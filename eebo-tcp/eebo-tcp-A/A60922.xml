            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is nothing in the world of ſo nice and tickliſh a nature as
<hi>Poetry,</hi> a thing which conſiſts all in <hi>extremes,</hi> and like a
Melon is either all gold or dirt. 'Tis that which if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a <hi>regular</hi> and a <hi>great</hi> Mind, not only raviſhes
and aſtoniſhes the <hi>preſent,</hi> but eſtabliſhes it ſelf an Empire
in the <hi>future</hi> time. But as it happens in the <hi>life</hi> of man, that
<hi>Vices</hi> are infinitely more numerous then <hi>Vertues,</hi> ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
in <hi>Poetry</hi> (which is the <hi>Repreſentation</hi> of the Life of
man) that the <hi>offences</hi> of it are innumerable, the <hi>excellencies</hi>
very rare and few. For it being a <hi>chymical</hi> extraction of all that the action of
man can preſent, or the mind of man think, and requiring not only great <hi>happineſs</hi>
of <hi>Thought,</hi> but alſo a noble <hi>reſtraint</hi> of <hi>Judgment,</hi> over and above ſome <hi>fury</hi> or
enthuſiaſm, which may ſtrike <hi>life</hi> into all the reſt; it hath been a thing ſo inacceſſibly
ſeated, that he obſerv'd very well that ſaid, The number of <hi>Poets</hi> truly ſo called
have not been as many as the <hi>Ages</hi> they lived in. Whereas, on the other ſide, the
delight which tickles younger minds, puts them alſo on emulation; and the motions
of the imagination being ſwift and eaſie, and commonly the weakeſt minds moſt
fruitfull, in regard they <hi>refuſe</hi> nothing, hath been that which hath begot into the
world huge numbers of <hi>little</hi> and impertinent <hi>Poets,</hi> who have <hi>ſpawn'd</hi> forth things,
which though they were crooked and <hi>deformed</hi> in themſelves, yet ſo blind hath
the people been, that they have found <hi>eſteem,</hi> which after ſome ſmall time hath
turn'd to <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> So that even ſome ſpirits of a better mould
have been ſeduc'd to the ſame opinion, and expected no ſmall glory, if they could
but arrive at a good imitation: A humour ſo generally unfortunate, that unleſs it

hath left us ſo odd an account both of <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Mankind,</hi> that I profeſs, to me
is one of the greateſt wonders that I have, how through ſo many ſerious <hi>Ages</hi> his
reputation hath continued in that ſtrength and youth, were it not that I conſider
<pb facs="tcp:43725:5"/>
that the <hi>Generality</hi> of mankinde are wholly led away with their firſt thoughts, and
are guided by <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> rather then ſatisfied with the ſcrutiny of
their own <hi>reaſon;</hi> and for that of painting him <hi>vomiting,</hi> and the others <hi>licking</hi>
it up, as the humor is <hi>naſty</hi> enough, ſo had it been as falſe, had not that great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
of <hi>imitation</hi> ſo peſtered <hi>Poetry</hi> ſince ſhe was firſt known among men, and her
own dazling greatneſs made men willing to look upon her by reflection; beſides
that, there is a kinde of lazineſs in the mindes of moſt men, that make them ſit
down with things formerly thought on by others, and never to look after any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements
or diſcoveries of their own. And as this hath extreamly peſtered <hi>Poetry,</hi>
ſo hath it been <hi>fatal</hi> even to <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which profeſſes a ſevere <hi>inqueſt</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi>
which certainly ſhould enlarge to greater <hi>variety</hi> and <hi>extent</hi> of thought, then a
buſineſs intended only for <hi>pleaſure</hi> and all capacities, ſince we ſee how few <hi>heads</hi> of
<hi>Philoſophy</hi> there have been, and how many <hi>followers;</hi> and what an infinite number
hath follow'd <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> for ſo many centuries together, in reſpect of thoſe very
<hi>few</hi> exalted and heroical ſpirits, who have disdain'd the fetters of <hi>Tradition</hi> and
<hi>Acquieſcence,</hi> and generally broke looſe, and diſcovered <hi>New Worlds</hi> of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others there have been, who willing out of what had been left by others, to
melt down what they thought fitting into their own works, that have not been
much more lucky then the former, but only diſguis'd foolery from one ſhape to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
or elſe grave and ſerious things into things very ridiculous. Thus <hi>Ovid</hi> by
bringing <hi>Hieroglyphical</hi> learning into literal <hi>Fables,</hi> hath amaſs'd together a ſort of
the oddeſt and moſt childiſh whimſes that ever were. Thus <hi>Ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>o</hi> making bold with
the <hi>Legend,</hi> hath taken a good many actions, intended there for actions of <hi>Vertue,
Chaſtity</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> and transform'd them into <hi>Amorous</hi> or Marſhal <hi>Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies.</hi>
Nay, and thus many men not weighing diſcreetly the differences of <hi>times,
perſons</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> which they have had to repreſent, have fallen into errors very
misbecoming. The <hi>Indecorum</hi> of <hi>Homers</hi> gods, the fault in <hi>Virgils</hi> Chronology,
<hi>Taſſo</hi> making <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſpeak like <hi>Heathens, Spencers</hi> confuſion, and different choice
of names, are things never to be forgiven.</p>
            <p>Nay, even that <hi>Poetry</hi> which comes to the <hi>City,</hi> and which ſeems rather to look
upon the <hi>reprehenſion</hi> of <hi>Vice,</hi> then the encouragement and repreſentation of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
as it hath not wanted its ſeveral indecorums; ſo hath it been ſeveral times ſo
unfortunate as to teach that which it would deter men from. The common <hi>Rogueries</hi>
and <hi>cheats</hi> preſented in <hi>Plays,</hi> I believe have rather <hi>taught</hi> wickedneſs, then made
it <hi>odious,</hi> ſince even the worſt of men want the <hi>Theory</hi> of it, which that furniſhes,
and the <hi>Satyriſts,</hi> which pretend to be the ſevereſt enemies of all <hi>vice,</hi> it is to be
feared have the moſt taught <hi>it.</hi> There is no greater <hi>Morality</hi> in any Book I know,
then in <hi>Juvenales,</hi> yet in repeating the vices of the times, he is forc'd unto ſuch
<hi>obſcoenity,</hi> that he hath regiſtred <hi>vices</hi> ugly above the common conceit of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and ſuch as this age, or at leaſt this clime hath not wickedneſs enough to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe;
nay things ſo tranſcendently bad he doth not forbear to mention, that even
<hi>Scaliger</hi> hath adjudged him not fit for Chriſtian ears: Not but in all theſe Books
ſomewhat conſiderable is ſcattered up and down, but the miſchief is, that the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous</hi>
and noble parts are ſo outnumbred by the light, flat, and <hi>impertinent,</hi> that
they hold no proportion at all. But as the mind of man eaſily receives the worſt
impreſſions, but is very difficulty labour'd into vertue; ſo among things of this

            <p>Theſe are the noble entertainments of Books of this kinde, which how profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
they are, you may judge; how <hi>pernicious,</hi> 'tis eaſily ſeen, if they meet but
with an intentive <hi>Melancholy,</hi> and a ſpirit apt to be overborn by ſuch follies. Such
a one was our <hi>LYSIS,</hi> who is here preſented, one that thought their <hi>Sottiſes,</hi>
examples of <hi>life,</hi> and thoſe other impertinent circumſtances which they bring, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
into preſent practiſe. And therefore by imitating them, he hath amaſs;d
together a number of the moſt conſiderable follies that ever were ſeen; ſuch a one
hath our Author made him, and that very juſtly, ſince all the <hi>Fooleries</hi> of all <hi>Men</hi>
and <hi>Books</hi> of this nature, he hath arraign'd and convicted in this <hi>one</hi> Perſon, and
this <hi>one</hi> Book, with a deſign, not only judicious enough, but alſo profitably plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.
For while he brings on the ſtage their fooleries, though with better judgement
and nobler invention then ever they were before, he brings them withal ſo habited,
that it will not be eaſie for any ſober minde to be further enamour'd of them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, conſidering how pleaſant ſuch kinde of traſh is, and what heads and
hands it entertains, it muſt needs be acknowledg'd a courteſie to bring any thing
that may ſcourge and baniſh it out of eſtimation. But becauſe our Author treads
croſs to ſuch a <hi>multitude,</hi> and is ſo <hi>over-voyc'd;</hi> and for that the <hi>curious</hi> and <hi>judicious</hi>
may upon the firſt thoughts <hi>miſconceive</hi> of ſome <hi>paſſages,</hi> and the <hi>ignorant</hi> draw

who when they have done all they can, are as unprofitable in the Commonwealth,
as ſo many Vermin in a Warren. And yet they think it an injury, if they are not
call'd <hi>Wits,</hi> as if it were as proper for the people to ſpeak of them with the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of <hi>Wit, Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>Learnedneſs,</hi> as they do by that of <hi>Worſhip</hi> to a <hi>Juſtice</hi>
of <hi>Peace,</hi> and expect that adoration and reverence which was anciently paid to
<hi>Orators</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> But ſince there are withal in the world a many excellent
men, who make a <hi>Recreation,</hi> and not a profeſſion of <hi>Writing,</hi> a more particular
cenſure will be more becoming; and ſince the quarrel I am engag'd as to the other,
is with their works, and not with their perſons, I ſhall forbear to bring them into
further contempt, and not envy them the acclamations of the beſotted populacie,
ſince I perceive they are ſo obſtinate, as to be more taken with the extravagancies
of thoſe men, then with any thing relative to the publike good, or the conduct of
humane life.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing I ſhall note, is, the tranſportation of our <hi>Shepherd,</hi> while he
contemplates thoſe excellent Reliques he had gather'd of his Miſtreſſes. This, it
may be, may ſeem ridiculous, and ſuch a ſtupidity as could not fall into the minde
of man, however tranſported by his own imaginations. If I produce as ridiculous
in the more ſerious and admired Authors, ſhall it be taken for good payment?
<hi>Lopa de Vega</hi> in his <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> brings <hi>Pamphilius</hi> and <hi>Niſa</hi> into <hi>Bedlam</hi> (their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies
having been ſuch, that they were taken for mad) where <hi>Niſa</hi> findes no
preſents for her <hi>Pamphilius,</hi> but that which the floor afforded, duſt, dirt, ſtraws,
and the like, wherewith yet he embroidered his clothes, as if they had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ſtones or feathers. Were they not worthily diſpoſed where they were? if this
be not as extravagant as our <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I know not what is. The Author of the Hiſtory
of <hi>Lyſander</hi> and <hi>Caliſta,</hi> hath as good ſtories; alas, Lovers put another value
<pb facs="tcp:43725:6"/>
on things then other men; and that Knight in <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> who falling in love with a
Lady whom he had detain'd in chains (being diſguis'd in Mans cloaths) paſs'd his
time afterward in kiſſing and courting the chains, and wearing them about his neck,
never putting them off but when he went abroad, I think is one may well ſhake
hands with <hi>Lyſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he thinks the Stars living creatures, is not ſo ſtrange a Philoſophy, as that
of thoſe who maintain they feed on the vapours of the earth and the ſea. If you will
not believe him, believe <hi>Ronſard</hi> in his hymns, who ſays, they feed in the Plains of
Heaven all night, and in the morning the Day-ſtar (who is the Keeper) brings them
together, tels them over, and drives them for all day into the ſhade.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Adrians</hi> Relation, 'tis natural, and ſuch as becomes a man of his quality,
who is a dull ſoft-headed <hi>Citizen,</hi> not much acquainted with <hi>Romances;</hi> and the
Books he quotes are ſuch as he underſtands, that is, ſuch as children go to ſchool
withall. And for his name, it becomes him better then to call him <hi>Lucidorus,</hi> or
<hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lemarchus;</hi> names very fit, are they not, for a Tradeſman?</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s demanding of Verſes of the Country-Shepherd, he that knows
any thing of <hi>Romances,</hi> knows how familiar it is there to have Shepherds anſwer
one another in Verſes, and the Authors make whom they pleaſe excellent extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
<hi>Poets.</hi> As for his deſcription of his Miſtreſſes beauty, he is not the only man
hath given ſuch extravagant power to the eyes of a Beauty. Ask <hi>La Roque:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Since 'tis decreed that fire ſhall ſurpriſe</l>
                  <l>This world, it muſt be that of your fair Eyes.</l>
               </q>
a prophaner expreſſion by much then that of <hi>Lyſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now he comes to the Dialogue with the <hi>Eccho:</hi> Which becauſe it hath
been a generall Ornament in all <hi>Love-ſtories</hi> and Books of <hi>Shepherdry,</hi> and is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſuch a groſs impertinence, our Remark on it ſhall be ſo much the larger. The
Paſtorals of <hi>Julietta</hi> are peſter'd with them, though far-fetch'd: Nay, the witty
<hi>Eraſmus</hi> hath not in this been very fortunate; otherwiſe why ſhould the Eccho
anſwer in <hi>Greek,</hi> when ſhe was ſpoken to in <hi>Latine?</hi> 'Tis as if a man ſhould ask
her ſomwhat in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſhe ſhould anſwer in <hi>Welſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh.</hi> But to forgive
that, when a man hath ſpoken ten or twelve lines, how can ſhe anſwer all in one
word? But of all the Compoſers of Eccho's that ever were, a Gentleman of our
own Country, and an Author, hath been ſo fortunate, that he hath brought two or
three hundred into the compaſs of one ſheet of paper, and his Conceits are withall
incomprehenſible: I have heard ſome ſay of them, that had they been to find out
ſo many, they might have worn out ten Dictionaries to find out the rimes. But
what our Author ſays in defence of himſelf is, that all the wonder in his was, that
it was <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s good fortune to light on things, that <hi>Anſelme</hi> could either anſwer or
rime to with ſome ſenſe.</p>
            <p>But for the diſcourſes of <hi>Anſelme</hi> concerning the Eccho, I may ſay they are no
ordinary invention. I could make long Remarks on the <hi>Pantomimes,</hi> which were
a ſort of people of old that counterfeited the cry birds and beaſts. <hi>Parmeno</hi>
counterfeited the grunting of a Pig ſo excellently well, that it became a Proverb:
ſo that when another Actor brought a real Pig under his cloak upon the ſtage, and
made it grunt, yet the people cry'd out, that was not <hi>Parmeno's</hi> Pig; whereupon
he ſhew'd them the Pig, to convince them <hi>Parmeno</hi> could do no better. This ſtory,
as it well diſcovers the fooliſhneſs and obſtinacie of prepoſſeſſed minds, ſo was it a
ſit example for <hi>Anſelme,</hi> ſpeaking of the Eccho, which they ſay imitates all
voices.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eccho</hi> which is made of Conduits of congeal'd aire, is an Invention in
the <hi>Steganography</hi> of <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> but much advanc'd and clear'd up by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is his diſcourſe of the <hi>Deſtinies</hi> leſs admirable. There is an <hi>Italian</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
between Life and Death, ſpeaking as if they were the <hi>two</hi> Deſtinies; and that
<pb facs="tcp:43725:6"/>
when one hath perfected the web of a mans life, the other cuts it off. This hath
more wit then that of the Ancients.</p>
            <p>Nor are <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s deſcriptions of his Miſtreſſes beauty ſo extravagant, but I can
eaſily match them. <hi>A certain poor man had a daughter; yet if her Beauty were truly
conſidered, he might be ſaid to be a very rich man; for in her face he poſſeſs'd Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
Rubies, Coral and Pearl.</hi> This is an Imagination in one of the <hi>Nouuelles.</hi>
But is it not enough to ſay, Lips are of Coral, and ſo of the reſt, but it muſt be
ſaid they can enrich a body? If this poor man wanted any thing, he muſt pull
out one of his daughters Eyes, or cut off her Lip, and carry it to the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths.</p>
            <p>This obſervation of his Miſtreſſes colour is in <hi>Lyſis</hi> extraordinary, and argues his
invention. 'Tis true, the <hi>Turks</hi> bear a great reſpect to <hi>Green; Mahomet's</hi> Turbant
was of it, and it is now a prerogative of thoſe only of that race; and if any be to
be puniſhed, for ſome crime, the Turbant is firſt taken off as ſacred. But the reaſon
why <hi>Lyſis</hi> hates the <hi>Turks,</hi> is, becauſe they know nothing of <hi>Romances</hi> and a
<hi>Shepherds</hi> life.</p>
            <p>That he calls the Kitchin-maid <hi>Goddeſs</hi> of the <hi>Pottage-pot,</hi> it rubs the ancient ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,
eſpecially that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who put their Gods to all the offices and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
they had to do. They had a <hi>Cloacina,</hi> which we may call <hi>Scavangera,</hi> or
the Goddeſs of the Common-ſhores. There were no leſs then three Gods about
one Cradle; one kept the Child from crying, another rock'd the Cradle, a third
look'd to the Womans breaſts.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the day of Judgment at <hi>S. Cloud.</hi> The examples of this kind
are infinite. When <hi>London-Bridge</hi> was afire, the Country-people that ſaw it afar
off, thought the world was at an end, and that it began to burn at this great City,
where more iniquity had been committed then elſwhere. The day of Judgment hath
been ſo often foretold both by <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> that many now believe
there will not be any at all. A certain rich man in <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> upon the reading
of an Almanack, beſtow'd between his friends and the poor all he had, and came
afterwards to beg his bread. Nay, ſuch was the ſtupidity of Mankind, that even in
the firſt Ages there wanted not Enthuſiaſts to amuſe the people. Every perſecuting
Emperor was thought to be Antichriſt; nay, the Fathers were not much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
in this point then others. But I have no mind to ſhew my reading here
of that, nor yet to advance the divers opinions have been held of the end of the
world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montvalerian</hi> is a place neer <hi>St. Cloud,</hi> where live ſix Hermites. This I tell you,
becauſe the Author of <hi>Lyſander</hi> and <hi>Caliſta</hi> ſays, that when their <hi>Majeſties</hi> went
to ſee one of them, who had not been ſeen in 48 years, he alſo ſaw him, and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi>
liv'd with him afterwards in his Cell.</p>
            <p>But the people of <hi>St. Cloud</hi> are beholding to <hi>Lyſis</hi> and his <hi>Poets,</hi> at leaſt were
they not the next morning? If a <hi>Lover</hi> ſhould ſay he burn'd in mid-winter, would
not a ſimple man think he were in a feaver? If he ſhould ſay he were on the rack,
and that that Fiend <hi>Love</hi> fed on his heart, as the Vulture did on that of <hi>Prometheus,</hi>
would not a ſober man unacquainted with Poetry think his meaning were that he
was damn'd in this life?</p>
            <p>The Paſtorals of <hi>Leon,</hi> the River <hi>Ezla,</hi> and the Shepherd <hi>Sirenus</hi> have had for
their Celebrator <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Montemajor,</hi> of which book anon.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of <hi>Veſper, Lyſis</hi> contemns, as repreſenting things with too much proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
as Country-people may love now; but he is for <hi>Cyrenus, Celadon,</hi> and thoſe
other <hi>illuſtrious</hi> Shepherds.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s diſmiſſion of the Rout, it's an humour claſhes not with his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance;
for mad as he was, he remembred that now being entred into the
condition of a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> he was to live <hi>peaceably</hi> with all men, and conſequently
not to be tranſported ſo far by paſſion as to give one blow for another.</p>
            <p>And thus much by way of Remark on the firſt Book, wherein I have been the
larger, becauſe I would ſhew how much more I might have ſaid in juſtification of
<pb facs="tcp:43725:7"/>
my Author. In the reſt I ſhall confine my ſelf to the moſt conſiderable heads:
And ſo I paſs to the</p>
            <div n="2" type="book">
               <head>Second BOOK.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>LYſis</hi>'s contempt of good Books, ſhews he eſteems all pedantry that is not
Romantick; and for his meeting with the Satyre, 'tis an humor any one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of his Authors could have furniſh'd him with.</p>
               <p>But the chiefeſt matter of this Book, is that of the <hi>Metaphorical Picture,</hi> which
he had given directions for in the firſt. The deſcriptions of Beauty have been ſuch
as <hi>Lyſis</hi> mentions, ever ſince there were any Poets in the world; and it ſhould ſeem
to be their chiefeſt ſtudy and emulation to deſcribe it the more extravagantly, and
the more fantaſtically. But the grand foolery is, that when they have deſcrib'd their
Beauties with <hi>Suns, Coral, Diamonds, Ivory,</hi> &amp;c. they cannot let alone poor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
women that have but fleſh and blood. But as for the Picture, you muſt needs
think it was much more noble when it was in colours, as <hi>Anſelme</hi> had done it: the
particulars explain themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the diſcourſe between</hi> Anſelmes <hi>and</hi> Montenor, <hi>I ſhall quote one thing as to
the Language.</hi> Antitheſes <hi>and</hi> Contrarieties <hi>are mighty ornaments; as to ſay,</hi> Love
<hi>is</hi> a pleaſure full of ſadneſs; a torment full of delight; a deſpairing hope, <hi>and</hi> a hoping
deſpair: <hi>I think what</hi> Montenor <hi>ſaies is more gentle,</hi> If Love be a poiſon, 'tis a
pleaſant one; if a diſquiet, 'tis deſireable; if a death, peaceable; if a priſon, there
wants only liberty, and miſery reigns not there as in others. <hi>Is not this better ſaid,
then to ſay that</hi> Love is a free priſon, and an incarcerated liberty? <hi>But theſe things
I ſhall leave to the obſervation of the Reader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis not the ſea makes women more or leſs vertuous or perfect, nor yet more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious;
but to the latter, the perſeverance and iteration of mens temptations have
contributed much, ſince it is the knowledge of all things beget the deſire of them.
All that I have to ſay, is, that the <hi>Poets</hi> who idolize them with all the attributes of
Divinity, are alſo thoſe that load them with all the calumny poſſible. A <hi>Poet</hi> ſhall
<hi>deifie a Tripe-woman</hi> if ſhe be his Miſtreſs; but though ſhe be never ſo handſom,
if ſhe be withal diſdainful, <hi>Bear, Serpent, Viper, Waſps, Fiends,</hi> is not language fit
to deſcribe her.</p>
               <p>As for the humor of the difference between <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>Anſelme,</hi> whereof
<hi>Lyſis</hi> is Judge, 'tis ordinary in Love-ſtories, and 'tis the Ore of the <hi>Golden-Age,</hi>
when the firſt man met was the Judge of all controverſies. All the proceedings in
this have very good Authors, but it is not to much purpoſe to quote them
here.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s Serenade, his <hi>Letter,</hi> and all the circumſtances of it, other Lovers
have done things of the like nature, and therefore I paſs them over. But as for the
Letter, I muſt do him right, it was his own as to the compoſure; but for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
his Countrymen <hi>Ronſard, Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and others, could have furniſhed him
with much more extravagant and greater contradictions: but <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s complements
came ever out of his Common-places; for he bore ſuch a reverence to thoſe good
Authors, that he choſe rather to deliver himſelf in their language then in his own.
I heard of a Country-Gentleman, that having bought the <hi>Academy of Complements,</hi>
came to court his Miſtreſs, where after he had paſs'd his Complement, he wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhe did not anſwer him as it was in the Book. The next time he came to <hi>London</hi>
he bought one for her, that ſo ſhe might be able to continue the Dialogue with
him.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who would light the candle at his Miſtreſſes eyes, 'tis not more then
Poetical; all his conceptions about the flyes, the trees growing, &amp;c. betray his read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him that knows any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:43725:7"/>
As for the burning of his hat, he might eaſily believe it was his Miſtreſs did it;
for beſides his acquaintance with the Poets, ſome <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> have delivered, that
fire hath iſſued out of the heads of divers people, as <hi>Luvy</hi> ſaies of <hi>Ser. Tulli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> and
<hi>Cardan</hi> of a friend of his: why might not <hi>Lyſis</hi> think his Miſtreſs could do as much
as any of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s dream is nothing extraordinary, and his diſcourſes and actions thereupon
ſpeak him not ſo extravagant as ſome other Lovers have been; but above all things
it is to be obſerved, that let him do what he can, he ſtill comes ſhort of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
the Poets.</p>
               <p>But his calling his Miſtreſs the <hi>Beauty of Beauties,</hi> is his own, 'tis a little vulgar,
yet few conſider it expreſſes not what they intend; and that that expreſſion is only
proper in this, The <hi>King of Kings;</hi> that is to ſay, a King that governs other
Kings, but the beauty of Beauties ſignifies but a Beauty: So the Romance of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
or the Shepherd of Shepherds; nay, rather it ſignifies a Beauty that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to other Beauties, which is contrary to our intention: This is called Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limathias.</p>
               <p>The heavineſs and weight of <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s heart muſt needs be great, becauſe he is no
ordinary Lover.</p>
               <p>The conſiderations of <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s departure, and of <hi>Charite</hi>'s, are ſuch as could be
wiſh'd. The ſad <hi>Tyrcis</hi> is he in <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> that would love none but his <hi>Cleon,</hi> though
ſhe were dead. <hi>Baſilias</hi> is the celebrated King of the <hi>Counteſs</hi> of <hi>Pembrokes Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia,</hi>
a Country ſo happy, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> is the Protector of it, and the Gods come
down and live there familiarly among men. This is he that goes into the deſart with
his wife and daughters, having learn'd by the Oracle, that a Son in Law of his ſhould
take away his Kingdom from him; and is like him that kill'd himſelf for fear of
death.</p>

               <p>PReſents us with that pleaſant ſalley of <hi>Lyſis</hi> at the Play-houſe, where he took

who ſometimes ador'd them, and ſhall thenceforward forfeit is wit.</p>
               <p>There are in the beginning five reaſons of the <hi>Dew.</hi> The Poets had in a manner
but one, and that was, that it was the terms of <hi>Aurora,</hi> yet can they not truly tell
us why this <hi>Aurora</hi> ſhould ſhed tears thus every day. But they ſay it was for the
death of her ſon <hi>Memnon.</hi> What a pittiful Divinity is this, to weep ever ſince
the war of <hi>Troy,</hi> where this <hi>Memnon</hi> was kill'd? But who ſees not this ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lly ſhift?
If a Prince or Nobleman dye, <hi>Aurora</hi> muſt weep as if ſhe were one of his friends,
or mourn for him. <hi>Clarimonds</hi> imaginations are far beyond this, eſpecially the laſt,
where he ſaies it is that the horſes of the Sun ſhake their mains as they come out
of the ſea.</p>
               <p>Why may not the Sun be thought to make uſe of a <hi>Night-cap,</hi> ſince he wants
reſt ſometimes as much as ever did <hi>Hobſon</hi> the Carrier.</p>
               <p>But for <hi>Jupiters</hi> hearing from his Palace the addreſſes of men, I refer you to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qian,</hi>
who ſaies that when he had a minde to hear their prayers, he opens certain
holes, and liſtned and when he was weary ſhut them again.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:43725:8"/>
                  <hi>Juno's</hi> avarice, and <hi>Pallas</hi>'s divers profeſſions are ſuch as the Poets have attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to them. But that Invention of the Gods <hi>Linnen</hi> is <hi>Clarimond's;</hi> there was
never any Poet could tell us what became of the <hi>thread</hi> of mens lives. <hi>Cupid</hi> muſt
needs be treated as a Child, ſince the Poets ſay he was hardly able to draw the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of his mothers bed when ſhe lay with <hi>Mars,</hi> which is that made <hi>Vulcan</hi> ſo
jealous of <hi>Mercury,</hi> whom the Poets have made a fine example for men to inſtruct
them in cheats and rogueries; and his diſcourſe to <hi>Charon</hi> is as like that of a crafty
Mountebank as can be. But where he is troubled that he cannot find ſome Gods he
was to invite, I cannot omit a fiction of <hi>Arioſto's,</hi> an Angel, wanting <hi>Silence</hi> to
bring an Army upon ſome enterpriſe without noiſe, went to look for her in thoſe
places where it is forbidden to ſpeak, as in Monaſteries; but there he finds <hi>Diſcord</hi>
with her black and gray hair, which ſeem'd to fight one with another: Her hands
were full of Chancery-Bills and Law-writings, and ſhe had about her an Army of
Councellors and Sollicitors; ſhe ſate alſo Preſident at a Chapter, when the Monks
being on the election of a Prior, divide into ſuch factions, that the Breviaries do
mighty execution on the bald pates. What need had this malicious <hi>Poet</hi> thus to
abuſe the <hi>Monks,</hi> who are not all naught, and to ſcandalize a Religion he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
defended? But what a ſimple Angel hath he pitch'd on, that was to ſeek what
he knew not where to find? 'Tis an abuſe of thoſe divine Spirits, and him whoſe
Agents they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vulcan</hi> was the fitteſt for the Kitchin, as being always neereſt the fire. Nor was
<hi>Pythagonas</hi> leſs for the ſauces, ſince he was the beſt acquainted with herbs and
fruits. And what is ſaid of him and the other Philoſophers, is home to their
Tenets.</p>
               <p>The Raillerie which follows along is obvious, as that of taking down the Signes
by <hi>Brontes</hi> and <hi>Pyragmon,</hi> who are <hi>Vulcan's</hi> Kitchin-boyes; the divers entries of
the Gods: That <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> is Phyſitian; the Gods had need of one ever ſince
<hi>Homer</hi> affirm'd they might be hurt or ſick. The Arms of the Gods, may make us
laugh at their Statues.</p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>Fate</hi> makes <hi>Terminus</hi> eat, that is, what he hath decreed muſt come to paſs,
and 'tis he only hath the key of his padlock. <hi>Priapus</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are well ſeated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
But that <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhould fall ſo heartily to the <hi>Souls,</hi> is not without reaſon,
ſince ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have held, that all ſouls were reunited in the ſoul of the
world, which they held to be <hi>Jupiter.</hi> But as the Gods live only on <hi>ſouls</hi> and <hi>idaa's</hi>
ſo have I ſeen a <hi>Banquet of Poets,</hi> and their food was the <hi>vowels</hi> in a Verſe which
are cut off and not pronounc'd.</p>
               <p>The drunkenneſs of the Gods is to be laid on their ſcore, who have furniſh'd
them with all other vices.</p>
               <p>The ſcuffle between the Pedees and the Pages about the wing of the ſoule of a
Turkey, is to ſhew that thoſe ſouls had the forms of bodies, and are diſpers'd into all
parts of the body to exerciſe their functions.</p>
               <p>As for the Signs of Heaven, I quarrel not with their names, becauſe I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſay to the Aſtrologers, though they have not the images of thoſe beaſts
by whoſe names they call them. But why ſhould our Poets build their fables on
them, and ſo fill Heaven with Adulteries and other crimes? <hi>Du Bartas</hi> and others,
to take away the memory of thoſe villanies, would needs change the fable into a
ſacred ſtory, ſaying the <hi>Lyon</hi> belongs to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the <hi>Ship</hi> to <hi>Noa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

to <hi>S. Luke,</hi> and <hi>Virgo</hi> and <hi>Via lactea</hi> to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> &amp;c. but they cannot carry
out the humour.</p>
               <p>There was no ſuch way to abuſe the odd perſonages which the Poets attribute to
the Gods, as that of the latter band of Gods; and we muſt never more ſpeak any
otherwiſe then abuſively of them all, as my Author does.</p>
               <p>I know I have omitted divers things which deſerve to be taken notice of: For
there is not any paſſage in this Banquet which hath not a ſecret grace, beſides that
it contains the whole ſtory of all the ancient fables, and that digeſted into a natural
order. <hi>Lucian</hi> in his Dialogues may have ſomwhat of this humour, but he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect;
<pb facs="tcp:43725:8"/>
and it was his deſign to deny the eternal Providence, which is not taken
away with the loſs of thoſe names he quarrels with.</p>
               <p>That's no leſs ſubtle attacque to the Fables, of <hi>Montenor's,</hi> as to the confuſion
of them. If <hi>Phaeton</hi> and his Father, as they ſay, fell into the River <hi>Eridan,</hi> why do
they not tell us how they got out again? But there's no leſs inconvenience, if we
ſay that that Torch of the Day is faſtened to the Chariot of <hi>Phoebus;</hi> for <hi>Ovid</hi> ſays
the Chariot was broke all to peeces.</p>
               <p>That there is as much morality in ROBERT <hi>the Devil,</hi> as in the ſtory of
<hi>Hercules,</hi> is certain; for that was a ſturdy fellow, and Mythologie hath a great
latitude, for a wicked man may be made vertuous. If one man kill another, the
meaning is, the victory of the wiſe man over the paſſions; and ſo of the
reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Natalis Comes</hi> hath peſter'd us with his Mythologies; and for his Genealogies
of the Gods they are ſo various, that every one hath three or four fathers. Mr. <hi>Roſs</hi>
hath gone beyond him, and hath defil'd the Sacred hiſtory with the ordure and filth
of Heathen fables.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſis'</hi>s deſcriptions of Beauty, being by him ſpoken ſeriouſly, are an open abuſe
to the Poets, whoſe diſciple he is. Nor is he leſs himſelf, where he propoſes that
every one ſhould relate his ſtory. And for his diſcourſe with <hi>Charite,</hi> conſidering
what he is, and what ſhe is, it is very natural. What would a ſimple Country-Laſs
ſay, if a man ſaid ſhe had hurt him, but ask whether ſhe had prick'd him, or ſcratch'd
him? But <hi>Lyſis</hi> had learn'd out of his Romances, that a Lover ought to ſpeak al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſively
to ſomwhat his Miſtreſs had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clarimond</hi> concludes with that ſaying; That to be happy, a man muſt be either
<hi>King</hi> or <hi>Fool.</hi> Wherein he is in the right. Pleaſure is not meaſur'd by the reality of
things, but the imagination of them. There was a Serving-man, who would not
live with any Maſter, but upon condition he might have one hour in the day to do
what he pleas'd in his chamber. Having led this life a long time, his Maſter would
needs know how he ſpent the time. Coming to his chamber-door, he perceiv'd
through ſome chink, his man ſate in a chair with a Crown on his head, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him on the wall a draught of the Pope and Conſiſtory; there did he make a
ſpeech for the Pope, and anſwer'd it in the name of the Emperor. But the Maſter
diſcovering himſelf, the Fool folded up his Picture and went his ways, and was never
ſeen ſince. Such a one is <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who though he be not ſtark mad, yet conceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
happier then an <hi>Emperor</hi> in his Paſtoral and amorous imaginations. But he
advances in his Extravagances, and finds my Author work for a</p>

               <head>Fourth BOOK.</head>
               <p>WHerein though in ſome things he exceed his predeceſſors, yet in ſome
he ſhews himſelf more ſober and more rational, as may appear by the
diſcourſe about the deſpair of Lovers, whom he finds in his books to
have arriv'd at that madneſs, as to have hang'd and drown'd themſelves. But this
you muſt attribute to his good intervals. <hi>Clarimond's</hi> diſcourſe, and his replies touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Poetry,</hi> and his own <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> (which he is extremely carefull to have come
abroad) are not ordinary.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Golden Aſs</hi> is a work of <hi>Apuleius;</hi> the argument of it ſtollen out of <hi>Lucian,</hi>
only he hath added the fable of <hi>Pſyche</hi> and ſome old wives tales. All the excuſe I
can make for this, is, that haply in his time <hi>Lucian's</hi> works were very rare, and he
was in hope they would have been loſt, that ſo no man might diſcover the cheat;
otherwiſe certainly he would have acknowledg'd his Benefactor.</p>
               <p>His explication of Dreams argues his wit and reading: But for what is ſaid of
the <hi>Muſes,</hi> and particularly where he ſays <hi>Love</hi> ſtands Sentinel at his bolſter, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but admire it. His Song. I can aſſure you, was ſet to a very excellent air, but
<pb facs="tcp:43725:9"/>
very mournful; the dames of <hi>Paris</hi> ſing it to this day in memory of this famous
Shepherd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s ſong is follow'd with a notable abuſe of the Poets; for they never cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the kindeneſs nor the cruelty of their Miſtreſſes, but when ſome fancy comes
into their mindes fit to expreſs thoſe qualities, rhiming it ſeems is ſuch a rack. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi>
calls <hi>Caliſta</hi> in his ſongs, ſometimes <hi>Hippolita,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Sylvia,</hi> which
made the Gentlewoman very jealous of his conſtancy.</p>
               <p>To think a Hermit a Magician, he might haply have had it from <hi>Taſſo,</hi> who in
his <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> makes the Chriſtian Hermits all Magicians, and withal celebrates them
for very devout and religious men.</p>
               <p>His coming to <hi>Hircans</hi> wood, and his conſiderations there, betray a huge read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but his thoughts running ſtill on magick, was that made him take <hi>Hircan</hi> for a
Magician, and what he ſayes to confirm him in that opinion, is founded on what
the Poets ſay of the ancient Sorcereffes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Armida</hi> was a Sorcereſs that in a minute of an hour, caus'd a great caſtle to be
built, if you believe <hi>Taſſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For his diſguiſing himſelf like a Maid, and his perſwaſions that he was really one,
and was taken for one, 'tis an humor ſo thread-bare in all Books of Shepherdry
and Love-ſtories, that I need ſay more of it; only I ſhall note, that it is more
probable in <hi>Lyſis;</hi> for <hi>Hircan</hi> caus'd him to be trim'd, a thing thoſe Authours
thought not on, but putting on other cloathes, without any other circumſtance
they are preſently what ſex they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>As for what is ſaid of the <hi>Nymphs,</hi> 'tis to abuſe thoſe that are ſuch admirers of
Antiquity. If they had gone in <hi>Greece</hi> as people do now in <hi>France,</hi> we ſhould have
had the Nymphs dreſs'd after another mode. And for <hi>Fables,</hi> why may not we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
as good ones as the Ancients? and why ſhould it be thought ridiculous for
us to ſee the Gods dreſs'd like us, more then the <hi>Greeks</hi> were to ſee them habited
like them?</p>
               <p>The crime this counterfeit Maid is accus'd of at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, brings upon the ſtage
the many Trials they had, whereby to know whether a maid or wife had done any
thing diſhonorable: becauſe in <hi>Hiſtory</hi> we finde ſome whoſe innocency hath been
try'd certain ways; as the veſtal <hi>Turia,</hi> that being accus'd of unchaſtity, carried
water in a five from <hi>Tiber</hi> to her Goddeſſes Temple, to juſtifie her innocency;
therefore the Poets muſt invent ſo many ridiculous <hi>Fables</hi> for the ſame effect, as if it
were nothing to ſet God a work on miracles at their pleaſure, unleſs if one, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
be caſt into the fire for tryal of his innocency, a <hi>Pantarb</hi> (which is a certain
ſtone which frees from flames) does the work; as you may ſee in the ſtory of
<hi>Chariclea</hi> in <hi>Heliodorus.</hi> But the miracle you muſt conceive, is to be attributed to
certain Magical Characters that were graven on the Stone, a very probable
Foolery.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s diſcourſe to <hi>Charite,</hi> let us do the Poets no wrong, he hath it from
them. <hi>Meduſa</hi> turn'd all before her into ſtones, and <hi>Anaxarete</hi> was the Miſtreſs
of that <hi>Iphis</hi> that hang'd himſelf at her door. Theſe are hard names, and <hi>Charite</hi>
might take them for abuſes.</p>
               <p>Some have not thought there was ſo much grace in <hi>Carmelins</hi> ſpeeches; but they
are to know, that by <hi>Common-places, Lyſis</hi> meant a ſort of <hi>Pedantick</hi> books,
where a man may Alphabetically finde ſomewhat on every thing. And the <hi>French
Margarites</hi> is a book much like the <hi>Academy of Complements,</hi> only it hath this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
withal, that it is good to learn bad French by.</p>
               <p>The ſtatue of <hi>Memnon,</hi> out of which proceeded an harmonious ſound, when
ſmitten by the rays of the Sun, goes near to give me a vomit, I can ſhew a dozen
books of good account, that in the Epiſtles Dedicatory bring in this into compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
but never was it better apply'd then by <hi>Lyſis,</hi> when looking up towards the
Sun, it made him ſneeze.</p>
               <p>For the ſtone <hi>Panthura,</hi> I ſhall note this, That it is a trivial learning to bring
compariſons from ſtones, fiſhes, herbs, birds, and other as intertain things, which
<pb facs="tcp:43725:9"/>
we muſt take upon Mr. <hi>Pliny's</hi> credit. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in their harangs to the people
entertain them much with theſe ſimilitudes, whereas a man would think, that it
were more convincing, to draw them from ſomewhat familiar to them. The Author
of the <hi>Abridgement of Long-ſtudities,</hi> was a cheat, and fit to be <hi>Carmelins</hi>
Maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fontenay</hi> is a true French name, and there have been Lacqueys called <hi>Gringalet</hi>
and <hi>Champagn,</hi> and why may they not, according to their quality, affront the
<hi>Callidorus</hi>'s and the <hi>Ariſtander's</hi> of our Romances? The <hi>Greeks</hi> were not aſham'd
of their own names as we are, but qnoted them in their: Fables.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charite</hi> is here called a <hi>Chambermaid,</hi> a word for the <hi>City</hi> dames, and meaner ſort
of Gentry, thoſe of any quality have their <hi>Woman,</hi> or <hi>Waiting-Gentlewoman.</hi> But
the word now a late hath been extended to the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſis</hi> takes it not well to be compar'd to <hi>Don-Quixot,</hi> for extravagant as he is,
he thinks himſelf wiſer then that Knight.</p>
               <p>For his Love-letter, which in French is called <hi>Poulet,</hi> that is a <hi>Pullet,</hi> he is the
firſt that ever gave the reaſon of it, and made the beſt application of it. <hi>Ronſard</hi>
ſays, that Love is a <hi>Bird,</hi> that he hath laid <hi>Eggs</hi> in his boſom, and that when they
are <hi>hatch'd,</hi> they'll prey on his <hi>heart,</hi> and when they have done flie away, if he
do not lay Bird-lime or nets to catch them, &amp;c. But to ſatisfie thoſe that know not
the reaſon of the Pullet, that expreſſion riſe from the folding of the <hi>Love-Letter,</hi>
much like a bird.</p>
               <p>The Fable of <hi>Hero</hi> and <hi>Leander</hi> is one of the ancienteſt we have, 'twas a ſad thing
this poor Lover was forc'd to ſwim an arm of the ſea, almoſt two mile over, to
enjoy his Miſtreſs. I believe it took of ſome of his courage: if he had had <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonds</hi>
advice, 'tis likely he had not been drown'd.</p>
               <p>As for the wayes which Lovers have found out to get their Letters delivered to
their Miſtreſſes, though the Romances might have furniſh'd <hi>Lyſis</hi> with choice, yet
ſuch a pregnant invention hath he, that he addes to all things.</p>
               <p>Where he ſaies the fruits of the earth ought to be common, it ſeems he is almoſt
perſwaded that he hath already reduc'd the <hi>Golden-Age,</hi> wherein the Poets ſay, there
were no incloſures, and men underſtood not thoſe two words, <hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If in his ſwound he would not have <hi>Carmelin</hi> trouble himſelf for any water, but
make uſe of his tears, he remembred our unfortunate Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> who, when
his Murtherers had after much hard uſage, gotten him to a River ſide, and were
going to fetch ſome water to ſhave him, ſo to diſguiſe him the more; <hi>Let alone that
cold water,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>here's warm comes out of my eyes.</hi> This indeed was a little
<hi>Romantick:</hi> but <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s affliction is ſo much the further from reſtoring him to his
wits, that it heightens his folly: as we ſhall ſee in the</p>

               <p>WHere we finde him metamorphos'd, 'Tis the ſad fate of things, that

to this Book, from thoſe, who being unacquainted with <hi>Fables</hi> and
<hi>Metamorphoſes,</hi> do not finde that <hi>Satyre</hi> in this, as in other parts. But I cannot
omit what I receive from the Poets touching <hi>Aurora,</hi> who is the forerunner of the
<hi>Sun:</hi> What neceſſity had the Ancients to imagine that the Sun muſt be uſher'd in
by ſuch a Goddeſs? But then why muſt ſhe have a Chariot? ſhe had not ſo far to
go, but aſſoon as ſhe had done her work in heaven in the morning, ſhe might have
taken her pleaſure with <hi>Cephalus</hi> on earth. Why do not the Poets clear up theſe
things to us? <hi>Virgil</hi> ſayes in one place, that the Chariot of this Goddeſs is drawn
by four horſes, and in another by two; ſometimes they are white, ſometimes red,
but this I'll reconcile, 'tis to be thought ſhe hath horſes of all colours in her
Stable.</p>
               <p>But how learned are all <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s conſiderations of the <hi>Metamorphoſes?</hi> and for
<pb facs="tcp:43725:10"/>

               <p>He that conſiders his farewels to his friends upon his Metamorphoſis, and hath

were minded to metamorphoſe any, they muſt bid them put off their cloaths firſt,
or ſhould do it for them; which, what an abſurdity it is, I leave any man to
judge.</p>
               <p>Nay, ſuch was the blindneſs of the Ancients, that they believ'd the Trees of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dona</hi>

               <p>As for <hi>Clarimond's</hi> ſubtilty to make him take ſome ſuſtenance, 'tis admirable.
But for the exerciſes and recreations of the <hi>Nymphs</hi> and <hi>rural</hi> Divinities, I might
produce whole Odes out of <hi>Des Portes</hi> and <hi>Ronſard,</hi> to acquaint you what they were;
but take upon my credit, they are ſuch as our Shepherd meets with. For their names,
it may be 'twill not be ungratefull to rip up ſo much ancient ſottiſhneſs. They had
<hi>Dryads,</hi> whom I take to be Nymphs of <hi>Forreſts; Hamadryads</hi> were ſuch men as
were chang'd into <hi>Trees;</hi> the <hi>Nayads</hi> were the Nymphs that preſided over the
<hi>Waters,</hi> and were ſuch as had been chang'd into <hi>Fountains;</hi> the <hi>Napaeae</hi> are the
Nymphs of the Flowers, the <hi>Oreades</hi> of the Mountains, and the <hi>Nereides</hi> of the
Sea.</p>
               <p>I do not tell you what part of <hi>Brie Lyſis</hi> was in, nor where the River <hi>Morin</hi>
begins; 'tis an humour of <hi>Ronſard's,</hi> to make a long comment on every proper
name, which I will not imitate.</p>
               <p>As for the Fable of <hi>Morin,</hi> I maintain it to be much more ingenious then any
thing of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s, or any other Poet.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things which we bring in under the name of <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> are <hi>Fables.</hi> Among
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the word <hi>Fable</hi> was reſtrain'd to thoſe relations that concerned the
<hi>Gods; Hiſtory,</hi> to the affairs of <hi>men:</hi> But becauſe a Fable ſignifies only a narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that what they ſaid of their Gods was falſe, it is come to paſs that a Fable
ſignifies that which is falſe.</p>
               <p>As for the Stories of <hi>Synopa</hi> and <hi>Lucida,</hi> and their <hi>Metamorphoſes,</hi> they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
and probable: whereas the Poets can only tells us, that to be metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos'd
into Water, there was no other invention then to weep away, as <hi>Ovid</hi> ſays
of <hi>Biblis.</hi> But where <hi>Lyſis</hi> takes away that contrariety of being chang'd into water,
and yet retaining the form of a humane body, which muſt be compos'd of watery
vapours, he ſhews nothing eſcapes him. He had read ſomewhere what the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
ſay of the apparition of Spirits, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Terreſtrial ſpirits aſſume bodies
of the vapours of the earth, and the Aquatick of thoſe of the water.</p>

What follows concerning the <hi>Violin,</hi> and the Nymphs who deny'd <hi>Diana</hi> the
Sweet-meats, all is natural, and their puniſhment too. For the latter, certainly 'tis
as eaſie for the Gods to make Trees bear fruit preſerv'd, as to change men into
Trees: And if my Author had ſaid that the Cypreſs into which the Violin was
chang'd, bore Fiddles and Violins ready made, it had been as probable. Theſe ſtories
we are beholding to <hi>Clarimond</hi> for; who ſeeing the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets had invented <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſes</hi>
for the <hi>Fountains</hi> and <hi>Rivers</hi> of their Country, would do the like to the
honour of <hi>Brie:</hi> but the truth is, he is gone far beyond them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carmelin</hi>'s Queſtions to his Maſter, give him occaſion to clear up the ancient
Fables, wherein 'tis wonderfull to ſee how well he is read.</p>
               <p>I know not whether the Gum of the Tree <hi>Lyſis</hi> be well taken; yet 'twas a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity
could not be omitted: His mind ran then upon <hi>Myrrha,</hi> and the Siſters of
<hi>Phaeton,</hi> who weep <hi>Amber.</hi> However it be, the ſtory of the <hi>Excrement</hi> in <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Argenis</hi> is as bad, upon which too there is an Ode.</p>
               <p>At the ſecond rencontre with the Rural Divinities, I note <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s abuſe of the
<hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Nymphs</hi> for offering to run away for fear of mortals. The Ancients
might have made that queſtion to thoſe that talk'd of ſo many Gods, which no
man could ever perceive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carmelin's</hi> ſpeech to the Nymphs is nothing but a ſort of contradictions. <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard</hi>
and other Poets have thought them mighty ornaments; for <hi>Carmelin</hi> is one
that in this caſe is no Author, I aſſure you.</p>
               <p>I do not obſerve <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s reading fail him, till I come to the bathing of <hi>Carmelin:</hi>
And I wonder at it; for <hi>Ronſard</hi> could have taught him what ceremonies were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to make a Mortal fit for a celeſtial converſation. He had forgot that the
Ancients waſh'd themſelves before they conſulted the Oracle, as alſo the Victims
when they ſacrificed; and that Magicians bathe themſelves in running-water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they fall to their conjurations.</p>
               <p>Certainly <hi>Lyſis</hi> muſt needs be troubled not to find his Tree; yet muſt he needs
play the Tree, till <hi>Hircan,</hi> with the help of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> conjur'd him into a Man again
The apparition of the Winds hath nothing in it fantaſtick, compar'd with what the
Poets ſay of them. That <hi>Lyſis</hi> believ'd <hi>Hircan</hi> more powerfull then the Gods, it
ſhews him to be of the Creed of the Ancients, who believed the Gods were ſubject
to the charms of Magicians; and that when the Moon was ecclips'd, it was ſome
Sorcereſs had forc'd her from heaven.</p>
               <p>Thus have we ſeen <hi>Lyſis</hi> chang'd into a Tree, and the Tree into <hi>Lyſis</hi> again. We
are now to ſee how he behaves himſelf in the</p>

'tis he that carries the ſouls to the priſons of hell; 'tis he that ſummons the inferior

               <p>

deſcribed it then the divine <hi>Plato,</hi> who calls it <hi>Pandidaſcala;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Maſter
of all Arts,</hi> for there is no Art nor Science which he teaches not his Schollars. In
the firſt place he teaches them <hi>Grammer,</hi> and the <hi>eight</hi> parts of <hi>ſpeech,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with the <hi>nown</hi> or name of the beloved, and then the <hi>pronown</hi> of their good
Qualities, which he makes them repeat often. Thence he paſſes to the <hi>Adverbs</hi>
of the infinite <hi>time</hi> of their perſeverance, and thoſe of the ſwearing of their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.
Then he makes them underſtand the <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſsive verbs,</hi> acting
and ſuffering all things for the Beloveds ſake. Then he teaches them the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiple,</hi>
by which they muſt divide and part between them the good and the bad, the
thorns and the roſes, the pleaſures and the torments of this life. From thence
he proceeds to the <hi>Conjunction</hi> and conformity of their honeſt deſires, to the
vertuous affections of the beloved, which brings in the <hi>Prepoſition,</hi> teaching
thereby to prefer the pleaſure and ſatisfaction of the beloved, before their own;
and laſtly, he teaches them the ſad and ſorrowing <hi>Interjections,</hi> full of pittiful
<hi>Alas's;</hi> and interrupted by ſighs.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Lover</hi> is become a perfect <hi>Grammarian,</hi> his Tutor <hi>Love</hi> 'prefers him
to <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> which helps him to a many eloquent ſpeeches, ſometimes in the
<hi>Demonſtrative</hi> kinde, remonſtrating to his beloved how much he ſuffers for her
ſake; ſometimes in the <hi>Deliberative,</hi> reſolving rather to dy, then change his
affection; ſometimes in the <hi>Judicial,</hi> beſeeching his beloved to think him worthy
of a reciprocal love.</p>
                  <p>The Lover having gone through <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> Love brings him into <hi>Logick,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with her ten Predicaments; that is to ſay, the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of his heart, real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
converted into that of his beloved; the <hi>quantity</hi> of his ſighings, the <hi>quality</hi>
of his affection, which onght to be pure and innocent; the <hi>relation</hi> between his
ſoul and his Beloveds; the <hi>action</hi> of his minde, the <hi>paſſion</hi> of his heart, the <hi>time</hi>
of his ſufferings, the <hi>place</hi> of his repoſe, which is the heart of his beloved; the
<hi>ſcituation</hi> of his deſires, upon the firm rock of Conſtancy; and laſtly, he ſhews
of what colours his <hi>habit</hi> ſhould be; that is to ſay, <hi>grey</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> to intimate
unto him, that he muſt ſuffer all things to approve his <hi>integrity</hi> and his <hi>faith.</hi>
Having gone ſo far, he teaches him to crack an <hi>Argument,</hi> but his <hi>Syllogiſms</hi>
muſt for the moſt part be in <hi>Barbara, Ferio</hi> and <hi>Friſeſomorum,</hi> enduring all bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
torments, all furious aſſaults, and all <hi>frowning</hi> and <hi>froſty</hi> returns, though
it were in the heart of his ſummer. But at length he muſt conclude all his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in <hi>Celantes,</hi> for he muſt conceal all things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Logick</hi> being attained, he brings him into the eight books of <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> ſhewing
him firſt the three natural Principles; which are, the <hi>matter</hi> of the Lovers faith,
the <hi>form</hi> of the Beloveds vertues, and the <hi>privation</hi> of the ſatisfactions of Love.
This done, he advances to the ſecond Book, which treats of the four <hi>cauſes</hi> of
his <hi>paſſion;</hi> the <hi>material,</hi> which is no other then his own natural inclination; the
<hi>formal;</hi> an enflam'd deſire of the thing loved; the <hi>efficient,</hi> the attractions, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
and goodneſs of the Beloved I and the <hi>final,</hi> her vertue and her honor.
Out of this he paſſes into the third, which treats of the <hi>perpetual motion</hi> of the
Lovers <hi>heart,</hi> by which it moves, ſometimes ſuddenly to the ſervice of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
ſometimes ſlowly as it were from enjoyment to privation, from joy to
ſadneſs, and from reſt to labour. This done, he ſteps into the fourth, where he
ſhews him the <hi>infinitum</hi> of his ſufferings, the <hi>concentrick</hi> place where his heart
ought to be; that is, the Beloved: the <hi>vacuum</hi> of his ſonl exhauſted of all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and the <hi>time</hi> of his affection, which is perpetual. This being diſpatch'd, this
excellent Doctor leads him into the fifth book, which treats of the <hi>generation</hi> of his
noble and generous thoughts, his chaſte intentions, and his honeſt deſigns, and
the <hi>corruption</hi> of all his impure deſires, and irregular affections. Thence does he
bring him to underſtand the nature of <hi>mixt</hi> bodies, which are the matter of the
ſixth book, where he learns what cauſes the piercing <hi>thunder</hi> of his complaints,
the interlaced <hi>clouds</hi> of the <hi>vapours</hi> of his ſadneſs; the bluſtering <hi>winds</hi> and <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43725:11"/>
of his ſighs, and the plentiful <hi>ſhowers</hi> and <hi>dews</hi> of his Tears. Thence he
advances to the ſeventh book, where he findes that the <hi>earth</hi> is nothing elſe but
his conſtancy. The <hi>water</hi> his tears, the <hi>ayr</hi> his ſighs, and the <hi>fire</hi> his deſires;
the <hi>Moon,</hi> his want of <hi>Reſolution, Mercury</hi> his enchanting Remonſtrances and
Addreſſes, <hi>Venus</hi> his milde Diſpoſition, the <hi>Sun</hi> his Vertue, <hi>Mars</hi> his Courage,
<hi>Jupiter</hi> his Diſcretion, <hi>Saturn</hi> his Judgement; the <hi>Firmament</hi> his Conſtancy, the
<hi>Empyraean</hi> Heaven, the Purity of his affection, and the <hi>primum mobile</hi> his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
love. And laſtly, he finiſhes his courſe of Phyſicks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the eight Book,
where he contemplates the excellency of a ſoul that's perfectly <hi>loved</hi> with a noble

that is to ſay, the <hi>Addition</hi> of preſent to paſt ſufferings, the <hi>Subſtraction</hi> of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt
entertainments, the <hi>Diviſion</hi> of his complyant minde from it ſelf, and the
<hi>Multiplication</hi> of the pains he takes night and day. Thence he <hi>Screws</hi> him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Muſick,</hi> teaching what an harmonious compliance is expected from him, by the
<hi>Diapaſon,</hi> which is compos'd of three Notes, whereof the loweſt is Coſiſtancy,
the next Patience, and the higheſt Fidelity. In this <hi>muſical</hi> Love, the <hi>reſts</hi> are
very frequent, and very ſweet, <hi>ſharpes</hi> there are none at all. When he is Maſter
of <hi>Muſick,</hi> Love ſhews him the <hi>Dimenſions</hi> of <hi>Geometry;</hi> that is to ſay, the
<hi>profundity</hi> of his ſervices and ſubmiſſions, the <hi>height</hi> of his imaginations, the
<hi>breadth</hi> of his hopes, and the <hi>length</hi> of his perſeverance. To make him an <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger</hi>
requires but little time, ſhewing him the <hi>courſe</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> in the <hi>ſphere</hi> of
his heart; and his <hi>Eclipſe</hi> upon the <hi>Horriſon</hi> of his eyes, whoſe effects are ſad and

and croſs <hi>aſpects</hi> of the ſtars ſhall contribute thereto.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mathematicks</hi> well underſtood, he brings the Lover into the ſtudy of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi>
teaching him to let <hi>blood,</hi> and open the <hi>veyns</hi> of the heart, and thence to
draw the blood through the eyes, and to make a <hi>Diet</hi> of the pteſence of his
beloved, if need be.</p>
                  <p>From hence he aſcends to the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> and her three general Precepts; and
that teaches him to live honeſtly with his beloved; not to offend her any way,
and to bear her all the reſpect, and render all the ſervices he can.</p>

himſelf into the ſea of his Tears, being at the mercy of the <hi>winds</hi> of his ſighs,
under the conduct of the <hi>North-ſtar</hi> of his Loyalty. Laſtly, he inſtructs him in
the Art <hi>Military,</hi> ſhewing him how he muſt by main force carry the <hi>fort</hi>
of the heart of his Beloved, ſometimes with the aſſiſtance of the <hi>fire</hi> of a
pricking paſſion, ſometimes by the <hi>water</hi> of his tears, ſometimes by the <hi>mines</hi>
of his ſighs, ſometimes by the <hi>aſſault</hi> of a vehement grief, or at leaſt annoying
the <hi>beſieged</hi> place by a patient perſeverance; and when it is once <hi>Delivered</hi> up,
he teaches the Lover how to keep it with Modeſty, Diſcretion, Honour and

               <p>Now do I think I have oblig'd two ſorts of people, the judicious, by furniſhing

take it for an <hi>Encuclopaedia,</hi> for it will mightily rub up their memories. But I
pray what is there in all this, which a man would not deciſively attribute to a

               <p>But to return to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who would bring in a new <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> directing all to his
Miſtreſs, yet not ſo pernicious as what the Poets ſay of theirs. For they ſay, they

hath ſufficiently ripp'd up theſe abſurdities. But it were enough to confute
the Golden Age, to conſider the Celebrators of it, the <hi>Poets,</hi> who of all men the

have nothing of their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clarimond</hi> with much reaſon ſtudies the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Fables,</hi> ſince we muſt be
troubled with them; as for example, that Fable of <hi>Cupid,</hi> who might better carry
a <hi>Piſtol</hi> then <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Arrows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing is the indiſcreet curioſity of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> in opening the Box wherein
he thought the <hi>Eccho</hi> was; but his comparing himſelf to <hi>Pandora, Aglaura,</hi> and
<hi>Pſyche,</hi> is that which brings with it ſuch a maſs of fables, that I am weary of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
the abſurdities of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s conformities are very remarkable, yet he wants not preſidents; for they
ſay that a Lover muſt ever be ſick of his Miſtreſſes diſeaſe: and for his Picture being
in her blood, it comes from the ſame forge. His diſcourſe upon the muſick made by
<hi>Carmelin</hi> and the other Shepherd, is much like the Corollaries which the Poets

               <p>The rencontre of <hi>Philiris</hi> and the other Shepherds, is certainly <hi>Romantick</hi> and

But I cannot but take notice of <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s inventions in the Metamorphoſis, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
his judgment far beyond the Poets; for they never give any reaſon of their
Metamorphoſes, it being the moſt abſurd thing in the world to advance things, even
in fictions, which defie probability. As for example, <hi>Polyphemus</hi> being jealous to
have ſeen <hi>Acis</hi> with <hi>Galathea,</hi> caſt a great piece of a Rock at him, with which he
was forc'd into the ground; but his Miſtreſs and the Nymphs chang'd him into a
River. Should they not rather have ſuccour'd him? But now I had rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a man chang'd into water by an extraordinary ſweat, through ſome violent
exerciſe or ſickneſs, or by diſtillation. Yet <hi>Carmelin</hi> unacquainted with the Poets,
cannot ſwallow that Metamorphoſis; for <hi>Des Portes</hi> would have taught him, that
the teares of a <hi>Poet</hi> are a certain water diſtill'd from the Roſes, Lilies, and other
flowers of his Miſtreſſes beauty; his Love is the fire, his Heart the furnace, and
his Eye the beak of the Alambick, and his Sighs are the bellows. I think <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s
propoſition to <hi>Carmelin</hi> is not more extravagant then what this Poet ſays; only
I think fit <hi>Carmelin's</hi> noſe be the beak of the Alambick, that ſo the water may be
preſerved for the uſe of decay'd Ladies.</p>
               <p>I hope the Poets will pardon <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s courſe to multiply <hi>Carmelin</hi>'s water. <hi>Ocyro</hi>
was chang'd into a <hi>Mare,</hi> for preſuming to be a <hi>Propheteſs.</hi> This is impertinent
enough; for what relation is there between a <hi>Propheteſs</hi> and a <hi>Mare?</hi> But that the
hinder part of her gown ſhould be chang'd into a tail, is yet more: I wonder, if
ſhe had had no cloaths on, whether ſhe had been without a tail. Therefore I think
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> ſimple as he is, more diſcreet then all the Poets: for where his Maſter
tels him, that when he is chang'd into water, he ſhall ſee the Divinities naked, he
asks where will be his eyes and other members? Honeſt <hi>Ovid</hi> ſayes, that <hi>Cyana</hi>
being to relate to <hi>Ceres</hi> the carrying away of her daughter, could not do it, becauſe
being chang'd into water, ſhe had neither tongue nor mouth. And yet in the next
fable, <hi>Arethuſa</hi> who had run the ſame fortune, lifted up her head above her waves,
and related all her ancient adventures. This is enough to ſhew how far the Poets
preſume upon the ignorance of the people, who muſt receive what they bring, be
it ever ſo abſurd.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s rural <hi>Temple,</hi> which he would build to <hi>Charite, Des Portes</hi> will
needs build one for his Goddeſs; where his Eye ſhall be the Lamp, his Body the
Altar, his Sighs his Vows, and he will ſing a daily office: provided his Miſtreſs
gave him a good fat Parſonage; for this Poet was a benefie'd man. His avarice
might be pardoned, but not his idolatry.</p>
               <p>I ſhall paſs to <hi>Clarimond's</hi> reconciliation of the Metamorphoſes; and that of the
Raven I like above any. In like manner a man may with ſome probability ſay, that
a <hi>Souldier</hi> having a head-piece and boots and ſpurs on, may be chang'd into a <hi>Cock.</hi>
But <hi>Ovid</hi> troubled not himſelf with any conſideration of probability.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtory of <hi>Fontenay</hi> hath much conduct and judgment in it. As for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
I ſhall not comment on them: It repreſents a ſort of old Romances, which
brought Magicians, Sorcereſſes, and their Miracles on the Stage, but without that
probability which <hi>Fontenay</hi> obſerves. As for inſtance, that he lov'd himſelf, he
gives you this reaſon, that he was of a ſolitary and melancholick diſpoſition, and
'tis withall natural for ſuch a Complexion to conſult Sorceries.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s changing his place, to receive the ayr which came from <hi>Charite,</hi> 'tis
neither too amorous, nor too poetick: I ſhall quote but one authority, and that
is <hi>Ronſard;</hi> who ſayes, that being at a great diſtance from <hi>Paris,</hi> on a mountain,
he ſuck'd in the ayr that came from that great City where his Miſtreſs was, which
did extreamly enliven him.</p>
               <p>As for the Hiſtory of <hi>Philiris,</hi> the naturalneſs of it is extraordinay, and the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
he is in for this laſt Miſtreſs, after he had neglected ſo many, keeps within its
bounds; he is content to wiſh a picture of her as ſhe was every year ſince ſhe was
born: far from the extravagance of that Courtier, who to teſtifie his love to his
M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſtreſs, had caus'd his own picture to be drawn, which had in the left ſide a great
rent through doublet, ſhirt, skin and bones, even to the heart, where he had
<pb facs="tcp:43725:13"/>
caus'd his Miſtreſſes Picture to be drawn. And her playing with Dogs and Lambs is
as natural, conſidering her age, which was not yet capable to underſtand what love
was. For <hi>Philters</hi> and <hi>Amulets,</hi> our Romances are ſo peſtered with them, that the
Authors think they are not perfect without them.</p>
               <p>Where he ſays, his Miſtreſs ſhed ſo many tears as would have made a <hi>Channel,</hi>
that might have born a boat to bring him thither in, 'tis an ordinary Poetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
for they weep <hi>Rivers,</hi> nay <hi>Oceans;</hi> it ſhall ſuffice to quote him, that
ſaid, he ſhed ſo many tears as would make a <hi>ſea,</hi> wherein his Miſtreſs ſhould ſport
her ſelf like a <hi>Mermaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are none more ingenious then your Lovers, who whatever they ſee, apply
it to their Miſtreſſes. If they ſee Roſes, they think of their Beauty; if an Oak,
it puts them in minde of their ſtature; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſhould alſo ſee her at the ſame time, and that ſhe ſhould carry intelligence between
them, 'tis only <hi>Philiris</hi> that ever imagin'd it. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was a notable fellow,
for he made people read in a glaſs, what was written in the Moon: but alas, the
characters were written in blood upon the glaſs; and thus did he abuſe the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and foretold divers things. But there's a better invention in the Adventures
of <hi>Florida;</hi> Two Lovers had gotten two Sun-dials, but inſtead of the hours of the
day, there was an Alphabet about, and the needles of both being touch'd by the
ſame ſtone, moved both together at a diſtance, and thus did they hold correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
But theſe Dials coming at laſt into the hands of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who

               <p>Another Lover of our own Country, not being able to brook the abſence of his

if there be no ſuch things in nature, lets laugh at thoſe that firſt advanc'd them.
The <hi>Remora</hi> ſtops a ſhip in her courſe; I'll tell you how this came up. A certain
boat ran a ground on a bank of ſand, being overturn'd, the Mariners found this
fiſh ſtuck to the keel, and ſo they believ'd that hindred the boat, and brought it on
the ſand. As for the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> the ſtories of it are ſo monſtrouſly ridiculous, that
out of them I ſhall only obſerve the ſtrange ſottiſhneſs of mans minde, that ſuffers
it ſelf to be carried away by the torrent of tradition, though in things that are in

no female, let them conſider whether they abuſe not God, who for the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation

                     </gap>,</hi> theſe reſemblances, and the miſtakes that ariſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are a great part of our <hi>Romances.</hi> In the Paſtorals of <hi>Julietta, Delio,</hi> a Knight
of <hi>Barcelona</hi> being gone to the wars, his Miſtreſs <hi>Catulla</hi> expected him every day;
but being at the utmoſt of deſpair for him, there comes into the Town a certain
German that was very like him. <hi>Catulla</hi> having heard of it, ſends her woman to
give him directions how to come to her in the night, which was by the help of a
ladder of cord. He, though a ſtranger, yet perceiving the miſtake, would needs
truſt himſelf to Fortune; but going at his hour appointed, he meets the Watch,
draws on them; and after he had kill'd two, was taken and carried to priſon, and
the next day condemn'd. <hi>Catulla</hi> hearing of this, knew there was no way to
ſave him but to beg him, which ſhe did by her maid. This was a notable reſemblance,
that could not be diſcovered all the time: But that which put me on this ſtory is,
that cuſtom of begging condemn'd perſons: 'Twas a priviledge of common whores,
who upon promiſe of amendment of life, had ſuch as were deſtin'd to the gallows
beſtow'd on them. One reaſon of this is, the affinity of the ſins of thoſe people.
Beſides that, it was thought a work of Charity to put together two bad livers, who
repenting, might haply bring forth children full of courage, and honeſt, fit to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Colonies: And ſuch were the founders of old <hi>Rome,</hi> a ſort of Vagabonds, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waymen,
Tories and Bandits, who having made a Troop, came afterwards to give
Laws to all the world.</p>
               <p>But I come to the famous hiſtory of <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who though an inconſiderable
perſon, yet ſhall exceed the Romanciſts. All he ſaies are fancies and hyperboles.
For the littleneſs of his Maſter, you muſt note, that the Poets deſcribing a thing,
obſerve leſs probability; elſe what meant he that ſaid, That a little man having
gotten up on the back of a Piſmire, thought himſelf upon an Elephant, but on a
ſudden got a fall from it as high as that of <hi>Phaeton.</hi> For <hi>Taupins</hi> changing his
name, and thinking to grow bigger with it, <hi>Carmelin</hi> had read ſome <hi>Romance,</hi> where
he found a Gyant called <hi>Nagibuſcantropocara,</hi> a name proportionable to his body.
There was a certain Roman, who beſides the making of his cloathes too big, as
<hi>Taupin</hi> did, would not eat of any ſmall creature, leſt it ſhould make him little like
what he eat, and that made him love Beef better then Partridge. His ſauce was
<pb facs="tcp:43725:14"/>
made of <hi>Pompions,</hi> but for Peaſe and beans he could not endure the ſight of them.
This was a little beyond ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carmelins</hi> ſeveral conditions are certainly as pleaſant as any thing of <hi>Lazarillo
de Tormes:</hi> and his deſcription of the Joyners life and houſe-keeping, is a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of a Frenchman.</p>
               <p>You ſee how <hi>Clarimond</hi> begins <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s Hiſtory: I'll tell you how <hi>D'audiguier</hi>
begins that of <hi>Lyſander; Under the memorable Reign of the great</hi> Henry, <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
father of our invincible Monarch, there flouriſhed in</hi> France <hi>a yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whoſe heroick vertue is rendred more illuſtrious by the glory of his vertues,
then by the antiquity of his race, &amp;c.</hi> Methinks the Epithets here are very cheap,
what need a mans valour come in to tell us of his ſon: but that word <hi>Flouriſhing</hi>
troubled <hi>Lyſis</hi> moſt; 'tis ſo like the Legend, for alas he was afraid that for that word
men would have doubled the truth of his Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſis</hi> believes <hi>Hircan</hi> took off the beards of the Gods of the waters; how
faithful is his memory! he remembred <hi>Hercules,</hi> ſnatch'd a horn from the River
<hi>Achelous,</hi> and that the Satyr <hi>Marſias</hi> was flead by <hi>Apollo,</hi> from the ſoals of his
feet to the crown of his head, a ſad encounter for a God.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Philiris</hi> ſaies touching the thoughts of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and his deſcription of the
night, are true Poetick imaginations; his putting perſonages on the clouds and
winds, puts me in minde of a certain petty Romance, wherein there was <q>
                     <hi>The fight
of the four Seaſons of the year; Summer</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> were the two Generals. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Summer</hi> was diſcontented, that ſuch a Tyrant as <hi>Winter,</hi> with a confus'd
Army of <hi>Winds, Miſts,</hi> and others, <hi>Highlanders, Scythians</hi> and <hi>Deſerteers,</hi> ſhould
make ſuch ſpoil on his fine <hi>Champion</hi> Country, rob his <hi>Forreſts,</hi> and trample his
<hi>Meadows,</hi> and impriſon the faireſt <hi>Flowers</hi> in his Garden, and cauſe himſelf to
fly for refuſe to the <hi>Antipodes.</hi> The <hi>Autumn</hi> and the <hi>Spring</hi> took part with the
<hi>Summer,</hi> by the means of <hi>Cupid. Venus</hi> alſo ſent him the <hi>Cyclopes</hi> with ſome
<hi>Thunderbolts</hi> for his Artillery. <hi>Ceres, Pomona</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> promis'd to finde him
proviſions. He drew up his forces in the Vale of <hi>Eſam;</hi> but he was no ſooner
in the field, but he had intelligence that his brother <hi>Autumn</hi> was routed the other
ſide the ſea. That they had diſcovered the advance of a Brigade of ſharp bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Winds,</hi> with which a company of <hi>Miſts</hi> came up as reſolutely, as if they had
been Swiſſers; after which came up the Canon and Artillery, which was guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſeveral Regiments of <hi>Froſts, Rains, Hail</hi> and <hi>Snow,</hi> with Scaling Ladders,
and Bridges of <hi>Ice.</hi> That three hours after they diſcovered a Squadrons of <hi>Fogs,</hi>
all in diſorder, and led up by the Amazon <hi>Cold,</hi> which was follow'd by the main
battel of General <hi>Winter,</hi> who had four Legions of Flakes of <hi>Ice</hi> had preſt the
<hi>frigid Zone,</hi> and all old and grey <hi>Travellers,</hi> who had proviſion for five months
and odde days; and that theſe forces had quite routed <hi>Autumn.</hi> General <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
was not much troubled at this news, who thought it his beſt courſe to joyn
battel with his enemy before his forces were refreſh'd. While he was thus buſie,
a <hi>Page</hi> comes from <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> and tells him he had there ſeen two or three
Gentlewomen get green gowns, which made him believe that <hi>Winter</hi> could not
be ſo near. Whereupon he giving himſelf over to ſome little enjoyment. <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
advances with ſome Troops of <hi>Hoar-Froſts,</hi> which made <hi>Summer</hi> retreat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his works: Some days were thus ſpent in skirmiſhes to no great advantage of
either ſide; for what the <hi>Hoar-froſts</hi> did in the morning, Captain <hi>Phoebus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
at noon. But <hi>Winter</hi> brought up all his forces, and took the works, and
froze the hearts of the hotteſt Champions among them. <hi>Summer</hi> in the mean
time rallies, and brings on the rays of <hi>Phoebus,</hi> which were come to his ſuccor
from the high Countrey; but <hi>Winter</hi> had ſet a ſort of good reſolute <hi>Fogs</hi> all
about, who aſſoon as they perceiv'd the rays, riſe up and gave alarm, having let
Captain <hi>Ayr</hi> paſs their guards. The ſignal of the Battel was a <hi>Bluſtering wind</hi>
on the one ſide, and on the other <hi>Thunder.</hi> The Battel being joyn'd, <hi>Phoebus</hi>
would needs ſuccor the <hi>Summer,</hi> but the <hi>Miſts</hi> being of the other ſide, came and
cover'd both Armies, ſo that he could not ſee them. The Duke of <hi>November</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43725:14"/>
would needs with a ſelect troop of <hi>Fair days</hi> reinforce the fight; but the Earl
of <hi>Shrove-Tueſday</hi> came with a drunken deſperate crue, and took him off. <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
ſeeing himſelf put to the rout, fought ſtoutly; but at laſt was forc'd to flie to
the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> to raiſe new forces againſt the next <hi>Campagn.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſeems pleaſant enough; and there is another fight between the <hi>Fleſh-days</hi>
and <hi>Fiſh-days,</hi> but it is too long for this place: but for this, I think it is much
more ingenious then <hi>Homers</hi> between the <hi>Mice</hi> and the <hi>Frogs.</hi> For what difference
could happen between two ſorts of Creatures, that had no acquaintance one with
another? one living in the water, the other in warm holes in houſes. That humor
of arraigning <hi>Banquet</hi> of certain crimes of <hi>Drunkenneſs, Qnarrels</hi> and <hi>Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and referring her to the puniſhment of <hi>Famine,</hi> was not much better in our
old Poets. <hi>Clyſters</hi> and <hi>Julips</hi> are brought to <hi>purge</hi> away her noxious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
               <p>Now we come to <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s unwillingneſs to take <hi>arms:</hi> he remembers that <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſongs,
Madrigals</hi> and <hi>Ecclogues</hi> are the ordinary entertainments of <hi>Shepherds;</hi> but
where he ſays, that he will only contend who ſhall give the beſt kiſſes; he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<hi>Myrtil</hi> in the <hi>Faithful Shepherd;</hi> as alſo <hi>Ronſard,</hi> who in the Temple he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
for his Miſtreſs, will have her ſtatue, cloſe by which ſhall ſtand by his, as it
were going to kiſs her, and that all that are in Love, muſt come thither once a year

ſhould have ſome reward.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Hircan</hi>'s Propheſie aſſures him as to the taking of arms; there are two or
three ſuch in the Hiſtory of <hi>Lyſander,</hi> where I ſhall leave them.</p>

               <head>The Ninth BOOK.</head>
               <p>THere is no book but much may be ſaid on it; but ſince it might be thought
repetition, I ſhall contract. I ſee nothing incomprehenſible in the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, nor yet in the arrival of the <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
that are ripp'd up; as, the drinking by the Letters of the Miſtreſſes name
(which ſome did till they forgot their own) nor was <hi>Carmelin</hi>'s drunkenneſs to be
omitted, for the truth of the ſtory requir'd it.</p>
               <p>Love blinded is again in the <hi>Faithful Shepherd,</hi> and that in the <hi>Arcadia</hi> is, to ſay
truth, very difficult to make any thing of.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s paſſing from the Iron to the Golden-Age, without paſſing through
the Silver one, 'tis to ſhew the excellency of his operations, and withal to tell them,
it ſhall coſt them nothing.</p>
               <p>Nor is that humor of his, of having a <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Romances</hi> leſs pleaſant; but what
Cockſcombs are theſe <hi>Romans,</hi> that attribute <hi>Genders</hi> and <hi>Sexes</hi> to their Divinities,
and multiply them without any reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſis</hi> his <hi>Vniverſity</hi> is very pleaſant; The diſputations that were had on his
<hi>Theſes</hi> had been printed, had they but aſſign'd him a Colledge at <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nd</hi> ſaies of the Golden-Age, muſt be added to what had been ſaid
before. The fruit of <hi>Lotos</hi> is a thing was never yet ſeen, nor much heard, but what
<hi>Homer</hi> ſays of it.</p>
               <p>But the deſign of the Plays is that which is incomparable; as well for the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the Scene as the Language: To rip up the Fables which they propoſe to
act, were to be too tedious; as for the lights which <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſaw, he ſays nothing
which the vulgar opinion confirms not, whether they proceed from natural cauſes
or diabolick, matters not here. In <hi>Euphormio</hi> you may know ſomewhat more
of them; the Author of that Satyr tells you they call Travellers to them, and
that <hi>Euphormio,</hi> with his friend <hi>Percas,</hi> going by a river ſide, ſaw a man with a great
head of hair, and a great Beard, who was ſeen to the navil, and that he turned
<pb facs="tcp:43725:15"/>
up his buttocks, and clapped himſelf; which done, he laughed, and went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
water again.</p>
               <p>As for the Players habits, <hi>Black</hi> is the colour of <hi>Pluto</hi>'s Kingdom; <hi>Jupiters</hi> red
is the colour of his Thunder; <hi>Venus</hi>'s green is the colour of the Spring, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
Love; <hi>Ceres</hi>'s yellow is the colour of her harveſts. <hi>Proſerpina</hi>'s blew is
the ordinary colour of maids to be married; and for <hi>Cyana</hi> and <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> white
repreſents the ſilver of their ſtreams. But for <hi>Cupids</hi> being naked, with his Bow
and Arrow, as the Poets paint him, there is ſomewhat to be ſaid againſt it.
When he would ſhoot at one, what does he with his torch? doth he let it fall to
the ground? or does he put it out till he hath done, and then lights it again at the
eyes of ſome Beauty? nor do I ſee why he ſhould go naked in the cold; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I approve <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who being to repreſent him, would not for modeſty ſake.
But it may be ſaid the enjoyments of it are naked: be it ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> ſpeaks by <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> yet not ſuch, but the Poets make them ordinary;
for to ſay, that the beauties of a Miſtreſs are able to make the Gods Idolatrous, is
much beyond any thing ſhe ſaies. The diſcourſes alſo of <hi>Cupid</hi> are fit for ſuch a
perſon, as the Poets make him: for his playing at Cockal, ſince he is a childe, 'tis
natural; but pins are more proper for him, for 'tis his deſign to prick. Nor is <hi>Gani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>'s
loitering from ſchool abſurd, for you muſt note, <hi>Mercury</hi> taught the Gods
languages. While the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſtood, they ſpoke all Greek, but when the Empire came
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Gods were fain to ſubmit to the Latine tongue, otherwiſe
they could not have convers'd with that people, nor anſwer'd them by their
Oracles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pluto</hi> hath taken the Pedantick ſtile, which is the moſt proper for a ſolitary God
as he is; and as this God paſſing his time with the dead, muſt needs ſpeak ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Language; ſo thoſe here who ſpend night and day in reading old Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and never converſe with other men, furniſh us with nothing but their Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
both in their diſcourſe and Books. For his mangling of the Latine words, he
may be eaſily underſtood, as being not ſo ridiculouſly affected, as that of the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
in <hi>Rabelais;</hi> who ſays he goes to the <hi>Lupanar</hi> inſtead of a Bawdy-houſe, and
transfrets the <hi>Sequane.</hi> But <hi>Rabelais</hi> needed not have abus'd others in this point, for
his own ordinary ſtile is Pedantick enough.</p>
               <p>The Rencontre of <hi>Adrian</hi> juſt in this nick of time, muſt needs be very pleaſant;
and his bidding the company adieu, and the Waggoner drive on both in a breath,
ſufficiently ſpeak his quality.</p>
               <p>But the next Comedy is much more perfect, as being not interrupted. <hi>Zethes</hi>
and <hi>Calais</hi> ſpeak the ordinary phraſe, as being yong men; but <hi>Jaſon</hi> being a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
and better at his hands then at this tongue, can ſpeak no other but <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathias,</hi>
a kinde of ſpeech hath no name neither among the <hi>Greeks</hi> nor <hi>Latines,</hi>
as conſiſting of contradictions, and clinches upon the words, and 'tis only the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
declares what it is. 'Tis a Language that much peſters the Courtiers; you
have enough of it in the <hi>Loves</hi> of <hi>Nerueza,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Des Eſcuteaux,</hi> and in
<hi>Loves Alarms;</hi> and though theſe Books are ſlighted now, yet were they excellent
in their time, and thoſe that are now in vogue, will come to the ſame fate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our</hi> Medea <hi>is all in</hi> Metaphors; <hi>a ſtile proper for a Sorcereſs; he that compos'd
the Travels of</hi> Ariſteus, <hi>was excellent at it.</hi> Deſpair <hi>ſaies he,</hi> like a reſolute War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
having laid ſiege to the heart of that Shepherdeſs with an Army of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
took in at length that fort of her ſoul, having at his entrance knock'd down that
inflexible courage, cut the throat of his patience, maſſacr'd his furious reſolutions,
and precipitated thoſe thoughts, which had eſcaped the fury of the ſword, into a fire
perpetually burning with a deſire of death. <hi>This Author was the only admiration
of the Court; but how deſervedly</hi>—</p>
               <p>But to return to our Comedy. <hi>Jaſon</hi> deſirous to obtain the <hi>Golden-Fleece,</hi> which
was a Book of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> as ſome ſay, though the Fable bears other expoſitions.
But the Poets know not where the <hi>Colchos</hi> was, for ſome will have it to be an Iſland,
others a Continent; nay, ſome ſay, they knew not by what river the <hi>Argo</hi> got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:43725:15"/>
the ſea. But that trouble, you will ſay, <hi>Orpheus</hi> ſav'd them; for he could as well
draw after him their ſhip as other things with his Harp. But I wonder, that being
at ſea, the Rocks follow'd them not: but it is to be thought they heard him not.
When this Muſician deſcended into hell, the <hi>Acheron</hi> followed him even to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of <hi>Pluto,</hi> ſo that the Shades were like to be drown'd in the midſt of the fires.
'Twas a brave fellow; for with one touch on the Harp he could draw the faireſt
Trees from his neighbours garden into his own; and if he chang'd Country, he
could make his houſe follow him: And yet this was the moſt beggerly Poet that
ever was. But I wonder how the Sun and the Stars, being more excellent bodies
then the Stones Trees, were not charm'd by his muſick. But to purſue the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
When the <hi>Argonauts</hi> were arrived in the Country of King <hi>Phineas, Zethes</hi>
and <hi>Calais</hi> relieve him againſt the Harpies. Theſe young men were the ſons of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas</hi>
and the fair <hi>Orithia,</hi> and had the gift of flying. But why the Harpies ſhould
hinder King <hi>Phineas</hi> to eat, I ſee not; nor yet how this poor King could live ſo
long without meat. But having done their buſineſs, the <hi>Argonauts</hi> purſue their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
and <hi>Medea</hi> ſo favour'd <hi>Jaſon,</hi> that ſhe gave him a charm toſet the Dragon
aſleep. What a ſimple Conquerour is this <hi>Jaſon,</hi> that does all things by magick?
The Dragon being aſleep, 'twas eaſie to take the Fleece. And his Companions never
drew ſword till they came to <hi>Theſſaly.</hi> Are not theſe excellent examples of valour?
As for the language of ſome Actors in this Comedy, it is enough to ſay it is fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
as the reſt. Theſe two pieces could not be better repreſented. <hi>Carmelin</hi> and
the <hi>Harpies</hi> did excellently well, nor did <hi>Hircan</hi> who playd <hi>Orpheus</hi> do leſs. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
if any of the Country chanc'd to ſee them, they muſt needs think them mad:
but they had ſuch a lechery to make ſport with <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that they cared not; and
therefore being ſatisfied with this diverſion, they find him other adventures in the</p>
            </div>
            <div n="10" type="book">
               <head>Tenth BOOK.</head>
               <p>I Cannot but admire <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s reading and his judgment in the old Authors. His
attaque of the Fable of <hi>Thetis</hi> is excellent; but his heroick accoutrements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
him again: But that was becauſe he ſaw ſome Poets even of his own time
ſo dreſs'd before their Books. That ſubtilty of <hi>Hircan,</hi> to make <hi>Lyſis</hi> believe that
the Coach was drawn by horſes as long as it was on firm ground, and did not flie
till it came to the ſea, was not ordinary: but <hi>Lyſis</hi> helps it by his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie.</p>
               <p>But what he intends to do in heaven, is beyond all Aſtrologie, and diſcovers the
Tenets of divers Philoſophers, and eſpecially thoſe of the <hi>Platonicks</hi> concerning
<hi>Reminiſcence;</hi> and that was it made <hi>Lyſis</hi> believe there muſt be an Univerſity in
heaven for the ſouls. After he hath ſpoken of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Tuns of Good and Evil, he
falls afreſh on the <hi>Ideas</hi> of the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> as if they had been things to be ſeen
in heaven. Nor is his holding of <hi>ſolution</hi> of <hi>continuity</hi> in ſpirits leſs Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical.</p>
               <p>The adventure of the Dragon ſhews how eaſie it is to deceive him that deceives
himſelf. But for the things that come out of the Dragons belly, they are not ſo
ſtrange as what comes from a Gentleman in the Hiſtory of <hi>Lyſander,</hi> that vomited
images of wax, pieces of Looking-glaſſes, Pen-knives and Ink-horns.</p>
               <p>The Deliverance of <hi>Pamphilia</hi> muſt needs be a great honour to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and ſuch as
muſt make him <hi>heroick.</hi> But his relation of his adventure is excellent. Becauſe he had
ſeen Birds that could ſpeak at <hi>Paris,</hi> he thought there might be a Country whence
they came, and where they ſpoke and did all things as we do. But this, and what he
ſays of the <hi>Diaphonous</hi> people, is but a dream of <hi>Lyſis;</hi> yet not ſo impertinent as that
of <hi>Poliphilus,</hi> who in one night dreamt a book as big as ours.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s imagination, that being invulnerable, the Gyants could not force
<pb facs="tcp:43725:16"/>
out his ſoul but through the noſe, 'tis an abuſe of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who in his <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſays
that <hi>Moſes</hi> having long wandered the deſart, found a Tomb, whereof as he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidering
the length and breadth, the Angel of death came to kill him: <hi>Moſes</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, How wilt thou get my ſoul out? ſays he to him: Not through my mouth,
for that hath ſpoke to God; not through my ears, for thoſe have heard him; not
through my eyes, for thoſe have ſeen him; not by my hands, for thoſe have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
preſents from him; not through my feet, for thoſe carried me into the Mount.
The Angel went his way thus baffled: but another time he preſented <hi>Moſes</hi> with an
Apple of Paradice; which he ſmelling at, the Angel took him by the noſe and drew
out his ſoul, &amp; ſo diſpos'd him into that Sepulchre which could never ſince be found.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Lyſis</hi> will be accoutred according to his Authors, he ſtill diſcovers his old
humour, that makes him believe there's as much truth in Picture as in Poetry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clarimond's</hi> abuſing of thoſe Shepherds that grave their amorous ſpeeches and
expoſtulations on Trees, is not without reaſon, 'tis ſuch an impertinent and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
foolery: For they muſt ſend notice to their Miſtreſſes to go to that tree,
or all's loſt; which if they do, they might as well have ſent what they writ on the
tree ſome other way.</p>
               <p>The hiſtory of <hi>Anaximander</hi> may well go for canonical with <hi>Lyſis.</hi> He had ſeen
in the fables, that <hi>Medea</hi> had taken <hi>Aeſon</hi> by the throat, and let out all his old
blood, and fill'd his body with other, by which means he became young again. Nor
want our preſent Romances theſe renewings of age. <hi>Panurgus</hi> had his body mine'd,
as if it had been to be put into paſte; which done, it was molded anew, and made
handſome then before, and they got life into him by blowing into his fundament.
Then does he relate ſtories of the other world. But if there be any wit in things of
this nature, 'tis <hi>Anaximander</hi> claims it. As for the God of <hi>Sleep,</hi> whom <hi>Clarimond</hi>
quotes, 'tis to keep even with the fables. Some grant this God a palace, ſome a grot.
But to what purpoſe either; ſince all that are about him muſt be aſleep, and cannot
do this Child of the night any ſervice? And ſince <hi>Ovid</hi> ſays he is ever aſleep, how
can he go about the earth to ſow <hi>poppies?</hi> That's a task for the God of <hi>Vigilance</hi>
rather then the God of <hi>Sleep.</hi> Thus ſhall we never be rid of abſurdities.</p>
               <p>The inſtructions which <hi>Lyſis</hi> gives to his Hiſtoriographer, are certainly very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent:
but the new deſcription of his Miſtreſſes Picture is much more. <hi>La Roque</hi>
was a fool to him; for he ſays only that he is a new kind of <hi>Spider,</hi> that makes a
web whereon Love ſhould work his Miſtreſſes picture, but how he tels us not,
whereas <hi>Lyſis</hi> deſcribes his to the leaſt particulars. As for the Copper-piece, you
ſee 'twas all was left of the brazen age. For the gold into which <hi>Midas</hi>'s wine was
turn'd, why might not <hi>Lyſis</hi> think it might be made potable again, with the help of
the Chymiſts who have broke their heads ſo much about it? The white muſt be
made of the ſame milk which made the <hi>via lactea;</hi> which though not very white,
yet might ſerve <hi>Charite</hi> well enough. The fleſh-colour taken from the ſweat of
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> is a new invention; and ſo is the red that is borrowed from Autumn.
The black is <hi>Proſerpina's</hi> Paint, yet may do well enough for an Eye-brow. The
Poets who have made ſuch monſters of the Gods, have made <hi>Neptune</hi> always with a
blue beard. For the marble whereon the Colours were wrought, it muſt needs be a
peece of the firſt Altar that was erected to thoſe Gods whom <hi>Lyſis</hi> honours ſo much.
<hi>Venus</hi>'s ſhell was that wherein ſhe arriv'd at <hi>Cyprus;</hi> and <hi>Lada's</hi> egg was that out
of which <hi>Helen, Caſtor,</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> were hatch'd.</p>
               <p>That I have not altogether obſerv'd <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s directions for the titles of his Letters
and the Hiſtories, is becauſe I would not in ſuch a punctilio tranſgreſs the laws of
our <hi>Romances.</hi> But his obſervation is never the leſs commendable.</p>
               <p>As for him that would dedicate a Romance of Knighthood to <hi>Bethlem-Gabor,</hi> 'tis
a Satyre, he being a moſt warlike Prince: And where 'tis ſaid he ſhould have a
Love-ſtory dedicated to him to teach him to court his Miſtreſſes, <hi>Germany</hi> and the
<hi>State of Venice,</hi> I may add, that he hath ever been in love with the <hi>Ocean,</hi> which he
enjoys more then thoſe other Miſtreſſes; and that if thoſe old Cuckolds of <hi>Venice</hi>
marry her every year, the <hi>Turk</hi> commits adultery with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:43725:16"/>
As for that Raillery concerning the attribute of <hi>Majeſty</hi> to <hi>Kings,</hi> beſides that
it is but of late, and that Court-flattery hath brought it into vogue; conſidered
truly, 'tis ridiculous; for 'tis no more then if a man ſhould ſayto one, May it
pleaſe <hi>your ſoul, your mind,</hi> or <hi>your memory.</hi> But to fight with Cuſtom is folly; ſince
that in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Vulgar Ceremonies are ſuch, that <hi>Lordſhip</hi> is but Civility to a
<hi>Tranſlator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis a mighty lechery ſome men have to do things croſs to others, were it but for
the beginning of a Book, or the ending of it. But for <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s, 'tis done according to
his deſire, beginning with his entrance into Shepherdry, though he had lov'd <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
long before.</p>

               <p>MY Author had incurr'd the diſpleaſure of ſome Ladies, for (as they

                  <hi>Carmelin</hi>'s relation of his and his Maſters adventures at <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s, is (conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his perſon) very good, and that he is not always of the ſame opinion as his
Maſter. But where it's ſaid, that, <hi>In the mean time</hi> Lyſis, <hi>to whom it is now time to
return, riſe with much diſquiet;</hi> 'tis a manner of ſpeaking very frequent in our Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
where you find, <hi>We leave him where he is;</hi> and, <hi>See what ſuch a one does.
Lyſander's</hi> Hiſtory in every page hath it: <hi>Let's now return to</hi> Caliſta; <hi>We have
left</hi> Ambriſa <hi>at</hi> Paris; <hi>We have left</hi> Lyſander <hi>in</hi> Holland. There's no artifice in
this, and 'tis to ſuppoſe the Reader of a very weak memory, and betrays the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
weakneſs that cannot faſten things more handſomly together.</p>
               <p>That Triumph wherein <hi>Carmelin</hi> repreſents <hi>Bacchus,</hi> is like that which the Poets
celebrate him for, who ſay he was the firſt conquered the <hi>Indies:</hi> but his greateſt
glory was, that all his voyage he ſcorn'd to drink water. But that which <hi>Lyſis</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
at in this Ceremony, is, that the old cuſtoms are not punctually obſerv'd;
which he would not have violated, not only in this, but alſo in all other things, as
his Triumph, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But I cannot but hug that deſign of his of ſending for the <hi>Muſes.</hi> For their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
you muſt note there were at firſt but <hi>three,</hi> but how they came to be <hi>nine</hi> I'll
tell you. The people of <hi>Sicyon</hi> deſirous to have their Statues to place in <hi>Apollo</hi>'s
Temple, employed about it three Statuaries, thinking to chooſe the three beſt done:
but it happened they were ſo well, that they knew not whhich to refuſe, and ſo they
were all nine conſecrated in the Temple of the God of Poetry; and to make the
people believe there were really nine, <hi>Heſiod</hi> and a ſort of Poets found them all
names. For their <hi>chaſtity,</hi> it cannot be much, ſince they have inſpired all the laſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Poets that ever have been. But that Fable of their <hi>Fountain</hi> made by a horſes
hoof, 'tis ſuch an impertinence, as I cannot tell how it hath hitherto been ſwallow'd;
for what vertue can there be in a Beaſt to make men Poets? It had been more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to ſay, that thoſe who drank of that fountain became horſes, or rather
aſſes.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s carrying away of his Miſtreſs, 'tis an ordinary Romantick humour.
Young Wenches run away and wander forreſts and deſarts with their Lovers, as
if they were brothers and ſiſters, yet muſt be thought honeſt, nay though they fall
into the hands of robbers and pyrats. But <hi>Lyſis</hi> would not have Lovers live like
<hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno. Natalis Comes</hi> tels us how <hi>Jupiter</hi> came to lie with this ſiſter of
his the firſt time: He chang'd himſelf into a <hi>Cuckow,</hi> and it being a great ſhowre
<pb facs="tcp:43725:17"/>
of rain, fled into <hi>Juno's</hi> lap; but ſhe hiding him under her coats, he in the mean
time got her with childe, and could not but for ſhame marry her. 'Tis true,
<hi>Jupiter</hi> might very well be a <hi>Cuckow,</hi> for he was always in ſome other birds
neſt.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Lyſis</hi> diſcovers a moſt ridiculous humor of the Romances, where you have
a ſilly young girl, that haply was never out of her mothers ſight, upon the firſt
of a Lover, become ſo bold, that ſhe will travel all over the world with him; and
in all theſe travels, there muſt be thoſe that will infallibly entertain them, as if they
had planted their ſtages beforehand; and if they build Sconces any where, they are

                  </hi> which <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſaies was torn in pieces by her Lovers: This
Laſs had two Suitors, <hi>Straton</hi> and <hi>Caliſthenes;</hi> ſhe having choſen <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> the
other ſeem'd to comply ſo far, that he was invited to the Wedding: But as <hi>Ariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi>
was ſacrificing, he brought a ſort of <hi>Ruffians</hi> to carry her away; at which
<hi>Caliſthenes</hi> being alarm'd, laid hold on her. Which <hi>Straton</hi> ſeeing, put in too, and
between them they ſo drew, that each of them had both too much and too little
of her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſis</hi> is ſomewhat troubled that <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Anſelme</hi> marry before the end of
the Book, and that they are not all married on a day. That marrying all of a day
<hi>Clarimond</hi> needed not ſo much to have laugh'd at: for your <hi>Romantick Shepherds</hi>
being all <hi>Beggars,</hi> ſuch a thing might happen, if they came to ſome good houſe,
where after good drink and victuals, 'twas eaſie to bring them into the humour, as
being ſuch as of whom it might be ſaid, when they caper'd in a dance, that all their
worldly wealth was in the Ayr. But for <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Hiſtory, that treats of perſons
of Quality, to have all match'd of a day, and that in the Chappel of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> was
a little extravagant. But Romances can do more; they can raiſe Armies, and
conquer Kingdoms in as little time: yet a man may fain a thing ſo, as not to be
openly tax'd for a Lyar.</p>
               <p>As for what is done by <hi>Lyſis</hi> at <hi>Hiccans</hi> Marriage, if any ſee not the wit of it,
'tis becauſe they are not acquainted with <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as he was.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Adrian's</hi> looſing of his hearing at <hi>Hircans,</hi> 'tis not ſo ſtrange. I can
tell you of one that was perſwaded out of his fight. Three <hi>Italians</hi> were at Cards
at an Ordinary at <hi>Venice:</hi> One having loſt all his money, went to bed, with his
mouth full of curſes and blaſphemies, leaving the other two at play: Theſe two
having given over play, would needs make ſome ſport with the third, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the loſs of his money was faſt aſleep. They put out fire and candle,
and began to quarrel about the game; one ſwore 'twas ſo, the other, 'twas not,
making ſuch a noiſe that the other awoke, and looking up and ſeeing no candle,
thought they had ſpoke in their ſleep, and ſo laid him down again. But they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling,
and making greater noiſe then before, he looks up again, and being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
awake, What, ſays he, do you play in the dark? In the dark! ſay one; what
are you blinde? do you not ſee we have two candles? With that, rubbing his
eyes, I can ſee neither you nor the candles, ſays he. Sure he hath loſt his ſight,
ſays one; and withal going to the bed ſide, made as if he were amaz'd. Bring the
candle hither, ſaies he, look, his eyes ſeem as if there were ſome film over them:
But it may be he does but counterfeit, or imagine himſelf blinde. With that he
ſwore he ſaw nothing; and withal calling to minde his curſing and blaſphemies
over night, he was perſwaded God had ſo puniſh'd him for it, whereupon he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to weep. They advis'd him to vow a Pilgrimage to <hi>Loretto,</hi> which he kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his bed, did, promiſing her Ladiſhip two ſilver eyes, if he recovered his.
This done, one of his Companions brought a Candle lighted out of another room,
whereupon they laugh at him. He was ſo aſtoniſh'd at it, that he could not ſo
much as ſpeak; nevertheleſs, his Companions told him, he muſt accompliſh his
vows, ſince he had obtained his deſire. Now if a <hi>Gameſter,</hi> one whoſe wit is
<pb facs="tcp:43725:17"/>
more refin'd then other ordinary men, and an <hi>Italian,</hi> could be thus perſwaded,
why not ſuch an Animal as <hi>Adrian,</hi> whoſe underſtanding was of no greater lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
then his profeſſion; for as for what miracles are told him of <hi>Hircan</hi> and
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> his judgement is ſo ſtrong, that he knows not whether be ought to believe
them or not.</p>

               <p>HEre we have <hi>Lyſis</hi> relating his adventures to his Couſin, wherein though he
have an excellent gift of invention, and applyes things handſomely; yet
any action that relates to ſome old fable, he thinks he may venture on as
a thing will be granted him. But that natural and Citizen-like perſwaſion of <hi>Adrians</hi>
to him thereupon to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> pleaſes me extreamly, where he tells him, that
there he ſhall not need fear Monſters, or any thing of that nature.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we have a many caſts of <hi>Carmelius</hi> learning Common-places, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs

the beſt, deſcends into the field of his Eloquence, deſcribing the City and the
Country life. But <hi>Clarimond</hi> now intends to diſſolve the enchantment, as being
weary of abuſing ſo long, one whom they ſhould rather endeavor to convince of
his extravagant opinions. However, <hi>Lyſis</hi> intends to make his party good; you
ſee what inventions he can finde to live, though he loſt all his eſtate. He thinks
he deſerves entertainment as well as thoſe his Authors quote, and I think ſo too.
As for his exhortation to Patience in Adverſities, you muſt note he was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with <hi>Celadon,</hi> who upon the diſdain of his Miſtreſs, lived a great
while on herbs like a beaſt, though he were not two miles from his own
houſe.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Lyſis</hi> feigning himſelf dead, I think him wiſer then many other Lovers,
who have kill'd themſelves through the cruelty of their Miſtreſſes. Had not <hi>Iphic</hi>
better have done ſo, then hang'd himſelf at her door; or the <hi>Baſilius</hi> in <hi>Don Quixot,</hi>
that pretended to ſtab himſelf before his Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>The main deſign of all Poets is, to celebrate their Miſtreſſes; and that is it made
<hi>Fontenay</hi> ſay, that <hi>Pernella</hi> ſhould be more famous then <hi>Laura.</hi> But why all the
Poets compare themſelves to Swans, thoſe ſweet ſinging birds I know not; but I
believe, that the ſinging of that bird ſo melodiouſly before his death, may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
among the <hi>Vulgar Errors;</hi> and he that firſt advanc'd it, did it upon no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fontenay</hi>'s deſire to change wives with <hi>Adrian,</hi> furniſhes <hi>Lyſis</hi> with excellent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of Antiquity, who knew there had been ſome Republikes where ſuch a
thing had been permitted. <hi>Meliantes</hi> and <hi>Hircan</hi> not only imitate but exceed our
Romances.</p>
               <p>You ſee how much my Author ſtudies to make all things natural; why may not
<hi>Adrian,</hi> who is a Citizen, be much more jealous and tender of his <hi>Pernella,</hi> as
<hi>Menelaus</hi> was of <hi>Helen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſi</hi>'s feigned death is very well acted, <hi>Carmelin</hi> doth alſo his part; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he will not always borrow of his Common-places, I think that about Cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourning
is his own, if he have not ſeen it in ſome Manuſcript; but <hi>Hircan</hi>'s jeſt
about one laughing on the wheel, he that knows that in other Countrys Malefactors
are broken with an iron bar upon a wheel, ſees it.</p>
               <p>Then follow ſome excellent conſiderations about the burying or burning of dead
bodies; wherein though <hi>Philiris</hi> play the Poet, the Shepherd, and the Heathen
altogether, yet ſeems he to quote ſomewhat out of Doctor <hi>Charon,</hi> who ſays,
that the moſt diſhonorable way to mankinde of diſpoſing dead bodies, is that of
<pb facs="tcp:43725:18"/>
burying them; and the moſt honorable, that of burning them: that the earth is
the dregs and ordure of the Elements, the ſink of the world, and mother of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
I cannot conceive the reaſon why <hi>Charron</hi> ſhould thus abuſe the poor
Earth: nor why he ſhould ſay, we have no parts we ought to be aſhamed of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to ſhew the inclination he had to aſſert that Paradox, <hi>That women ought to
go naked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Poets tell us, their Miſtreſſes make them dye, and that they raiſe them again;
and therefore that <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſhould think ſo, is not ſo extravagant. Beſides, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> rais'd up <hi>Hippolitus.</hi> Why ſhould not <hi>Charite,</hi> who is a Sun her
ſelf, do as much as that ſon of <hi>Apollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſays, That <hi>Love</hi> led his ſoul into Hell, wherein he differs from ſome of his
ancient Maſters; who affirm'd, that death divided a man into three parts, the Body
return'd to earth, the ſoul went to Heaven, or elſe was united to that of the
Univerſe, and there went to Hell but the Shade, which what it could conſiſt of,
I cannot conceive. Yet thoſe others that ſay the fouls go to Hell, tell us ſtories of
Shades, enough to diſcover the contradictions of Poetry: but why a ſoul ſhould
be call'd a Shade, I ſee not; for being a thing of more worth then the body, and
that in its ſeparation it loſes nothing, it ought to have a nobler name.</p>
               <p>Nor doth the fiction of the Waterman <hi>Charon</hi> and his fare hold any more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
What need had this fellow of any money, in hell, where there is nothing to
buy? <hi>Pluto</hi> needed not this Poll-money, for the earth and all the mines were his;
<hi>Ceres</hi> and the other rural Divinities having no more then they neceſſarily took up.
Of equal abſurdity is that of <hi>Cerberus,</hi> the three-tongu'd Dog. Hath <hi>Pluto</hi> no
other guard then that of a Dog? but it muſt be thought there needs none in hell,
for the Devils need neither Dog nor Cat, ſince they keep no houſe, but live like
Philoſophers.</p>
               <p>Then is <hi>Lyſis</hi> brought before the three Judges, and by their order ſent to the
<hi>Elizian</hi> fields, where he rips up old Poetry and Fables ſo exquiſitely, that if all
Books were loſt, we might have all of this nature from him. He ſaies that the paſtimes
of the Devils are Cards and Dice. 'Tis true, quarrels, oathes and blaſphemy are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of them, and Avarice the Inventor; But the impatience is remarkable: But at
what is a Gameſter moſt impatient? Is it for the loſs of time in eating or ſleeping?
is't want of money? is't a years ſickneſs? No; 'tis when the candle is put out in the
midſt of a game, or when the Die falls down, and cannot be found.</p>
               <p>Now comes the famous <hi>Muſardan</hi> on the Stage, that excellent advancer of <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories,</hi>
and Courtier of the <hi>Muſes,</hi> who is wellcomeſt of all to <hi>Lyſis;</hi> one that
for ſport-ſake was admitted to ſome great mens tables.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Fontenay</hi> continuing his follies, give <hi>Clarimond</hi> occaſion, really to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<hi>Lyſis</hi>'s conviction; for that he had ſaid before, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
in his extravagance, in regard of the Felicity of Fools, 'twas only for a

               <p>THough there need not much be ſaid on theſe two Orations, the Objections
and Anſwers being ſo clear; yet to draw things to ſome concluſion, I
ſhall where my <hi>Authour</hi> hath been very liberal, contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.</p>
               <p>The War of <hi>Troy</hi> is by moſt acknowledg'd a fiction: and <hi>Homer</hi> grounded his Poem
on ſome old wives Tales, yet <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſays nothing of that, becauſe truth and Poetry
travel not far together. But he quarrels at the ſubject of his Books, which is ill,
and that grand fault, of not mentioning the cauſes of that war; for that he had
written any thing before, is but a conjecture; which yet <hi>Philiris</hi> makes the beſt
<pb facs="tcp:43725:18"/>
of, when he ſays, that his ſubject was well enough known in <hi>Greece,</hi> and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
he might begin where he pleaſ'd. But as to <hi>Homer's</hi> Country, which
<hi>Philiris</hi> ſaies is heaven, and that Poetry is the Language of the Gods, 'tis a little
extraordinary, though all Oracles were in verſe. For <hi>Homers</hi> ſentences, beſides
that they are ſuch as it may be were in every mouth in thoſe days, all ſects of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
have gotten ſomewhat out of him; as if he commend Vertue, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
a <hi>Stoick,</hi> &amp;c. Nor have they been more fortunate, that make him Maſter of
all Arts; or to ſay better, a Jack of all Trades. For to make him a Ship-Carpenter,
'tis enough that he makes his <hi>Vliſſes</hi> one: To ſhew he was a good Cook, he made
his Hero's turn the ſpit, and boil the pot, and in <hi>Vulcan</hi> he is an Armourer: This
was an eaſie way to be of all Trades; but it is to be thought, that Ignorance and
Pedantry were the Godfathers that gave him that name. That any Captains and
the like ſhould eſteem him, as if his works could infuſe courage, is as improbable;
and yet this is no great commendation; for <hi>Amadis</hi> hath ſharpen'd the courage of
ſome, whoſe unacquaintance with affairs kept them in ignorance of what was truly
military. And for <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who going into a ſchool, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Maſter for <hi>Homer</hi>'s Iliads, gave him a box on the ear, when he told him he
had none, 'tis no great credit. <hi>Alcibiadas</hi> was a raſh yong fellow, that affronted
all where he came, not ſparing the very Images of the Gods, the noſes whereof
he cut off; beſides that, it ſhews that it was in thoſe days a Book fitter for School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys
then Souldiers; and indeed it was fit a Schoolmaſter ſhould have it, it being
their <hi>daily-bread;</hi> as <hi>Hieron</hi> ſaid to <hi>Xenophanes,</hi> complaining of Poverty; That
<hi>Homer,</hi> though while he liv'd, begg'd his bread, yet dead, he maintained ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
men. And hence it came, that the Schoolmaſters have ever been his greateſt
celebrators. As for <hi>Hector</hi>'s leaving the Army in a fight, to go and deliver a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
that was unneceſſary, 'twas ſuch an abſurdity as <hi>Philiris</hi> mentions it not. As
for the fable of <hi>Circe,</hi> 'tis juſtly tax'd: for dawb as you will with <hi>Mythologies,
Ulyſſes</hi>'s lying with a Sorcereſs, will be a thing of ill example. As for the Beauty
of <hi>Helen</hi> and <hi>Penelope, Clarimond</hi> ſays what he ought, and <hi>Philiris</hi> anſwers as well;
but for the chaſtity of the latter, and that evaſion of the web, 'tis ſuch a poor
one, that ſo many yong Lovers could not but in ſo many years diſcover it. But
there are that ſay, that thoſe yong men, all enjoy'd her, and that thence ſprang
the God <hi>Pan,</hi> you have the credit of the Poets for the one as well as the
other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clarimond</hi> having ſpoken of <hi>Homer,</hi> ſpends not time on the other <hi>Greek</hi> Poets,
ſince it was but repetition; and ſo falls on <hi>Virgil</hi> the Prince of the <hi>Latine</hi> Poets.
That <hi>Dido</hi> liv'd not in <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s time, is eaſie to prove: for his Fables, they are
low enough; his Buckler of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> his golden branch to go to hell with; to
finde explications for them, were to no purpoſe. But <hi>Philiris</hi> deſervedly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
the harmony, weight, and fluency of his verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For</hi> Ovid <hi>and his</hi> Metamorphoſes, <hi>it hath been in divers places ſhew'd they are
not natural, and ſome modern, have been more fortunate; as for example,</hi> A
Player being to repreſent all conditions and perſons, having offended Mercury, in not
repreſenting him well, was by that God Metamorphos'd into a Looking-glaſs, that ſo
he might repreſent things better then he did in his life time. <hi>And that other,</hi> of a
cruel diſdainful Miſtreſs, who could not be charm'd by any complaints of her Lover,
the Gods to puniſh the one, and reward the other, chang'd this deſperate Lover into a
Loadſtone, and that ungrateful Miſtreſs into Iron, that ſo in ſpight of her teeth ſhe
might be drawn by him, whom before ſhe did avoid. <hi>To which if we adde the
Metamorphoſes of</hi> Marne, Morin, Synopa, &amp;c. <hi>we need ſay no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orlando Furioſo</hi> is a book hath leſs order yet then <hi>Ovid,</hi> from whom and the
other Poets the invention is borrow'd. You muſt not think <hi>Clarimond</hi> can quote
all the impertinences of any book, eſpecially of this; as where <hi>Aſtolphus</hi> rides to
heaven upon his <hi>Hypogriph,</hi> and there meets with St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> who
ſhews him all the curioſities of the place, having put up his horſe in a certain place,
where he gave him celeſtial oats. Yet is the Author among his Countrymen
<pb facs="tcp:43725:19"/>
call'd the <hi>Divine Arioſto;</hi> and ſo is <hi>Aretin,</hi> notwithſtanding all his filthineſs and
impiety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taſſo</hi> is not ſo confus'd; but his mingling together ſacred and prophane things,
ſhews him of that Country where they love vice, and allow impiety. <hi>Du Bartus</hi>
is not much behinde; but it muſt be thought his deſign was only to reduce the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
into neater terms then it was in: but methinks, being to ſpeak as a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi>
he might have omitted the Suns coach and horſes, and ſuch other <hi>Pagan</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities.</p>
               <p>Next comes up <hi>Ronſard</hi> with his Poems, Sonnets, Elegies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For his Sonnets,
they are alluſions to the old <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Fooleries, or elſe ſome traductions
out of <hi>Italians.</hi> But becauſe he is often quoted with his abſurdities in the text it ſelf,
we ſhall not ſay much here, only ſhake a little his hymn, wherein hee compares
<hi>Hercules</hi> to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> both as to his birth and labours. <hi>The three nights that</hi>
Jupiter <hi>made one, when he was to enjoy</hi> Alcmena, <hi>repreſent the number of years,
which paſt before the Son of God was born of his mother; That</hi> Juno, <hi>who ſent two
great Serpents into</hi> Alcides<hi>'s cradle, is King</hi> Herod, <hi>who to deſtroy the childe</hi> Jeſus,
<hi>ſent his ſouldiers to kill the children in</hi> Bethlehem; <hi>That it was thought that thoſe
two children were purely humane, the one being thought the ſon of</hi> Joſeph, <hi>the other of</hi>
Amphitruo; <hi>though</hi> Jeſus <hi>was the ſon of</hi> God, <hi>and</hi> Hercules <hi>the ſon of</hi> Jupiter: <hi>That</hi>
Prometheus <hi>unchain'd, is humane nature ſet at liberty: That</hi> Hercules, <hi>who ever
obeys</hi> Euriſtheus, <hi>is the</hi> Saviour <hi>of the world, who is ever obedient to his Father:
That the envious</hi> Juno <hi>is</hi> Satan (for ſhe <hi>repreſents both</hi> Herod <hi>and the</hi> Devil; <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
Amphitruo <hi>and</hi> Euriſtheus <hi>doe both repreſent</hi> God the Father) <hi>That</hi> Hercules
<hi>puting on the Garment of</hi> Iole, <hi>is</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>cloath'd with the humanity of his Church:
That</hi> Hercules <hi>and</hi> Atlas <hi>who ſuſtain the Heavens, are the</hi> Father <hi>and the</hi> Son <hi>who
ſuſtain the Vniverſe: That</hi> Charibdis, <hi>which ſwallowed one of</hi> Alcides<hi>'s Bulls, is
Satan, that makes a prey on one of the diſciplies of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>And laſtly, that</hi>
Hercules, <hi>who is burnt on a mountain, is our</hi> Redeemer, <hi>who offers himſelf up a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
unto God the Father.</hi> O lewd Poet! The Adulteries of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the
<hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> are they not fit compariſons? why is not <hi>Alcmena</hi> the
<hi>Virgin,</hi> and the Angel <hi>Gabriel Mercury?</hi> But that <hi>Alcides,</hi> who to ſatisfie his
luſt, diſguis'd himſelf, and ſpun with <hi>Iola,</hi> ſhould be <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is equally as
Impious. I am to note further, that he is ſuch a ſworn imitator of <hi>Homer,</hi> and the
Poets his Predeceſſors, that he omits not their greateſt abſurdities: for this is but
a patern of what might be quoted: for his deſcriptions and ſimilitudes, they are
as tedious as <hi>Homers.</hi> If a man be to get a little water boild, he tells how he clove
the wood to make the fire with, then how he kindled it and blew it, then comes in
the flame, that encircles about the Kettle, then the white ſcummings, then the
noiſe it makes in boiling, and this is your conſtant entertainment. This Poet would
finde a man perpetual Satyre, yet was the moſt renowned of his time.</p>
               <p>But if we catch Poets and Fabuliſts, we muſt not let the Mythologiſts eſcape,
who by their impertinences ſeek to continue the credit of the former, and would
have us ſwallow down obſcure and ambiguous fooleries for Divinity. 'Tis hard but
ſome alluſion or other may be found to ſave the reputation of advancers. <hi>Apollo</hi>
and <hi>Neptune</hi> build the walls of <hi>Troy,</hi> ſaies the Fable; there muſt be water, ſays the
Mythologiſt to make the morter, and when the wall is built, the Sun muſt dry it.
If they had put in <hi>Minerva</hi> too, it had been ſaid that it was to give them inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the <hi>Architecture,</hi> ſhe being the Goddeſs of the Liberal Arts: But for <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s
accompanying <hi>Aeneas</hi> in his battels in <hi>Italy,</hi> as alſo being at thoſe before
<hi>Troy,</hi> and her being hurt there; if you would put all <hi>Pedantry</hi> to the rack, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
finde any good explication. Thoſe alſo that ſhift off the abſurdity of Fables by
<hi>Synonima's,</hi> are we not any thing more oblig'd to; as that <hi>Helen, Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi>

Nay, ſo critical are they, that they find explications for the adulteries and abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of theſe pittifull Divinities; and ſo impudent, as to preſent us with them as
pieces of ſolid learning. Nay further, ſome in the defence of fables tell us, that the
<pb facs="tcp:43725:19"/>
Poets had read ſome parts of the Bible, and grounded them on ſome ſtories thereof;
as that the Chariot of the Sun, was that of <hi>Elijah:</hi> but they cannot chooſe but
be impertinent, that excuſe impertinence.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Romances,</hi> there is as much ſaid in the beginning of this Preface concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their impertinences, and that little entertainment that is in them, that we ſhall
not have much to adde. For <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Montemajor,</hi> the Paſtorals of <hi>Julietta, Daph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>is</hi>
and <hi>Cloe,</hi> and ſome others, my Author ſhall make good what is ſaid againſt them.
Nor does our <hi>Arcadia</hi> eſcape the quick-ſighted <hi>Clarimond. Aſtraea</hi> is a book hath
gotten great reputation, as coming out with the firſt fruits of more poliſhed lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
and that which hath continued it is, that it contains a many ſtories fitted to
the humours of all ſorts.</p>
               <p>Nor is what this great Antagoniſt of Romances ſayes touching the beginning of
the <hi>Argenis,</hi> ſo inconſiderable. The Verſes are alſo forc'd in; you find them fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
graven on ſtones, and any occaſion ſerves to foiſt in a paper; ſo that we
may think that the Book was rather made for the Verſes, then the Verſes for the
Book.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>D' Audiguier,</hi> the Author of <hi>Lyſander</hi> and <hi>Caliſta,</hi> one thing may be ſaid
in his excuſe, is, that he was rather a man of his ſword then his pen, as appears in
many of his Epiſtles; very <hi>Gaſconically</hi> bragging, that <hi>he made his Pen with his
Sword,</hi> to excuſe his ill writing. But his miſtake was, that having heard that Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ought to be full of miraculous adventures, he hath endeavoured to make his the
moſt monſtrous he could; by mangling of his adventures, abruptly leaving
things undone, and carrying the Reader into another Country, where he had left
ſuch a one, whom it was time to look after.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe that go into woods, and talk to themſelves ſo loud, that ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear,
it is thought a mighty ornament, otherwiſe ſo many would not have uſed it,
and that ſo frequently. The examples are obvious.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s interpoſition; that ſhe ſhould ſtir ſo much in a buſineſs which
concerned the whole ſex, for whoſe entertainment and diverſion theſe excellent
works are compoſed, wants not example, as may appear by that anſwer of a woman
to a certain book written againſt the ſex: <hi>That as the Lyon ſeeing a man painted
with his foot on the throat of one of his kind, ſaid, that if Lyons were Painters, they had
the ſame advantage over men: So did women but write books, they would make men as
contemptible as they make them, and would make it appear they are the nobler ſex.</hi>
And this was it cauſed <hi>Anſelme</hi> to give ſuch a cautious judgment, as being unwilling
to diſoblige any. But as for others, they may cenſure <hi>Romances</hi> as they pleaſe.
But what influence theſe two Orations had on our excellent Shepherd, appears not
yet, nor how this rare perſonage conſummates all his high and famous adventures.
But that is the work of the</p>

               <head>Fourteenth &amp; laſt BOOK,</head>
               <p>WHere in the firſt place we have him giving his good word for <hi>Carmelin:</hi>
but when he is demanded how rich he may be, anſwers very evaſively,
that he muſt needs be rich, ſince he ows nothing. He from whom he
had that, was alſo uſed to ſay, (though an ancient Gentleman) that he was young
enough when he was in health. But that humour of a Schoolmaſter was very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
who being upon clapping up of a match with a rich Citizen, and ask'd what
means he had, whether it were in lands or ready money, he anſwered, he had not
either, yet he thought himſelf as rich as any. This went very well, and 'twas thought
he had great ſums due to him, or that he was upon ſome project, or that he had
found the Philoſophers ſtone. But being ſtill preſs'd to declare, he told them, that
his riches conſiſted in the ſaying of one of the Seven wiſe men, who ſays, That the
only Poor man in the world is the Covetous, and the Rich is the Contented. It
<pb facs="tcp:43725:20"/>
was anſwered him, that if he had no other eſtate, 'twere well he went into <hi>Greece,</hi>
and marry ſome kinſwoman of <hi>Bias;</hi> for in <hi>London</hi> Maids did not marry with <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
nor yet <hi>Greek</hi> Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>The diſcourſe between the Hermite and the Shepherd is very pleaſant, and the
graces of it are obvious; the one being a ſimple devout man, that wore out no
other books then Breviaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other, one poiſoned with a pernicious reading, which
he was able well enough ſo to diſguiſe, as that ſuch a one ſhould not perceive it.
But ſince ſome have thought <hi>Lyſis</hi> prophane, I muſt vindicate him ſo far as that he
is not without example. <hi>Caliſto</hi> in the Comedy of <hi>Celeſtina</hi> ſays, That <hi>if the fire of
Purgatory be as tormenting as that of his Love, he ſhould wiſh himſelf the ſoul of a
Beaſt rather then that of a man.</hi> And his man asking whether ſuch expreſſions were
Chriſtian, or no: <hi>If I am no Chriſtian,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I am a Melibean; for I adore</hi>
Melibea, <hi>and believe in her.</hi> But theſe abuſes of <hi>Religion,</hi> the Ceremonies and
Saints of it, is ſo frequent in all <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Romances,</hi> that a man cannot avoid
them ſo are they beſotted, that they care not where they faſten their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Lyſis,</hi> you may perceive, is not wanting to make his party good, to prove
his <hi>Divinities,</hi> his <hi>Satyres,</hi> and his <hi>Nymphs.</hi> He hath <hi>Agrippa</hi> up, but <hi>Clarimond</hi>
clears him; yet not ſo, but his book of the <hi>Vanity of the Sciences</hi> comes ſhort of
what it pretends to; for ſome he hath only <hi>defin'd,</hi> and ſhewn what they were for,
whereas it was hop'd he ſhould have diſcovered the <hi>Vanity</hi> of them. But I wonder
<hi>Lyſis</hi> being ſo well read as he was, did not think on that <hi>Satyre</hi> which <hi>S. Hierome</hi>
ſays appeared to <hi>S. Anthony</hi> the <hi>Hermite,</hi> and was afterwards brought alive to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria.</hi>
It may be he thinks better to quote his own <hi>Metamorphoſis.</hi> But now is
the Enchantment to be broken up; now muſt the pernicious reading of ſo many
years, and the impreſſion it had made on <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s mind, (which was but too ſuſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
of all images) be rendred as contemptible as it had been pleaſant to him.
<hi>Clarimond</hi> by a ſhort relation of his life and adventures makes a great progreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
but when all he ſaid was confirmed by <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Hircan,</hi> ſuch was his
confuſion, that he had not what to ſay. Nor may this ſeem ſtrange; for I never
told you he was quite <hi>mad,</hi> but having good intervals, all could be ſaid of him was,
that he was <hi>extravagant.</hi> But <hi>Hircan</hi>'s proffering to ſhew him the dreſſes of the
Aquatick Gods, and the final revolt of the <hi>Shepherds,</hi> finiſhes the work of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.
Upon which <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſhews him many ſecrets concerning <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> and
that it was not conducing to <hi>Felicity</hi> to go in <hi>Shepherds</hi> habit; convincing him out
of thoſe Authorities which he himſelf eſteemed the greateſt; for ſince he believed
what was in <hi>Romances,</hi> he muſt alſo believe what <hi>Clarimond</hi> quoted out of them.
And thus is he made wiſe by the maxims of Folly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi>'s marriages need not much remark: Only as for the former,
where it was feared he might be as extravagant in his <hi>Philoſophy</hi> as in his <hi>Shepherdry,</hi>
'tis to ſhew that it was hard to cure ſuch a one ſo, as that there might not remain
ſomwhat of the old diſeaſe. <hi>Charron</hi> is now one of his Authors, and of him he'll
take inſtructions how to get children. In the <hi>Trial</hi> of <hi>Wits,</hi> there is a whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to ſhew how to get Boyes, and not Girls. But all is but <hi>Theory,</hi> and fragments
of Phyſicians, grounded upon Diets. But were there any truth in it, there yet
wanted one thing, which is of moſt concernment in generation of fair children, that
the married be both, as neer as may be, of a temperament. So that they ſhould firſt
have taught a man how to chooſe a wife <hi>moiſt</hi> or <hi>dry</hi> to his own temperament; or
elſe told us, that upon every marriage there ought to ſit a Grand-Jury of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians.</p>
               <p>And thus have I given you an account of this Hiſtory of the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis;</hi>
and tell you, that if you deſire to know what is become of the Perſons, you find in
the text what became of the principal: For the leſs conſiderable, we ſhall follow
the cuſtom of the Romances ſo much, as not to trouble you with any thing further
about them. All which when you have conſidered together, I doubt not but you
will ſoon reſolve where to faſten the <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>extravagance</hi> which this <hi>Shepherd</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:43725:20"/>
hath entertained the world with; for he doth but conveigh it from thoſe great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
the <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Romanceers</hi> that had lived in the ſeveral Ages before him.</p>
               <p>For my part, in the mean time I muſt acknowledge my own deficiencies, which
yet I hope are ſuch as have not rendred my Author unlike himſelf: And whereas
notwithſtanding what is here ſaid, this Book may be lookt on by ſome of a nature ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
and trivial, I am ſo bold as to tell them, that it is the moſt ſerious <hi>Satyre</hi>
and graveſt Work that ever came into the world, and of no ſmall importance: For
if in <hi>Religion</hi> we value ſo much Books that combat and overcome <hi>Errour,</hi> I ſee not
why it ſhould be a leſs acceptable action in <hi>Morality,</hi> to endeavour the eradication
of <hi>Folly.</hi>

white <hi>Taby;</hi> a pair of gray <hi>Pearly ſilk-Stockings</hi> on, and <hi>white Shoos</hi> with green <hi>Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fata

painted as the Staff of a <hi>Maſter of Ceremonies.</hi> So that conſidering all this equipage,
he was almoſt like <hi>Belleroſa,</hi> going to repreſent <hi>Myrtil</hi> in the Paſtoral of the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Shepherd.</hi> His <hi>hair</hi> was rather <hi>flaxen</hi> then <hi>red;</hi> but naturally curled into ſo many
rings, as ſufficed to demonſtrate the dryneſs of his head. His Countenance had ſome
features which rendred it gracefull enough, if his <hi>ſharp Noſe,</hi> and his <hi>gray Eyes</hi> half
<hi>aſquint,</hi> and almoſt buried in his head, had not made him appear ſomewhat gaſtly;
ſhewing thoſe that underſtood any thing of <hi>Phyſiognomy,</hi> that his brain was not

            <p>A young Gentleman of <hi>Paris</hi> having perceived him afar off, was ſomwhat aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
at his extraordinary garb; and diſcontinuing his walk, came and hid himſelf
ſomwhat near him, behind a haycock; where he was ſo far from making any noiſe,
that he hardly durſt diſmiſs his breath. He ſaw him walk with paces ſo grave and
meaſured as a <hi>Swiſſ-Captain,</hi> and heard him pronounce words with ſuch animation
as if he had been on a Stage: which made him believe that he conn'd the part of
ſome Stage-play wherein he was to be an Actor, as indeed they had a little before

            </p>
            <p>While he was in doubt whether he ſhould diſcover himſelf, or let his curioſity
be ſatisfied by other accidents, the Shepherd put himſelf into more different po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
then a Painter puts his boys into when he would repreſent ſome great hiſtory.
Sometimes he leaned on his Sheep-hook, reſting his right leg thereon; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he croſſed his arms, lifting up his head towards heaven, as if he begged ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with his eyes. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

my Pocket ſome Apricocks, whoſe skin ſeems to be interlined with Roſes: We will here
participate with a fraternal concord what the Gods have ſent us.</hi> I give you thanks,

I preſume to ask you what fair things you have there expoſed, and why you eſteem
them ſo highly as if they were Peeces taken out of the Cabinet of ſome Antiquary:
I had rather for the preſent that you gave me part of your ſecret deſigns, then of

            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> hearing all theſe not ſo common things, was unſpeakably aſtoniſh'd,

well that there is nothing gotten of ſuch people but blows, if they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted;

ſhould ſay any thing that were ridiculous, leſt he ſhould laugh; and put on a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
ſo modeſt, that the Shepherd aſſuring himſelf that he prepared him a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
audience, began to ſpeak thus.</p>
            <p>I put up my <hi>bread</hi> for the preſent, that I may entertain thee with my <hi>ſufferings.
Diſcourſes</hi> are more pleaſant then <hi>Banquets.</hi> Know then that this common <hi>Tyrant</hi>
of our ſouls, this <hi>God</hi> that is ſo little in bulk, and ſo great in power, (who if he were
not, <hi>Shepherds</hi> might diſpute, as to <hi>felicity,</hi> with the <hi>Gods)</hi> no ſooner obſerved me
in the world, but he deſtin'd me for one of thoſe Captives which he will have drawn
after his triumphal Chariot. Yet he alone could not have robbed me of my Liberty,
had he not been ſeconded by a fair Eye; who conſpired with him to make
him Maſter of the Univerſe. The incomparable <hi>Charite</hi> receives his pay, or rather
he hers, ſo to perfect the conqueſt of all hearts. 'Twas in <hi>Paris,</hi> that Epitome of
the World, that I ſaw that onely Wonder; when I was in a richer habit, but not
ſo noble as this I now have on. She dwelt about the quarter of <hi>St. Honore,</hi> and that
not without reaſon, ſeeing ſhe was honoured of all the World. <hi>Fortune</hi> with her
blind eyes denyed me often the means of ſeeing her; and it was only at ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
hours that I enjoyed that object, in paſſing by the <hi>houſe,</hi> or rather the <hi>temple</hi>
of that <hi>Goddeſs,</hi> but wanted the opportunity of tendring my <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>ſacrifices</hi>
to her. I paſſed by that way above ten times in an afternoon; and becauſe I ſhould
have been aſhamed that the neighbours ſhould ſee me ſo often, the firſt time I put
on a black Cloak, the ſecond a gray; one while I walked gravely, another with a
ſtaff, as if I had been lame, leſt I ſhould have been obſerved. When I would not
paſs quite through the ſtreet, I was content to poſſeſs my ſelf of a corner, and ſee
my <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> afar off, though the moſt commonly I could perceive but the extremity
of her Petticoat. But I did more then all this: when I returned from ſome part
where I had been at ſupper, I went out of my way three ſtreets, to go into hers;
and it ſatisfied me to conſider the walls that kept her in, and to ſee the candle in her
chamber; and if the glaſs appear'd more obſcure in one place then another, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it was ſhe that was near the window, and there I ſtood for to contemplate
that fair ſhadow ſo long as it continued. And though all this can be called no
other then a falſe pleaſure, yet I was neceſſitated to continue in this torment a whole
year; A torment more cruel then that of <hi>Tantalus.</hi> But theſe eight dayes ſince, I
have found the Heavens more favourable to me: <hi>Charite</hi> is come to dwell here,
where I hope to find greater means to acquaint her with my flames. The <hi>Shepherd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes</hi>
doe oftentimes retire into the groves, where the <hi>Shepherds</hi> may entertain them,
and yet no envious eye ſhall diſcover it, as it falls out in Cities, where a man is ſpied
and ſuſpected by every one. To proſecute therefore my <hi>Love</hi> with more <hi>liberty,</hi> I
have put on this habit, which I had wiſh'd long before, and am reſolved to paſs
away my dayes near thoſe fair <hi>Rivers</hi> with this little <hi>Flock.</hi> But that I may not
conceal any thing from thee, and that I may be known to thee as to a Brother, I
tell thee what I would not every body; and that is this, that my own proper name
is <hi>Lewis,</hi> but I have quitted that to take ſome <hi>Shepherd</hi>-name. I would have one
that came ſomwhat near my own, that ſo I might be always known; and ſometimes
I had a mind to be called <hi>Lodovick,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Lyſidor,</hi> but in the end I have not
found any name more fit then <hi>Lyſis,</hi> a name that ſounds ſomwhat, I know not what,
that is amorous and gentle. As for <hi>Charite,</hi> not to diſſemble, her true name is <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine;</hi>
I heard her ſo call'd but yeſterday by a Nymph. But thou knoweſt the
<hi>artifice</hi> of <hi>Lovers:</hi> We ſay <hi>Francina</hi> inſtead of <hi>Francis, Diana</hi> inſtead of <hi>Anne,
Hyanthe</hi> inſtead of <hi>Jane, Helene</hi> inſtead of <hi>Magdalene, Armida</hi> inſtead of <hi>Mary,
Eliza</hi> inſtead of <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Theſe old names ſound far better then the new, in the
mouths of the Poets. So after I had taken aſunder this name of <hi>Catherine</hi> for to
compoſe another out of it, I found by way of <hi>Anagram</hi> that of <hi>Chariteé,</hi> and there
wants only an <hi>[n]</hi> but all the letters are there. How many Laurels have I deſerved
for this rare invention, ſeeing that name is clearly the name of a Shepherdeſs,
and that lately there hath been a Book of Paſtorals made, which is ſo called?
Nevertheleſs I have been content to cut off one letter more, and to call her <hi>Charite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43725:25"/>
becauſe the name ſeems to me more <hi>gentile,</hi> and more eaſie to come into <hi>verſe</hi>
Wherefore henceforward there ſhall not be <hi>rock</hi> nor <hi>tree</hi> in the Country, where
ſhall not be engraved the names of <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Charite:</hi> nay, I wiſh I could grave
them in the <hi>heavens,</hi> or make the <hi>clouds</hi> receive the form of our Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters.</p>
            <p>But to ſatisfie thee more particularly as to the Jewels thou ſeeſt me have, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<hi>Shepherd,</hi> know they are things which I look on as moſt exquiſite favours.
For the little that I have ſeen <hi>Charite,</hi> I doe not think ſhe knows me: ſhe hath not
given me any <hi>bracelets</hi> of her hair, nor caſt <hi>amorous</hi> looks on me. For want of this,
I ſhall not forget my ſelf ſo far, as not to keep ſomething that comes from her.
Yeſterday as I came to <hi>St. Cloud,</hi> I ſaw her walking with one of her Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
In jeſting ſhe took a <hi>Pink</hi> that was in her breaſt, and caſt it at the other whom
ſhe met: I was carefull to gather it up, that the reſt of my dayes I might have the
pleaſure to kiſs that fair Flower which had touched thoſe fair Apples that are more
precious then thoſe of the <hi>Heſperides.</hi> After that ſhe took out of her pocket a peece
of <hi>Paper,</hi> which ſhe tore all to peeces, and threw away as a thing nothing worth;
yet highly eſtimable to me, who took it up, deſiring to preſerve whatever comes
from her. Preſently after ſhe ſtooped down, ſomewhat ailing her foot and hindring
her to go, and tore off a little <hi>peece</hi> of the ſoal of her ſhoe, which dragg'd along:
What grief would have ſeiz'd me, if I had not obtained that fair peece of <hi>Leather,</hi>
whoſe ſervice had once been to carry ſo worthy a body! Fate was favourable to
me: <hi>Charite</hi> and her Companion betook them into a houſe, ſo that I being left
alone in the ſtreet, preſumed to take up that rich treaſure; and what is more, that
my felicity might not be imperfect, I gathered of the <hi>Graſs</hi> which had received the
impreſſion of her divine paces. Behold, gentle Shepherd, I have all theſe things in
my cuſtody: Satisfie thy eyes with them, and obſerve quickly if they have not
ſome extraordinary luſtre; for I am going to put them up: 'Tis a prophanation
of them, to expoſe them ſo long in the aire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> wondering at the <hi>extravagances</hi> wherewith <hi>Lyſis</hi> entertained him,
could not withhold himſelf from ſaying to him; But what, perfect <hi>Lover!</hi> if <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
had ſpat ſomewhere, or done ſomewhat leſs decent, would you be ſo curious as
to keep whatever ſhould come from her? Who doubts it? replies he: ought any
thing that is ſo precious be loſt, when it may be recovered? I make a vow from
henceforward, to find me out a Cave ſomewhere hereabouts, where I will preſerve
all whatever ſhall come from her; and thither will I go every day, and there ſpend
whole hours in contemplation. You will never have done, ſayes <hi>Anſelme,</hi> if you
will keep ſo many things: How is it poſſible to get all the graſs that ſhe ſhall tread
upon? Let me tell you, you ſhall do well to content your ſelf with ſome part: but
your ſatisfaction would be far greater, if you could get her Picture, and that would
make you remember her better. Ha! that's excellently imagined, replies <hi>Lyſis.</hi>
It is true, I have ſeen in all Books, that <hi>Lovers</hi> doe always endeavour to have the
Pictures of their Miſtreſſes: But how ſhall I have mine? Where is the Painter ſo
skilfull that can draw it? A mortal man cannot fixtly look on her. There is none
but <hi>Love</hi> that is able to accompliſh this work, as he hath already painted her well
in my heart: yet I ſhould be well pleaſed to have her (if it be poſſible) in another
draught, that I might place it upon an Altar, and make it my Idol. Whereupon
<hi>Anſelme</hi> told him, that if he knew <hi>Charite,</hi> he might aſſure himſelf that he would
draw her Picture ſo as he ſhould therewith be ſatisfied. And indeed he ſpake truth,
for from his very childhood he delighted in Painting; An accompliſhment that
doth a man no hurt, though he doe not make it his profeſſion. <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſeeing that
he proffered him ſo great a favour, could not imagine that any mortal had ſo much
power and will to ſuccour him; and hereupon embracing his knees, ſpake to him
in theſe words: Pardon me, <hi>O great Divinity</hi> of our groves! if ere-while I could
not diſcover who you were: Now doe I perceive well enough that you are the God
<hi>Pan,</hi> that hath diſguiſed himſelf for to come and aſſiſt me in my <hi>Loves;</hi> and I eaſily
obſerve ſomwhat in you more then a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> ſeeing your Clothes are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43725:26"/>
like mine: Henceforth there ſhall not paſs a day, that I ſhall forget to pour
out <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>milk</hi> before your Altars; and every moneth will I offer you ſacrifice
of the fatteſt of my Lambs. Conſider well what you ſay, replies <hi>Anſelme:</hi> I am
not he whom you conceive me to be; I have no <hi>cloven feet,</hi> nor any <hi>tail</hi> behind,
nor <hi>horns</hi> on my head. And thereupon puſhing him from him, he was ſomewhat
amazed to ſee a man make towards them, crying as loud as he could, I have thee
<hi>Lewis,</hi> I have thee; henceforward I will ſhut thee up, ſo as thou ſhalt not any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
amuſe the world with thy follies. Their diſcourſe was interrupted by the
arrival of the man: who being near the <hi>Shepherd,</hi> took him by one arm, and ſaid
to <hi>Anſelme,</hi> Sir <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I pray afford me your aſſiſtance to convey this young man as
far as <hi>St. Cloud:</hi> You may have diſcovered that he is not ſound in mind: I who
am his Guardian, cannot but be more conſcientious then to ſuffer him to wander
thus from one place to another; if I were not, I ſhould be accountable to Juſtice:
I intend to bring him back to <hi>Paris.</hi> Silence, ſayes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> Let us ſtay a little here:
Good Couſin <hi>Adrian!</hi> give me but an houre or two, to ſhew you my reaſons:
This courteous <hi>Shepherd</hi> ſhall be our Judge: He is ſo perfect, that I took him but
now for the God <hi>Pan;</hi> and yet I cannot otherwiſe perſwade my ſelf but that he is
either <hi>Cupid,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> or ſome other God in the habit of Man.</p>
            <p>At theſe words the Guardian ſtayes, as having a deſire to hear what he would
ſay. Whereupon the <hi>Shepherd</hi> reſuming the diſcourſe with a tone ſomwhat elevated,
ſpake to him thus. Is it not a ſtrange blindneſs to blame the <hi>happy</hi> condition that I
would follow? The name of <hi>Shepherd</hi> is as ancient as the World, and <hi>Pan</hi> is the
firſt God to whom men have ſacrificed. Heretofore Kings children kept Sheep as
I doe; and for to learn how to hold a <hi>Scepter,</hi> they were before fain to hold a
<hi>Sheep-hook.</hi> The <hi>Wooll</hi> which we have from time to time at the ſhearing of our <hi>ſheep,</hi>
is like the Revenue that a Prince receives from his Subjects. The <hi>Gods</hi> themſelves
have ſometimes deigned to come down on earth for to be <hi>Shepherds:</hi> And if that
were not ſo, they ceaſe not to be ſuch always in heaven; for what are the <hi>Stars,</hi>
but a ſort of <hi>living</hi> creatures which they drive to feed here and there in thoſe vaſt
<hi>Plains?</hi> But as for us <hi>terreſtrial Shepherds,</hi> what is it that can be compar'd to our
glory? Could the world with any ſhift be without us? The Wooll of our Flocks,
doth it not furniſh cloathing to all the world? The Tapiſtry of Temples and Kings
Palaces, is it not made of it? Some may tell me, that men may make uſe of <hi>Silk:</hi> Is
that any noble thing in compariſon of the other? It is but the excrement of a vile
creature. What if I have made me clothes of it? It is only for every day; I will have
others made of <hi>Cloth</hi> for Holy-dayes. The fleſh of our <hi>Sheep,</hi> is it not the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
nouriſhment of men? If we had none, how ſhould we ſacrifice to the Gods?
Are not theſe creatures, think you, acceptable to them, when <hi>Jupiter</hi> would be
adored in one of his Temples under the form of a <hi>Ram?</hi> and was it not for a <hi>Fleece</hi>
that <hi>Jaſon</hi> and the <hi>Argonauts</hi> went to <hi>Colchos?</hi> This is to ſhew you, Couſin <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
that as our <hi>Flocks</hi> are very profitable, ſo is it a great honour to keep them, and
that no man indeed ſhould meddle with any other imployment. To what end ſerve
all the Trades in the <hi>City?</hi> Read the Paſtorals of <hi>Julietta,</hi> and you will find that
there was in <hi>Arcadia</hi> neither <hi>Councellors,</hi> nor <hi>Attornies,</hi> nor <hi>Sollicitors,</hi> nor <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;</hi>
there was nothing but <hi>Shepherds:</hi> We muſt be ſo too here in <hi>France,</hi> if
we deſire to be happy. Buy you a Flock, take Shepherds habit, change your <hi>Ell</hi>
for a <hi>Sheep-hook,</hi> and come your wayes hither to be a <hi>Lover:</hi> And doe not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
me to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> there to execute ſome <hi>Office.</hi> You may bring hither my
Couſin your wife, and all your <hi>Prentiſes,</hi> who will all be glad to become <hi>Shepherds:</hi>
You will find it a greater pleaſure here to laugh and dance to the <hi>Bagpipe,</hi> then to
take the pains you doe at <hi>Paris,</hi> in ſhewing of <hi>Silks</hi> and <hi>Stuffs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O heaven! cry'd out <hi>Adrian:</hi> What hath our race committed, that muſt be
thus expiated? Now I plainly ſee that the poor Youth hath loſt his ſenſes quite
and clean. Sir, ſayes he to <hi>Anſelme,</hi> I beſeech you, ſeeing he places ſo much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in you, beſtow your perſwaſions to bring him to himſelf. Whereupon <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme</hi>
taking <hi>Adrian</hi> aſide, tells him, that he had fully diſcovered his ſickneſs, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43725:26"/>
it was requiſite to comply a little with him, leaving him there ſome while longer to
entertain himſelf with his own thoughts; and that in the mean time, he deſired to
know who he was, if ſo be he had the leiſure to tell him. <hi>Adrian</hi> anſwered him,
that he would willingly doe it; believing, that when he had acquainted him with
the whole life of his Ward, he might be the more able to remove thoſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
which troubled his mind.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid ſo, they retired ſome diſtance from <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who being alone ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to <hi>ruminate</hi> on his <hi>Loves,</hi> not dreaming any thing of what they went about:
And <hi>Adrian,</hi> who was an honeſt man, but withall very ſimple, as moſt of your <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi>
are, and one that knew very little beſides his <hi>Trade,</hi> continued thus his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with much natural ſimlicity.</p>
            <p>That Young man whom you have now ſeen, is the Son of a <hi>Silk-man,</hi> who lived
in <hi>St. Dennis ſtreet:</hi> He had no more children; and hath left him ſo rich, that we
all hoped that he would reſtore our Nobility, and that we ſhould ſee in our race
a Regal Officer, who might be a protection to us. You know, there are many
<hi>Merchants</hi> Sons that are ſo: And though the <hi>Nobility</hi> contemn us, yet we are as
good men as themſelves: They are not able, as we are, to beſtow great Offices for
their children; and if they are ſo <hi>brave,</hi> it only demonſtrates their <hi>borrowing</hi> from
us. In the mean time they call us <hi>Sires,</hi> and they are not miſtaken; for indeed we
are a ſort of <hi>petty Kings.</hi> But to come to my Tale: <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Father and Mother
being dead, I was choſen his Guardian, as being the next of Kindred. He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
gone through his Studies at the Colledge of <hi>Navar,</hi> and coſt his friends more
mony then his weight. He was eighteen years of age, or thereabouts: I told him
it was time for him to bethink himſelf what courſe of life he would follow; That
he was not brought up to Learning, to the end he might idle away his time; and
that he was old enough to make his own choiſe how to diſpoſe of himſelf. For to
try him further, I asked him whether he had any inclination to be a <hi>Draper,</hi> as I am
myſelf: but he anſwering me, that he aſpired to ſomewhat more noble, I was not any
thing diſpleas'd at him. He tabled at my houſe, and I ſent him to certain Maſters in
<hi>Paris,</hi> who teach the Trade of <hi>Councellors.</hi> They are a ſort of people that are ſo
expert, that when a young man is to be received a Diſciple, they undertake to teach
him in one moneth all that he hath to anſwer, as if it were but to teach him to
whiſtle, as one would doe a Starling; ſo that of an ignorant <hi>School-boy,</hi> they ever
make a learned <hi>Lawyer.</hi> My Couſin ſtudied a year under them, and was ſent thither
to no other purpoſe: yet could he never be perſwaded to put on the <hi>Long-robe.</hi>
Inſtead of <hi>Law-books,</hi> he bought none but a ſort of traſhy books called <hi>Romances:</hi>
Curſed be thoſe that have made them! They are worſe then <hi>Hereticks:</hi> The books
of <hi>Calvin</hi> are not ſo damnable; at leaſt thoſe ſpeak not of any more Gods then
one, and the others talk of a great many, as if we ſtill lived in thoſe heathen times
which worſhipped blocks hewn into the ſhape of men. It doth not a little diſturb
the minds of young people, who as in thoſe Books they find nothing ſo much men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
as <hi>playing, dancing,</hi> and merry-making with young <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> ſo would
they doe the like, and thereby incur the diſpleaſure of their friends. Thoſe Books
are good for your medley-Gentlemen of the Country, who have nothing to doe
all day, but to walk up and down and pick their nails in an out-chamber: But as
for the ſon of a <hi>Citizen,</hi> he ſhould not read anything, unleſs it were the <hi>Royal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi>
the <hi>Civility of Children,</hi> or <hi>Patient Griſſel,</hi> to make himſelf merry on
<hi>Fleſh-dayes.</hi> This was my advice to <hi>Lewis;</hi> but he would not believe me: And
then you would ſay I had a fine task to command him to learn by heart the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drains</hi>
of <hi>Pybrac,</hi> or the <hi>Tablettes</hi> of <hi>Matthieu,</hi> that he might ſometimes rehearſe
them at the Tables-end when there were Company; alas! he could not endure the
ſpeech of it. That put me into ſuch a fury, that I went one day into his chamber,
and took all his miſchievous books, and burnt them: But he bought him others,
and hid them ſometimes in his Straw-bed, and ſometimes in ſome other place. I
could not hinder his reading of them; if he did it not at home, he did it abroad;
ſometimes he walked out into the fields with a Book in his breeches. At laſt being
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43725:27"/>
at a loſs of all patience, I intreated him in the name of all his good kinsfolks and
friends, to tell me what profeſſion he would be of. He anſwered me, that I ſhould
let him alone, that the hour to think of that was not yet come; and that in the
mean time he would be a <hi>Stage-player,</hi> ſaying it was a Profeſſion that payed no
duties, and yet was very noble, ſeeing that although a Stage-player were of all
qualities and conditions one after another, yet did he not purchaſe any of them.
This reſolution of his I thought would have broke my heart, for I have ever loved
him as much as if he had been mine own child: but I found out at laſt, that all that
he had told me was only in jeſt. Yet he continued his <hi>pernicious reading,</hi> wherein
he paſſed over whole moneths, without ever going out of the houſe, unleſs it were
one half houre on Sunday to go to Maſs. He always locked himſelf up in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and came not to meals with me but once a day. I went ofttimes to liſten at his
door, and I could hear him make ſuch Love-diſcourſes, as if he were ſpeaking to
ſome fair Lady, and then a little after, he anſwered himſelf for her, counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his voice. You ſee now how he hath paſs'd his time at my houſe till this year,
which is his five and twentieth, wherein he hath made appear that his mind is more
fraught with hurtful imaginations then ever. My wife had about a moneth ſince pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
the conſecrated bread in our Pariſh; the Beadle that overſees that work had
brought her back the wrought cloth it was carried in: He got hold of it, and having
wrapp'd himſelf about with it, as the School-boys doe who repreſent <hi>Shepherds</hi> in
the Colledge-Comedies, he began to repeat <hi>verſes</hi> in my chamber, beholding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the Looking-glaſs, to ſee if he acted his his part handſomly. I came to him
while he was in this poſture, and jeered him ſo much, as if he had own'd any ſhame,
he had repented him of what he had done. It hath been his ſtudy ever ſince, how
to counterfeit the <hi>Shepherd;</hi> and inſtead of a <hi>Sheep-hook</hi> he took ſometimes a <hi>Beſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff,</hi>
and ſometimes a <hi>Raſp;</hi> moſt commonly he took a <hi>Fork</hi> I had in my back-ſhop,
which was ſomewhat more commmodious for him, becauſe it was of a good length;
and he hath broke me two or three, by leaning negligently his leg thereupon for to
perſonate the <hi>Paſſionate Shepherd,</hi> as he once had obſerved at <hi>Bourgundy</hi>-Houſe.
At laſt he found out the means to make him the habit which he now hath on, and
hath ſtollen away from me to come hither, where he intends to play the Shepherd
in good earneſt, and act Comedies in the midſt of the field. 'Twere at leaſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
better if he were at my houſe then in this place, where his follies will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
to all the world. Thus far therefore have I gone: I learned he was come
into theſe quarters, and that he retired laſt night to a poor Countrymans houſe,
who hath help'd him to buy ſome ſheep, and hath ſuffered him to go abroad in his
new habit, without croſſing him in any thing. My intention is to carry him back,
and lock him up in ſome place, where he may ſee nothing at all, untill this humour
be over.</p>
            <p>You will get nothing by that, ſaith <hi>Anſelme,</hi> you muſt not go that way to work:
For ſuppoſe he were in ſome place where there were no Books that could give any
entertainment to his Extravagances, he knows enough already for to feed himſelf
in them, and in a Chamber that were no longer then a Perch, his mind would travel
500 leagues in half an hour; 'twere in this ſolitude that his imagination would be
in continual imployment. 'Tis better to let him enjoy company; for he will divert
and rid himſelf of many errors, which haply had not poſſeſt his thoughts but for
want of knowing how men live in the world. Let me have the tuition of him a little;
I have a houſe at St. <hi>Cloud</hi> that is at yours and his ſervice, and I will entertain him
the beſt I can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> thanked <hi>Anſelme</hi> for his courteſie, and told him, that come what will
on't, he would let him try, if he could prevail any thing with his Couſin. While
they were engaged in this diſcourſe, they came ſtill nearer and nearer St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> and
<hi>Anſelme</hi> drew <hi>Adrian</hi> with ſome importunity thither for to dine at his houſe, telling
him, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> muſt be left in the fields till night, to ſee if his patience would hold
out to ſtay there without the diverſion of any company.</p>
            <p>While they were abſent, the <hi>new Shepherd</hi> made his meal on the fruits wherewith
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43725:27"/>
he was furniſhed, and went and drunk at the River. Divers Country-people went
near by him, but there was not one that had the boldneſs to ſpeak to him; they
all took him for an Apparition.</p>
            <p>It was at length tedious to him, not to have any body to talk with: And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Flock of Sheep at ſome pretty diſtance from him, he drove his towards that
ſide, to paſs away the time with him that kept them: Though it was a luſty
Country-fellow, and that he obſerved his habit to be much different from his: Yet
he ſtick'd not to approach him, with a geſture as courteous as if it had been <hi>Celadon</hi>
or <hi>Sylvander.</hi> Courteous Shepherd! ſayes he, Tell me what are thy occupations
here? Doeſt thou think on the cruelty of <hi>Clorinda?</hi> How long is it ſince thou haſt
made any <hi>Song</hi> for her? Prethee ſhew me ſome of thy <hi>Verſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Shepherd, who underſtood no more of theſe Elegancies, then if he had
ſpoken to him in ſome barbarous tongue, was very much amaz'd at his mode, not
knowing what kind of perſon he was. However comprehending his diſcourſe the
beſt he could: I know not what you tell me of <hi>Cock d' Inde;</hi> As for a Song, I
bought one the other day at <hi>Paris</hi> at the <hi>New-bridge end;</hi> And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for Verſes, if
you mean thoſe at the beginning of <hi>Maſs,</hi> I think I can tell one or two. <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at this anſwer with a kind of diſdain, which in him was a ſomewhat natural
gracefulneſs, ſaid to him, How <hi>Shepherd?</hi> doſt not thou know yet what <hi>Verſes</hi> are?
Muſt not all <hi>Shepherds</hi> be <hi>Poets?</hi> Haſt thou obſerved any in the hiſtories that have
not been ſo? Haſt not thou obſerved that they ought to make Verſes in talking;
and that it ſhould be as eaſie for them, as Proſe to other people? Otherwiſe how
could they expreſs their ſufferings to their <hi>Shepherdeſſes</hi> upon all occaſions by a <hi>Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
Roundelay,</hi> or a <hi>Madrigal</hi> handſomly ſung? But it may be thou art of the
number of thoſe inſenſible ones who deſpiſe <hi>Love</hi> and the <hi>Moſes.</hi> Can I ſay thou art
happy, if thou art of that humour? Yes, I may, for thou art not therefore expoſed
as I am to the charms of a cruel Deity. Alas! tell me, doſt not thou know the fair
<hi>Charite?</hi> No indeed, anſwers the Shepherd, I do not know thoſe people you name
to me. What, thou haſt not ſeen her then, replies <hi>Lyſis?</hi> Not that <hi>Charite,</hi> that can
no more hide her ſelf then the Sun? No, no, it is apparent: For if thou hadſt once
met her, thou wouldſt not have been any longer inſenſible. Avoid her ſtill, that
thou mayſt continue happy. She is at the preſent at St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> where with her <hi>looks</hi>
ſhe commits <hi>murthers:</hi> ſhe takes men and chains them up, puts them on the rack,
and plucks their hearts out of their breaſts without ever opening them: ſhe
doth not feed on any thing but <hi>Hearts,</hi> and carrouſes in nothing but <hi>Tears.</hi>
Alas, ſaid the Shepherd, (making the ſign of the <hi>Croſs)</hi> it ſeems you ſpeak to me
of a <hi>Witch!</hi> She may well be a Witch, anſwers <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſeeing one geſture, or one
word of hers charms all that is near her. All thoſe that have ſeen her, languiſh for
her: ſhe bewitches the Flocks, the Dogs, the Wolves, nay even the Rocks, which
ſhe makes follow her; the Plants doe not eſcape her, and it is only ſhe that cauſes
the buds of the Roſes to ſhoot forth, and afterwards cauſes them to wither away
through the ſame heat that produced them. Ah! how ſhall I have a care not to
appear before her, ſaid the Shepherd; for I am not ſuch a one as the moſt part of
the Citizens of <hi>Paris</hi> take me to be: They think I am a Wizard, as all thoſe
Shepherds are that live far hence: for I ſhould not have the power to defend my ſelf
from the wicked woman you talk of; I doe not know how they make Characters;
I cannot ſave my ſelf any way but by flight. Stupid fellow! replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> doſt thou
think to avoid what all the world muſt ſuffer? This great Univerſe which thou ſeeſt
will not be ruin'd but by <hi>Charite.</hi> Thou knoweſt how that in the time of <hi>Deucalion</hi>
all the Earth was overwhelmed with <hi>water:</hi> there muſt ſhortly happen another end
that ſhall be quite contrary, all muſt be deſtroyed by <hi>fire,</hi> and this <hi>Charite</hi> is born
to turn all to <hi>aſhes.</hi> What! thou wondereſt at what I ſay? How! knoweſt thou
not that I who am but her ſlave, have ſo much fire within my breaſt, that with one
ſigh I could burn up all this graſs; and that beſides that, I could drown all this
Country by a deluge that ſhould iſſue out of my eyes, were it not that the heat is
more predominant in me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:43725:28"/>
The Shepherd, who ſaw that <hi>Lyſis</hi> animated his diſcourſe with a ſerious manner
of ſpeaking, gave credit to all theſe miracles; and though he was as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
as if he had already ſeen the end of the world, yet had he the courage to
ask him who he was? I am a <hi>body</hi> without a <hi>ſoul,</hi> anſwers <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I doe not <hi>live,</hi>
ſince I have ſeen <hi>Charite;</hi> and ſhall not <hi>riſe</hi> again, untill her favours ſhall oblige
me thereto. Thou to whom I have the firſt of any communicated my ſecrets, go
and acquaint the Shepherds of thy village, to make their vows and offerings to my
<hi>Enchantreſs,</hi> to the end that if ſhe will doe them no good, ſhe may doe them no
hurt. Farewell friend! and make thy profit of my admonitions.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid ſo, he quitted the Shepherd; who was ſo much aſtoniſhed both at
the faſhion of the man, and his diſcourſe, that he certainly believed that it was a
ſpirit had appeared to him; and he thought it very long that the time of departing
was not come, that he might go and communicate this ſtrange news to all of his
acquaintance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> purſuing his way, came ſomewhat near the ſide of a Mountain: where cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to mind that in the Books he had read, the Shepherds did interrogate the <hi>Eccho</hi>
in ſuch places as that, his reſolution was to imitate them, and to conſult that Oracle
which he thought as infallible as that of <hi>Delphos.</hi> Languiſhing Nymph! ſayes he
with a ſhrill voice, I have erewhiles diſcovered my torment to all theſe deſarts,
haſt thou <hi>heard it?</hi> There was preſently an Eccho that anſwered, <hi>heard it.</hi> He was
ſo raviſhed to hear that voice, that he continued in this manner. What ſhall I doe
for to aſſwage my miſery? tell me, ſeeing I have already related my <hi>chance.</hi> The
<hi>Eccho</hi> anſwered, <hi>dance.</hi> Sing then, or whiſtle, or play on the Tabor, if thou wilt
have me dance, replies the Shepherd: but let us not fall out, friendly Nymph!
How is it that I muſt take my Miſtreſs, that my flames may be <hi>ſlaked?</hi> Eccho, <hi>naked.</hi>
What ſhall I doe, if I ſee one of her breaſts uncovered? ſhall I touch it, ſeeing
haply ſhe will be angry if I <hi>undertake</hi> it? Eccho, <hi>take it.</hi> That I take it, that's very
well ſpoken: I will go and ſee her immediately, that my pain may find ſome <hi>allay.</hi>
Eccho, <hi>away.</hi> Farewell then, my Faithfull one, till the next time: I'll go ſeek <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
where ſhe doth ſtay. Eccho, <hi>ſtay.</hi> Why ſo? thou bidſt me be gone, and that I
ſhould find comfort readily. Eccho, <hi>I ly.</hi> I think thou art a fool: thou aſſuredſt
me but now I happineſs ſhould <hi>ken?</hi> Eccho, <hi>when?</hi> Juſt now, ſycophant, haſt thou
forgotten? and doſt not think <hi>Charite's</hi> heart and mine the ſame chain muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go?
Eccho, <hi>No.</hi> Thou propheſieſt falſe: my Miſtreſs ſhall give thee the lye, and
make a fool of thee. Eccho, <hi>of thee.</hi> Of me! I believe not: what! ſhe will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
me: for ſuch miſhaps tell me ſome remedy. Eccho, <hi>dy.</hi> What kind of death
ſhall I chooſe, there being no ſuccour if her goodneſs doth not accord? Eccho, <hi>A
cord.</hi>
Ah cruel one! thou art deceived, or haply thou wouldſt ſpeak of the cord of
<hi>Cupids</hi> bow, that will ſend me an arrow will make me dye an eaſie death: Is not
that thy meaning? Eccho, <hi>No, no, I mean a halter to hang thee.</hi> This anſwer, which
was very lively, extreamly ſurpriſed <hi>Lyſis.</hi> Ha! what pleaſant Eccho is this? ſays
he: ſhe repeats not my laſt ſyllables, but ſays others.</p>
            <p>As he had ſpoken theſe words, <hi>Anſelme</hi> came from behind a long wall where
he had lurk'd, and preſented himſelf to him. 'Twas he that had all the time playd
the <hi>Eccho:</hi> but he did not diſcover any thing at all to him, though the other did
ſomewhat ſuſpect him, and queſtion'd him divers times. So that <hi>Lyſis</hi> who was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſible
to any thing, told him, that if it were not he that had anſwered him, he
had found a place where the <hi>Eccho</hi> ſhewed her ſelf very merry; and that in
all the Books of <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> he had never read of her ever being in ſuch a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
I do not know, ſays he, whence it comes, ſhe nothing but jeers now. Is there
not ſome impatience troubles her? Is ſhe not ſtill in love with <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> having
found <hi>Charite</hi> more beautifull then he? But rather on the contrary, hath not ſhe
greater cauſe to grieve, ſeeing <hi>Charite</hi> is not of her own ſex, from whom ſhe can
expect no ſatisfaction? Or perhaps doth ſhe not dote on her, and that at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſhe is ſomwhat extravagant? For my part, I believe it, or elſe ſhe muſt be
drunk. Certainly 'tis ſo, ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> and laughs! The Nymph <hi>Eccho</hi> comes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43725:28"/>
from a collation at the Tavern in the <hi>Heaume,</hi> where ſhe had drunk a little too
much <hi>Sureſne</hi> wine. But what an error are you guilty of, to believe that the Eccho
which anſwered you was the ſame Nymph that was in love with <hi>Narciſſus?</hi> There
are few rocks and other places in the world where there is any hollowneſs, but there
are ſuch voices as theſe: whereas ſhe that was in love with that fair huntſman, who
loved none but himſelf, lives only in a rock of <hi>Beotia,</hi> where her languiſhing hath
made her ſo lean, that there remained of her no more then the bones, which were
turned into ſtones, and ſpeech, which is heard there to this day. She could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
us at that diſtance; it muſt needs be, that in <hi>France</hi> and other Countries there
are ſome Demy-goddeſſes which drive the ſame Trade as ſhe. Do not believe that,
replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> ſhe hath a ready ſpirit, and hears well when one calls her, ſhe comes
preſently in what place ſoever it be. But ſometimes, ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> ſhe returns our
laſt words without ever being called, and it is poſſible ſhe may be called in fifty
places at the ſame time, how could ſhe anſwer all? But I will explain this to you:
Know that there were many Nymphs which were called <hi>Eccho.</hi> Firſt of all there
was ſhe that loved <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> which for certain was changed into Voice, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
thoſe that travel in the Country where ſhe was metamorphoſed. Beſide that
there was one, an excellent Muſitian, and which we may rank among the antient <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomimes</hi>
who counterfeited the ſpeech of all men, the cry of all beaſts, and the chirp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all birds: <hi>Pan</hi> fell in love with her, but could not obtain what he deſired;
ſhe moſt unworthily ſcorn'd him, and what is more, boaſted ſhe underſtood Muſick
better then he. That anger'd him ſo much, that he incited all the Shepherds to kill
her: They cut her body into infinite peeces, which they ſcattered through all the
world, leſt they might be recompoſed again. But the Muſes which had been her
friends, ordered that they ſhould all imitate all manner of ſounds, as ſhe did while
ſhe lived. <hi>Pan</hi> was thereby ſufficiently puniſhed: for whereas before ſhe ſham'd
him but in one place, ſhe doth it now every where; and counterfeits not only the
ſound of his <hi>Bagpipe,</hi> but alſo that of divers other inſtruments whereon he could
never play: Thence it comes, that there are few places where there is not a Voice
that anſwers us. But there is another thing worth your obſervation, which I am
going to tell you. In one of the <hi>Fortunate Iſlands</hi> there was ſometimes a very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Fairie,</hi> which having the tuition of the perſons of divers Princes and Knights
that were her friends, found out a means to aſſiſt them ſuddenly in all manner of
dangers, and yet not go out of her palace: ſhe by the aſſiſtance of ſome ſpirits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd
a great quantity of Air, whereof ſhe made many Conduits which ſhe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
into divers Cities, Mountains and Rivers, making them inviſible to all people;
and when ſhe was to acquaint thoſe ſhe affected with any thing, ſhe acquainted
them by that means, ſo that in a ſmall time ſhe gave them to know what was to
come, and gave them wholſom advices, and they could alſo anſwer her the ſame
way. But ſhe departing the world, there was no body could make uſe of her ſecret,
though divers <hi>Magycians</hi> had try'd what they could doe in it. It is therefore come
to paſs, through the injury of time, that by little and little her long Conduits have
been ſpent and broken to peeces in divers places; and when men ſpeak now, the
voice is carried thither, but it preſently comes out again through the holes, as if it
were ſome broken water-pipe, without going much further: If there be any places
where the voice is return'd to ſeven times, the reaſon is becauſe it goes out of one
pipe into another near it. Let us now put all this together, that in one place the
Eccho of <hi>Narciſſus</hi> anſwers us, and in infinite others the members of the Eccho of
the God <hi>Pan,</hi> or the Channels of the <hi>Conduits.</hi> You would have me believe that,
ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I ſhall ſooner believe that I flie like <hi>Daedalus: Ovid</hi> never ſpoke any
thing of this, you have it out of ſome <hi>Apocryphal</hi> book: As long as the <hi>Deſtinies</hi>
ſhall be imployed to ſpin out the thread of my dayes, I ſhall credit what the good
<hi>old</hi> Authors ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme,</hi> who was a very underſtanding perſon, and took it a kind of recreation
to contradict <hi>Lyſis,</hi> reſumed the diſcourſe to this effect. Doe not you now run into
a new folly in ſpeaking of the <hi>Deſtinies?</hi> You believe they have nothing elſe to do
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43725:29"/>
but to ſpin out your life: muſt they not alſo ſpin mine and all other mens? In what
manner do you diſpoſe of them? Tell me how they are all imployed. The firſt
holds the Diſtaff which hath the Flax on it, ſayes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſhe wets her fingers and
twiſts the thread: The ſecond turns the Spindle to wind it upon: And the third is
to cut it with the Sciſſers. Very good, ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> is not that a ſtrange abſurdity?
The <hi>Deſtinies</hi> being always a ſpinning as long as the life of a man laſts, can hold but
one ſpindlefull at a time, and yet there are a hundred thouſand lives that laſt at the
ſame time. Is it not the ſame caſe as that of the Nymph <hi>Eccho,</hi> which you think
anſwers all the world? He who firſt advanced theſe two things, had he not a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs
in his brain? and ſo many Poets as there have been ſince, have they not
been blinded and beſotted to follow him without any examination? Take another
doctrine that I ſhall teach you. The <hi>Deſtinies,</hi> whether they are in heaven or in hel,
are indeed charg'd with the ordering of our dayes to come, which <hi>fate</hi> hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed;
but they have neither Flax nor Spindle: They have a great Pannier,
where there are almoſt as many Silk-worms as there are men living on earth; all
the threads of them are drawn and placed on a pair of windles: The firſt turns it,
that it may be made into skains; the ſecond comes and cuts ſometimes one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
another, with the ſhears; and the third makes proviſion of new ones, in ſtead
of thoſe that are finiſh'd or cut. Now the threads which are drawn from one only
worm, are to wind the lives of thoſe that are of the ſame linage; and when there
is no more ſilk about the Bottom, it ſignifies that race is at an end. There is yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
thing to be conſidered, and that is, That for to determine a life 'tis not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
neceſſary that the thread ſhould be cut, it happens often that it breaks, and
then it is that we d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e before our time by ſome accident which our horoſcope did
not ſeem to portend. But it is to be obſerv'd that they are always the fineſt threads
which break, as it happens here on earth that the men of the moſt piercing wits
live ſhorteſt.</p>
            <p>I never heard any thing of all you have ſaid, then cry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d out <hi>Lyſis.</hi> You are an
<hi>Heretick</hi> in <hi>Poetry;</hi> you falſifie the texts of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and entertain us
with corrupt doctrine. Go elſwhere, and ſeek ſuch minds as you ſhall be able to
ſeduce: I am too firm in what I believe, to be ſhaken by your opinions, which
poſſibly are pump'd out of ſome modern Author, who is not followed by any
other.</p>
            <p>You are angry already, ſayes <hi>Anſelme,</hi> but there is a great deal more to come:
Aſſure your ſelf, that neither in what you have ſaid, nor in what I have, there is
any thing of truth. There is no ſuch thing as a Nymph <hi>Eccho</hi> that anſwers us: 'tis
our own voice, which retained in ſome concavity, returns again, as the light of the
ſun is retorted by the reflexion of the place where it caſts its rayes. Nor is there
any <hi>Parque</hi> or <hi>Deſtiny:</hi> and it is only the pleaſure of God, that makes our lives
longer or ſhorter. But we will diſmiſs that point for the preſent, and talk of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
whence there ſhall not ariſe ſo much conteſtation between us. <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who
would not ſeek the occaſion of a quarrel with a perſon whom he had much need of,
was very well pleaſed to change diſcourſe, and thereupon asked where his Couſin
was. <hi>Anſelme</hi> told him that he had left him at his houſe, where he had met a certain
friend that ſtaid him: but that he would neither ſup nor lodg there, though he had
much intreated him; and that he was deſirous to go to the Inn where he had ſet up
his horſe in the morning. <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſwore by the god <hi>Pan</hi> that he would not go ſeek
him there, and that he would go back into a little Hut which he had choſen for his
habitation: conceiving that <hi>Adrian</hi> would doe nothing but importune him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into the <hi>City. Anſelme</hi> anſwered him, that haply his perſwaſions might be ſo
effectual with him, as that they ſhould induce him to turn <hi>Shepherd:</hi> He ſaw ſome
likelihood of it: yet would he not return ſo ſoon, ſaying the ſun was yet too
high, and that Shepherds ought not to retire till <hi>Veſper</hi> which is their ſtar began
to appear.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſaid this, yet <hi>Anſelme</hi> ceaſed not endeavouring to get him away
immediately to St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> as he had promis'd <hi>Adrian:</hi> but he therein loſt his labour,

this Shepherd made a great conſcience of violating any <hi>Paſtoral</hi> cuſtoms. <hi>Anſelme</hi>
therefore being reſolved to paſs away the time with him, they entertained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon divers ſubjects: And among other things, <hi>Lyſis</hi> not being able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
his Love, ſtumbled on this. But thou comeſt from that St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> gentle Shepherd!
haſt not thou ſeen the beautifull <hi>Catherine du Verger?</hi> And preſently correcting
himſelf, and ſtamping on the ground with his foot, Ah! unhappy man that I am,
I have named her! wo is me, I have named her! ah indiſcreet ſhepherd that I am!
A Lover! whom reſpect obliges to ſilence: muſt I, ah! muſt I diſcover a fire
which ſhould always be covered with its own aſhes?</p>
            <p>What, is it <hi>du Verger</hi> that you love there? ſays <hi>Anſelme:</hi> I ſwear I was almoſt
in ſuſpect of it. But why would you conceal it ſo much? ſhould not I have diſcover'd
it at laſt? You have asked me for a Picture of your Miſtreſs, could I draw it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing her? Thou art in the right, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> with a countenance not ſo
ſad: And prethee, if I had not named that Fair one, what other couldſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
capable to enſlave me? However I muſt tell thee, that I ſhould have been
glad that none knew my flame, before her who hath cauſed it. That <hi>Beauty</hi> it ſeems
is yet ignorant of the hurt ſhe hath done you, ſays <hi>Anſelme.</hi> Doſt thou think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe?
anſwers <hi>Lyſis.</hi> Yet I am ſure my eyes have ſpoken enough of it; and all
the times that I have paſs'd before her, I have ſigh'd ſo loud, that I believe I might
have been heard to the other world. Henceforward, to give her clearer teſtimonies
of my love, I will always wear of her Colours, if I can learn what they are. Doſt
not thou know them? I do, anſwers <hi>Anſelme,</hi> I may very well know them, for I
do much frequent Madam <hi>Angelica's,</hi> whoſe ſervant ſhe is. A ſervant! replies <hi>Lyſis</hi>
all in a fury: what unworthy name is that for her that is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſtreſs of the whole
world! Say that ſhe is a Companion of the Nymph <hi>Angelica.</hi> I will indeed, Maſter
<hi>Lewis,</hi> I ſhall not fail henceforth, replies <hi>Anſelme.</hi> How's that! ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> retiring
three ſteps backward: wilt thou never make an end of affronting me? Knoweſt
thou not that I am call'd the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis?</hi> and that theſe names of <hi>Sir, Maſter,</hi>
and <hi>My Lord,</hi> are only for thoſe deſpicable people that live in Cities? I beg your
pardon, ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> my tongue goes before my wit: For to appeaſe you, I am
to give you to underſtand that the Shepherdeſs <hi>Charite,</hi> who is no more call'd <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine
du Verger,</hi> Companion, and not ſervant of the <hi>Nymph,</hi> not the <hi>Lady Angelica,</hi>
and Miſtreſs of the <hi>Shepherd Lyſis,</hi> and not of <hi>Maſter Lewis,</hi> hath choſen <hi>Red</hi> as her
moſt favourite colour: ſhe hath ſhoo-ſtrings of it, and ſhe hath Lace of the ſame
colour at her Busk, and 'tis not Carnation I am ſure of it; if you will not believe it,
go and ſee.</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Lyſis</hi> putting on a countenance inclining to a ſmile, came and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<hi>Anſelme,</hi> and ſaid to him, I believe thee, courteous Shepherd, my only aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance!
I thank thee for this ſignal favour thou doſt me! And as by chance the Sun
being near ſetting appeared all red, and made the clouds all about appear ſo too,
the Shepherd beholding it preſently cry'd out, It is eaſily ſeen that the incomparable
<hi>Charite</hi> loves <hi>red:</hi> The heaven, which honours her, will not be adorned with any
other colour; and if it be conſidered well, I believe Nature, which is not pleaſed
but in pleaſing her, communicates redneſs to all things that are ſubject to her: It
will be found that this year there are more <hi>red</hi> Flowers then <hi>yellow,</hi> or <hi>white,</hi> or <hi>blue:</hi>
There hath not been ſuch plenty of any Fruit as of <hi>Strawberries</hi> and <hi>Cherries;</hi> and
there hath been great ſcarcity of Apples, unleſs it be thoſe which are of a vermilion
colour. I meditate thereon ſomwhat that is excellent and rare, ſuch as never fell into
the brains of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> the moſt knowing Shepherd of <hi>Lignon.</hi> But it's enough!
let us return to the village, it is now time; for if I ſhould ſtay here any longer,
I ſhould fear the loſs of ſome of my ſheep, being not yet provided of a Dog for to
keep them. <hi>Let us go: behold the Sun lies him down in the waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme,</hi> who deſired nothing ſo much as to get him away, ſeeing him in a good
humour, led him into the way to <hi>St Cloud:</hi> And to try the ſubtilty of his ſpirit,
ſaid to him as they went along, But Shepherd! you have a ſtrange opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Sun: you think he goes to bed in the <hi>ſea,</hi> and that he repoſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43725:31"/>
there till the morrow that he ſhall riſe for to continue his wonted journy. That
indeed is it that I believe of it, anſwers <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and who doth not the like betrayes
much ignorance. Conſider then a little thus thing, replies <hi>Anſelme:</hi> Behold, the
Sun ſets on that ſide, and to morrow he will riſe on the other, which is quite op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite:
how is that done? There is as much way for to go thither, as he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch'd
before when he was above us: In what manner can he doe it, if he reſt
himſelf upon a bed in the ſea which the <hi>Nereides</hi> had prepared for him, or if he ſtay
a banqueting with <hi>Neptune,</hi> as I believe you imagine? The bed or chair wherein
he is, doe they go forward while he ſtirs not out of the ſame place? But beſides
that, how does he go to his <hi>Orient?</hi> is it athwart the Earth that he returns thither?
is that pierced through to make him a paſſage? We muſt grant it is ſo, anſwers
<hi>Lyſis:</hi> and though I have heard much talk of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> I do not believe there
are any other then thoſe we ſee when we look into a Well. I have not ſo great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
to your new Maxims, as that for them to diſcredit ſo many good Authors,
from whom I learn that the Sun paſſes over the night in the ſea: It's a thing ſo
univerſally received, that the <hi>Poets</hi> of this age doe not ſtick to avow it, though they
would diſſent from all that their Predeceſſors have ſaid. I will conteſt no further
with you, replies <hi>Anſelme,</hi> Clear but my mind of one doubt: If the Sun be all night
in the ſea, hidden in ſome cave, how can he communicate his light to the Moon?
for they ſay, that if ſhe be ſometimes full, and ſometimes in her increaſe, tis accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the Sun enlightens her. Oh the blind minds of mortals! ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Is it
not ſufficiently known, that whereas there hath never been but one Sun in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
there hath always been an infinite number on earth? and that at preſent there
is one that hath more light then a hundred thouſand others, which is the divine
<hi>Charite?</hi> Tis from her that the <hi>Moon</hi> borrows her light, and ſhe is much more
<hi>Sun</hi> then the <hi>Sun</hi> himſelf on high: ſo that when the <hi>Marigold</hi> beholds her, it looks
ſtraight up, and is raviſhed into an extaſie: It does not know on which ſide it
ſhould direct its yellow and languiſhing leaves, and which is the true Sun, that it
might follow it. Truly, ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> this is ſuch a new <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> as <hi>Sacroboſco</hi>
never imagined: And you are able to comment on the Great <hi>Shepherds Calendar:</hi>
you can give the reaſon of <hi>Ecclipſes, Comets,</hi> and <hi>Meteors,</hi> and all other natural
effects, without having recourſe to any thing but your <hi>Miſtreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this diſpute ended, they entred St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> and were preſently at the Inn where
<hi>Adrian</hi> was lodg'd, which was juſt at the Towns end: There was a world of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
met them, all being aſtoniſhed at the ſtrange habit of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and at the ſheep
which he drove before him: but no body durſt ſay any thing to him, ſeeing him
with <hi>Anſelme,</hi> who was there much reſpected, as being a perſon of quality. <hi>Adrian</hi>
who waited for them at the Inne-gate, received them very courteouſly, being very
joyfull that his Couſin came with ſo good a will. The firſt thing that <hi>Lyſis</hi> did, was
to provide a Stable for his Flock: there was one preſently aſſigned him, where he
locks it up, and afterwards returns to <hi>Anſelme,</hi> who was talking with <hi>Adrian;</hi> and
taking him aſide, put him in mind of drawing the Picture of <hi>Charite,</hi> ſeeing he knew
her, and had the means to ſee her often. <hi>Anſelme</hi> aſſured him that he had already
a Copper-peece for that purpoſe, and that he would not reſt till he had fallen in
hand with it. But I ſuppoſe it a very hard peece of work, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> For as a man
cannot behold the Sun but in a glaſs, ſo a man cannot ſee <hi>Charite</hi> but in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
her. Open my breaſt, <hi>ſecond Apelles!</hi> take out my Heart, her Figure is
therein engraved, That ſhall be thy Original. But what doe I ſay! I have no <hi>heart</hi>
at all: and though I had, thou wouldſt not commit that cruelty. Take example
from every thing that approaches the beauty of my Miſtreſs: I will teach thee how
thou muſt guide thy ſelf in they work: Make firſt thoſe <hi>fine twiſts of gold</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
her head, thoſe <hi>inevitable ſnares,</hi> thoſe <hi>hooks,</hi> thoſe <hi>charms,</hi> and thoſe <hi>chains</hi>
which ſurpriſe <hi>hearts:</hi> Next paint me that <hi>Forehead,</hi> where <hi>Love</hi> is as it were ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his <hi>Throne;</hi> below that put thoſe two <hi>Bowes</hi> of <hi>Ebony,</hi> and under them
thoſe two <hi>Suns</hi> which perpetually dart forth <hi>arrows</hi> and <hi>flames:</hi> And then in
the midſt ſhall riſe up that fair <hi>Noſe,</hi> which like a little Mountain ſeparates the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43725:31"/>
               <hi>Cheeks,</hi> and that not without reaſon, ſeeing they continually ſtriving which ſhould
be the faireſt, would ſometimes or other fall out, if they were not ſeparated. Thou
ſhalt make thoſe <hi>pretty Cheeks,</hi> intermingled with <hi>Lilies</hi> and <hi>Roſes:</hi> And then that
little <hi>Mouth,</hi> whereof the <hi>Lips</hi> are <hi>branches</hi> of <hi>Coral.</hi> If it were decent to leave
them half open, thou ſhouldſt draw her <hi>Teeth,</hi> which are two <hi>rowes</hi> of <hi>fine Pearl.</hi>
But content thy ſelf with this, and afterwards there is only the <hi>Neck</hi> to doe, and
her fair <hi>ſnowy Boſom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Anſelme</hi> had heard this fine diſcourſe, as he was a perſon of the greateſt
courteſie in the world, ſo he preſently conceived an excellent Invention as to this
Picture: and being impatient till he were at his own houſe to fall about it, he took
leave of <hi>Lyſis.</hi> When he was departed, <hi>Adrian</hi> believing that the folly of his Couſin
proceeded from over-faſting, had a mind to make him good cheer, and asked him if
he could not feed on a diſh of <hi>Carps</hi> and <hi>Pikes,</hi> becauſe it was Saturn-day. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
a little thereupon, and ſmiling to himſelf ſaid, The time is come that I ſhall
doe the gallantry which I erewhile boaſted I would: I will outvie the fidelity of
<hi>Sirenus</hi> and <hi>Celadon,</hi> and doe a thing that ſhall be eternally memorable. No, no,
Couſin, I am not for the Fiſh you have named: Let me have a Diſh of <hi>Gurnards,</hi>
ſome <hi>Salmon,</hi> ſome <hi>Shrimps,</hi> and ſome <hi>Beetroot</hi> or <hi>Carrets:</hi> And for, Fruits, give
me only Cherries, and Apples of <hi>Calleville.</hi> And doe not believe that this is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
myſteries: I will eat nothing but what is <hi>red,</hi> becauſe the fair <hi>Charite</hi> loves no
colour but that. Alas! what excellent myſterie is this? ſays <hi>Adrian:</hi> What ſhall
we doe, if we cannot find what you now ask for? I will rather ſtarve then eat any
thing elſe, anſwers <hi>Lyſis:</hi> the Dy is already caſt for't, I am reſolv'd. And ſo going
into the Kitchin; Dear <hi>Comus,</hi> God of banquetting! ſays he to the Cook, Let
me have what I have called for. <hi>Adrian</hi> being gone in with him, gave order for
the providing of <hi>Beet-roots</hi> and <hi>Crabs,</hi> for to pleaſe him; and ſo led him into a
Chamber where the cloth was laid. When he was there, he conſidered it all over;
and finding all painted with <hi>red,</hi> he thought in himſelf it was very well; but that
he would not lie there, unleſs they brought in another Bed, becauſe that which was
there was green: He went into another chamber, where finding a red one, he ſaid
he would have it removed into his own chamber. <hi>Adrian,</hi> who would not they
ſhould be at the pains to take it down, began to contradict him, and would have
him to ſupper without any further troubling himſelf about that. But he told him,
he would by no means hear of it, and ſo made unto him this fair complaint: How?
Couſin, are you ſo barbarouſly minded, that you will not grant a Lover a ſmall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
that he deſires? Ha! I ſee now you have a heart of ſtone, and that a fair
Eye never touched you: Would you have me commit this crime, to make uſe of any
other colour then that of my Miſtreſs? I will dye rather then offend that fair one:
if I have a thought guilty of it, it is a Traitor. But what do I dream on, ſtupid man
that I am! I wear the ſame colour as the bed in my chamber, which I will preſently
be rid of: ſhall it be ſaid that I preſerve it? No, no, my fortitude ſhew thy ſelf!
While he ſaid this, he took his <hi>Sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-ſtrings,</hi> which were green, and caſt them out at
the window: As for Garters, he had not any, for his Breeches came down below
the calf of his leg. Alas, what folly is this! ſays <hi>Adrian:</hi> why doe you caſt away
thoſe Strings, which might well have ſerved one of my little children? Now you
talk of Love, we ſhall have ſomwhat to doe with you: if you will have all <hi>red,</hi> you
muſt always have <hi>Dyers</hi> at your breech, or elſe you muſt have your train after you
like ſome great man. Cannot one ſleep as well in a <hi>green</hi> bed as another? O Couſin!
ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> how extreamly are you miſtaken! and all becauſe you have not read good
<hi>Authors:</hi> I am confident you never medled with my <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> and that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read any thing but your <hi>Shop-books.</hi> Cannot you judge by what charms I am
forced to have an averſion to this <hi>green</hi> bed? Beſides that it is not of my Miſtreſſes
colour, doe not you ſee that <hi>green</hi> is deſpiſed for many reaſons? As long as Fruits
are <hi>green,</hi> they are not fit to be eaten; while the Wheat is <hi>green,</hi> it is not ready for
the ſickle: Thoſe which are defeated in a buſineſs, wear the <hi>green</hi> Bonnet; and
out of a certain contempt, all your <hi>Cloſe-ſtool</hi> cuſhions are of <hi>green</hi> Serge. But that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43725:32"/>
which is moſt conſiderable, <hi>Green</hi> is the colour which the <hi>Turks</hi> honour, and we
muſt hate what thoſe people love, as being bruit beaſts who know nothing of <hi>Love,</hi>
or a <hi>Shepherds</hi> life. As for <hi>red,</hi> the amiable colour, the fleſh and blood which
ſuſtain our life are of it, the lips and cheeks of <hi>Charite</hi> wear it. That is the reaſon
<hi>I</hi> deſire that even my <hi>Sheets,</hi> my <hi>Table-cloaths,</hi> my <hi>Napkias,</hi> my <hi>Shirts,</hi> and my
<hi>Handkerchiffs</hi> might be <hi>red,</hi> if poſſible.</p>
            <p>As he ſaid ſo, there ſtood behind him a little <hi>Bar-boy,</hi> that had a Napkin on his
arm, and a little light Cap on: who asked him, Sir! would not you have a <hi>red Noſe</hi>
too? We have good wine in the houſe to <hi>paint</hi> it withall. At which <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſmiling,
anſwered, Thou wouldſt laugh, little <hi>Foot-boy</hi> of <hi>Ganymedes!</hi> Obſerve what <hi>I</hi> ſay,
and bring me ſomebody to change the Bed. This is handſom: For Gods ſake,
ſays <hi>Adrian,</hi> let him have his will.</p>
            <p>There came preſently two Servant-maids, who took down the Cuatains and Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
of both Beds, and put the <hi>red</hi> into the Shepherds chamber. In the mean while
he fat down at the Table with his Couſin, and Supper was brought in: There were
ſome <hi>Beet-roots</hi> fryed, and ſome cold in a Sallad, whereof <hi>Lyſis</hi> fill'd his belly: but
as for the <hi>Crabs,</hi> ſeeing that within they were all white, and were only red without,
he left them for <hi>Adrian.</hi> There waited at the Table a good big Servant-maid, who
took the pot and the glaſs for to give him to drink: but he perceiving it was white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine
that ſhe fill'd, Take it away, ſays he, <hi>Nymph</hi> of the <hi>Kitchin!</hi> it is not of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite's</hi>
colour: Give me ſome <hi>Claret,</hi> fair <hi>Goddeſs</hi> of the <hi>Pottage-pot!</hi> or elſe we ſhall
not be good friends. Nay, for this time he is ſomwhat in the right, ſayes <hi>Adrian:
Evening red, and morning gray, denotes the Pilgrim a fair day.</hi> Men ſay that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the <hi>weather:</hi> but for my part, <hi>I</hi> apply it alſo to <hi>wine.</hi> Yet doe not caſt
away that wine, <hi>I</hi> pray, as you did your Shoo-ſtrings: we muſt not abuſe Gods
creatures. When <hi>Adrian</hi> had ſpoken thus, they took order that Claret-wine ſhould
be brought him, whereof <hi>Lyſis</hi> drank with much ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Supper ended, he began to walk up and down without ſaying ought to any body;
and at length his Couſin prevail'd ſo far with him, that he put off his cloaths and
went to bed. A while after <hi>Adrian</hi> went out of that chamber, making all faſt, and
went to bed in another. His <hi>Ward</hi> had found him ſo much trouble, that he fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep
as ſoon as his head was laid on the pillow: but it was not ſo with the amorous
<hi>Shepherd,</hi> who imagined that his eyes were little <hi>ſtars</hi> upon earth, and that they
ought to <hi>twinkle</hi> all night like thoſe in heaven.</p>
            <p>But he was not the only man that was awake that night in <hi>St. Cloud:</hi> there were
a many more, to whom his company had been very ſerviceable. That <hi>Shepherd</hi>
whom he had ſpoken to in the fields, had acquainted his Maſter, who was a ſtupid
Country-Clown, with all the ſtrange diſcourſes which had paſſed between them.
This fellow went and related all again to nine or ten of his own quality, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
thereof ſeiz'd a many zealous devout women. All the ſuperſtitious multitude
addreſs'd themſelves to the <hi>Shepherd,</hi> who repeated the ſame things divers times from
point to point: He not being wanting as to the relation, nor they as to audience.
He told them, that he who had come to him was ſo beautifull and ſo brave, that he
took him at firſt for an Angel: but that having foretold him ſo much miſchief, he
took him for ſome Devil, who had gotten ſome ſheep, and had a ſheep-hook in his
hand, ſo to appear leſs terrible, and make him believe he was of his condition. In fine,
all that we can judge of what he hath ſaid to me, (goes he on) is, That that curſed
Woman, which is here for to maſſacre all men, and bring the world to an end, can
be no other then the wife of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> believe that he whom <hi>I</hi> have ſpoken
with is <hi>Antichriſt</hi> himſelf, for he boaſts that he can doe great matters. As the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
had ſaid thus, there was one Country-fellow more reſolute then the reſt, who
drew aſide ſome of his companions, and remonſtrated to them, how that that man
ſhould not be credited ſo lightly, though he had always been of a good reputation;
and that the honeſteſt men did ſometimes lye, whether out of hope of gain, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
Upon that account they all went to him, and made a world of queſtions to him
for to try him. He ſeeing that they did not ſufficiently credit his diſcourſes, began to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43725:32"/>
weep of very grief, making this complaint. Alas, my good friends! what have <hi>I</hi>
done to you, that you ſhould doubt of what <hi>I</hi> tell you? <hi>I</hi> would to God it were not
ſo true! but <hi>I</hi> never lyed leſs in my life.</p>
            <p>Preſently a woman of the village, who thought herſelf the moſt knowing among
them, interrupted him, and ſaid, Alack my friend <hi>Richard!</hi> tell me all: Sayeſt thou
not that this old ſhe-Devil muſt kill all the men? Doubtleſs, replies the Shepherd:
<hi>I</hi> have been told nothing that ſhe ſhould doe to the women. Alack! what great
pitty it is, replies the woman: what ſhall we doe here by our ſelves? what's a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
without a man? ſhe is but a Spindle without Flax, or like an Oven without an
Oven-fork. 'Twere better ſhe ſhould take ſome of both, and that the ſhorteſt cut
were drawn who ſhould be eaten firſt. To theſe fair complaints the other Goſſips
added others, and that with ſo much weeping and ſobbing, that the whole houſe
where they were did eccho again.</p>
            <p>The Shepherd <hi>Richard</hi> thinking to comfort them, bid them not be ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
that they ſhould not be long without Husbands, for they ſhould go after them,
ſeeing the world was ſhortly to end. But ſhall that be by fire, ſays the maſter of the
houſe, ſhall we all burn together? If <hi>I</hi> ſhould put wet ſheets on the top of my houſe
as <hi>I</hi> did when my neighbours houſe was a fire, ſhould not <hi>I</hi> ſave my ſelf? <hi>I</hi> fear me,
ſays <hi>Richard,</hi> that we muſt be deſtroyed by water: methinks the viſion threatened
ſuch a thing. And as he ſpoke the word, a light appeared in the sky, which ſmit the
ſight of all that were preſent, and immediately it began to rain. Ah! we need no
more doubt of it, cry'd out a Waterman, behold the deluge approaches: <hi>I</hi> will go
to the river with a horſe, for to draw my Boat aſhore; if <hi>I</hi> can, <hi>I</hi>'ll bring it up
to the top of my chimney, where <hi>I</hi> will expect till the water riſe to that height, and
that it carry me where God pleaſes.</p>
            <p>As he had done ſaying ſo, yet without any great deſire to doe it, the Maſter of the
houſe's Son approving the invention, would needs practiſe ſomewhat that were like
it. 'Twas a Lad of ſome ſixteen years of age, of whom it might have been ſaid that
there were wiſer at ſix. Having gotten a great waſhing-tub, he made a ſhift to get it
up to the top of the houſe, and placed himſelf in it as if it had been a Boat. All this
he did without ſpeaking ought to any body, for fear ſome body ſhould diſpute with
him for the ſafety of this fine Veſſel. In the mean while the women altogether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs,
reſolved among themſelves to go to Mount <hi>Valerian</hi> to the <hi>Hermites,</hi>
and the men would doe the like, ſaying that the water could not ſo ſoon riſe to the
top of that mountain, and that till then they ſhould be ſafe enough.</p>
            <p>Thereupon they had an infinity of excellent conſiderations: A <hi>Churchwarden</hi> of
the Pariſh that was there, came and made this complaint. Alas! to what purpoſe
have we ſo much troubled our ſelves, my good Pariſhioners, about the repairing and
adorning of our Church? is it not ſo much loſt, ſeeing <hi>Antichriſt</hi> will convert it
into ſtables? Ah! how ſhould we have ſpared that pains, if we had known the
world ſhould end ſo ſoon? <hi>I</hi> who have quite new built my houſe, and have faſted
ſo much to ſpare ſomewhat, had it not been better that <hi>I</hi> had enjoyed what God
hath ſent me? Ah! how doth man purpoſe, and God diſpoſe! And you that dreſs
the Vineyards, and have planted ſo many Stocks, you ſhall not drink of the wine, but
the dog of Antichriſt ſhall devour it. Ought <hi>I</hi> not to think that he will ſhortly come,
ſeeing that when <hi>I</hi> went a while ſince to <hi>Paris</hi> with ſome Apricocks to my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
<hi>I</hi> heard <hi>his coming</hi> cry'd openly upon the <hi>New-bridge</hi> by the Almanack-ſellers?
<hi>I</hi> wiſh now <hi>I</hi> had bought the book of it: <hi>I</hi> remember <hi>I</hi> heard two or three leafs
of it read by one that held it: 'Twas the moſt terrible thing that can be imagined,
and it muſt needs have been ſome new Prophet that had compoſed it. In fine, the
time of our ruine is come upon us: And yet my Goſſip, the Miſtreſs of the houſe,
ſticks not to be juſt now driving a buck, and dreams not that the Linnen ſhe waſhes
is only to wipe the muſtaches of the great Tyrant that we expect.</p>
            <p>Theſe words were heard with as much attention as if they had been propheſies;
and yet the Miſtreſs of the houſe for ſook not her Bucking-tub: ſhe was a woman ſo
reſolved, that when ſhe once began a thing, ſhe would go through with it. The rain
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43725:33"/>
which fell down abundantly did not ſtrike ſo much fear into her as the others; and
being oblig'd to be ſtill ſtooping near the fire, ſhe thought not of any thing but her
work. But ſhe had put into the fire a certain ſort of wood that crackled after a
ſtrange manner, and a great coal flew out of the fire and lighted on her coat:
Preſently after feeling the heat, ſhe cry'd out, Ah! I burn, I burn! the world will
be deſtroy'd by fire. He who was moſt amaz'd was her ſon, who was upon the top
of the houſe, where he had been ſufficiently wet, and held his hands together, ſhaking
his teeth in expectation of what ſhould happen. Aſſoon as he heard them cry,
that the world was not to periſh by water but by fire, his tranſportation was ſo
ſtrange, that he caſt himſelf down together with the Tub, which ſtaid not much
after him, but ſoon tumbled down: And if by chance there had not been a dunghil
in the yard, whereon he fell, he had without diſpute broke his neck. His fall was
eaſily perceiv'd, and every one hearing him cry, they went to ſuccour him, but they
found he had more fear then receiv'd hurt. All being entred into the houſe, one of
the Village ſpake theſe ſententious words: What doe we fear ſo much? if we dye
not to day, we ſhall dye to morrow, it is the way we muſt go ſooner or later: Let
us not climb up on the tops of our houſes, nor yet to the mountains, and leave all
at random: Hang all! we ſhould be more jovial: It is enough that the <hi>Pedees</hi> of
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> have the vintage of this year, let us not leave them the wine we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
let us rather drink it (my dear friends!) when we have taken a little of it, we
ſhall know no more care, we ſhall not think ſo much on our ſorrows, and we ſhall
die more gently.</p>
            <p>This advice being approved, the good man of the houſe went himſelf down into
the Cellar, and all the reſt follow'd him with tankerds and pitchers; and having
ſtruck out the heads of the Pipes, they drank ſo much, that they in a manner knew
not what they did. Afterwards they brought to the women what wine, remain'd,
and they in like manner invited one the other to drink, ſaying at every word, Ah!
we'll burſt rather then leave a drop to the fornicator <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> So all the wine
was drunk: which now failing, and not raining ſo much, it began to dawn. Their
fear began then to diminiſh a little, and they were ſo bold as to go into the ſtreet,
where they perceiv'd that all the water ran along the channel, which ſoon ſmother'd
all further fear of the deluge. But the wine flying up into their brains, furniſh'd
them with a new reſolution: And the moſt witty among them, laughing at the fear
paſſed, tels them, that he could not conceive for what reaſon they ſhould be ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and how they could imagine the end of the world to be ſo neer: For (continued
he) we fear the Deluge and Antichriſt both together: If all the Earth were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd,
what ſhould that falſe Prophet have to doe here? You ſee that all this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtand together: and ſeeing he muſt come at leaſt ſeven years before the end
of the world, as I believe I have heard affirmed, we have yet ſome time to
live.</p>
            <p>Theſe words were approved by all the rout, only there was a little grambling at
him that ſaid them, becauſe he had ſo long ſtudied for this fine advice. Thereupon
thoſe that were moſt drunk went and ſlept; and the reſt hearing the laſt toll to
<hi>Mattins,</hi> went to the celebration of a low Maſs. <hi>Lyſis</hi> his Landlord, who was a
very good <hi>Catholick,</hi> was there alſo. When they had done their prayers, they
came and acquainted him with what news they had. That Shepherd whom <hi>Lyſis</hi>
had ſo terrified, deſcrib'd his habit and countenance, ſo that the Inne-keeper knew
whom they would ſpeak of, and laughing ſaid, Alas, my friends, you are of a very
eaſie belief, to have credited what hath been told you not by an Angel, nor yet an
evil ſpirit, nor yet a wiſe man, but the moſt fool of all men, and who the laſt night
lodg'd at my houſe: I well know his madneſs, and by and by you ſhall ſee the truth
of it. As he ſpake thus, there were others in the Church, who ſaid it was true, that
ſuch a one as the Shepherd had deſcribed lodg'd in his houſe, and that the laſt night
they had ſeen him go in there. The Country-people were hereby convinced they
had been deceiv'd, and were ſo aſham'd of it, that they would have given ſomwhat
they had not ſpoken of the fear they had been in the night before. The Parſon who
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43725:33"/>
ſaw them talking with great attention, would needs know what the matter was:
which when they had related to him, he made a good exhortation to thoſe ſtray'd
ſheep, and ſhew'd them how that they ſhould not believe Impoſtors; and that
though there be nothing more certain then the laſt Judgment, yet there is nothing
more uncertain then the time it ſhall be. Which done, he diſmiſs'd them in peace
with his benediction.</p>
            <p>Being returned to the houſe where they had ſpent the night, they awoke thoſe
that ſlept, and among the reſt the good man of the houſe, whom they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with what they had learn'd. When he ſaw it was a Fool had cauſed all this
their fear, and that his Shephered had been the firſt deceiv'd, and had afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the reſt, he became furiouſly angry, and ſtirr'd up all the company againſt
him, ſo that they began to beat the poor fellow, and had murther'd him with their
fiſts, if he had not ſomwhat appeaſed them by his ſad complaints, making it appear
above all things that he had done nothing maliciouſly, and that all the hurt they
had received was that they had had a ſleepleſs night of it; and that he was the cauſe
of that good work they had done in ſerving of God, which was meritorious, and
whereof they ſhould one day receive the comfort. 'Tis true, replies his maſter: but
thou doſt not withall ſay that all my good wine is by that means gone, Nor doe I
mean to loſe it, I intend thoſe that have drunk it ſhall return it me. While he ſpake
that, he who had drunk the beſt part was diſgorging behind the door: 'Tis not in
that manner (continues he) that I would have it returned; you muſt all come to
proportion, of the Judge ſhall hear of it: Will you have me now drink nothing
but water, or that I ſend to the Tavern for daſh'd wine? You muſt every one of
you preſently carry me to your houſes, and give me of yours. He had no ſooner
ended this diſcourſe, but his wife purſues with the choiſeſt injuries all thoſe that had
drunk of their wine: So that to avoid the tempeſt, which was more heavy then
that of the night, they left them there and went to their homes.</p>
            <p>The report of the Adventure was preſently ſpread abroad, and eſpecially among
the Citizens of <hi>Paris</hi> who were at St. <hi>Cloud.</hi> They wiſh'd the day ſomwhat further
ſpent, that they might ſee thoſe that had been ſo neatly deceiv'd. They came to
high Maſs: which ended, and they gone out of the Church, they were infinitely
jeer'd. Yet I know not which prevail'd more with them, whether the indignation
of having been ſo troubled all night, and of ſeeing themſelves ſtill aſſaulted by ſo
many abuſes, or the joy of being aſſured that the world ſhould not end ſo ſoon as
they had believed, and that they had time enough for the Vintage. <hi>Anſelme</hi>
and <hi>Adrian</hi> were at Church, and were extremely aſtoniſh'd at the troubles which
<hi>Lyſis</hi> had already cauſed in St. <hi>Cloud.</hi> But that need not ſeem ſo ſtrange: For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of greater underſtanding then the people of a Country-village might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
if they were ſoberly entertained with the extravagances of <hi>Poetry;</hi> and there
would be many who would innocently believe what ſhould be told them of the <hi>fire,
ice, chains,</hi> and ſo many other imaginary puniſhments of paſſionate perſons. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme</hi>
asked <hi>Adrian</hi> where he had left his Couſin? He anſwer'd, that he was a-bed,
but that he had barracado'd himſelf in his chamber; and when he had asked him
whether he would go to Maſs, he told him that he would reſt himſelf yet a while:
ſo that he had left him, knowing that ſleep would doe him no hurt. <hi>Anſelme</hi> was
of opinion that they ſhould go and ſee whether he would riſe: And in this delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
they walked to the Inne, and went to <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s chamber-door. <hi>Adrian</hi> opened
it with the Key, but it was bolted within. <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſpoke, and pray'd the amorous
Shepherd to let him in. Knowing preſently the voice of his beſt friend, he opened
to him: And having bidden good morrow to his Couſin and him, he put on his
cloaths, telling them for excuſe for his not being more early, that all night he had
not put his eyes together, and that he began to be ſleepy at the break of day. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that is not well done, Couſin, ſayes <hi>Adrian:</hi> there is no more Maſſes to be
ſaid and you cannot hear any to day. Think you that God hath any need of thoſe
fancies wherewith you entertain your ſelf? Yet this is paſt, and there is no remedy:
But what (when I think on't) if you went to Church, would you go in that mask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43725:34"/>
habit which you put on? Think you that there are any Masks, or that they act
Comedies in a conſecrated place? Away with it preſently, I will ſend for another
for you. I will never put on any other then this, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> And I pray content
your ſelf that I do not, as I did yeſterday, deſire one all red. Then turning him to
<hi>Anſelme,</hi> he cry'd out, O dear friend! what have I not done ſince I ſaw thee!
Know then that I have gone through the nobleſt adventure in the world, and that
I give checkmate to all the Lovers in <hi>Europe.</hi> The laſt night I ate nothing but what
was <hi>red,</hi> and all my <hi>thoughts</hi> have been <hi>red.</hi> Am I not as good as my word, as to
what I boaſted to thee? 'Tis enough to have ſhewn by one time, that it came from
my invention to doe it: Henceforward I will eat of any thing, and will not be any
more ſcrupulous as to <hi>colour;</hi> it ſhall ſuffice me to wear always about me ſome little
<hi>red</hi> Riband, in remembrance of <hi>Charite.</hi> But when I think on't, what an ample ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
will there be here to exerciſe the pen that ſhall write my hiſtory! where could
he have found a more noble matter? By this means ſhall not his diſcourſe have
thoſe ornaments which are not ſeen in other books?</p>
            <p>Having finiſh'd this diſcourſe, he ſent to the Mercers for red Ribaning, and put
ſome to his ſhoes inſtead of the green which he had caſt away: And when he was
all cloath'd, he asked <hi>Anſelme</hi> whether he would come along with him into the
fields, for he was going to lead out his Flock to graze. I pray ſtir not hence, ſays
<hi>Adrian,</hi> but let us dine: Beſides you are out of the ſtory; here is no Flock for you,
I have ſold it to the maſter of the houſe, who cauſes all to be kill'd, and perhaps
you ſhall eat your ſhare of them. <hi>Lyſis</hi> thereupon look'd into the Yard, and ſaw a
man cutting the throat of one of his ſheep: which put him into ſuch a choler, that
he cry'd out preſently, Ah cruel Couſin! what have I done to thee, that thou
ſhouldſt deal thus with me! Thou haſt ſold my dear Flock to theſe Barbarians, and
there they maſſacre it. Ah innocent <hi>ſheep!</hi> you will be no more the witneſſes of
my <hi>Loves.</hi> Alas! how was I delighted in your company! Yet I ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
if they made you dye upon ſome noble occaſion: And if they offered you
up at the Altar of ſome God, that is the worſt could happen to you, nay you ſhould
have been reſerved for a Sacrifice; you ſhould have had the honour at leaſt to die
within ſome ſtately Temple, whereas now you die on a dunghill in a filthy yard.
Ah Butcher! ah Executioner! ſtay the fury of thy knife, leave me ſome to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
me. Ah! I ſee that thou never wert a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and that thou never readſt
the <hi>Apotegms</hi> of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> where it is written, That the good Shepherd ſhears, but
doth not fley his ſheep. Ah poor Innocents! that I have not here a <hi>Chalmia,</hi> to
celebrate your death in ſad and Elegiack <hi>Verſes!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ceaſe your complaints, ſayes <hi>Anſelme,</hi> taking him aſide: You muſt not afflict
your ſelf ſo much for the death of Beaſts. We are not Diſciples of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> nor
doe we believe as he did, that the ſoul of our Grandfather is in the body of a Calf.
Why doe Shepherds breed up Sheep, but to ſell them? we may have others in
ſtead of thoſe: And if we ſhould have none at all, is it a prodigie to ſee a <hi>Shepherd</hi>
without a <hi>Flock?</hi> it ſuffices that he ſometimes hath had one. A Gentleman that
hath had Souldiers under his conduct, is ſtill called Captain, though his Troops be
disbanded, becauſe he hath ſhew'd himſelf capable of being ſo. You ſpeak well,
ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> And when I think on't, I ſaw you yeſterday in the fields that you had
no Flock, yet I call'd you Shepherd: I have always believ'd you to be one, for
you ſpeak with a <hi>Courtezy,</hi> which is not common but to <hi>us. Anſelme</hi> unwilling
to humour him then, ſaid to him, You were miſtaken in calling me Shepherd,
for I am not one; and there is no perſon of quality in the Country that is ſo,
unleſs it be you. I doe not deſire you ſhould call me otherwiſe then <hi>Anſelme;</hi> and
for my qualities, there is not any one I more eſteem then that of your Friend and
Servant. Have you not ſeen that they are only Country-Clowns that keep Sheep
all hereabouts? I grant what you ſay, courteous <hi>Anſelme!</hi> ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> but my
deſign ſhould be to reſtore to its ſplendor that happy condition, and to cauſe that
the moſt noble and rich perſonages ſhould not diſdain it; to the end that men may
no longer ſtudy how to plead and wage war, and that they ſhould ſpeak no more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43725:34"/>
of any thing but <hi>Love.</hi> Would not you willingly ſecond me in it? When men ſhall
ſee us both of an opinion, will not every one imitate us? Let us now talk a little of
this, now the time is propitious, and that <hi>Adrian</hi> is gone down to ſee if dinner be
ready. That I may conceal nothing from you, replies <hi>Anſelme,</hi> know that it would
be very ill look'd upon to turn Shepherds in a place ſo neer <hi>Paris</hi> as this, whither
all the <hi>Pariſians</hi> ordinarily come. We are not far enough from <hi>ambition</hi> and <hi>avarice</hi>
to lead ſuch an <hi>innocent</hi> life: were it not for that, I ſhould be of the deſign. Is there
ſo much to do, ſays <hi>Lyſis?</hi> For to ſhorten the pains which we ſhall have to perſwade
a people to receive new cuſtoms, let us go into a place where thoſe which we would
follow have been already practiſed: There are many Countries in the world where
men live in a <hi>Paſtoral</hi> way: Let us go into <hi>Arcadia,</hi> gentle <hi>Anſelme!</hi> it is a Country
much eſteem'd by the Gods, they ordinarily live there among men. We muſt paſs
the Sea to go thither, ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> and I doe not love to ſee ſhips but in the haven;
<hi>I</hi> would not be in a place whence a man cannot come away when he pleaſes, nor get
on a horſe which a man can lead by the tail. When one is there, he is much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to ſay, <hi>I</hi> ſhake, <hi>I</hi> am afraid, <hi>I</hi> am ill at the heart! <hi>I</hi> would return to our houſe!
No body hears you; or if any do, they abuſe you. Let us go then, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
into the Plains of <hi>Leon,</hi> along the River <hi>Ezla,</hi> where the diſgraced <hi>Sirenus</hi> hath ſhed
ſo many tears. That is yet too far, ſays, <hi>Anſelme:</hi> and beſides, we ſhall not agree
well with the arrogant humour of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> You will then ſtay in <hi>France,</hi> ſays
<hi>Lyſis:</hi> Well then, there is nothing but may be done. <hi>I</hi> know many Provinces where
there are brave Shepherds. <hi>I</hi> have lately read a book called the <hi>Paſtorals</hi> of <hi>Veſper,</hi>
wherein are deſcrib'd the Loves of certain Shepherds of <hi>Tourain?</hi> Shall we go into
that Country? they ſay it is the Garden of <hi>France.</hi> Yet let me tell you, theſe Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
whoſe hiſtory <hi>I</hi> have ſeen live a little too ruſtickly for us: There is nothing
commendable in them, unleſs it be that they love faithfully. What doe <hi>I</hi> dream on
all this while, or have <hi>I</hi> reſerved it as the beſt till laſt! 'Tis into the Country of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts</hi>
that we muſt go, near the antient City of <hi>Lyons</hi> on the weſt-ſide: There we
ſhall find the <hi>Druid Adamas,</hi> who diſpenſes with much of his gravity, the better to
entertain ſtrangers: We ſhall ſee <hi>Celadon, Sylvander,</hi> and <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and <hi>Aſtraea,
Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis. I</hi> leave it to you to imagine how much we ſhall be taken with
their converſation, ſeeing the relation of their Hiſtory is ſo noble, that in reading it
<hi>I</hi> have often wept for joy. But how confident am <hi>I</hi> to refute the reaſons of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
<hi>Hylas,</hi> and diſpute againſt him with more heat then <hi>Sylvander!</hi> And if he
do not confeſs himſelf vanquiſh'd by my words, <hi>I</hi> ſwear to you that <hi>I</hi> ſhall not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from blows; for <hi>I</hi> ſhould not brook it, that that little Raſcal ſhould deride the
fidelity of <hi>Thyrſis.</hi> Moreover <hi>I</hi> ſhall not appear there as a ſtranger; for <hi>I</hi> know all
that is paſt there theſe many years, and the Shepherds ſhall not relate their Loves to
me. It is more then three years that <hi>I</hi> conceiv'd my ſelf among them, for <hi>I</hi> was in a
company where the young men and maids took their names out of <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> and our
entertainment was a perpetual <hi>Paſtoral:</hi> inſomuch that <hi>I</hi> may truly ſay that it was
there <hi>I</hi> went to School to learn to be a <hi>Shepherd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> hearing this diſcourſe, had much ado to keep from laughing, yet could
he not but make <hi>Lyſis</hi> this anſwer: <hi>I</hi> am willing to go into <hi>Forreſts, I</hi> know that
the ſojourn wil be very delightful, and <hi>I</hi> doubt not but we ſhall find there abundance
of <hi>Shepherds</hi> and <hi>Shepherdeſſes:</hi> but as for thoſe whom you name, it is moſt certain
we ſhall not meet them there; they lived in the time of <hi>Mercueur,</hi> reckon how long
it may be ſince they are dead. How ſay you! replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> doe you affirm that
in jeſt, or for want of judgment? The Author of the Paſtorals of <hi>Forreſts,</hi> doth he
not dedicate an Epiſtle in the beginning of his firſt book to the Shepherdeſs <hi>Aſtraea,</hi>
and in the ſecond another to the Shepherd <hi>Celadon?</hi> Doth he not ſpeak to them as
to perſons yet alive? Beſides, do you not ſee that their hiſtory is not yet finiſh'd?
<hi>Celadon</hi> hath not obtain'd the favour of his Miſtreſs: He perſonates <hi>Alexis</hi> in the
fourth and laſt book of him, who hath begun to put down his adventures in writing:
For as to what may be in the Books which others have written of it ſince, or may do
hereafter, as if they proceeded from the true Hiſtorian of <hi>Lignon, I</hi> am not obliged
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43725:35"/>
to believe them. <hi>I</hi> think, if <hi>Celadon</hi> had married <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> or had dyed, as you ſay, the
Author of this Hiſtory would have mentioned it; and that is it confirms my belief
the more.</p>
            <p>It muſt be ſuppos'd that <hi>Anſelme</hi> would have been much to blame, if he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to deprive <hi>Lyſis</hi> of ſuch a rare and excellent opinion, therefore did he not
attempt it, but humour'd him in it, to make more ſport with him; affirming that all
he ſaid did more and more heighten his deſire to be a Shepherd as he was, but that
there was one thing troubled his mind extremely, which was, That if they ſhould go
to <hi>Forreſts,</hi> they muſt quit the converſation of the fair <hi>Charite,</hi> without which <hi>Lyſis</hi>
could not live. He anſwered, that he had much conſidered it; but that he hoped
the firſt time he ſhould ſpeak to her, he would uſe ſuch a charming perſwaſion to
her, that ſhe ſhould conſent to go with them and turn <hi>Shepherdeſs. Anſelme</hi> ſaid
that were very well, if it could be obtained. And thereupon in comes <hi>Adrian,</hi> with
the people of the houſe after him bringing up Dinner. He bade <hi>Lyſis</hi> make haſte to
dine, that he might take him along with him to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſaying that his houſe was all
in diſorder when he was not at home, conſidering his wife was not of the beſt houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifes;
the Prentiſes were in league with the Servant-Maid, who would give them
the key of the Cellar to drink up his wine; and if ſhe would not give it them, they
would go down half way the well, and paſs through a little window which was there
for to viſit his Pipes. <hi>Lyſis</hi> anſwered, There needed not ſo many words; that he
might go if he would; that as for his part, he would not live any longer under his
tuition, and that he was big enough to be without Guardian or Curator. <hi>Adrian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
he would ſtay there and continue in his follies, told him that if he would not
go by fair means, he would carry him away by foul; that it was not ſo hard a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to find a Coach, wherein he ſhould be chained and fetter'd; and that when they
were at <hi>Paris,</hi> he would clap him in priſon at <hi>St. Martins,</hi> where he ſhould be whipt
every day; or elſe ſend him to the Almshouſe, to keep company with ſuch fools as
they diſpoſe thither. At that <hi>Lyſis</hi> was extremely angry, and his Couſin was no
leſs: but <hi>Anſelme</hi> by his prudence reconciled all; telling <hi>Adrian</hi> in particular, that
as he had already remonſtrated, the diſpoſition of the Young-man could not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
by rigor, and that it were better to humour him. So that he conjur'd him
to leave him to his cuſtody a moneth or two, and he would deſire nothing for his
entertainment. <hi>Adrian</hi> believing it was neceſſary, for the <hi>diſ-ſhepherding</hi> of him,
that he ſhould be with ſome honeſt man which would acquaint him with the world,
conſented to leave him to his care, ſeeing he was willing to venture the trouble of
his importunity; and promiſed him a world of ſervices in requital.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> having obtain'd his deſire, ſate at Table with them, and there was no
diſpute while they were at dinner: Only <hi>Adrian</hi> told <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that he had reſolved to
leave him with <hi>Anſelme,</hi> and charg'd him to obey him in all things as his maſter and
benefactor. He promis'd him he would not fail, and ſeem'd very joyfull to be left in
ſo good company. After dinner the <hi>Merchant</hi> took horſe; and leave taken, return'd
to <hi>Paris.</hi> He was in hope the good diſpoſition of <hi>Anſelme</hi> would conduce much to
reform that of <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and he gave all the kindred this account of him, that they
ſhould have more comfort for the time to come, then they had had before. Yet
<hi>Anſelme</hi> tranſported with the impetuoſities of Youth, which loves nothing ſo much
as to paſs away the time merrily, would not task himſelf ſo ſoon to take away his
fancies; and in himſelf accuſed <hi>Adrian</hi> of a great injuſtice in deſiring to deprive the
world of the moſt excellent Fool that ever was; believing that if he ſhould reſtore
him to his underſtanding, it would have been a hard matter to reduce him to his
folly. He reſolved therefore to make ſport with him as long as he ſhould remain in
the Country, being rich enough to give him his entertainment. And as our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
is never perfect, if our friends are ignorant we receive it, and do not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of it, he reſolved to recommend to all his Acquaintance this gentle Perſonage,
when he thought it convenient. Having made him quit the Inne, he led him through
a many ſtreets, to bring him to his own houſe. They were met by ſome who knew
what had happened to the Country-people, who had ſo much fear'd the end of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43725:35"/>
world. They ſaw well enough that <hi>Lyſis</hi> was he that had been the cauſe of it. His
extraordinary habit which had been deſcribed to them, eaſily diſcovered him. The
novelty of his clothing, and of his proportion'd gate, obliged to follow him all the
Townſmen of <hi>S. Cloud,</hi> who were then in the ſtreets. They who had already ſeen him
ran a great way before, that they might ſee him paſs by again: the Boys throug'd
at his heels, making a noiſe as thoſe of <hi>Paris</hi> do at the riding of a man beaten by his
wife. <hi>Anſelme</hi> could not make them be quiet; and they had not ſo good luck as
they had had the day before, when they were not followed by any, it being a working
day. This malicious rout caſt ſtones at <hi>Lyfis;</hi> ſo that receiving ſome hurt by one
in his back, he could endure no longer, and turning back with his hat in his hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thoſe that followed him, he ſaid, Sirs! leave off your conduct of me, <hi>I</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
you ſhall go no further; <hi>I</hi> beſeech you no further ceremony; <hi>I</hi> take the favour
for received.</p>
            <p>Theſe words amaz'd both great and ſmall, who underſtood no more the one then
the other; and with the menaces which <hi>Anſelme</hi> us'd at the ſame time, it prevail'd
with them to retire. <hi>Anſelme</hi> admired the natural ingenuity of <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and this
was haply one of the beſt things had ever been heard from him. Being come home,
he aſſign'd him a pretty Chamber; and having left him certain <hi>Books,</hi> he deſired
him to paſs away the afternoon in reading, while he in the mean time would go
viſit certain perſons whither he thought not fit to bring him along.</p>

had left him: But at length not allowing any conceptions
any way comparable to his own, he would entertain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
no further with them; but in the midſt of his fond ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
would take a walk in the Garden. And indeed he
found not any Books that pleas'd him, they being <hi>Seneca,
Plutarch, Du Vair, Montagne</hi> and <hi>Charon,</hi> which do not
ſpeak any thing of <hi>Romance.</hi> He affirmed that all was worth
nothing; and that it was only <hi>Plutarch</hi> that he valued a little, becauſe he ſaid <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi>
had been a <hi>Shepherd</hi> in his youth. When he had been at leaſt two hours in
the Garden, he had a great deſire to go abroad, though <hi>Anſelme</hi> had pray'd him
not to doe it by any means. He found a little door, whoſe lock was not of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
ſo that he eaſily opened it with a knife: It went out into a narrow ſtreet, where
he had not gone twenty paces, but he perceives that ſo fair <hi>Charite,</hi> the ſource of
his deſires, who was returning all alone from ſome houſe where <hi>Angelica</hi> had ſent
her of an errand. However this recontre a little ſurpriz'd him, yet did he not
appear ſo fearfull; and having an intention to ſpeak to her, he choſe rather to go
towards her, then expect her. But preſently a huge Country Clout-ſhoe, who lay,
as it were in ambuſh for her at ſome door, came and caſt himſelf on her, ſaying,
Ha <hi>Catherine!</hi> I have thee! Thou muſt pay me the Kiſs thou oweſt me, ſince laſt
night that we plaid at Queſtions and Commands. <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſeeing her faln into the hands
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43725:36"/>
of a perſon ſo unworthy her, ran as faſt as he could for to reſcue her: But before he
could come at her, ſhe had been already kiſs'd above ten times, whatever reſiſtance
ſhe could make. Which put him into ſuch a fury, that lifting up a ſtick he had in his
hand, he diſcharg'd it about the ears of the Fellow; crying out, How now, filthy
<hi>Satyre!</hi> who hath taught you to be ſo preſumptuous, as to profane the Coral of
that fair Mouth? Go and profeſs love to ſhe Goats, ſtinking Beaſt! The Clown
feeling himſelf hurt, diſmiſs'd <hi>Charite,</hi> and flew at the collar of <hi>Lyſis:</hi> He took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his ſtaff, and did ſo meaſure his ſides therewith, that he was convinc'd his ſafety
lay in his feet; but the other purſuing faſtned with him again, and threw him down,
in which poſture he gave him three or four kicks. He had beſtowed a little more on
him, had he not perceiv'd <hi>Anſelme</hi> coming with two Lacquays after him; which ſo
frighted him, that he took his heels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> being riſen up, ſaw <hi>Anſelme;</hi> and going as gently as if he had had all his
bones bruis'd, went to tell him. Ah! that you had not come ſooner! You might
have aſſiſted me againſt a <hi>Goat-footed</hi> god, which thought to have killed me. He
would have forced <hi>Charite.</hi> and I endeavoured to deliver her out of his hands, or
rather paws. The truth is, ſhe got away while we were fighting: but indeed I have
got good blows, and have not reliev'd her but at the coſt of my ſides. What could
I do againſt him alone? Theſe <hi>Fawns</hi> are much ſtronger then men: they have the
advantage in all things; and if your people ſhould have run after this, they could
not have overtaken him; he is as ſwift as thoſe horſes which they ſay that the wind
<hi>Boreas</hi> had engendred. I am very much troubled at this unhappy adventure, ſays
<hi>Anſelme:</hi> but it is your own fault, you ſhould not have gone abroad, I had deſired
you as much. The reaſon of it is, that in theſe parts they underſtand not what <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds</hi>
of your quality mean: You ſaw a while ago, that I had much ado myſelf to
defend you: And henceforward if we go out together, we will be ſure to be well
train'd. I had not a while ago my ſervants about me, becauſe I make no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
here to walk abroad all alone, as well as at <hi>Paris,</hi> where there is more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
required: But now I ſee it is not amiſs for a man to have always people about
him. But I pray tell me, why do you believe that he you fought with was a <hi>Satyre?</hi>
I perceived him a little, and he ſeem'd to me as proper a Country-fellow as any
hereabouts: He had breeches and doublet on, and do not you know that the <hi>Satyrs</hi>
go all naked? Alas, how are you out of the way! replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> have you not well
obſerved that it was a <hi>Satyre</hi> diſguiſed? He had only taken the garb of a Country-fellow,
the more freely to come into this Town, and carry away <hi>Charite.</hi> For my
part, I am certain his feet were cloven; and his doublet being unbutton'd, and his
ſhirt open, I ſaw his breaſt was all hairy: And if all this were not ſo, the deformity
of his countenance ſufficiently diſcovered him. Well then, replies <hi>Anſelme,</hi> I grant you

               </gap>t him better then I: Let us now ſee whether you are
much hurt. Having ſo ſaid, he conducted him home to his houſe, where the <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi>
being well ſtretched and chaf'd, perceiv'd his hurt not ſo great as he had ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined:
And when they asked him which ſide pain'd him moſt, he pointed to the
right ſide; but the people aſſuring him that they could not perceive any bruiſe
there, Then (ſaid he) I think 'tis the other. To cure him perfectly of his imaginary
evil, <hi>Anſelme</hi> cauſed him to be rubb'd all over with a certain Unguent that did him
neither good nor hurt; and in the mean time while Supper was preparing, he went
and ſhut himſelf into his Cabinet for to perfect <hi>Charite's</hi> Picture, whereon he had
been at work from betimes in the morning.</p>
            <p>Aſſoon as he had done, he returned to <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and being both at ſupper, he told
him that he had finiſh'd his work. This news put him into that impatience, that his
Hoſt was fain to ſhorten his meal to half of his wont, that he might ſhew him that
ſo excellent Peace. The Study being opened, <hi>Lyſis</hi> entred therein with as much
reſpect and veneration as if it had been a Temple; and <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſhewing him the
Copper-piece whereon he had wrought, our paſſionate Lover beheld it a long time
with an extreme attention: But at laſt crying out like one amaz'd, he ſaid, I do
not apprehend this, <hi>Anſelme!</hi> You have miſtaken, and given me one Picture inſtead
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43725:37"/>
of another. You are deceiv'd, anſwers he: Do not you ſee well enough by this
candle we have; or will you have me cauſe four or five more to be brought, that
ſo you may the better ſee how to judge of the Picture? Are you ſo blind, that you
do not perceive this to be the face of <hi>Charite?</hi> and that <hi>Du Mouſtier</hi> himſelf could
not draw it better? But how do you conceive it? replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I ſee there are
Chains, and Suns, and Flowers; 'tis not a Face. I will make you underſtand all
in one word, ſays <hi>Anſelme:</hi> Do not you ſee that I have done all according to your
directions, and that I have repreſented all the features of <hi>Charite's</hi> beauty in the
ſame manner as you have expreſſed them to me? Whereupon <hi>Lyſis</hi> diſcovering
the artifice of the excellent Painter, began to obſerve in order all the parts of the
Picture, which had amaz'd him when at firſt ſight he beheld them all confuſedly.
<hi>Anſelme</hi> had in this buſineſs acted a piece of ingenious knavery; obſerving what the
Shepherd had told him of the beauty of his Miſtreſs, and imitating the extravagant
deſcriptions of the Poets, he had painted a Face, which inſtead of being of a <hi>fleſh</hi>-colour,
was of a complexion white as <hi>ſnow;</hi> There were two branches of <hi>Coral</hi> at
the opening of the <hi>Mouth;</hi> and upon each <hi>Cheek</hi> a <hi>Lilly</hi> and a <hi>Roſe,</hi> croſſing one
the other: Where there ſhould have been <hi>Eyes,</hi> there was neither <hi>white</hi> nor <hi>apple,</hi>
but two <hi>Suns</hi> ſending forth <hi>beams,</hi> among which were obſerved certain <hi>flames</hi> and
<hi>darts:</hi> The <hi>Eye-brows</hi> were <hi>black</hi> as <hi>Ebony,</hi> and were made like two <hi>Bows,</hi> where
the Painter had not forgotten to expreſs the <hi>holding-place</hi> in the middle, that they
might the better be obſerved: Above that was the <hi>Forehead,</hi> ſmooth as a piece of
<hi>Ice;</hi> at the top of which was <hi>Love,</hi> like a little Child, ſeated in his throne. And to
add perfection to the work, the <hi>Hair</hi> floted about all this in divers manners: ſome
of it was made like <hi>Chains</hi> of <hi>Gold;</hi> other-ſome twiſted, and made like <hi>networks;</hi>
and in many places there hanged <hi>lines,</hi> with hooks ready baited. There were a many
<hi>Hearts</hi> taken with the bait, and one bigger then all the reſt, which hang'd down
below the <hi>left</hi> Cheek, ſo that it ſeem'd to ſupply the place of a <hi>Pendant</hi> to that rare
<hi>Beauty.</hi> This is mine own <hi>Heart!</hi> cries out <hi>Lyſis,</hi> when he ſaw it: I know it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
How judiciouſly is it placed in this part! Now that it is ſo near <hi>Charite's</hi>
Ear, it will continually repreſent unto her my <hi>ſufferings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have I not had reaſon to conceive that you would like my work very well, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<hi>Anſelme?</hi> I can without vanity affirm that the fancie is incomparable. There
was never any that found out the way of painting the beauties of faces by a <hi>Poetical</hi>
figure: This ought to be called a Picture by <hi>Metaphor.</hi> Let me embrace you, my
dear friend! ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> after a little recollection apart: I muſt confeſs you have
given an incomparable proof of your ingenuity. That beautifull face of <hi>Charite</hi>
could not be painted but by <hi>Metaphor.</hi> We had before conſidered that theſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
could not be repreſented naturally. O Painter more excellent then <hi>Apelles,
Protogenes,</hi> and <hi>Parrhaſius!</hi> I do not judge this a Monſter, as I did erewhiles: I
hold it a thing extreme rational, and very full of art.</p>
            <p>The ſatisfaction of <hi>Lyſis</hi> diſcovered it ſelf by a many ſuch other expreſſions;
and as for the excellent Picture, he would preſerve it as long as he lived. <hi>Anſelme</hi>
diſpoſed it into a Box, leſt it might receive any hurt; and then it was he received
the higheſt thanks that could be for the pains he had taken. As he was ruminating
on his invention, he ſaid to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that as they had <hi>metaphorically</hi> repreſented the
fair <hi>Charite,</hi> ſo might be painted any ill-favoured woman. She ſhould have on a
<hi>Perriwig</hi> of <hi>Serpents</hi> like <hi>Megaera;</hi> or if ſhe might be allowed <hi>hair,</hi> they ſhould be
<hi>big,</hi> and ſtanding <hi>upright</hi> like the briſtly head of a <hi>Wild-Bore:</hi> At which there ſhould
be <hi>chained</hi> nothing but <hi>Lice</hi> and <hi>Nits.</hi> Her <hi>Eyes</hi> ſhould be like two waſhed <hi>Prunes,</hi>
about which there ſhould be a quantity of <hi>birdlime</hi> for to catch the <hi>Files</hi> that ſhould
come neer it. Her <hi>Mouth</hi> ſhould be like the ſhutting of a <hi>Carriers pouch;</hi> and the
<hi>Complexion</hi> ſhould be like the <hi>folds</hi> of an old <hi>Boot.</hi> And ſo for the reſt, which I refer
to the conſideration of more excellent wits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> thought all this very ingenious, yet nothing witneſs'd his approbation but
a ſhort ſmile; becauſe indeed he was ſo taken up with <hi>Charite's</hi> Picture, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd
not much of his thoughts on any thing elſe. When bed-time was come, there
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43725:37"/>
was a little Chamber aſſign'd him alone, for he deſired it ſhould be ſo. He made
faſt the door and went to bed, but it was a long time ere he could ſleep. He had left
the candle (which was a good big one) burning, that he might conſider his Picture;
and it is not eaſily imaginable what praiſes he ſtill gave the Painter, whoſe invention
ſeem'd to him wholly divine. He was thinking within himſelf, that as <hi>Poetry</hi> was
called a ſpeaking Picture, ſo painting might be called a dumb <hi>Poeſie.</hi> So that he was
clearly of opinion, that Painting and Poetry were well met, and that both of them
diſcovered themſelves in terms diſtinct and intelligible enough to good wits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> having underſtood that he had not put out the candle, was ſomwhat
troubled, for he was afraid leſt he might ſet the houſe on fire. But though he was
ſufficiently a fool, yet did he not advance ſo far; and unleſs it were for ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancie
that the betray'd in miſtaking all the Fables of the Poets for real truths, and
thinking men ſhould live as the <hi>Heroes</hi> in <hi>Romances,</hi> he appear'd rational enough;
and beſides had judgment enough to know what could hurt him, or was for his good.
Nevertheleſs the ſervants were charg'd to be carefull; and ſo at length the candle
being ſpent, every one went to his reſt and ſlept, as he did alſo. The next morning he
riſe, and gave his Entertainer a viſit, who was making himſelf ready. While <hi>Anſelme</hi>
was entertaining him with ſome curious and choiſe diſcourſes concerning the divers
effects of <hi>Love,</hi> there entred into the Court a Gentleman of his acquaintance, called
<hi>Montenor,</hi> whom he immediately went to entertain, and was with him ere he was
off horſ-back. He carried him into the Hall, ſpeaking by his gladneſs the obligation
he laid on him, in that he had been at the pains to come to his houſe. <hi>Montenor</hi> told
him that he came out of <hi>Paris</hi> betimes, for two reaſons: The one, to enjoy the cool
of the day; and the other (which was the ſtronger inducement) was, the likelier
meanes he had to finde him, which he was in ſome impatience till he had
done.</p>
            <p>While they were thus engag'd, <hi>Lyſis</hi> deſirous to know who it was, entred
the place where they were, and ſaluted the Company very courteouſly. <hi>Montenor</hi>
was ſomwhat aſtoniſh'd at his garb and mode; but preſumed not to ſpeak of him
to <hi>Anſelme,</hi> becauſe the other was ſomwhat neer, as alſo becauſe he was entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a diſcourſe of that importance, that he could not wave it. I am very certain,
ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> that beſides your deſire to give me a viſit, there is ſome particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
hath cauſed your coming hither. So that the other found himſelf oblig'd to
diſcover what burthen'd his mind, in theſe words.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs (ſays he to him) that I come hither partly upon the occaſion of an
afflicted perſon, on whom there muſt be compaſſion ſhewn, or ſhe muſt not be
heard complain. That you may not languiſh in expectation, 'tis <hi>Geneura</hi> that I ſpeak
of: Caſt but your eyes on the vehemence of the affection ſhe hath always born you,
and you will perceive, that not being able to beget any thing in you that were not
like it, the diſquiet ſhe is in to ſee herſelf forſaken muſt needs be extreme. They ſay
that in Love the ſeparation of Bodies is not truly abſence, ſeeing there may be viſits
of Thoughts at every moment: But when a Lover abſents himſelf abſolutely, 'tis
then that his affections and inclinations wander from the Object on which they
ſhould be faſtened. <hi>Geneura</hi> is an example of this; and though you are now but
at the diſtance of eight or nine miles from her, ſhe hath more to ſuffer then at other
times when you were in <hi>Touraine,</hi> or in <hi>Britany;</hi> for then ſhe was aſſured, that if
in the night ſhe dreamt of you, you did no leſs of her; and that ſo it ſeem'd your
minds being diſengaged, your bodies gave one the other the meeting at half way.
But now that ſhe knows that you have quite forgotten her, he that would comfort
her contributes to her deſpair; and ſhe knows ſo much affliction, that for to learn
how to dye, there is no more required then to ſuffer the like. This hath made ſuch
an impreſſion on me, that I promiſed her to come to you to repreſent part of her
ſorrows, that you might be induced to give her a viſit, at which time you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the reſt from her own mouth.</p>
            <p>Now am I fully convinc'd as to the artifices of <hi>Geneura,</hi> ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> they muſt
needs be very ſtrong, ſith they have been able to overcome you. However, I am
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43725:38"/>
ſorry ſhe hath employed a perſon ſo wiſe, in ſo indiſcreet a buſineſs. I ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
my pains, if I can ſatisfie your prejudice. But what! will you ſay that <hi>Geneura</hi>
cannot accuſe you of infidelity, ſays <hi>Montenor,</hi> and challenge what you have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
elſwhere, to have been ſometimes hers? Knew I not that what ſhe bewails
was ſometimes hers, and that ſhe hath a right to require it, I ſhould not have been
ſo uncivil as to come to ſpeak to you of a thing which would return as much to her
diſhonour as mine own. I muſt needs acknowledge, that if I ſhould ſay I never
loved <hi>Geneura,</hi> ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> the very ſtones of her houſe would convince me of
falſhood, and that it were not neceſſary they ſhould ſpeak for to repeat the things
they have heard me ſay, ſeeing in many places they bear yet the characters I trac'd
on them when I was in my amorous <hi>fondneſſes;</hi> the Letters and Sonnets which
<hi>Geneura</hi> hath in her Cabinet, were alſo ſufficient evidences againſt me. But, Sir,
what would you infer thence? That becauſe I have been a long time expoſed to
the furges of a tempeſtuous ſea, muſt I therefore return thither again, and that I
remain there till the conſequence muſt be a wrack? Tell me no more of the love
of theſe Wenches, that are ſo fickle, that among them all there is not one conſtant,
unleſs it be in the deſire of change every houre. A man ought not to engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo far in loving them, as not to preſerve the better part of his Liberty for an
antidote againſt the affliction which their lightneſs may bring upon him. It ſeems by
what you ſay, ſays <hi>Montenor,</hi> that you your ſelf are quite metamorphoſed, and that
you are no more one of the Subjects of the Godeſs of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> as you have been; for
<hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> are the two moſt <hi>incompatible</hi> things in the world. <hi>Love</hi> muſt be
<hi>abſolute</hi> Maſter where-ever he is: <hi>Reaſon</hi> gives him the place; the <hi>Will</hi> obeyes;
and the Inclinations <hi>change</hi> for him, and the ſervice done him is not thought half
what is due to him. But though this God have ſuch power, yet muſt we not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to avoid him: 'Tis well known, that if Love be a poiſon, 'tis a pleaſant
one; if it be a diſquiet, 'tis deſireable; if it be a death, 'tis peaceable; if it be a
priſon, there wants nothing but liberty, and miſery reigns not there as in other
priſons. A perſon that at your age ſhould love nothing, is like a dead Sea, wherein
if a ſhip cannot be caſt away, no more can it attain the haven; and if you can loſe
nothing by not loving, neither can you arrive at any conſiderable good fortune.
When I ſee a Mind ſo noble as yours not inflamed with Love, methinks I find a
Torch of moſt excellent wax, but without fire to light it, for want whereof we are
ſtill in the dark.</p>
            <p>All this were good enough, replies <hi>Anſelme,</hi> had I not experience that Love is
an evil painted with the colours of good. The torments are much more aſſured then
the pleaſures, to him that will ſubmit to his conduct; and though ſome take great
pleaſure in taſting its fruits, yet is it a ſort of meat whereof a man cannot eat much
and think it's good. There is a ſentence as true as old, that ſayes there are but two
happy dayes in marriage, the Wedding-day, and that of the Wifes death. But it is
withall to be granted, that ſince this ſentence was firſt pronounc'd things are rather
grown worſe then better; nay, for my part, I ſhould not grant the Wedding-day
to be wiſh'd. To be ſhort, A Woman is a domeſtick danger, and under a humane
beauty there often lurks a ſavage beaſt; ſo that ſome wiſe men have doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they ſhould rank them among <hi>men</hi> or <hi>beaſts.</hi> But thou omitteſt (cry'd out <hi>Lyſis</hi>
engaging himſelf in the conteſt) that ſome other <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> wiſer then thy Authors,
have thought they ſhould be diſpoſed between Men and Angels, as participating of
both natures. Ha! who would have thought thou hadſt profeſs'd enmity to what is
moſt amiable in the world. Ah, my Entertainer! how hypocritically haſt thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
me! how unfit art thou to meddle with the profeſſion of a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> as
thou hadſt reſolved with me! Where haſt thou ever heard that <hi>Shepherds</hi> ſhould
blaſpheme againſt <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Women?</hi> Ah <hi>Savage! Woman-hater!</hi> Inſenſible thing!
Wouldſt thou have Mankind decay, and that there ſhould not be any body here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to ſacrifice to the immortal Gods? or if thou deſireſt Children ſhould be
brought forth, wouldſt thou have no other way but by caſting of ſtones backward
as <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha</hi> did, without any further copulation? If thou art of that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43725:38"/>
humour, I diſown thee: Come give me my bag and baggage, I will not ſtay any
longer with a perſon accurſed of men and the Gods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> was delivered of this diſcourſe with much choler; and <hi>Anſelme</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he had ſome reaſon to blame him for what he had ſaid, reſumed the diſcourſe
thus. Be not angry, my dear Friend! know that I do not blame all women: 'tis
only with this <hi>Geneura,</hi> of whom we ſpeak, that I was afraid a marriage would have
proved my repentance. But that is contrary to what I ſaid, replies <hi>Montenor:</hi> you
are obliged to love <hi>Geneura,</hi> and to avoid all others. Anſwer that objection, friend,
ſays <hi>Lyſis</hi> to <hi>Anſelme:</hi> This Gentleman ſeems to be in the right. You will never
be thought worthy to enter into the Temple of <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> if you have not continued
faithfull to your Miſtreſs. I have hearken'd a good while to your diſpute, but I ſhall
be able to make nothing of it, if you give me not each his ſtory, and alleadge your
reaſons. Obſerve me; Will not you ſubmit to the <hi>Paſtoral</hi> Laws, and take a <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi>
for to be Judge in your difference, and not ſpend your mony on the Pettifogers
of the Country? So <hi>Sylvander</hi> judg'd the difference between <hi>Leonice</hi> and <hi>Tyrcis;</hi>
and <hi>Leonidas</hi> that of <hi>Celidaea, Thamyra,</hi> and <hi>Calidon,</hi> and that of <hi>Adraſtus</hi> and <hi>Doris;</hi>
and <hi>Diana</hi> decided that of <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Sylvander.</hi> 'Twas always the cuſtom to take
him for Judge whom the Oracle had choſen, or the firſt they met that would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it, that there might be no long quarrels between Shepherds, whoſe profeſſion
it is to live in all tranquility. Will you not therefore do well to take me to decide
your buſineſs? Am not I a competent Judge in this caſe? I refuſe you not (ſays
<hi>Anſelme,</hi> laughing at this rare invention) and it ſhall be the Gentlemans fault, if
you diſcharge not that office. For my part, anſwers <hi>Montenor,</hi> I believe ſhe whom
I ſpeak for hath ſo good a cauſe, that I fear not to appeal to any whatſoever. 'Tis
very well, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> but the worſt on't is, that we are not in the midſt of the
fields; and methinks we ſhould be there, for all the differences in <hi>Aſtraea</hi> have been
ſo judg'd: ſhall we go thither? It may poſſibly be that the ſentence will not be
valid, if the Judge that gives it ſit not on a ſtone in the ſhade of an Elm. Nay, if it
pleaſe your Honour, let us not go hence, ſays <hi>Anſelm:</hi> Seat your ſelf in that Chair
before the Table: you ſee that on the Chimney-piece which is behind you there is a
Repreſentation of the Country; you ſhall be in the ſhade of thoſe Trees that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there, doth not that ſuffice? I think <hi>Anſelme</hi> is in the right, reply'd <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and it muſt
be granted that our Judgment-ſeat is whereever we are, ſeeing we have none certain.</p>
            <p>In ſaying ſo he ſate him in the place they had aſſign'd him; and putting his hands
on the elbows of the Chair, be took on him the gravity of a Magiſtrate. <hi>Anſelme</hi>
remonſtrated to <hi>Montenor,</hi> that ſeeing he was of Councel for the Plaintiff, he ſhould
ſpeak before the Judge firſt, for to make his complaint. He, who knew not yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Lyſis</hi> was a Fool, or play'd the Knave, began to provide himſelf to ſpeak;
beſides that he thought himſelf obliged to perſwade <hi>Anſelme</hi> not to diſcontinue
his love to <hi>Geneura.</hi> So ſtanding on one ſide of the Table, while his adverſary was
on the other ſide in the ſame poſture, he thus began his Harangue.</p>

have ſometime thought her worthy your affection, why is ſhe not ſo ſtill? Is her beautie

                           <hi>I</hi> Shall not need the courteſie of a long Preface, to captivate your Honour's favour,
nor will I throw duſt in your eyes, as the Proverb ſays, leaſt you ſhould ſee the
truth, for it concerns me that you ſhould know it, and it is ſhe ſhall ſpeak for me.
To anſwer then my Adverſaries Councel; who aks firſt, Whether I believ'd the
Beauty of <hi>Geneura</hi> decay'd: I ſay, it is a needleſs queſtion. Alas! To whom doth he
make it? I have never found her but too beautiful, and I deny not but that ſhe hath
yet as many beauties in her face, as ſhe had ever: but that (ſhe hath) the ſame now in
her diſpoſition and minde, is more then I avow. As for the faithfulneſs which ſhe hath
obſerved towards me, I ſhall bring thoſe proofs will witneſs the contrary: And to clear
up all this to my Judge, and to your ſelf <hi>Montenor,</hi> whoſe charge it is to ſpeak againſt
me, I ſhall give you a ſhort Hiſtory of my Loves, which you have not received ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
from <hi>Geneura:</hi> for if you had but known any thing, you would not have plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for a Wench, who hath ſo little right to what ſhe demands of me.</p>
                        <p>After the deceaſe of my Father and Mother, taking the Liberty of all ſort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
I became acquainted, among others, with <hi>Lerantus,</hi> a Batchelour, one not
of the meaneſt quality, and an ingenio W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with whom he had ſome buſineſs, and he did as good as bring a Victim to the
Altar to be ſacrificed. I had no ſooner ſeen her, but my deſires were ſo inflamed for
her, that I had no reſt till I had returned to offer her the prey ſhe had already gotten. The
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43725:39"/>
Father and Mother being a ſubtile ſort of people, diſcover'd preſently on what deſign I
came to their houſe, and gave me thoſe entertainments that lur'd me to further viſits.
They perceived that a while before, I had gotten a Treaſurer-ſhip; beſides, they knew
my Father had left me ſomewhat, and as for their part they had not much, the husband
being of the moſt inconſiderable Officers belonging to the King; ſo that it had been to
their no ſmall advantage; if I had married the Daughter. I think they had not
forgotten to recommend to her, to receive me favourably, and to carry her ſelf before me
diſcreetly and modeſtly. And indeed ſhe was not wanting; and I vow to you, that as
ſhe was yet very young, and of much ſimplicity, I took an infinite pleaſure to hear her
talk innocently of Love. I ſhall not tell you how many afternoons and evenings I have
paſtim'd away with her, nor how many <hi>Serenades</hi> I have given her, nor what Letters
and Verſes I ſent. It's enough for me to tell you, that I lived not but for her, and that
ſhe lived not but for me, and that preferring content before riches, I diſpos'd my ſelf to
marry her as ſoon as I ſhould obtain the conſent of my friends. Yet from that very time I
obſerved ſome Artifices in the Mother, and in Her; but paſſion blinding me, I thought
all ſupportable. When I was in the houſe, and that there came ſome to viſit them, if he
were a perſon of quality, as there frequented divers, they gave word they were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and had much ado to recover the courteſie they did me. But what dream'd I on at
that time, that I ſhould give them any credit, ſeeing <hi>Perſida, Geneura</hi>'s Mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as ſubtile as woman could be, ſerved me in the like kinde, and cauſed me to be ſent
back again, when I came to ſee them, while they had others to entertain: And this
maxime ſhe ever kept, that it might not be known they were familiar with all the world,
and that they might be thought very reſerved. Now it hapned often, that I was told
they were not at home, and I doubted the principal reaſon to be, that <hi>Geneura</hi> was not
dreſſed to her advantage: for when ſhe had notice of the day I ſhould viſit her, I obſerved
ſhe would make long mornings to dreſs her head only. All this wind ſhook no corn:
And though I could remember ſome paſſages then, I ſhall conceal them, as being not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to make her be deſpis'd. But one time, having been about a year abſent about my
Charge, when I was return'd, I found her firſt innocency chang'd into the greateſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
in the world; and that ſhe might deſervedly be called the <hi>Queen</hi> of Tatling Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſips.
Her mother had carried her to great Ladies, who were pleas'd to eſteem her for
her beauty, ſo that ſhe would govern as they, who were more then ſhe could ever be; and
ever and anon ſhe diſcover'd an inſupportable vanity. She never heard a Coach go by,
but ſhe bid her maid look out at the window to ſee if it were not ſome great Lord of her
acquaintance: See if it be not <hi>Lyſander</hi> or <hi>Poliarchus,</hi> ſays ſhe to the Wench, though
'twere but ſome Countrey Laſs, that knew neither of them. How's that? ſaid I to
her once on that occaſion, do you know when <hi>Lyſander</hi> paſſes by, by the going of his horſes,
or by the noiſe of his Coach-wheels? That is not it, ſays ſhe, but I well know he fails
not to paſs by every day at a certain hour juſt by the houſe; and note here, that in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo, ſhe bit her lips, as if ſhe gave me a bone to pick, and to make me believe, that that
Lord paſs'd by that way for to ſee her. Another imagination ſhe had was, that all that
once ſaw her dyed for love; and ſhe took ſuch a pleaſure to be look'd on, that one evening
being in a ſtreet wherein there is always much people, I ſaw her paſs by in a Coach, at
the boot whereof ſhe ſate with a lighted Taper in her hand. There was no Maſque or
Collation, where ſhe appear'd not with the firſt; nay, ſhe would not ſtick to come to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
and danced with throngs of men, an action which was thought ſomewhat diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
by the diſcreeteſt perſons. I found her one time in a great company, wherein we
were ſix who loved her, and ſtrove to obtain ſome favour from her, when in the mean
time ſhe was ſo ſubtil, that ſhe obliged all together: For ſhe ſate on ones knee, trod on
the foot of another; ſhe had one Gentleman by the hand, and ſpoke to another that ſtood by
him. That hindred not but that ſhe heard another Lover, who had a very good voyce,
ſinging, and caſt amourous looks on his neighbour. So every one thought himſelf in greater
favour then his Rivals, but ſhe knew not her ſelf what would pleaſe her. Whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe went to Maſs ever and anon in the morning, ſhe went not now till almoſt noon,
becauſe that is the time the Nobility goes; and when ſhe was in the Church, though ſhe
ſaw a Maſs ready to begin, yet would ſhe walk up and down as if ſhe ſought for one:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43725:40"/>
and if ſhe ſaw a knot of Courtiers diſcourſing together, ſhe would paſs through them, that
they might all behold her. Nor indeed did the deſign miſcarry, for there was not any
one that addreſſed not his eyes to her, but it was only to laugh at her folly. One gave
her a jog as ſhe paſs'd by, ſo did the other: and I have heard, that a witty Gentleman
obſerving her, ferretting all about ſo, ſaid, to her, Lady, you need ſeek no further, I
have what you look for; yet they ſay, this ſharp abuſe rais'd not the leaſt bluſh, ſo much
confidence was ſhe guilty of, or to ſay better, impudence. That which beſides further
preſented the world with occaſion to laugh, was her gate, for ſhe gave her whole body a
certain ſhaking, as if it had been a Puppet, and ſhe negligently bent her head on every ſide,
with ſuch meaſure and proportion, that it ſeem'd ſhe had learn'd that method by <hi>Tabla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
As for her cloathes, there was ſo much matter for Reformation, that ſhe deſerved
an EDICT for her alone; and though when ſhe went abroad ſhe was ſo gallant, that
there was much to be reproved, yet was ſhe not content, but when ſhe ſtayed at home ſhe had
better Cloathes then ſhe durſt ſhew abroad. Her Language was alſo very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that there might not be any thing in her that ſwelt not of Artifice. When ſhe ſpoke,
ſhe us'd a wanton liſping, and of an imperfection of Speech ſhe would make a grace. As
for her diſcourſe, it was only of ſome little Court-toyiſhneſs; and ſhe never looked on
any perſon twice, but ſhe preſently gave him ſome name of alliance, and that receipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
ſhe took not another from him, not once thinking that the moſt commonly ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd
her ſelf to infamous perſons. I well obſerved all theſe things, yet I was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched,
that I excuſed them, rather then condemn'd them: And I anſwered thoſe
who ſpoke to me of the affectations of <hi>Geneura,</hi> That it was impoſſible to finde a Beauty
ſo accompliſhed by nature, but there may be neceſſary ſome recourſe to Art. Nay, I
could not rid my ſelf of the deſire of marrying her, and attributing all her indiſcreet
actions to the ill conduct of youth. I hop'd one day to furniſh her with better diſcipline
then her Mother. But what a mad man was I to think, that a woman will exchange
Liberty for Slavery? He that would keep her in, muſt give her her way; and he that
would have her deſire any thing, muſt pretend to ſtand infear of her. <hi>Geneura</hi> would
have done ſo too, and I am beholding to her diſdains and remiſſions, which, when I was
the moſt enchanted, prevail'd with me to ſeek my remedy rather in her contempt, then in
her enjoyment. The proud <hi>Titifil</hi> forgot all reſpect to me, that ſhe obſerved before, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
her ſelf a better fortune: ſo that to the end ſhe might the more eaſily be found,
ſhe freely entertained all that came. While St. <hi>Germains Fair</hi> laſted, ſhe miſſed not a
day to be there: ſhe ſate on the Counter of ſome Shop, that ſhe might the better be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
as if ſhe had been ſome Commodity to be ſold. 'T had been no great matter,
had ſhe only obliged thoſe that paſſed by of her acquaintance to treat her with ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats,
but ſhe further importun'd them for ſome little Diamond, or ſome piece or other
out of the Goldſmiths: So that if ſhe would do ſo every year, 'twould prove a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
to her. About that time ſhe had purchas'd a great reputation for her Beauty;
and I think that when there came any ſtrangers to <hi>Paris,</hi> they went to ſee her in the
Church, and other places, as if ſhe had been ſome Rarity of the Citie. Thoſe that had
any Suits of conſequence at Law, endeavoured her acquaintance, for to deſire her to
ſpeak for them to their Counſellours, for they thought her beauty able to corrupt the
Judges of moſt integrity. But this might have been excus'd, were it not that ſhe did it
for advantage, and that it gained her the frequentation of a many, who would not have
courted her but for to deceive her. I was extreamly troubled to ſee it, though for my part,
I had all the reaſon in the world to hate her, and I thence eaſily inferr'd her ruine. For
I know well, there could not be a worſe Guardian of a Maids chaſtity then Poverty,
and that ſlender Revenues, Beauty and Chaſtity ſeldom lodge all at the ſame Inn. And
what is more; <hi>Geneura</hi> encouraged the leſs confident ſort of people, to ask her thoſe
things which are honeſtly refuſable; and her Cloathes, words and actions ſeem'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
her to all the world.</p>
                        <p>Howbeit I took notice of all this, yet did I not diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ontinue my viſits, but ſuffered a
gradual decay of my affection; to imitate the ſea, which ebbs ſo ſlowly out of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
that it is hardly perceiv'd, but with this difference, that I intended no reflux.
So I inſenſibly diſingag'd me out of her Love, to the end ſhe might let go quietly what I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43725:40"/>
took from her, without knowing how it was loſt, as if it had been a ſhadow which had
diſappear'd: So that if there remained any affection for her, 'twas only in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that I had formerly born her, it being an incivilitie to make a ſtable of that
place, which was before reverenced as a Temple. But <hi>it was to great</hi> purpoſe for me
to wiſh her happineſs: for ſhe met with that misfortune, which a Laſs of her quality
ought the moſt to fear. She never went with her Mother, becauſe the woman was ſtill
ſo fooliſh, that ſhe would have the reputation of fair, and by a maxim of Goſſipry, would
not take her in her company, leſt ſhe ſhould diſcover her age, ſeeing ſhe had a daughter ſo
big. <hi>Geneura</hi> being once at a Wedding where ſhe had but one Maid with her, a young
man who had taken her in divers times to dance, kept alwaies ſomwhat near her, and
proffer'd his ſervice to wait on her home, ſeeing no body came to look after her. About
ten of the clock, when they talk'd of bedding the Bride, a ſort of unknown diſguis'd
Dancers came into the room, and putting out all the Torches, committed an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
diſorder. In the midſt of the tumult, they ſay the Bride was raviſh'd by one of her
former ſervants: and as for <hi>Geneura,</hi> there was one <hi>Gismond</hi> carried her away, and
diſpos'd her into a Coach that waited in the ſtreet. In the mean while he that held her
in talk before, made ſome ſtir in the Hall, which was obſerved by her Maid, who knew
not where her Miſtreſs was. As ſhe was asking him for her, he told her ſhe was with
him, and bid her follow him. The Maid believing him, follow'd, and kept her eye on
him ſtill in the dark; and when they were come into the ſtreet, where it was not much
more light then on the ſtairs of the houſe whence they came, ſhe ſaw him conducting a
Gentlewoman, which ſhe took for her Miſtreſs, ſo that ſhe ſtill followed on. She diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
not the cheat till the Gentlewoman ſpoke, and then the poor Wench almoſt amaz'd,
returned to the houſe where the Wedding had been, for to look for <hi>Geneura,</hi> where when ſhe
had in vain as'd for her of all thoſe ſhe met, ſhe return'd with the news of this loſs to the
Father and Mother; and I know not whether they were much diſpleas'd at it or no, or
whether they had ſome aſſurance that their daughter was in ſome good place. <hi>Giſmond</hi>
having gotten the prey he deſired, bid the Coachman drive as faſt as he could, ſo that in
a little while they were gotten a League off <hi>Paris,</hi> where they accidentally met a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
a former Suitor of <hi>Geneura</hi>'s, who was coming out of the Countrey. He hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Miſtreſs ſpeak, draws his ſword, ſtaies the Coachman, and gives <hi>Giſmond</hi> a
thruſt in the left arm. <hi>Giſmond</hi> thereupon drew out a piſtol he had, but it went not
off, only the others horſe, being ſtartled, carried him away acroſs the fields. In the
mean while the Coachman put forward, and having gotten a good diſtance from the
place, met with no further miſadventure. He ſoon after recovered a houſe of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
three leagues from <hi>Paris. Giſmond</hi>'s wound was there lanc'd, but that ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly,
that a feaver ſo violent enſued, that ten days after he dyed. Thoſe that think it
their buſineſs to ſpeak the truth without diſſimulation, affirm, his life was not ſhortned
but through his impatience in his loves; and that without regarding his wound, he would
enjoy the fruits of the ſpoil he had taken, wherein he ſo overheated himſelf, that he could
live no longer. This being very likely to be true, do you ſuppoſe <hi>Montenor,</hi> that I
would marry <hi>Geneura,</hi> though ſhe be come back to her Fathers, and though ſhe ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to honeſty? I do not believe it the ſame caſe with Women as the Sun, which though
it be common, loſes not of its beauty; and if I ever marrie, I will take one that is not
only not blamed, but not ſuſpected. I have now found out a Miſtreſs, who is ſo far from
all ſubtilty and affectation, that ſhe hath nothing of it but the diſdain give me leave to
ſerve her, and tell me no more of this <hi>Geneura,</hi> who would be better known then I, were
I the moſt renowned man in the world.</p>

               <hi>Anſelme</hi> having paus'd there, <hi>Montenor,</hi> who was not able to endure what he
had ſaid of his ancient Miſtreſs, retorted thus. I do not ſo much wonder at what
you have ſaid <hi>Anſelme;</hi> for it is a thing generally granted, that there is no diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
ſo violent, as that which ſucceeds a friendſhip? but I apprehend not whence
it comes that you are guilty of ſuch a change: you tax <hi>Geneura</hi> with many little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectations,
but it is well known, that ſince ſhe hath been out of <hi>Giſmonds</hi> hands,
ſhe hath only preſerved thoſe that render her more handſome, and more deſirable.
As for her Chaſtity, there is no doubt but ſhe is as pure as ever. 'Tis generally
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43725:41"/>
known that <hi>Giſmond,</hi> who was an old Batchelor, and very rich, carried her away by
force out of the place where ſhe was, by the aſſiſtance of his friends diſguiſed
When he had her at his own houſe, I believe he gave ſome aſſault to her chaſtity:
But to make it appear to you how that he prevailed nothing at all, you ſhall be
ſhewn the Teſtament he made the day before he dyed, wherein he bequeaths all his
Chattels to <hi>Geneura,</hi> repenting him of the injury he had done her, and deſiring to
make her ſatisfaction, and that preciſely for what, ſays he, becauſe that having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to corrupt her when ſhe was at my houſe, ſhe reſiſted my aſſaults, and
diſcovered that chaſtity, that ſhe well deſerves an honourable acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Seeing ſhe was carried away by force, ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> why did ſhe not cry out for
help among ſo many people; and when ſhe was in an open coach, why did ſhe not
ſtrive to get out? When ſhe was at <hi>Giſmonds</hi> houſe, what endeavours was ſhe ſeen
to have to ſend to her friends for to come and relieve her, or to my ſelf who ſhould
have been more ready to aſſiſt her then any of them? You would alſo have me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that ſhe did not ſuffer herſelf to be vanquiſh'd by her ſweet Enemy; and you
quote me his Teſtament to prove it. But alas! how plain is this cheat? For what
appearance is there that <hi>Giſmond,</hi> an old Ruffian, who had deſign'd his means to be
the prey of diſhoneſty and lewdneſs, ſhould make choice of this Wench to be his
Heirreſs for having continued honeſt. Was ſhe then the firſt wherein he had found
that vertue, and was there no chaſtity among his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſters and Couſins? What a
miracle is this! There is only he that attempted her love, that thinks her
chaſte, and all others eſteem her unchaſte. It muſt be conceiv'd it was ſhe caus'd
the poor man to ſay ſo, when he was at the point of death. To be ſhort, I will
not take other mens leavings, and buy a Tree whereof the faireſt fruits are already
gathered.</p>
            <p>'Tis injuſtice to infer the worſt rather then the beſt in things uncertain, replies
<hi>Montenor:</hi> And if, as I perceive by your diſcourſe, you ſuſpect <hi>Geneura</hi> of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſtity,
becauſe ſhe ſpoke freely, to all ſorts of perſons; conſider that you your

            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſeem'd to have ſomwhat further to ſay in anſwer to this; and <hi>Montenor</hi>
would not have been wanting to maintain his cauſe longer, if <hi>Lyſis</hi> had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them both to conclude, becauſe that he would give ſentence. <hi>Anſelme</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed
himſelf to hear it, and had cauſed his Adverſary to be ſilent. But the Judge
riſing out of his ſeat, ran away as faſt as he could, ſaying to them, Stay for me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
I'll be back preſently. And in that poſture went he to his Chamber, where he
took his Sheep-hook that he had left there; and being return'd, ſeated himſelf in
his Chair; which when he had done, ſayes he, I had forgotten what was moſt
neceſſary, which is this Paſtoral ſtaff, without which my ſentence might have
been invalid. Now I have it in my hand, I will give judgment upon this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
            <p>

changing his diſcourſe, ſays he to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> But if it pleaſe your honor, you have made
your Sentence too large, dating it at the pronouncing, which is not us'd to be
done: Beſides, you have been overſeen, in that you have not caus'd it to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
How ſhall I take it out againſt my adverſary? Who hath the minutes of it? You
are indeed in the right, replyes <hi>Lyſis:</hi> you have a Lacquey that writes well, why have
you not made him come hither to be my Clark? Yet ſtay, now I remember me, the
Shepherds of <hi>Lignon,</hi> never had any Clark to write down their judgements, and I
will tell you the reaſon, They lived ſo innocently, that as their Contracts were not
paſs'd before Notaries, to oblige them to do what they promiſs'd, ſo no more do
they keep any Records of the Sentences they gave, becauſe who were condemned,
were people of ſuch good conſcience, that they remembred as well as their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
what paſſed againſt them, and performed it without violence. You muſt live
like them, and be content to imprint in your memory the judgement I have given.
<hi>Anſelm</hi> confeſs'd it was well ſpoken, and affirm'd, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſhould ever carry the
day of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and the reſt, ſeeing his judgement was better couch'd then theirs.
Wherein they diſcover'd they underſtood not the Laws and the practiſe as well as he
who had been deſign'd for the <hi>Long robe,</hi> and had ſtudied the <hi>Pandects</hi> of <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterward he went to <hi>Montenor,</hi> and told him, that what was order'd muſt be
obſerv'd, without thought of appealing: And the Gentleman ſeeing by all his
abuſes, that his contempt of <hi>Geneura</hi> was as high as might be, knew well enough he
had engag'd his heart elſewhere. He asked him who was his new Miſtreſs; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly
told him it was <hi>Angelica,</hi> the daughter of a Patentee, dead not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<hi>Montenor</hi> who knew her, and withal knew ſhe was very handſom, and very
rich, would not divert his purſuance of her, and ſo ſaid to him, Aſſure your ſelf,
that though <hi>Geneura</hi> bewail'd your loſs, ſhe hath repair'd it, by the devotion of as
faithful a Lover, whom ſhe muſt reſolve to marry, now that ſhe can hope no more
from you. I muſt with all haſte return to <hi>Paris</hi> to diſpoſe her thereto; for I am
certain ſhe counts the hours ſince I parted, and thoſe my return might take up, ſuch
is her impatience to know what I have prevail'd with you. To which <hi>Anſelm</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43725:42"/>
That he ſhould be very glad <hi>Geneura</hi> met with a good fortune; and that
what he had ſaid againſt her, was partly the better to juſtifie himſelf as to the Crime
which he was charg'd with of having forſaken her. In conſequence of this diſcourſe,
he took <hi>Montenor</hi> aſide and told him, who the Judge in the <hi>ſhort R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> was, that
had reconcil'd them. He alſo farther forc'd on him the pleaſure to hear him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
ſome longer time, for he would not permit him to go before dinner. Which
being done, <hi>Montenor</hi> returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he gave an account of what had
paſs'd to <hi>Geneura,</hi> who thereupon reſolved to take for husband him they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſpent that day within doors with <hi>Anſelm,</hi> and that very impatiently; for he
had a great deſire to be carried to <hi>Angelica</hi>'s, where CHARITE dwelt, but
<hi>Anſelme</hi> had no minde to't: and all the Shepherd could obtain of him, was only
to paſs by the door, which yet <hi>Anſelme</hi> was willing to do ſo far as he thought it ſo
much walk. As they were in the ſtreet: O God! ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> what a propitious
hour is this to go and tickle the ear of a <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> with the ſound of a <hi>Lute,</hi> that
crys Compaſſion for him that touches it! Can you play on the Lute Shepherd, ſays
<hi>Anſelme?</hi> No, anſwers <hi>Lyſis,</hi> but for the <hi>Guitar,</hi> I touch it in ſuch a manner, that
there is no Magick ſo ſtrong as the ſound I give it, when I ſing to it ſome ayr that is
amorouſly ſweet. Well, if you ſing it ſuffices, replys <hi>Anſelm,</hi> the voyce is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
which may be carried every where. Come and ſing before the window
of your Sherherdeſs. That would do very well, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> if I had but an ayr upon
that occaſion, but I thought not on't this afternoon to make one: beſides, I left at
<hi>Paris</hi> my Dictionary of French Rimes, and my Collection of Epithetes, without
which I cannot make Verſes. And now I think on't, He that not long ſince hath
advanc'd in <hi>France</hi> thoſe looſe Verſes according to the <hi>Italian</hi> mode, hath been
much in the right, for there is nothing ſo eaſie as to make of them; and when a man
is in haſte, they are ſoon diſpatch'd. They are ſome long, and ſome ſhort, ſome
maſculines, ſome feminines, ſometimes with plain Rimes, ſometimes a croſs, all as it
comes into a mans minde, without being oblig'd to diſpoſe them into <hi>Stanza</hi>'s or
<hi>Odes.</hi> I yet would not preſume to practiſe them, till ſome others had lead me the
way: for I have heard ſay, that at preſent there are at <hi>Paris</hi> a ſort of people, who
would be call'd the Ingenuities of the age, who would hiſs at me, as if I preſented
them with ſome unſeaſonable Novelty. They would preſently rank me among thoſe
who have endeavored to make meaſured Verſes according to the Latines. A man
muſt a little fear them, for things are ſo far well or ill done, as they like or diſlike
them, and all depends on their approbation, and their cenſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> thought theſe conſiderations very rational, but he perſwaded him that
though he had not made Verſes purpoſely to ſing before <hi>Charite</hi>'s window, yet muſt
he not omit to go thither, conſidering, many Gallants gave <hi>Serenades</hi> every day with
ordinary Songs, and that it matter'd not, ſo that they were well ſung. <hi>Lyſis</hi> was ſo
deſirous to go and raiſe up his Miſtreſs with the melody of his voyce, that he eaſily
believed all this: ſo having bethought himſelf a little, he ſaid chearfully to <hi>Anſelme,</hi>
I have found what I had need of; have not you heard of an Ayr that begins
thus:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Charite,</hi> whoſe brighter eyes,</l>
                  <l>Our hearts do Tyranniſe,</l>
                  <l>And thoſe that dare rebel chaſtiſe, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That's it <hi>I</hi> muſt ſing, <hi>I</hi> believe it was made expreſly for me, and that the Poet
preſag'd that a <hi>Charite</hi> ſhould diſpoſe me under her Laws</p>
            <p>As he had ſaid ſo, <hi>Anſelme</hi> gave him notice, that they were before the houſe of
<hi>Charite,</hi> and aſſured him, that his choice as to the Song was ſo excellent and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
that he believed it was ſome Divine inſpiration, wherefore he advi'sd him not
to think of taking any other. Then he ſhew'd him that part whence he might be
heard by his Miſtreſſe: and <hi>Lyſis</hi> having hemm'd divers times to diſgorge all the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43725:42"/>
flegme that might have block'd up the paſſage of his voice, began his aire ſo melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
that his muſick was almoſt as pleaſant as the noiſe of a Cart-wheel. <hi>Anſelme</hi>
in the mean time bethought him to take off his Galloches, and put them between
his fingers; and by making the ſoals clatter one againſt another, he playd as if it had
been with Clappers, that he might bear a part with <hi>Lyſis.</hi> But the Shepherd not
approving it, intreated him to let him ſing alone the ſecond and third Couplet, and
afterwards he ſhould do what he would. He had no ſooner begun, but a Country-fellow
whoſe ears were grated with this mad muſick, came to the window, and caſt
three or four ſtones at the Muſitian. See there! ſays <hi>Anſelme</hi> to <hi>Lyſis:</hi> your muſick
is as powerful as that of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> it already draws the ſtones after it. That makes no
amends, ſays the Shepherd; let us retire, 'tis not good to be here: Theſe ſtones are
not reſpectfull as thoſe that followed <hi>Orpheus;</hi> for they approach'd him not by
twenty paces, leſt they ſhould have orewhelm'd him, and were balanc'd in the air;
but of theſe we may in the end feel the weight.</p>
            <p>When he had ſo ſaid, they retir'd: For though <hi>Anſelme</hi> could have quieted the
Country-fellow, yet would he not, leſt any ſhould know he were there. <hi>Lyſis</hi> in
the return, diſcourſed much to him of the diſcourteſie and ſavage humour of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Town, who would not permit Lovers to give <hi>Serenades;</hi> and he
ſpake ſomewhat too concerning his voice, ſaying it ſeem'd to him it was not very
good then, and that if he had not caught a cold, he had ſung a great deal better.
As ſoon as they were come home, they went to bed, and ſlept both of them very
well till the next day, which <hi>Lyſis</hi> would ſpend in ſolitude in his chamber to write a
Letter to <hi>Charite.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Anſelme</hi> went to viſit <hi>Leonora, Angelica's</hi>
mother, at whoſe houſe dwelt the incomparable Miſtreſs of our Shepherd. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
her with the excellent adventures of his Gueſt, and of what pleaſant folly
he was poſſeſſed: which rais'd in her ſuch a deſire to ſee him, that he promiſed to
bring him along with him as ſoon as he could conveniently. He forgot not to tell
her, that he was paſſionately ſurpris'd with the beauty of her Waiting-gentlewoman;
and that the diſcourſes he made on his Love, excell'd the moſt excellent Comedies in
the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> being return'd, asked the Shepherd if he had finiſh'd his Letter? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
He had but three words to add, and he would not ſup till he had done, and
had neatly encloſed it in gilt paper, and ſeal'd it with Spaniſh wax, with red ſilk about
it. While they were at Supper, <hi>Anſelme</hi> told him that he had been where <hi>Charite</hi>
dwelt, and made him believe that he had ſpoken to her of him, and that ſhe thank'd
him for his aſſiſtance againſt the <hi>Satyre.</hi> This he thought a high glory; and he ask'd
his dear Hoſt whether he would do him the favour to deliver his Letter to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs?
<hi>Anſelme</hi> told him he would willingly do it; but withall, that he ſhould be
glad to know the contents of that Miſſive. I have forgotten it, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> If it were
burnt or loſt, and that I were to write another, I ſhould not put one word of the
ſame. Shew me the foul Copy, ſeeing you will not unſeal it, ſays <hi>Anſelme.</hi> I have
tore it in a thouſand peeces, anſwers <hi>Lyſis:</hi> And not to diſſemble with you any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
I tell you that if I had it, you ſhould not ſee it, for it is not reaſon you ſhould ſee
the true draught of my affections, before her that hath caus'd them. Are you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about?
replies <hi>Anſelme:</hi> how prettily capricious you are! I ſhall pay you in the
ſame coyn; and I aſſure you, you may go ſeek one to carry your Letter, for that
ſhall not I. Poſſibly, ſeeing you will not ſhew it me, there is ſomwhat in't to my
prejudice. I have read of divers who have carried their own deaths in a Letter, and
receiv'd their puniſhment as ſoon as it was in his hands to whom it was directed.
That's not the reaſon, <hi>as I am a Shepherd,</hi> replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> And I tell you that I care
not much whether you carry my Letter, or no; nay I would not admit of <hi>Love</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be the Meſſenger, were it not that he is blind, and cannot read my ſecrets.
Know then that I could willingly give him this Pacquet, and that he would carry it
ſafely, though he have neither pocket nor budget, for he would hide it in the locks
of his hair; yet cannot I truſt him; for put the caſe he ſhould not know the way to
<hi>Charite's</hi> chamber, he not ſeeing any thing at all, muſt have ſome other little Boy to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43725:43"/>
be his guide, as your Bag-pipers have; and he perhaps would miſtake <hi>Angelica</hi> for
<hi>Charite,</hi> and ſo ſome other then my Miſtreſs ſhould have the glory of my writings.
You offend <hi>Cupid</hi> to think ſo, ſays <hi>Anſelme:</hi> For though he have no eyes, yet he
preſently knows whom he hath any thing to do with; he hath a better noſe then
any Dog in <hi>France,</hi> he'll go ſcenting ſo long till he find out your Miſtreſs; he hath
as good an ear as a Cat that watches a Mouſe, ſo that he'll preſently know her by her
ſpeech; then he hath the feeling ſo good, that he will not miſtake another for her
But if all that were not ſo, ſhould he have ſo little wit as not to know his ordinary
lodging, having no nobler retreat then the eyes of <hi>Charite?</hi> If he ſhould not ſeek
her, would he not ſtill go to her by cuſtom? I grant your reaſons, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> But
leſt this <hi>little God</hi> who is very quarrelſom, ſhould be angry with me, I will not ſpeak
to him of carrying my Letter: He would anſwer me, that I was uncivil to take him
for my Lacquay. He is not like you, who proffer me that favour: For among us
men, who can make returns of courteſies, 'tis the office of a friend, and not of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
All this conſidered, I have bethought me of an invention to ſpare both you
and him; but let us talk no more on't, for 'tis not yet time to execute the
deſign.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Anſelme</hi> could not ſee the Shepherds Letter: and two houres being ſpent in
this conteſtation and other things, <hi>Lyſis</hi> deſired leave to go out, and deſired him he
would let one of his Lacquays go with him. <hi>Anſelme</hi> granted it, though he ſeem'd
to be angry with him: And the Shepherd having taken the Lad aſide, promiſed him
a great reward, if he would aſſiſt him in his affairs. He ſhew'd himſelf ready to obey
him in all things; and according as he had bidden, took the Hay-loft-ladder, and
carried it after him. <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſeeing them go out ſo accoutred, ask'd them if they
were going to ſcale the Heavens, and take the Moon by aſſault? But <hi>Lyſis</hi> bid him
only retire and be ſilent, and that he ſhould ere long have an account of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.
<hi>Anſelme</hi> letting him go his wayes without any further diſcourſe, expected a
good while for his return: but ſeeing he ſtaid out long, and that it was very late, he
went to bed.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Lyſis</hi> being come before <hi>Charite's</hi> houſe, look'd about to ſee if
there were any light in the chamber where <hi>Anſelme</hi> had told him ſhe lay. There
was, contrary to his deſire, but it was preſently put out; ſo that he then thought all
were abed in the houſe, and that opportunity favoured his deſign. He caus'd the
Ladder to be placed againſt the wall; and bidding <hi>Gringalet, Anſelme's</hi> Lacquay,
hold it faſt below, he went up from rowel to rowel, with the Letter in his hand, for
to put it on the window of his Miſtreſs: but being come to the upper end of the
ladder, all he could do was to reach the lower brink of the window; ſo that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſtand a tip-toe, and to ſtretch out his arm, that it had been as good for his
joynts to have been on the rack. While he thus lengthned himſelf, there was a Car
within kept a pawing at the clappers of the window, which ſo alarm'd him, that he
made ſuch haſte back, that he very narrowly miſs'd falling to the ground. Having
been a little while in expectation of what might enſue, he bethought himſelf'twere
better to give the Lacquay the Letter to put on the window: whereupon he came
down and ſpoke to him of it: but having meaſur'd which were the taller, he was
two fingers ſhorter then himſelf; and beſides he perceiv'd his arms were very ſhort,
which rendred him the leſs fit for his enterpriſe. That caus'd him to get up again,
not looking for any aſſiſtance but from himſelf; and taking heart, he went as high
as he had been at firſt. Hearing the ſame noiſe as before, he thought there might
be ſomebody that would ſurpriſe him; ſo that he deſcended three ſtaves; then
hearing nothing, he aſcends again; the noiſe beginning again, he deſcends again.
Sometimes he lengthned his arm with all his might, ſometimes he drew it back:
He would ofttimes lift himſelf up altogether, and preſently again be ſhrunk down:
And methought he was like thoſe Capons legs, whereof children do leagthen or
contract the claws as they pleaſe, by pulling the ſinews. O how many pounds might
have been beſtow'd on the curioſity of ſeeing ſuch pleaſant poſtures! But alas, they
had no other ſpectators then the Stars, and a miſerable Lacquay that knew not his
own happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:43725:43"/>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having retir'd and as often approach'd the window, did at laſt put the Letter
upon it, and being preſently come down, he bid <hi>Gringalet</hi> take away the Ladder,
and return a long with him to <hi>Anſelme</hi>'s houſe. He ſaid no more to him, he was ſo
taken up, to entertain the divers imaginations which ſeiz'd him, when he conſider'd
the Amazement his Miſtreſs ſhould be in, finding his Letter the next morning on
her window. He ſaid within himſelf, That ſhe would believe it were ſome Bird had
brought it thither in his Break; or rather <hi>Love</hi> himſelf, who flyes as well as the
Birds. In this Meditation he came to <hi>Anſelme</hi>'s houſe, but underſtanding he was
a-bed, he would put his time to the beſt advantage. He bought of the Gardener
ſeven or eight Poſies half wither'd, wherein there were Pinks, Gilliflowers and
Marigolds, and ſome other flowers, he faſtened them altogether to a long peice of
Packthread. Then out he went again, with the Lacquey, whom he made take the
Ladder with him, which was ſuch a burthen to him, that, if he had not fear'd to
diſobey his Maſter, who had charg'd him to do whatſoever <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſaid to him, he
had bid him carry it himſelf. The Shepherd ſhewing himſelf familiar with him, to
gain his more willing aſſiſtance, asked him, If he had never ſeen the Sonnets of
<hi>Ronſard:</hi> No; anſwered the Lacquey, but I have ſeen Sonnettes or little Bells at the
Knees of Morrice-dancers, and at the Collars of little Dogs. That's not it, replyes
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> I ſpeak to thee of a Book of Verſes: But I well perceive thou haſt not read
it, ſeeing thou ſpeak'ſt of it ſo ignorantly. Know then, that the <hi>Poet</hi> ſays in ſome
places, that he adorn'd his Miſtreſſes door with <hi>Noſe-gays</hi> and <hi>Garlands</hi> of flowers.
I intend to imitate him; for he underſtood the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Loving</hi> as well as any <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi>
alive. And to what purpoſe, replyes <hi>Gringalet?</hi> were it not better keep theſe
Poſies till to morrow? I would carry them to your Miſtreſs in our ſilver Baſin, with
a clean Napkin or'e my ſhoulder, as the Attendants of Banquets do in theſe parts,
and haply ſhe would ſpit a couple of ſhillings into the Baſin to make the Boys
drink. Thou ſayeſt very well, replyes <hi>Lyſis:</hi> but that I intend not my Miſtreſs ſhall be
at any charge; and then methinks thou art ſomewhat impudent, to think that I
would go drink with thee out of the money ſhe ſhould give thee. Do not believe
it, but rather that there is nothing comparable to what I intend to do, for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
morning if ſhe have a minde to any Poſies, there ſhall be no need to carry her
any, ſhe ſhall only need take them down at her door; beſides that, to ſend her any,
'tis a thing too ordinary. We muſt reſtore the cuſtoms of the Ancient <hi>Poets,</hi> who
faſtned flowers at the Portals of their Ladies Palaces, to repreſent to them that their
beauties were like Roſes, which they conſidering continued not long ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to make their beſt advantage of them, while they had the opportunity. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
conſider, that when it is Holiday at ſome Temple, the Gates are beautified
with Garlands of Flowers, which ceremony is alſo practiſed over the Gates of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
where ſome Prince makes his Entrance. Now there is not any one on earth,
ſo much to be honor'd as <hi>Charite,</hi> and there is a perpetual Feſtival and Solemnity
in the place where ſhe dwells, ſeeing men go inceſſantly to adore her with all maner
of Ceremonies and Sacrifices. If it be Holiday in her Pariſh, ſays the Lacquey, why
do not you chime in her Steeple? This diſcourſe is inſolent and inſupportable, replys
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> but I am not to puniſh thee for't, for in what thou doeſt, there is as much ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
as knavery. I wonder, that having ſo gallant a man to thy Maſter, thou
art not more expert in the delightful Profeſſion of <hi>Apollo.</hi> Why doſt thou not learn
what the <hi>Muſes</hi> are? If I know not what <hi>Muſes</hi> are, I know well enough what
muzzling is and the <hi>muſick</hi> of a Bagpipe: Is that it you would ſpeak of? Ah! Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my!
cryed out <hi>Lyſis:</hi> have the gods given thee a tongue for no other purpoſe then
to blaſpheme againſt them? be ſilent henceforward, for thy ſilence is better then
thy beſt diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſaid nothing at all to <hi>Gringalet,</hi> leſt he ſhould oblige him to
ſpeak and the Lacquey ſomewhat frighted with his reproofs, durſt not open his
mouth though he conceived he had not ſpoken any thing amiſs. When they were
come before the door of <hi>Charite</hi>'s houſe, the Ladder was planted on one ſide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and the Shepherd went to make faſt one end of the packthread to a nail which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43725:44"/>
he had obſerved there, but afterward he was in a peck of troubles, for he could not
tell where to make faſt the other. He had neither nail nor hammer; yet ſuch was
his opinion of his deſign, that he would execute it whatever came on't. At length
he thought it his beſt courſe to faſten his packthread to the iron-bar of a little win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
which was on the other ſide: which, having carried back the ladder to that
ſide, he preſently did. Now though theſe Garlands were acroſs the door, and that
it might be conceiv'd they were put there out of ſpight, yet could he not believe
but they were very handſom, and were a great ornament to <hi>Charite's</hi> houſe.</p>
            <p>Having accompliſh'd this rare work, he came before the door; and having one
knee on the ground, he divers times kiſs'd the clapper, calling it moſt happy, as
having often the honour to be touch'd by the fair hands of his Miſtreſs, when ſhe
knock'd at the door. As for the Lock, he kiſs'd it not, nay on the contrary he ſpoke
injuriouſly to it, becauſe it kept in a Treaſure for which he ſigh'd, and hinder'd him
to enjoy it. But preſently changing his conceit, he demands pardon for having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it, and acknowledg'd himſelf oblig'd to it becauſe it kept his Rivals from
offering any violence to <hi>Charite.</hi> While he was thus imploy'd, <hi>Leonora's</hi> Kitchin-maid,
who was lodg'd juſt over the gate, had occaſion to make water, and having
no chamber-pot, made uſe of a broad-mouth'd glaſs-viol that was in her window;
and having fill'd it, ſhe emptied it into the ſtreet, putting forth her arm, not looking
if there were any body under, for ſhe was half aſleep. <hi>Lyſis</hi> feeling himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkled
with that water, lifted up his head and perceiv'd the hand and the viol as
much as the time of the night would permit him. He thought it had been his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
who having diſcovered him, caſt ſome perfum'd water on him as a ſignal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:
So that to give her thanks, ſays he, My faireſt! what ſweet preſage is this!
Do you not caſt water on me, to ſignifie unto me that you deſire to quench my
flames? But why, my <hi>Sun!</hi> do you debaſe your quality, and will become <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rora,</hi>
ſeeing you honour me with this <hi>dew?</hi> This he ſpake very low, leſt ſome of the
neighbours might overhear him; ſo that the Maid herſelf did not hear it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe had not quite emptied her bladder, ſhe piſs'd a few drops more into the
viol, and caſt it juſt on his noſe while he was looking up, which made him ſhake his
head a little as a Spaniel newly come out of the water; yet forgot he not to ſay,
Ah <hi>Charite!</hi> Now I ſee thy favours never go alone. But the Maid not thinking on
him, ſhut her window and went to bed again. So that being diſaopointed the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of entertaining his Miſtreſs, as he conceiv'd, he knew not what was become of
her: And however <hi>Gringalet</hi> adviſed him to be gone, he told him he would not, and
that he had ſome extraordinary diſquiets whereof he deſired firſt to be delivered;
that is to ſay, whether the window whence the water had been caſt, and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he had left his Letter, belong'd to the ſame chamber; and if that Paper were ſo
laid, that his Miſtreſs muſt perceive it? <hi>Gringalet</hi> told him, he doubted not but
'twas: But <hi>Lyſis</hi> remonſtrated to him, that he was not ſo fully ſatisfied; and that
he would go up to the window which was above the gate, to try if he could ſee <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
in her Chamber, and ſpeak to her; and that to ſhew himſelf a true Lover, his
importunity muſt come to that point. The Lacquay, who knew not who <hi>Charite</hi>
was, and knew her not by any other name then <hi>Catherine,</hi> diverted him not from
his deſign, and ſo plac'd the ladder where he bid him. <hi>Lyſis</hi> aſcends, and finding
that window a great deal lower then the other, was very joyfull, and reſolved in the
firſt place to kiſs the ground thereof, becauſe his Miſtreſs had ſometimes reſted her
elbow thereon. But in the mean time, <hi>Gringalet</hi> hearing people coming afar off, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes
the ladder which he held below, and ran away, fearing to be taken in an action
which could not ſeem otherwiſe then wicked. As for <hi>Lyſis,</hi> his amorous tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
kept him from thinking of any ſuch thing; and bowing himſelf down to kiſs the
ſtones which <hi>Charite</hi> had touch'd, he put his head into a platter of blood which the
Chirurgion had plac'd there, after he had that morning bled the Kitchin-maid. He
hath'd his noſe in it, and overthrew it all on himſelf; which put him into ſuch a
fright, that in violently removing himſelf, he caus'd the ladder, which was not held
by any thing, to ſlip away, and ſo came to the ground with it. He recovered himſelf
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43725:44"/>
on his feet the beſt he could: But as he was calling <hi>Gringalet</hi> with a low voice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
four men, who paſſing by had heard the noiſe of his fall, asked him what the
matter was; and perceiving the Ladder, take him for a Robber ſcaling of houſes,
ſeeing he refuſed to make them any anſwer. As for the Platter, which was alſo faln
down, they ſaw it not, nor yet the Poſies he had faſtned; for their greateſt care was
to make ſure of him and carry him where they lodg'd, which was not far, that ſo
they might ſecure his perſon and know who he was <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſuffered himſelf to be led
away peaceably, ſeeing his reſiſtance would have been to no purpoſe: Only what
he believ'd as to all the buſineſs, was, that they were Pyrates that would carry him
away, as hapned to divers Lovers mention'd in Hiſtories. Do not you believe you
carry away <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſays he at every turn: You have but the one half of him; To
have him all, you muſt have had <hi>Charite</hi> too: And if you have but him alone, you
can make no advantage of him. Thoſe that led him were ſome <hi>Paris</hi>-Merchants
coming from the Tave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, who underſtood nothing of all this: They only anſwered
him, that he ſhould give them a good account of his planting of ladders againſt the
walls of houſes. But as for his part, he no more regarded what they ſaid: And ſo
falling into his extravagarces, he imagin'd ſtill that they carried him away for his
beauty, and that they would preſent him to ſome barbarous Princeſs that was in love
with him. As he would have ſpoken to them to that point, they came to the houſe
or the chiefeſt of the company, who had brought the reſt with him from <hi>Paris</hi> to
be merry. They had no ſooner knock'd, but the Maid opens to them, having a
candle, by the light whereof they perceiv'd that he whom they led had his face and
cloaths all bloody: which made all cry out together, Ah miſchievous man! ah
murtherer! 'Tis not enough for him to take away peoples goods, but he muſt
take away their lives. But where's his ſword? Hath he thrown it in at ſome cellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>window,
or hath he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it in the wound of him whom he hath kill'd? Tell us, was't
in the ſtreet that thou haſt committed this murther, or in ſome houſe whence thou
cameſt out?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſet on thus with all their demands, began to apprehend what they would
ſay to him; and viewing himſelf all about, was amaz'd to ſee his cloaths in that
pickle. If you ſee any blood on me, ſays he, it is none but my own, and it muſt needs
be that I have hurt my ſelf in the place where you found me. Alas! it is not I that
commit murthers; on the contrary, 'tis on my perſon they are committed every
day, and <hi>Love</hi> himſelf hath taken away my life above a thouſand times already. If
you wonder you found me with a ladder, know I took it with me to do my devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to a Beauty, which is ſo wonderfull, that if there were ſuch another in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
there would be new Gyants who ſhould heap <hi>Oſſa</hi> upon <hi>I elion,</hi> for to
ſcale it.</p>
            <p>This ſo extravagant a diſcourſe confirm'd to thoſe Citizens, that the fellow had
a ſoft place in his head; and finding in him more ſimplicity then miſchief, they
thought to make ſport with him, and ſo ask'd him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What he would give them to
be ſet at Liberty? He told them he had no money, and that if he had, he would
not give them any, ſeeing he was not their Priſoner of War, that he ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to pay his ranſome. While they were in this diſcourſe, one of the company
conſidering his extraordinary habit, remembred, he had heard ſay, that <hi>Anſelme</hi> had
at his houſe ſuch a one, and thereupon acquainting the reſt therewith, they concluded
that their Priſoner belong'd to that gallant man, who was their eſpecial <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>end;
but it being too late to carry him thither, they diſpos'd of him for that night. They
aſſign'd him a bed apart, where he imagin'd more then ſlept; but the others being
burthened ſomewhat with their drink, were in a contrary poſture.</p>
            <p>The next morning <hi>Lyſis</hi> being gotten up, walkt in his Chamber, and the Miſtreſs
of the houſe who had not ſeen him, becauſe ſhe was-a-bed when he was brought
in, came to viſit him, being charg'd to make him believe, they would not ſet him
at Liberty. Fair Keeper of my Priſon, ſays he to her, in ſaluting her. 'Tis of
you, that I demanding Liberty, you are oblig'd to reſtore it me according to the
rules of all good Hiſtory; where do you ſee any <hi>Heroes</hi> in a <hi>Romance,</hi> that being a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43725:45"/>
Priſoner, recovers not his Liberty, by the means of ſome Lady who viſits him in
his Captivity? <hi>Pamphilus</hi> of <hi>Lopa de Vega</hi> is delivered by <hi>Fleria; Clyantes</hi> in the
<hi>Polyxena</hi> of <hi>Moliere,</hi> is delivered by <hi>Elismena;</hi> and <hi>Arſace,</hi> delivered by <hi>Theagenes</hi>
in <hi>Heliodorus.</hi> Imitate theſe Ladies, that ſo you may not diſturb this order, and
if you cannot do it for love, do it for compaſſion. The <hi>Cockney</hi> was of ſuch a dull
ſpirit, that ſhe underſtood not any thing of what he ſaid, but thought he tempted
her to diſhoneſty, ſo that ſhe ran away all in a fury, and went and conjur'd her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
not to keep a perſon ſo loſt as to his wits, any longer in his houſe. He to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
her, went to ſee <hi>Anſelme,</hi> and came juſt as he was going to beat <hi>Gringalet,</hi> for
having forſaken the Shepherd. <hi>Anſelme</hi> having had tidings of him, went to him,
and brought him to his houſe very joyfully. <hi>Lyſis</hi> being enter'd the houſe, reckon'd
up to him all his adventures. He would not have the ſpots taken out of his cloathes,
becauſe not feeling himſelf hurt any where, he did not imagine 'twas his own blood.
He remembred ſomewhat of the diſh he had overturn'd, and believed it was <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
had been let blood in the arm, ſo that he conceiv'd it not diſhonorable for him
to carry her marks about him. Yet <hi>Anſelme</hi> having made appear to him, how the
teſtimonies of his affection ought not to be ſo publike, he put off his cloathes, and
bravely went to bed, while one of the Maids took them to waſh, ſaying there was
no ſhame in that, though 'twere day, ſeeing they might well affirm he was ſick,
becauſe he was in Love, health ſeldom lodging with Love. <hi>Anſelme</hi> having left
him, a Lacquay from <hi>Leonora</hi> enters the houſe, and acquaints him, that his Miſtreſs
deſir'd him to come and ſee her preſently. That Lady which pretended much to
gravity, was not accuſtomed to betray ſo much familiarity; ſo that he wonder'd a
little at this meſſage, yet withal, was very glad on't, becauſe of the affection he bore
<hi>Angelica.</hi> He departed preſently unknown of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and being come to <hi>Leonora</hi>'s.
She told him ſhe had found a Letter on her window, which ſhe would communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to him, becauſe ſhe thought it came from the Shepherd which was at his houſe,
and that there were found about her Gate, abundance of Noſe-gays, and a Ladder
in the midſt of the ſtreet, which it was likely this excellent Lover had made uſe of
to bring about his deſign. <hi>Anſelm</hi> told her ſhe had gueſs'd aright, and ſo gave her
the whole Hiſtory of the adventure of <hi>Lyſis:</hi> wherein the Lover had omitted no
circumſtance, but that he had not hang'd himſelf at his Miſtreſſes door, as <hi>Iphis</hi>
did at <hi>Anaxareta</hi>'s, and that too, after he had diſpoſed there a many Garlands of
Flowers, according to the ancient cuſtom. <hi>Leonora</hi> had already read the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
Letter, ſo ſhe delivered it <hi>Anſelme,</hi> who therein found theſe words;</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>To the Moſt Worthy to be Loved, and the beſt
Beloved SHEPHERDESS of the
River SEINE.</head>
                  <p>LOve having taken your <hi>Beauties</hi> for <hi>Armes,</hi> had long
ſince laid a <hi>Seige</hi> to my <hi>Liberty,</hi> which was <hi>retreated</hi>
within the <hi>Fort</hi> of my Reaſon, when without putting
himſelf to the trouble of a <hi>Scalado,</hi> he is fled into my <hi>eyes,</hi>
and by that way is enter'd my <hi>heart,</hi> as a Robber breaks
into a houſe through the windows. The ſufferings I am
in through its means are very violent, but being at length
appeas'd, he hath ſworn to me that the remedy lay in your
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43725:45"/>
power, and that all I had to do was to write to you of it.
But then ſeeing I was a <hi>Secretary</hi> very ill furniſh'd with
the neceſſaries of my profeſſion, he took a <hi>Quill</hi> out of his
own <hi>Wing,</hi> and hath made me a <hi>Pen</hi> with the point of his
<hi>Dart;</hi> He hath given me <hi>Paper</hi> made of his old <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,</hi>
by a <hi>celeſtial</hi> Paper-maker: He took the <hi>Coals</hi> of
my Heart which was <hi>half-burnt,</hi> and having beaten them
to <hi>powder,</hi> he hath mingled them with my <hi>Teares,</hi> and
thereof hath furniſh'd me with <hi>Ink,</hi> with which I have
written; and for to dry the Writing, he hath caſt <hi>Aſhes</hi>
which he took out of the ſame place where he had the
Coals, which are already half conſumed. When my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was written, he cut off a little peece of the <hi>ſtring</hi> of his
<hi>Bow</hi> for to <hi>bind</hi> it, and he gave me <hi>Wax</hi> out of his <hi>Torch</hi>
for to <hi>ſeal</hi> it. Conſider, fair <hi>Shepherdeſs!</hi> if having aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me thus far ſo favourably, he may not with as little
difficulty furniſh me with all his <hi>Arrowes</hi> for to wound
you, and make you ſick of the ſame diſeaſe as him who

            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> made ſport enough with this Letter, which was according to the ſtile
that moſt part of our ignorant Clarks uſe to write at this day: who when they are
to write, excuſe themſelves that they have not written a long time, or that they
have now preſum'd to write; and ſo beſtow the whole Letter in telling they write
one, and acquaint you almoſt with nothing elſe. But there was one very pleaſant
conſideration, which was, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> out of want of judgment had put down, that
<hi>Love</hi> had caſt duſt on his writing to dry it, which yet could not be done till it was
finiſh'd; and beſides he ſaid, that the ſame <hi>God</hi> had given him of the ſtring of his
Bow, and ſome wax out of his Torch, wherewith he had ſeal'd it: but how is't poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
he could write all this, if the Letter was already incloſed? That made <hi>Leonora</hi>
laugh heartily, who was never weary to hear it read. Therefore ſhe told <hi>Anſelme,</hi>
that ſhe was deſirous to enjoy the converſation of his gentle Shepherd, as he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
promis'd her. <hi>Anſelme</hi> told her at his departure, that without fail he would
bring him with him in the evening. And indeed accordingly, when his clothes were
well waſh'd, and rub'd and dry, ſo that there was no ſpot to be ſeen, he cloth'd
himſelf; and having ſupp'd very cheerfully, went with his dear Entertainer to the
houſe ſo much deſired. They found no body in the Hall but <hi>Leonora,</hi> whom <hi>Lyſis</hi>
accoſted with a Complement taken out of one of the moſt celebrated <hi>Romances</hi> of
the Age; and if ſhe had anſwered him according to what was in the Book, he was
ready to return what follow'd. But ſeeing <hi>Angelica</hi> and <hi>Charite</hi> enter the room, he
was at a loſs of talk, and began to ſhake, as if he had been in a feaver. Yet taking
<hi>Anſelme</hi> aſide, he had the boldneſs to ſay to him, Do you mark how thoſe two
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43725:46"/>
Beauties enter'd in here? <hi>Angelica</hi> goes before, and <hi>Charite</hi> follows. A Clown
would think it is becauſe <hi>Angelica</hi> is the Miſtreſs, and <hi>Charite</hi> the Maid: But let us
baniſh that opinion; the reaſon is, that <hi>Angelica</hi> repreſents <hi>Aurora,</hi> to <hi>Charite</hi>
who is the <hi>Sun,</hi> and ſhe always denotes her coming. <hi>Anſelme</hi> had anſwered him
ſomwhat, to preſerve the honour of <hi>Angelica,</hi> if <hi>Leonora</hi> had not call'd him to know
what the Shepherd had ſaid. Fearing ſhe might be angry for the diſparagement he
did her Daughter, he made her believe that he ſaid, that Time that ſubſtracted from
all things, added every day ſome freſh grace to his Miſtreſs. <hi>Leonora</hi> ask'd him in
his ear, if 'twere not fit ſhe ſhould tell <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſhe took it not well that he came in the
night-time to ſcale her walls, and that it was a thing of ill example. But he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
her to the contrary, ſaying, 'twere not good treating ſo rigorouſly the firſt
time a Mind ſo extravagant, if they intended to make ſport with him. Whereupon
there came in four Gentlewomen of the neighbourhood, and two young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who ſaid they came to dance to Songs. <hi>Lyſis</hi> preſently fearing any other
ſhould take <hi>Charite,</hi> went to her and demanded her hand with a moſt humble reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
But he was no ſooner in the dance, but <hi>Angelica</hi> told him he muſt ſing, and
that a Shepherd (as he was) muſt needs know a many Songs. Know the number of
the Stars, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> count the Shells in the Sea, the ripe Ears of the Harveſt, the
Apples of <hi>Normandy,</hi> the Cheeſes of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Grapes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and
you have the number of my Songs. But I ſhould have had here my <hi>Nomenclature,</hi>
which my Couſin <hi>Adrian</hi> hath taken away from me: I ſhall now ſing but ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Song. Juſt then a Gentlewoman of the company began to ſing, being weary of
doing nothing; and when ſhe had done, they made <hi>Lyſis</hi> believe it was his turn to
ſing a Song: whereupon he began to ſay,
<q>
                  <l>O Shepherdeſs! this is the time,</l>
                  <l>See now the graſs hath put on green.</l>
               </q>
And he ſtill look'd on <hi>Charite</hi> with a corner of his eye, to tell her 'twas ſhe he ſpake
of. His manner of dancing was very pleaſant: For beſides that he pac'd it out of
ſeaſon, he quaver'd his body from one ſide to the other, as if his ribs had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointed.
In the mean time the Company, who had been acquainted with his humor,
confeſs'd ſtill they were much honoured to enjoy him: But becauſe they would
not importune him, there was none but the Gentlewomen ſung afterwards. The
time to retire being come, they gave over dancing: And becauſe it was not very
light on the ſtairs, there came a Lacquay with a candle to light down the company,
but the wind blew it out before he was half way down; ſo that <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſeeing the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
at a loſs by reaſon of the obſcurity of the place, cry'd out in this extremity:
Page! go thy ways to <hi>Charite,</hi> and touch her <hi>heart</hi> of ſtone with an iron, and there
will iſſue out fire as out of a flint and ſteel. You are in the right on't, <hi>Lyſis,</hi> replies
<hi>Anſelme:</hi> But to ſtrike out the ſparks of her heart, it muſt have been the iron of
the darts of your eyes that ſhould touch it; and the tinder of your Love, and the
Match of your Deſire muſt have been all ready for to light our candle. Is there all
that ado, replies <hi>Lyſis?</hi> I have another invention that's readier: Page, go thy ways
immediately, and light thy candle at the eyes of <hi>Charite,</hi> there ſhe hath alwayes
flames; but take heed the tallow be not quite melted. As he ſpake thoſe words,
<hi>Charite</hi> comes with a candle which ſhe had bin to light in the Kitchin. Ha! praiſe be
to <hi>Love</hi> (continued be) you ſee the power of the fire of the rareſt Beauty in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ.
And though every one began to laugh at his extravagant imagination, yet could
he not be perſwaded but that the candle had been lighted at the eyes of <hi>Charite:</hi> and
when <hi>Anſelme</hi> at his own houſe would ſeem to contradict him, he alleadg'd for a
very pertinent reaſon, that it was read in the <hi>Poets,</hi> that <hi>Cupid</hi> always lighted his
Torch at the Eyes of his Mother and other Fair ones, and that it was not the firſt
time that the Beauties had flames. Not to flatter you, ſays <hi>Anſelme</hi> to him, I aſſure
you that I never obſerved any <hi>fire</hi> in the face of <hi>Charite;</hi> but once that ſhe had a
certain <hi>ſcab</hi> on her cheek, which they call <hi>wild-fire.</hi> And to convince you of your
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43725:46"/>
errour, do you not conſider, that when the candle was blown out, we ſhould not
have been without light, if that beauty had any in her eyes, ſeeing ſhe was in the
place where we were in darkneſs: You are no good Phyloſopher, replyes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> you
are to know, that the fire which is in the eyes of <hi>Charite,</hi> is like the Elementary
fire, which we cannot ſee, though we are well aſſur'd that it is between the Ayr and
the Orb of the Moon. Now if this rare fire of my Miſtreſs be inviſible as to us, 'tis
becauſe it is ſo pure and ſubtile, that our eyes cannot perceive it; and if her flame
be fully ſeen when ſhe lights a candle, or ſets a peice of wood on fire, 'tis the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the material vapours that gives it a colour.</p>
            <p>But howſoever, <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſtrove to ſhew himſelf an able <hi>Naturaliſt,</hi> yet the next
day <hi>Anſelm</hi> renew'd the conteſtation upon the ſame ſubject, to make himſelf ſome
ſport, but the Shepherd had the diſcretion to be ſilent, leſt the other being incens'd
againſt him, ſhould carry him no more to the place, where his heart was in Priſon.
A while after Dinner, walking together on the backſide of <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Garden, they
found the back door open. <hi>Anſelme</hi> went in, and being advanc'd a good way into
the Garden, he came back and told <hi>Lyſis,</hi> he had ſeen <hi>Charite</hi> aſleep on one of the
beds. The buſineſs was, that her Miſtreſs being gone abroad upon ſome viſit, ſhe
had taken the opportunity to walk, and having repoſs'd her ſelf in that place, was
inſenſibly fallen aſleep. <hi>Lyſis</hi> willing to take the advantage of this occaſion, made
ſigns to <hi>Anſelme</hi> that he ſhould ſtay at the door, while in the mean time he would
go ſee her, but he ſtill followed him to ſee what were done. The Shepherd was ſo
afraid to make the leaſt noiſe, that he went as gently as if he had trod on thorns, and
when he was come to the bed which <hi>Anſelme</hi> had ſhewed to him, he perceiv'd <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
laid down on a moſſie bank, tapiſtred with graſs. Her face was towards the
sky, and her mouth open, ſo that the Sun ſhining on it, as he did, the time of the day
might be known, by looking on her teeth, which were large, and proportionally
diſpoſs'd, upon which reach'd the ſhadow of her noſe, which was ſo ſlender, that
it ſeem'd to have been plac'd there as the needle of a Quadrant. The Shepherd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd
with admiration to ſee her, was jealous of every thing. He was angry that
her body made any ſhadow, and he could have wiſh'd to have been there without
it. In the Sun beams which paſs'd through the trees, he obſerved the Motes turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſwiftly about, he was angry at that, and ſtrove to drive them away with his hat,
believing they were a fighting who ſhould firſt go and kiſs <hi>Charite.</hi> Conſidering
alſo, that the leaves were not thick enough for to fan his Miſtreſs from the heat of
the Sun, he ſtood before her, to hinder him to ſee her any more. That which
troubled him moſt, was that he ſtill heard ſome little noiſe, which he was afraid
might awake her, and that if ſhe went away, he might not ſee her at his pleaſure.
How troubleſom is this wind! ſays he, very ſoftly: 'tis not content to blow in her
noſe, but it muſt alſo keep a ſtir among the leaves. Methinks I can hear hither the
noiſe of the wheels of the Suns Chariot, nay I think the trees make a noiſe in grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the fruits in ripening; but above all, I hate thoſe flyes that come humming
about here, they would go and ſuck the roſes out of <hi>Charite</hi>'s cheeks, like thoſe of
<hi>Leucippus</hi> and <hi>Eudoxa,</hi> and in the mean time they'll ſting her. If I can catch but
one, ſhe ſhall pay for the reſt. I will ſacrifice it to my Deity, and will offer it up
before her. Having ſo ſaid, he put himſelf into more different poſtures to catch
flyes, then ever did the Emperour <hi>Domitian.</hi> He lifted himſelf up, he ſhrunk down,
he leapt in the ayr, he opened his right hand, then ſhut it again preſently, without
catching any thing but wind; and beſides that, he made ſuch faces, that no mask
or revels can have as pleaſant viſards. When he ſaw he could not catch any, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
himſelf to drive them away with his hat, to hinder them to come near her
Yet there was one ſo preſumptuous, that when he was a little turn'd aſide, it pitch'd
on the noſe of the Beauty, where it continued ſome while with much gravity. 'Tis
very well, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> Is there the place where you intend to ſit Lady Preſident? doſt
thou prophane that fair Throne? but that pleaſure ſhall coſt the dear. In ſaying
ſo very ſoftly, he put forth his hand gently, and thinking to catch the fly, ſtruck
<hi>Charite</hi> on the noſe with all his might; who thereupon awoke in a ſtart, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43725:47"/>
he had ſtruck her on purpoſe, ſays to him, Beſhrew you for a foul Gameſter;
I ſhall feel this blow a good while. Could you not have awoken me more gently?
While ſhe ſaid ſo, <hi>Anſelme,</hi> who had ſeen all, and was hid behinde the trees, came
to appeaſe her, making it appear, that it was <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s intention to oblige her, by
taking a fly which would have ſtung her in the noſe. And <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſaid it was true, and
the greateſt misfortune was, that for all that he miſs'd the catching of that miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Vermine, that he might have puniſhed it for the hurt it had cauſed. After
this, <hi>Anſelme</hi> asked <hi>Charite,</hi> If there were no body at home? She anſwered him,
That they were all gone abroad, but that <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> would be back very
ſuddenly. Well, ſaid he, lets go into the houſe, and ſtay for them. <hi>Charite</hi> as
ſoon as ſhe came in, fell to work about ſome Linen, to recover the time ſhe had
loſt, and <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſeeing ſhe wetted the thread between her lips, to make it the more
eaſily go through the eye of the needle, went and took it out of her hands, and ſuckt
it a good while, ſaying he would endeavour to moderate his flames by that charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moyſture, which was well as good as the dew of <hi>Aurora:</hi> And when <hi>Charite</hi>
ſnatcht the thread from him again, wondring at his folly: What, my faireſt, ſays
he, ſhall I not kiſs what hath touched your mouth, ſeeing all the laſt night I did
nothing but kiſs my own hand, becauſe yeſterday it toucht yours when we danc'd,
and the day before I did much more then that. There he ſtopt, for what he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to ſay, was ſo particular, that he muſt have conceal'd it. He would have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the door that he had kiſt, and in conſequence of that he muſt have ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
concerning his Letter, whereof he would not ſay any thing to <hi>Charite</hi> before
<hi>Anſelme.</hi> Yet he was not a little troubled, that ſhe diſcovered not that ſhe had ſeen
it, and that ſhe were truly conſcious of his affection; but he imagined it was her
modeſty, which indeed was to be admired. He thereupon reſumes his former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and on a ſudden, which ſuited well with his humour, he came and told her;
that he would thenceforward kiſs his hand no more, if <hi>Charite</hi> did not pardon him
more ſolemnly then ſhe had done for the blow he gave her, and ſo immediately he
went and kneel'd down before his Miſtreſs, expecting what ſhe would order: But ſhe
who was not accuſtomed to ſee men cloathed as he was, took him for no other then
ſome Jack-pudding in St. <hi>Germains Fair,</hi> and could not tell what to anſwer to his
extraordinary diſcourſes, ſo that he was fain to take her ſilence for conſent: It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
a little after, that in ſowing ſhe prickt her finger with the needle, and <hi>Lyſis</hi>
ſeeing the blood, cryed out thus, Such is the <hi>Nectar</hi> that flows out of the wounds
which the Gods receive, ſuch was the blood iſſued out of the hand of <hi>Venus,</hi> when
<hi>Diomedes</hi> hurt her in the <hi>Trojan</hi> war, and it was in the ſame manner ſhe bled, when
going to gather Roſes the prickles prickt her: and if the Roſes which were then
white, had not been Metamorphos'd into red, and that it were yet to be done, it
were the blood of <hi>Charite</hi> ſhould do that miracle; but inſtead thereof, it ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſome new flower, as well as that of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Narciſſus.</hi> In ſo ſaying, he took
ſome ſmall ſhreds of cloath out of <hi>Charite</hi>'s Panier, wherewith he wiped off the
blood that run down her hand, and ſo put it into his pocket with ſome other rags
of cloath: he believed himſelf as happy in having this, as when he had the ſtains
they had taken out of his cloathes: yet was he not ſatisfied, having found a bottom
of red yarn, which his Miſtreſs made uſe of in ſome Tapiſtry work, he took five
or ſix needlefulls, and made a Bracelet of it. <hi>Charite</hi> who was not pleaſed at it, told
him he was to blame ſo to ſpoil the yarn, ſo that he was fain to make this fine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to her. How now cruel one! do you deny this poor favour to one that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
ſo much affliction for your Love? have not you obſerved, that they beſtow
collars on the dogs of great Princes, wherein their Arms are engraved, that where
ever they go, it may be ſaid they belong to ſuch a one? And do you not know, that
in a Forreſt there was a Stag found with a golden collar, wherein were engraved
certain Letters, which made appear that fifty millions of years before, he had been
<hi>Alexanders</hi> the Great? In like manner it is neceſſary I ſhould have ſome Bracelet,
whereby it might be judg'd as ſoon as I am ſeen, that I am, not your Stag, for then
I ſhould be devoured by <hi>Acteons</hi> dogs, but your ſlave and ſervant of Love. What
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43725:47"/>
do you queſtion whether I belong to you? Know, you are my Goddeſs; and that you
have the glory to be able to call your ſelf the <hi>Queen</hi> of my ſoul, the <hi>Princeſs</hi> of my
heart, the <hi>Dowager</hi> of my <hi>Deſires,</hi> the <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> of my thoughts, the <hi>Marchioneſs</hi> of
my inclinations, the <hi>Counteſs</hi> of my conceptions, the <hi>Baroneſs</hi> of my actions, and the
<hi>Vidame</hi> of my words. I will not write you any more Letters, but all theſe Qualities
and Titles ſhall be ſuperſcrib'd.</p>
            <p>While he was in theſe Complements, <hi>Charite's</hi> finger bled ſtill: which <hi>Anſelme</hi>
obſerving, told the <hi>Shepherd</hi> he was to blame to amuſe himſelf ſo much in vain talk,
and not look for ſome remedy for his Miſtreſſes wound. He wiſh'd himſelf as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as <hi>Machaon</hi> or <hi>Eſculapius</hi> for to lance it; and preſently went out of the Hall
into ſome ſluttiſh place to look Cobwebs. He entreated <hi>Pallas</hi> to aſſiſt him, that
he might ſoon find it; for he believed ſhe had ſome power over that Inſect which
had ſometime been a Tapiſtry-maker, and that ſhe herſelf had thus metamorphos'd.
But <hi>Lemora</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> coming in, he gave over his ſearch, as alſo becauſe <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
had ſtopt the blood herſelf. <hi>Leonora</hi> having drawn in <hi>Anſelme</hi> into a diſcourſe
of husbandry, came to tell him of ſome young graſs in her garden which had born
fruit, and was deſirous he might ſee them. <hi>Lyſis</hi> follow'd them out of civility,
though he was very loth to leave <hi>Charite.</hi> When he was returned, he found her in
the Court ſitting on a ſtone: Leaving all other company, he went and kneel'd on
one knee before her, for to entertain her.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Gringalet</hi> was entred the Court, and was bethinking himſelf
how to be reveng'd of him, for having been the cauſe that his Maſter would have
beaten him; and that he had given him nothing of all he had promis'd him for his
aſſiſtance in his amor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us enterpriſes. 'Twas a Lad that ſpent all the mony he could
get in ſome miſchievous knavery or other. He was never without falſe Spectacles,
and Knives with prickles, for to cheat his Comrades: But at that time he had one
of the beſt Burning-glaſſes that could be gotten. Though his Maſter ſaw him hold it,
yet he ſaid nothing. He ſuffer'd the Sun-beams to unite in the middle, and made the
reflection paſs on <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, which being of ſtraw was preſently ſet a fire; it was
half burn'd before he felt it, ſo was he tranſported in love: But at length his hair
beginning to ſinge, he roſe up in a great fury, and clapping his hands on his head,
he ſcratch'd it a good while before he would reſolve to diſcover himſelf: At laſt
flinging his hat down, and ſeeing it yet burning, he in a great aſtoniſhment ſaid thus;
O miracle! <hi>Charite</hi> would have turn'd my whole body into aſhes, if I had not ſtood
away: But why a miracle, ſeeing it is well known ſhe can enflame all things? and
therefore I ſhould not have come ſo near her as I did, if I had not a deſire to be
burnt? Did I not tell thee as much, <hi>Anſelme,</hi> when thou didſt conteſt with me
upon that point? Ah Infidel! 'Tis for thy ſake that this miracle is ſhewn; and if
for puniſhment thou haſt not been burnt thy ſelf, 'tis becauſe thou art not worthy
to be conſumed by ſuch noble fires,</p>
            <p>Was there over ſuch a pleaſant <hi>ſally</hi> as this heard on? <hi>Leonora, Angelica,</hi> and
<hi>Anſelme</hi> could not laugh at it, ſo much were they ſurpris'd with admiring it. And
to ſeem to <hi>Lyſis</hi> that they believ'd all he ſaid, they took his hat and view'd all about
with divers geſtures, and ſaid they were truly aſtoniſh'd at the power of <hi>Charite.</hi>
How now, houſwife! ſays <hi>Leonora</hi> to her, will you burn all thoſe that love you?
Go your ways I pray quickly into the Kitchin, and put your head in a pail of water
to quench the fire of your eyes, which night haply burn my houſe. Hereupon <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
went her way, though ſhe could not comprehend ought of what they ſaid to
her: but looking into her Panier, and miſſing ſome Linnen, ſhe comes and demands
it of <hi>Lyſis.</hi> You ſhall rather pluck out my eyes, then get the Favours which I have
of your, ſays he to her; I'll keep them as long as I live. She could get no more
of him for the preſent: But a good while after, when he thought to go his ways
with <hi>Anſelme,</hi> ſhe cryed out to <hi>Angelica,</hi> Madam, be pleas'd not to let him go!
he hath ſtollen the ſtock of a band from me; let him not go till he hath reſtor'd it.
Ah Shepherd! ſays <hi>Angelica</hi> to him, you are to blame to rob the Maids, in a houſe
where you are ſo civilly entertain'd. Dear <hi>Nymph!</hi> replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> I am no <hi>Thief,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:43725:48"/>
but of <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>affections:</hi> As for the Linnen which <hi>Charite</hi> asks for, <hi>Love</hi> hath
with good right given it me; if I ſhould reſtore it, he would be angry with me,
and would diſown me again for one of his favourites. <hi>Charite,</hi> who thought this no
ſatisfaction, pull'd him by the breeches as hard as ſhe could; and another Maid aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
her, he was forc'd into the Kitchin: where this other Maid, which was ſhe
that had beſprinkled him with the Roſe-water, told him, that he muſt not think to
carry any thing away from their houſe. And when he had replied, he had nothing
but thoſe Favours which were due to him, ſhe ſaid that he ſhould then reciprocally
give others to <hi>Charite;</hi> and that it was never ſeen that a ſervant took any thing
away from his Miſtreſs, without leaving ſomwhat inſtead of it. It happen'd in this
ſcuffle, that one of <hi>Lyſis's</hi> ſhoes was untied: This maid, who was a ſturdy quean,
took it quite off his foot, and ſaid, This favour ſhall be for <hi>Charite</hi> from her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant:
Now in good time he may go his wayes, we do not ask any thing of him.
Whereupon ſhe diſmis'd <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who was very glad to have gotten off ſo cheap; and
having taken his leave of the company, went along with <hi>Anſelme</hi> in a very pleaſant
poſture. Having but one Shoe, he went limping along for fear of ſpoiling his Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſuſtaining himſelf with a ſtaff that <hi>Gringalet</hi> had ſent him. Beſides that he had
taken his half-burnt Hat, which render'd him ſo gracefull, that he ſeem'd to be ſome
maim'd Souldier newly eſcaped out of a Battel. And indeed he himſelf was ſaying,
that as Warriours that have been at ſome skirmiſh do carefully preſerve their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and Head-piece, if an unhappy blow hath made any impreſſion on them, that
ſo afterwards they may ſay they were the firſt in the Charge; ſo would he preſerve
his burnt Hat, in remembrance of the danger he had been in by his approach to
<hi>Charite,</hi> and that peradventure he would hang it up for a Trophy in the Temple of
<hi>Love. Anſelme,</hi> with a ſerious look, told him he approved of the deſign: but it's
to be thought he laugh'd under the mask of ſuch an extravagancie; for he had well
obſerv'd how his Lacquay had burnt his hat with a burning-glaſs, and had purpoſely
permitted it. As for <hi>Gringalet,</hi> who with his fellow-Lacquay came behind, he could
not refrain laughing, and made more wry faces then a Puppet-players Ape.</p>
            <p>When they were come home, <hi>Anſelme</hi> gave <hi>Lyſis</hi> a gray Hat, and other Shoes.
And the Shepherd ruminating on what had happened to him that afternoon, ſwore
he never obſerv'd in any book, that any Lover had in ſo ſmall a while met with ſo
many rare adventures. He took out of his pocket the Linnen rags which had <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite's</hi>
blood; and having kiſs'd them divers times, and his bracelet of Yarn alſo, he
accounted all his pains well beſtow'd, and he was nothing troubled neither at the loſs
of his ſhoe, nor burning of his hat. As for the Bracelet, he made a vow to wear it
on his wriſt for ever; and as for the Linnen, he lock'd it up with the other Jewels
he had before receiv'd of his Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>All ſupper-time he talk'd of nothing but the heat of the beams which iſſued out
of <hi>Charite's</hi> eyes, and all the night he dream'd of nothing elſe. So that towards
break of day, the ſtrong impreſſions he had of it made him dream that <hi>Love</hi> had
plac'd him on a great block, where he burnt from the ſole of the foot to the crown
of the head. Awaking as he was in that torment, he perſiſted in the opinion that
he was in a fire; and ſtarting out of his bed, he went out of the chamber without
any thing about him but his ſhirt, and went down ſtairs crying as loud as he could,
Help, help! I burn! Ah cruel <hi>Charite!</hi> why are not your flames more remiſs?
In that poſture went he to a Spring which was in the middle of the Garden, and
caſt himſelf in, hoping to quench his fire. The baſon was four foot deep, and there
was water enough to drown him, if he had ſtaid there any time. But God, who ever
relieves Innocents and fools, ordered the Gardener to be already at his work. He
hearing his outcries, and the noiſe of his throwing himſelf into the Spring, came to
ſee what ail'd him: He came to him as he was dabling in the water like a Frog; and
after he had ſuffer'd him to bath and refreſh himſelf as much as he would, he help'd
him out. Had it not been for that good fortune, we ſhould not have been troubled
to make his Hiſtory any longer, and his life and adventures ſhould here have been
at a period.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:43725:48"/>
When he was out of the water, he came a little to himſelf, and imagin'd not he
felt any more heat, yet could he not get into the houſe without ſhaking, and would
not go to bed again, out of an opinion he had, that his bed produced flames. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme</hi>
got up to ſee what reaſon he had to make ſuch a noiſe, and having had the
ſtory from his own mouth, and from the Gardener, he made him change his ſhirt,
and put on his cloathes, that he might walk abroad with him to drive away the
time. <hi>Anſelme</hi> was never more at a loſs then now, he believ'd he had undertaken a
greater charge then he imagin'd, and though <hi>Lyſis</hi> might be in the fault, yet would
they require him better then he was, ſo that he knew not if it were his beſt courſe to
ſend him back to his Couſin. While they walkt, he thought fit to try if there were
no means to reſtore his minde to a better compoſure. Pray tell me one thing, ſays
he to him, Why do you ſo much dread the fire of <hi>Love?</hi> Why do not you get a
good Pail of water by your bed ſide when you go to bed, that you may quench it if
it lighten in good earneſt? Alas! friend, replyes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> my fire is a wildefire; its
compoſs'd of <hi>Sulphur vive, quick-lime, naphte</hi> and <hi>camphire,</hi> it burns in the water,
and if it hath been quencht in thy Spring, that hath only been by good hap. But
do not you think that the Frigidites of the minde, replyes <hi>Anſelm,</hi> may do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
againſt it? why do you not fortifie your ſelf with them? Alas! replyes <hi>Lyſis</hi>
with a ſigh, it is a long time ago ſince my heart hath had no ice, and that there is
nothing but flames inſtead. Will not artificial waters quench an artificial fire, ſays
<hi>Anſelme,</hi> weep till yours be quite out. My tears flow from without, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
but the burning coals are within, to what purpoſe were they? it ſhould ſeem rather
it were better not to ſhed them at all, that ſo remaining within they may aſſwage the
internal ravages of my love. Yet not to lye, when I weep, I feel ſome refreſhment,
and I am glad that people put me in minde of it. That's very well, ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi>
ſhed then abundance of tears. when you are before <hi>Charite,</hi> whoſe looks are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious,
that yeſterday ſhe was ſo near burning you, that you feel it yet. But now
I think of it, whence comes it ſhe hath ſo many flames ſeeing ſhe hath alſo as many
froſts, at leaſt for all other Lovers, if not for you? The fire is in her eyes, and the
froſt in her heart, replyes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> its a good diſtance between thoſe two, ſo that they
both preſerve their power. You are in the right, replyes <hi>Anſelme,</hi> but hath ſhe not
ſnow on her neck and breaſt, nay, and on her face too? ſhould not all this mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the heat that is in the torches of her eyes? There is in that a Miracle, anſwers
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> and yet it is no novelty; for I have read of certain mountains in the world
covered with ſnow, at the top whereof there iſſue out flames. I grant you that, ſays
<hi>Anſelm,</hi> yet you muſt ever allow me, that the ſnow which is about the flames of
<hi>Charite,</hi> doth extreamly abate the violence of the heat, ſo that ſhe cannot burn
you, but when you approach near her, as ſhe did yeſterday, and cannot caſt her fire
from her houſe hither? ſo that if you have felt any hear,'t hath been imaginary, and
the ſubtile <hi>Morpheus</hi> hath deceiv'd you. I almoſt believe it, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> for that cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
companion changes himſelf into fire and water when he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> continued in that belief, ſuffering himſelf to be perſwaded by the Antitheſes,
and other ſubtilties of Poetry, that it were in his power to make that there be fire, or
yee, or ſnow, and many other ſtrange things in his Miſtreſs, according as it pleas'd
him to ſay ſo. His opinion was, that there was no more to do then imagine them,
to give them reality. I do not know, whether the Poets are of ſo light a faith,
but they have at leaſt the ſame conceits, and they build their deſigns on the like
foundations. They hunt out plenty of contradictions, to advance their Artifices,
and they'll deſcribe you a breaſt of Ivory which arrows cannot wound, in the ſame
Miſtreſs to whom they had before given one of ſnow, which receives any impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
'Twere a long work to ſum up all their abſurdities: it ſuffices as to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
to let you know, that <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who was one of their principal diſciples, ſuffered
himſelf to be treated as they pleas'd. <hi>Anſelm</hi> was very joyful to finde him ſo tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and ever after entertained him with much confidence, ſhewing him how that
he muſt not fear that <hi>Charite</hi> would burn him, ſeeing there are no <hi>Divinities</hi> ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectleſs
of their honor, as to burn up their own <hi>Temples.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:43725:49"/>
'Twas this opinion reſtor'd him his ſoul, if I may ſo ſay; and his hoſt being a while
after to go to ſee <hi>Leonora</hi> all alone, was not afraid to leave him in the houſe. Nor
indeed did he ſtay our long, and being returned, he came and told him there was
a great news ſtirring; and that <hi>Leonora</hi> (who was a woman, and built a deſign in a
moment) was returning to <hi>Paris,</hi> with her daughter <hi>Angelica)</hi> Thou canſt give nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grace nor gravity to things ſays <hi>Lyſis</hi> to him, ſeeing <hi>Angelica</hi> is thy Miſtreſs,
as I have eaſily obſerved, oughteſt thou to mention her without a <hi>Paraphraſe?</hi> ſay
that <hi>Leonora</hi> who is the Queen of merit, returns into the Queen of Cities, with her
Daughter, who is the Queen of thy foul. Say that this <hi>Angelica</hi> prepares her wings
to flie away; that is to ſay, ſhe packs up her baggage, and folds up her ſmocks to
be gone. Why ſhould I make men believe that ſhe flies, replyed <hi>Anſelme,</hi> ſeeming
ſhe goes by Coach, and that <hi>Charite</hi> alſo bears her company? What! ſhe goes too,
the <hi>Beauty of Beauties!</hi> cry'd out <hi>Lyſis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Alas! I think their Coach will not go ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
faſt, for it will be heavily loaden, <hi>Charite</hi> carries away with her my heart, which
is ſo big with troubles and diſquiets, that the burthen of it cannot be light. But
what is this departure ſo ſudden, that I ſhall not bid her adieu, and kiſs her hand.
Ah! bleſſed opportunity! this long time ſhall I not recover thee. I muſt <hi>loſe</hi> my
ſelf, for having <hi>loſt</hi> thee, in <hi>loſing Charite,</hi> whoſe <hi>loſs</hi> makes me <hi>loſe</hi> all things. The
Shepherds Expoſtulation had been longer, if <hi>Anſelme</hi> had not comforted him by a
promiſe, that within three days they would go together to <hi>Paris</hi> to ſee their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes,
<hi>Lyſis</hi> was ſomewhat ſatisfied with that, yet was it not a little trouble to him
to conſider that he was to go into a City which he was not at all taken with, and
muſt forſake the <hi>Fields</hi> and the condition of <hi>Shepherd.</hi> But that nothing ſhould
burthen his minde, his good friend aſſured him over and above, that they had elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
enough to perſwade <hi>Charite</hi> to go along with them into <hi>Forreſts,</hi> as they
had already propoſed. <hi>Lyſis</hi> told him, that he ever cheer'd himſelf up with that
hope: and that if he had not ſpoken of it, 'twas becauſe there had not any occaſion
preſented it ſelf. However, he became very melancholick, and though <hi>Anſelme</hi>
would have carried him into ſome good company, yet he choſe rather to ſtay at
home, where he employed the whole day in reading the Tranſlation of <hi>Ovids Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis,</hi>
which had been borrow'd for him. In the ſame manner ſpent he the two
next days, never ſpeaking to his hoſt but at meals: for <hi>Anſelme</hi> went ſome way or
other to divert himſelf, and that he did not carry him to his friends, 'twas becauſe
he found him not in ſo pleaſant an humour in <hi>Charite</hi>'s abſence. Yet one evening
<hi>Lyſis</hi> had a deſign to be merry, and he bethought him of going to that place where
he had ſome days before heard ſuch a fooliſh <hi>Eccho.</hi> He intended for diverſions
ſake to Interrogate her: ſo he asked her three times very loud if ſhe were there?
and how ſhe did, but ſhe would not ſpeak; for <hi>Anſelme</hi> was not there to anſwer in
her ſtead. The Shepherd wondring at that ſilence, returned home very penſive, and
ſaid to <hi>Anſelme</hi> at Supper, that he thought that <hi>Nymph</hi> was dead. You are extreamly
deceiv'd replyes <hi>Anſelme,</hi> ſhe is naturally immortal. The Eccho which anſwered
you a while ago, is a member of that Muſician Eccho, which I mention'd to you:
now it is Metamorphos'd into a ſubtile voyce, which can go from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
You are to know, that ſince yeſterday, conceiving that you would have
been glad to have ſuch another Oracle in the Country whither we go, I thought fit
to take it for to tranſport thither, and you will never gueſs by what ſubtilty I could
do it. I meaſured the place whence that voyce could anſwer, and having overſpread it
with a large peice of Linen cloath, I retird about fifty paces, and having call'd on her,
I let her anſwer a good while then I pull'd a cord that I held, and all of a ſudden let
down the cloath, under which I took her, as a Partridge under the net. She is now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſs'd
in a Box, where ſhe ſhall remain till we be in ſome Muſick-room, or ſome fair
Garden fit to be her ſojourning place. Thou tell'ſt me wonders, ſaid <hi>Lyſis;</hi> how
couldſt thou conceal this from me till now? I know not how I came to tell you it
ſo ſoon, replyes <hi>Anſelme,</hi> for you are very curious, you would fain ſee my little
Nymph, and in the mean time I fear me, if I ſhould open her lodging, ſhe'll flie away
far from hence, now that ſhe is not yet grown familiar with us. For which reaſon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43725:49"/>
you muſt not ſee, no, not the Box: And let us talk no more of her, leſt the deſire
to ſee her increaſe in us by little and little. I am content, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> But tell me,
prethee, if thou ſeeſt her not, how doſt thou give her meat? I beg thou wouldſt
let me know it, and that thou conceal not from me if ſhe ſtand in much the keeping.
She is no charge to me, replies <hi>Anſelme:</hi> I only ſing ſometimes near her little lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or elſe I rap with a knife againſt a trencher, and ſhe is nouriſh'd with that found
which ſhe eaſily hears. Thou art as ingenious as <hi>Daedalus,</hi> and as ſubtile as <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi>
ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I remember that the Prince of <hi>Ithaca</hi> lock'd up the winds in a leather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag,
and carried them in that manner in his ſhip. They invention is well worth his;
there was never yet found in any book ſuch a thing as the tranſportation of
Eccho's.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having ſo ſaid, reſolved to ſpeak no more of it, fearing to loſe the pleaſure
which he hoped for. The time of their departure being come, <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſaid to him,
that ſeeing they were to return to the City, 'twas neceſſary he caſt off his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit,
otherwiſe people would follow him as an Inbabitant of the New world. At
firſt <hi>Lyſis</hi> would by no means conſent; but at length ſeeing that <hi>Anſelme</hi> threatned
him that he would never take notice of him, he took his former Cloaths which were
brought from the Country-mans houſe, where he had lodg'd when he became a
Shepherd. The Cloak was of Spaniſh cloth of a light-foot gray, and the Linings of
Taby pink'd of the ſame colour, and the Doublet and Breeches were of the ſame
ſtuff: Yet did he not conceive himſelf ſo brave in this cloathing as in the other; and
the regret he had to quit it had not been ſilenc'd, if <hi>Anſelme</hi> had not remonſtrated
to him, that men ceaſe not to be of a profeſſion, though they ſometimes leave off
the ſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>al habit thereof; that the Souldier is not always oblig'd to have his armour
about him, and that Kings loſe nothing of their Majeſty when they have not on
their Royal robes. So the Paſtoral habit and all its equipage was diſpos'd into the
bottom of <hi>Anſelm's</hi> Coach; and when they had well din'd, they got in, and drave
away for <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme's</hi> houſe was ſomewhere about the <hi>Temple,</hi> and was one of the faireſt in
that quarter: yet <hi>Lyſis</hi> found it tedious to be there, and ever and anon made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
his deſire to go and ſee <hi>Charite. Anſelme</hi> willing to content him, ſaid, that on
the morrow he would go and ſee if there were any means to give her a viſit: but
aſſoon as he was return'd thence, he comes to <hi>Lyſis</hi> and ſays to him, You will be
amaz'd at the news I bring you; 'tis ill, and yet withall 'tis good. <hi>Charite</hi> is not in
<hi>Paris;</hi> but ſhe is not departed hence, but to go into <hi>Forreſts.</hi> Ah! that's bravely
ſpoken, cry'd out <hi>Lyſis;</hi> for if I am troubled at her departure, I muſt on the other
ſide be glad that ſhe is gone into that place where I have ſo much wiſh'd her. But
tell me, doth <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> go along with her, and how this is come about?
They go, replies <hi>Anſelme:</hi> So that to be neer the object I adore, I muſt be for that
journy my ſelf. <hi>Leonora,</hi> you are to know, being weary of the world ſince the loſs
of her husband, intends to live in that Country, which is full of <hi>Shepherds,</hi> where ſhe
ſhall be entertain'd by <hi>Tircis,</hi> who ſtill bewails the death of his <hi>Cleon.</hi> Oh how well
is it conſidered of her! ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> I am confident ſhe hath read the life of the good
King <hi>Baſilius,</hi> and that ſhe intends to imitate him. He forſook his Royalties, and
came and liv'd with his daughters among the Shepherds of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> who cheer'd
him up with their <hi>Ecclogues:</hi> ſo will ſhe take a pleaſure to hear our Country ſongs;
for your part, you muſt become Poet and Muſitian as well as I.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> diſcover'd his ſatisfaction by many more words to that purpoſe; and if he
ſaid <hi>[you]</hi> to <hi>Anſelme,</hi> 'twas becauſe he conceiv'd he ought not to be familiar with
all the world, and that eſpecially in the City, where men lived not after the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
mode. <hi>Anſelme</hi> promiſed, that within a few dayes they would go wait on
their Miſtreſſes. <hi>Leonora</hi> was not gone into <hi>Forreſts,</hi> as he ſaid; 'twas a thing he
had deviſed, to be in more quiet with <hi>Lyſis:</hi> ſhe was gone but to <hi>Brie</hi> to ſee a ſiſter
of hers called <hi>Florida,</hi> married to <hi>Orontes</hi> a Gentleman of that Country. He had a
mind to go thither, and to take the Shepherd along with him, being reſolved to take
up lodgings in a little Town neer <hi>Oronte's</hi> Caſtle, becauſe he would not trouble him.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43725:50"/>
Now he had power enough over the ſpirit of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> to make him believe that <hi>Brie</hi>
was <hi>Forreſts.</hi> In five or ſix days all the buſineſs he had at <hi>Paris</hi> was diſpatch'd, ſo
that he was at liberty to purſue his Loves, and make ſport with his <hi>extravagant
Shepherd.</hi> They went together to ſee <hi>Adrian,</hi> and to take leave of him. He was very
glad to ſee his Couſin in his ordinary cloaths again; and conceiving his brain bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſetled, he thruſt into his hands ſome Peeces towards the expences of his
journey. The next day, as <hi>Anſelme</hi> was upon his departure, there fell out a buſineſs
of importance, ſo that he was forc'd to defer it for two or three days.</p>

            <p>THeſe tedious expectations were ſuch an affliction to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that he
thought his life would not have done him the favour to let him
once ſee the day of his departure. As he was taken up with this
conſideration, he lights on an <hi>Almanack</hi> in <hi>Anſelme</hi>'s ſtudy:
Ha! <hi>Parſon of Milmons</hi> (ſays he with a great tranſportation,
ſpeaking to the Author) doſt thou think with this <hi>Aſtrology</hi> to be
fit for the care and governing of a thouſand worlds, when thou knowſt not how
this one is diſpoſs'd? What! thou put'ſt down that this moneth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> hath
one and thirty days, and it is rather to be believed it hath one and thirty <hi>moneths!</hi>
Alas how thou art deceiv'd in thy Calculation! Prethee make a <hi>Kalendar</hi> apart for
thoſe that are in <hi>Love,</hi> and that at leaſt the hours may be days, the days moneths, the
moneths years, and the years ages. Thoſe days wherein a man ſhall ſuffer a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
torments without any comfort, ſhall be markt with black as the working days;
and thoſe whereon a man may ſee his Miſtreſs, and adore her, ſhall be markt with
red like Holidays. O famous invention! ſays <hi>Anſelm:</hi> but will you have no
<hi>Vigils</hi> nor <hi>Faſting-days? Vigil,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>Watching,</hi> replyes <hi>Lyſis:</hi> That word
muſt be every where, to ſhew that the Lover ſhould always <hi>Watch,</hi> for to be
thinking of his Miſtreſs; and for the <hi>Faſt-days,</hi> they are all thoſe that a man is
abſent from her, and that he is forc'd to be without ſuch delicate food. As for the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43725:51"/>
               <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>foul</hi> weather, cold and heat, the ecclipſes of the Sun and Moon, and the
fortunate and unfortunate days revealed by the Angel to honeſt St. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> all that
ſhall be judged according to the preſence or abſence, the favour or the diſdain of
that bright <hi>Star</hi> which hath an <hi>Aſcendant</hi> over us. And for <hi>Fairs,</hi> will you order no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
ſays <hi>Anſelme:</hi> No, anſwers <hi>Lyſis;</hi> for it ſeldom happens that an honorable
Lady will fell her ſelf.</p>
            <p>After that the <hi>Shepherd</hi> had thus diſcourſed as to that point, he reſolved to take
his cloak and walk a little abroad into the City. At the firſt corner of a ſtreet he
met, there was a man looking on a Paper ſtuck up by the Stage-players: he alſo
would needs read it, and having ſeen that they promiſed to repreſent an <hi>Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Paſtoral,</hi> one of the neweſt pieces of their Author, and withal a Maſquarade,
he immediately returned to <hi>Anſelme,</hi> to perſwade him to go ſee the Play. As good
fortune would have it, <hi>Anſelme</hi> had no buſineſs that afternoon, he therefore was
willing to ſee whether the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> Players did as well as their Majeſties,
ſo that he bid the Coach-man make ready the Coach to go thither. <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſeeing his
reſolution, went preſently to his Chamber, and put on his Shepherds habit, which
done, he came and preſented himſelf to his dear friend. You ſhal not go along with me
in thoſe cloathes, ſays <hi>Anſelme</hi> to him, all the world will laugh at us. And I'll laugh
at all the world, replyed <hi>Lyſis.</hi> When a man is to go to ſome place of Ceremony,
muſt he not obſerve the <hi>decorum</hi> as to cloathes? For this time permit me to dreſs
my ſelf according to my fancy. The Shepherds are going to repreſent their Loves;
I go to ſee them as a Judge, and yet you will not have me clad like them, I who
am of their Profeſſion: there is no reſpect ſhall prevail the leaſt with me in this
caſe. Do you think a Judge would look handſomly in his ſeat with a ſhort cloak,
while all the Councellors plead before him in their long Robes? <hi>Anſelme</hi> knew not
how to anſwer this; and ſeeing <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſo wilfully reſolved, he received him into the
Coach clad like a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> only cauſing his <hi>Scrip</hi> to be taken away, and hindring
him to take his <hi>Sheephook</hi> with him, which had been a thing over-ridiculous. As for
cloak, <hi>Lyſis</hi> would have none: and yet thoſe that ſaw him in the ſtreet, diſcovered
not his diſeaſe, but thought him ſome fantaſtick Gentleman, who loved to be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
clad.</p>
            <p>When they came to <hi>Burgundy-houſe, Anſelme</hi> meeting there with three or four
Noblemen, his friends, placed himſelf with them in the Kings Box, having the
Shepherd always at his Elbow. The Players having begun their Paſtoral, <hi>Lyſis</hi> was
extreamly attentive; and ſeeing a very handſome Shepherdeſs come on the Stage,
She is accompliſh'dly handſom, ſays he, but <hi>Charite</hi> goes beyond her.</p>
            <p>As ſhe was ſpeaking all alone in a thicket, there came a <hi>Satyre</hi> that would raviſh
her, but preſently there hapned a Shepherd to ſtart out, that reſcued her out of his
hands, and began to fight with him. 'Twas no ſmall buſineſs to <hi>Lyſis</hi> only to look
on; one while he turn'd to the one ſide, another while to the other, as he wiſh'd
the Shepherd ſhould do. And as men at Bowls, think the Bowl will go one ſide
or other according to their ſeveral poſtures; ſo did he bend himſelf divers ways,
and ſometimes pull'd at one of the pillars as much as he could, as if by that means
he could make the <hi>Satyre</hi> be overcome by the <hi>Shepherd.</hi> At laſt the <hi>Forreſt-god</hi> was
overcome, and was led away chain'd by certain Huntſmen who happen'd to paſs
by, ſo that <hi>Lyſis</hi> was very joyful, and ſaid that the Beaſt did well to deliver himſelf
up, and that if he had reſiſted any longer, he would have gone and helpt to beat
him, becauſe he believ'd it was the very ſame that would have done ſuch an affront
to <hi>Charite,</hi> as was done to that Shepherdeſs, and that he knew it again well enough.
This Act being done, the father of the ſame Shepherdeſs came and ſaid, that there
was fallen into his hands a Love-Letter, that a ſervant of his daughters had writ to
her, but that he would not have love him, and that he went to deſire a friend
of his to counterfeit the Characters of that Letter, and to write another, wherein
there ſhould be nothing but abuſes, Thereupon he ſpoke to that miſchievous Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,
and the buſineſs effected, that Letter muſt come to the hands of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs.
When it was delivered to her, <hi>Lyſis</hi> cryed out, he would never ſuffer
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43725:52"/>
ſuch a cheat, whereof he ſhould become a complice, if he did not diſcover it. Will
you take the Play for a truth? ſays <hi>Anſelme</hi> to him: Do you not ſee it is but the
Fable of a Fable? <hi>Lyſis</hi> regarded not this, but went out of the Box to look for
ſome place whence he might get upon the Stage. <hi>Anſelme</hi> would have gone after
him, to keep him in, that he might not betray his madneſs to all the world; but he
was hindred himſelf by thoſe that were with him, who deſired to ſee what <hi>Lyſis</hi>
would do, whoſe extravagancy they had already obſerved. He was by that time
gotten into the Tyring Houſe, when the Shepherdeſs enter'd the Scene to make her
complaints upon the pretended infidelity of her ſervant; ſo that he thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him to make haſte to ſpeak to her, and taking a Sheephook he lighted on by
chance, he enter'd the Stage, without being perceiv'd by the Actors. He ſtood
ſtill a good while in a handſome poſture, hearing what the poor amorous Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs
ſaid; for he knew not at which end to begin his ſpeech. Perceiving ſhe
ſpoke all in Verſe, he imagin'd ſhe was not to be entertain'd in Proſe, and that ſhe
underſtood not haply the Language: in fine, he thought himſelf able enough to
make a Diſcourſe in Rhime, as indeed he ſpake very good words, but ſhortning ſome
and lenthening others, ſo to give them the form of Verſes, and pronounc'd them
with an harmonious Accent.
<q>
                  <l>Fair Shepherdeſſe <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> believe not that your Lover loves you leſs,</l>
                  <l>Baniſh that errour which ſome will have you entertain: tis better,</l>
                  <l>'Tis not your Servant writ that Letter.</l>
                  <l>I tell you now, becauſe you are ſo full of charms,</l>
                  <l>I wiſh not Jealouſie ſhould cauſe your death or harms.</l>
               </q>
The <hi>Actreſſe</hi> was ſo ſurpris'd to hear this diſcourſe, and to ſee the Author of it, that
ſhe could not think on what ſhe was to ſay next; for indeed ſhe had not been long
in the Quality. Being aſham'd to ſtay there and ſay nothing, ſhe went off the
Stage, and <hi>Lyſis</hi> follow'd her. The people ſeeing this, began to hiſs at the Players;
and every one thinking that <hi>Lyſis</hi> was one of the company, they cry aloud, that
what he did was nothing worth. <hi>Anſelme</hi> and all thoſe with him could not hold
themſelves, ſo heartily did they laugh at the admirable adventure, and being curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to know what <hi>Lyſis</hi> was then doing, they went to him. They found the Players
quarrelling with him, for having interrupted their Play; and haply they would have
beaten him in the end, if they had not been appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d; for he had no other reaſon
to tell them, but that out of charity he would have undeceiv'd the Shepherdeſs,
which made them believe that he was come thither to abuſe them. But the reſpect
they bore the perſons that interceded for him, oblig'd them to ſilence: They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in their Paſtoral, and <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſtanding at one corner of the Stage, the reſt
returned into the Box. He was diſpos'd into a place where he was not ſeen of the
people; but towards the latter end, ſeeing a Shepherd brought before an Idol, where
they feign'd to ſacrifice him, he ſtarted out of his lurking hole, and believing that
all was real, went and ſaid,
<q>
                  <l>Ah! Inhumar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <l>Throw that Sword out of thy hand:</l>
                  <l>The Gods deſire not the lives of men,</l>
                  <l>He doth well that poures</l>
                  <l>Before them incenſe, and offers Milk, Fruits and Flowers.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>With the finiſhing theſe words, he endeavour'd to deliver the Victim out of the
Prieſts hands, who thruſt him back with two or three cuffs on the ear. A Lord
which was with <hi>Anſelme</hi> made ſigns to the Pages that were upon the Stage to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
the Shepherd; ſo that they kept him from being beaten by the Players. But
in the mean time there was below in the Pit, ſuch another Counter-ſcu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Pick-purſes, who come not there but to pick quarrels firſt, had all their ſwords
drawn, and making a flouriſh, conſtrain'd the <hi>Citizens</hi> to retire. <hi>Lyſis</hi> was dazzl'd
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43725:52"/>
with the ſhining of ſo many Blades, and not being able to imagine when<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order

He had no ſooner cryed out ſo, but the quarrel was appeas'd, and among the dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and among the hurt, there was but one hat loſt. Hereupon <hi>Anſelme</hi> went to look
for <hi>Lyſis,</hi> fearing he might cauſe any further trouble, and in the mean time the
Paſtoral was finiſhed.</p>
            <p>The Mummery at the end of the Play was pleaſant enough, yet he lik'd it not,
for he ſaid, it was not ſeeming that <hi>Shepherds,</hi> ſuch as he had erewhile ſeen, ſhould
diſguiſe themſelves into <hi>Jack-puddings,</hi> to relate a thouſand abſurdities in a place
where they profeſs gravity, and ſhould not ſpeak but with ſighs, and in amorous
and dying expreſſions</p>
            <p>At the going out of the houſe, thoſe which were with <hi>Anſelme,</hi> asked him in
particular, who that brave Shepherd was he had brought with him. He told them
in few words what he knew of him, and ſo enflamed their deſires to converſe with
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> that they each of them invites him to dinner, in hopes he might bring the
other with him: Yet <hi>Anſelme</hi> was forc'd to decline their civilities, becauſe his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
were more urgent, and could not diſpence with their entertainment: Yet
the next day in the afternoon, deſirous of a little diverſion, after ſome trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
buſineſs he had in the morning, would needs go abroad, principally indeed for
to avoid viſits, ſo he gave order the Coach ſhould be made ready. He ask'd <hi>Lyſis</hi>
which way they ſhould go; who anſwered, That he thought fit the preparatives
for their Jour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ey ſhould be look'd after, and that they ſhould go and buy good
ſtore of new books for their better inſtruction and conduct in their <hi>Loves. Anſelme</hi>
approving it, bid the Coach-man drive into St. <hi>James Street,</hi> among the Stationers.
They drove along our <hi>Ladies Bridge,</hi> where <hi>Lyſis</hi> having obſerved a Painters ſhop,
cry'd out, Hold, hold Coachman, we have ſome buſineſs here. The Coach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtaid: See you, ſays he to <hi>Anſelme,</hi> the Painters of <hi>Paris</hi> have already heard
of me; look, they have painted me in my Shepherds habit, and that with my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
hook. <hi>Anſelm</hi> looking about, ſaw in that ſhop a Shepherd painted, who by
accident had ſomewhat of the aire of <hi>Lyſis</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They went preſently out of the Coach, to view it nearer, and <hi>Lyſis</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the ſhop, ask'd for the Maſter. When he was come, Sir, ſays he to him, I
am very much oblig'd to you, that you have taken the pains to draw my picture:
but I finde here ſome faults, I pray correct them. You have made the knots of my
ſhoe-ſtrings <hi>blue,</hi> and they ſhould have been <hi>red;</hi> and here you have made me with a
ſet Ruff, whereas when I was at St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> I wore nothing but a plain band. Do
you think that Shepherds have the leaſure to ſet Ruffs; and if they had, to what
purpoſe were it in the fields, where the rain would ſpoil them, and the ſtorms rent
them? I proteſt to you, I'll never wear any. Beſides, I finde you have beſtow'd
too much Vermilion on my face, and tis neceſſary in the complexion of a <hi>Lover,</hi>
the <hi>Roſe</hi> give place to the <hi>Lilly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Painter was ſo ſurpris'd with this diſcourſe, that he was ſomewhat in doubt
they were come to jeer him; for <hi>Lyſis</hi> had not then on his white cloathes; but
<hi>Anſelme</hi> taking him aſide, in a ſerious manner ſpoke thus to him, The Gentleman
hath ſome reaſon to imagine that your intention was to draw his picture; for beſides
that, that countenance ſomewhat reſembles his, he hath worn ſuch cloathes, as
having been a long time of the company of Players, among whom he acted the
Shepherd. Obſerve him well now, take him for the preſent in dry colours, and
henceforth put his face to all the ſhepherds you repreſent. They will ſell extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for he is well known. Whereupon <hi>Anſelme</hi> turning to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> bid him have a
quarter of an hours patience, that he might be drawn more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the life. He was
very willing, and the Painter conceiving he might get ſomewhat by it, drew him the
beſt he could. Other Painters have ſince taken by that original, ſo that you hardly
ſee any thing beſides their Shepherds, either at their houſes or their ſhops in St.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43725:53"/>
               <hi>Germains Fair.</hi> When the Painter had made an end, <hi>Lyſis</hi> told him, he had done
but half his work, and that he muſt alſo draw the picture of his Miſtreſs, but he
would give him that which <hi>Anſelme</hi> had drawn, for to make another in her full
length by it. He had in his pocket that little Copper piece, which he ſhew'd the
Painter, telling him that he muſt graft that head upon a body cloath'd like a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs.
Sir, I do not apprehend any thing here, ſays the Painter, 'tis ſome Ridle
or Embleme, if I ſhould put it upon a body, people would take it for a Monſter,
'tis not fit for any thing unleſs it were to repreſent Anticks in the border of a peice of
Tapiſtry. How, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> do you not ſee it is a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> picture, full of
<hi>Scientifical Erudition?</hi> In what manner elſe do you imagine my Shepherdeſs can
be painted? You may do as you pleaſe, but you will never do it more fortunately,
then the Courteous <hi>Anſelme</hi> here; and inſtead of painting my Miſtreſs, you will
paint your own ignorance. <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſeeing he began to be angry, got him into
the Coach again, and having taken leave of the Painter, bid him paint according
to his fancy the Shepherdeſs, that he ſhould place near <hi>Lyſis,</hi> as he doth to his hour,
ſo that we never yet have had any true Picture of <hi>Charite.</hi> Thence <hi>Anſelme</hi> and
<hi>Lyſis</hi> went to St. <hi>James-ſtreet,</hi> to a Stationers that printed a world of <hi>Romances.
Lyſis</hi> would ſee none but the neweſt, as for the old, he needed them not, for he
had them all by heart. As they were bargaining for ſome of them, in comes <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenor,</hi>
who having paſs'd his Complements, acquaints them that <hi>Geneura</hi> was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.
<hi>Anſelme</hi> in the midſt of his Congratulations takes him aſide, and tells him
of his deſign to go to <hi>Bry</hi> to ſee <hi>Angelica,</hi> and his intention to take <hi>Lyſis</hi> with him,
making him believe it was the <hi>Forreſts</hi> Country. I am heartily glad of it ſays <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenor;</hi>
do not you know that the houſe I have bought is but a League from <hi>Orontes</hi>'s?
you ſhall not think of any other Quarters then my houſe. We'll be as merry as
the Maids. <hi>Anſelme</hi> accepting his courteſie, went to <hi>Lyſis</hi> and told him, that this
Gentleman had a houſe in <hi>Forreſts,</hi> and that he would bear them company thither,
ſo that a many ſalutations paſs'd between them. They ask'd him, what he, who
had a ſoul perfectly martial, come to do in the <hi>Latine</hi> Country: he anſwered, An
intimate friend of his had ſent him a little book for to be printed, and that he had
given it the Stationer, to ſee if it were worth it. The Stationer told him, he had
not had ſo much leaſure as to peruſe it, and taking ſeven or eight ſheets of Paper
written out of his Drawer, delivered them to him. This is what I ſpoke to you
of, ſays <hi>Montenor</hi> to <hi>Anſelme,</hi> I wiſh you had the patience to hear a peice of it;
you'll finde it the moſt pleaſant and ingenious thing in the world. <hi>Anſelme</hi> told him
he was ready to hear what ever ſhould be read. <hi>Lyſis</hi> alſo being entreated not to
diſſemble his opinion, ſaid, he would do the like, and that all came very opportunely,
and was conformable to the adventures of all <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and all <hi>Heroes</hi> in <hi>Romances,</hi>
who never go to any place, but they are entertain'd with ſome Hiſtory: So that
being all ſeated, <hi>Montenor</hi> read the following Diſcourſe.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>AVrora</hi> had already given the Watchword to the night to draw her
Curtains, and truſs up her Baggage to be gone, when the earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a Mornings Draught of pleaſant Dew, which gave occaſion
to thoſe that ſaw it to imagine, that the Gods were rinſing their
Bowls; or that it was the remainders of ſome Nectar, after a great
Feaſt; or that haply the Beautiful fore-runner of the Sun waſh'd her
hands at her upriſing, or that ſhe emptied her Chamber-pot: But though it might
have hapned to be any of all theſe, according to the ſeaſons, as men know well by
the different Dews which fall from heaven, yet was it not either of all thoſe things,
fell out then; for indeed it was nought elſe, but that the horſes which draw the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
of that Goddeſs who began to ſhew her ſelf, ſhook their mains at their ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the ſea. The Sun being oblig'd to follow her, had by this time put off
his Night-cap, and having put on his Caſſock of fine gold, had incircled his head
with beams. The minutes, who are his pages, help'd to make him ready, while
the hours having dreſs'd his horſes, and given them their Oates, were putting them
into the Chariot. It was eaſie for <hi>men</hi> hence to judge it would not be long ere he
would appear in the Celeſtial Vault; but they ſlighted his brightneſs, and having
juſt broke off a <hi>Debauch,</hi> that had laſted four and twenty hours, they turn'd day
to night, and went for the moſt part to bed. Nay, juſt then when the Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting
themſelves to their ordinary employments, ſeem'd to upbraid their Supi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
their greateſt buſineſs was to baniſh all care, nor could they now proſtrate
themſelves at any Altars, but thoſe of <hi>bacchus</hi> and <hi>Sleep. Jupiter</hi> who was wont
to receive the early addreſſes of ſuch as ador'd him in his Temples, was very much
ſurpris'd with this alteration; and not thinking fit it ſhould be ſaid, that while
<hi>Mortals</hi> entertained themſelves in all ſorts of pleaſures, the <hi>Gods</hi> ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to infinite toil (as for example the <hi>Sun,</hi> who perfected his courſe with that
diligence, that he had not the leaſure to wipe his noſe by the way) he reſolved to
treat them all at a ſolemn <hi>Banquet.</hi>

ſomewhat of a niggardly humour, was not well pleas'd that he ſhould put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to ſo great expence; and to take away the deſire he might have to effectuate
his reſolution, ſhe told him ſhe had not Napkins enough to entertain ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and that it was along time ſince <hi>Pallas</hi> had made her any cloath. Now you
are to note by the way, that this Linnen of the Gods is made of the thred of the
lives of Mortals, which is ſtill wound up in heaven, when the <hi>Deſtinies</hi> have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
it. That which hath belong'd to vertuous and illuſtrious perſons, is employ'd
in Shirts, Smocks, Handkerchiefs and Tablecloaths; but for what comes from Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
and other people of groſſer Education, there is only made of it Kitchin-Linnen,

remonſtrate to her husband, as to the trouble ſhe ſhould have to get her Linnen
waſh'd afte this great Banquet, he calls <hi>Mercury</hi> with a loud voyce, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to go and invite all the <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Goddeſſes</hi> of the Univerſe, to Sup with
him in his Palace which <hi>Vulcan</hi> had built upon the top of Mount <hi>Olympus. Mercury</hi>
the Childe of Obedience, preſently put on his <hi>Flying-ſhoes,</hi> and his <hi>Wing'd-hat,</hi> and
got his <hi>Caduceur,</hi> and having perus'd the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of the <hi>Gods,</hi> whom he was to
go and invite to the General Aſſemblie, he took his firſt flight to the <hi>Seventh</hi>
Sphere, where finding <hi>Fate, Nature, Fortune, Prometheus, Janus, Terminus,</hi> and
certain other Gods, with <hi>Saturn</hi> in his own Palace, he diſcharg'd himſelf of his Duty
and Meſſage to them. Thence he paſs'd through the fourth Heaven, where finding
the <hi>Sun</hi> newly entered his Carreer, he ſpoke to him at the ſide of his Chariot,
without giving him any occaſion of ſtay. This God promis'd him he would drive
his Steeds ſomewhat faſter then ordinary, and that he would make as much haſte as
if he took freſh horſes at every <hi>Sign,</hi> for to be at the place appointed ſoon enough.
<hi>Mercury</hi> having left him, comes down on earth, becauſe neither <hi>Mars,</hi> nor <hi>Venus,</hi>
nor the <hi>Moon,</hi> were yet poſſſeſs'd of their ſeveral Heavens. He went in the firſt
place to the Iſle of <hi>Lemnos</hi> to <hi>Vulcan,</hi> whom he found very buſie making of
<hi>Thunderbolts,</hi> for to munition <hi>Jupiters</hi> Arſenal, becauſe the iniquities of men were
become ſo great, that there was need of an infinite number to puniſh them all. He
deſired him to leave his work for a while, telling him that <hi>Jupiter</hi> was to make a
<hi>Banquet,</hi> to which he was come to invite him, and that he had the ſame Meſſage to
his wife and Son. <hi>Vulcan,</hi> who was nothing Complemental, anſwered him with
a frowning countenance, That he underſtood not what civility oblig'd him, to let
him go into his Wives Chamber, while ſhe was yet a-bed; but that as for his Son,
he might freely go to him. Whereupon <hi>Mercury</hi> went out of the <hi>Forge,</hi> into a
little Chamber, where he found <hi>Cupid</hi> playing with his little Trinkets, as Children
uſe to do. Having ask'd him what he did; <hi>Cupid</hi> anſwered, he was going to waſh
his headband, which had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ain foul ever ſince he had worn it, and that if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
the hearts of ſo many Lowers, and made them ſhed ſo many tears, it was for
no other end then to get water and aſhes enough to drive a Buck. The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of the King of the Gods laughing in himſelf at his excellent invention, told
him the occaſion of his viſit, and deſired him to acquaint his mother with it. This
paſs'd, he took leave of him, as alſo of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> curſing ſuch a jealous Cockscomb,
that having a wife ſo handſome, roſe ſo betimes from her, becauſe he would do as
other Forge-men; that is, get up in the morning to work. <hi>Vulcan</hi> who knew
he never went abroad without his hands, had an eye to all his tools when he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away,
but ſeeing he had not medled with any thing, he diſmiſſed him peaceably.
<hi>Mercury</hi> having occaſion to croſs the ſea, gave notice to <hi>Neptune,</hi> and all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
Court; ſo that he ſoon acquitted himſelf of his Ambaſſage to them. And from
thence he went to <hi>Aeolus,</hi> and did the like: That done, in one continued flight, he
got into <hi>Thrace,</hi> and having found <hi>Mars</hi> ſurbiſhing his Armor under a Tent, he
invited him to the banquet with the ſame Ceremony as the reſt. Having by this
time traverſed the whole earth, he forgot not ſtill in his way, <hi>Ceres, Bacchus,</hi>
PRIAPUS, <hi>Pan,</hi> the <hi>Muſes,</hi> and an infinity of other <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Nymphs,</hi> both of the
<hi>Forreſts</hi> and of the <hi>Fountains,</hi> and having learn'd the place whither the Suns <hi>Siſter</hi>
was gone, he went and ſpoke to her. But beſides all this, there yet remained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
that part of his Ambaſſage, which was to the Deities of Hell. He deſcends
into thoſe Profundities, and in his way meeting certain Shades, who only ſtaid for
his company, to paſs the <hi>Acheron,</hi> he drove them before him with his rod, as a
Shepherd drives his ſheep. Though he might have eaſily flown over the River, yet
he went into the Ferriboat for the entertainment ſake of the Ferriman, whom he
had ever profeſs'd a Friendſhip to, there being ſome relation between their ſeveral
charges. The fare for each Shade being paid, they placed themſelves in the Boat, and
<hi>Charon</hi> took his Oars in hand, while <hi>Mercury</hi> ſpeaks to him to this effect, Have I
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43725:54"/>
not imploy'd my time well, ſince I have entred an aſſociation with thee? And is
there not reaſon thou ſhouldſt be oblig'd to make me ſome annual Preſent, ſeeing
I am ſo diligent in ſtirring up all thoſe that are born under my Planet to a profeſſed
ſtudy of Cheats and Rogueries; whence there happens ſo many violent deaths,
that it muſt needs ſwell thy bags much? Beſides which, when I obſerved that the
ſhears wherewith one of the <hi>Deſtinies</hi> cuts off the threads of mens lives, were all
ruſty, and not able to cut but by halves, whence it hapned there were many hurt,
and few kill'd outright; I took them and cauſed them to be groun'd at my own
charge; ſo that at this preſent they cut ſo well, that men die with the leaſt touch,
without any languiſhing. And to the end we might the ſooner grow rich, I have
found the means to corrupt thoſe three Spinſters, and have gain'd them to our ſide;
and they have promiſed me they will make their thread ſo ſmall, that it ſhall break
ever and anon; and that when it breaks, they will gain at leaſt an inch of the length
that Fate hath allo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Alas, how unprofitable are our deſigns! replies <hi>Charon:</hi> For when we have
reckoned all, what advantage is there of all this, but to haſten a gain which at one
time or other muſt be ours. Yet were it a good enterpriſe, if when we have uſed
this expedition to deliver men from earth, we could hinder their enrolling among
the Gods: for there are ſo many <hi>deified,</hi> that my profit is much the leſs for it. If
this cuſtom be continued, I muſt preſent a Petition to <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Pluto,</hi> to beg of
the one that he would not deprive me of my dues, and of the other that he would
abate of the rent of this Boat, for which I pay him an exceſſive rate. And if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not juſtice, I'll go into the world again, and keep a Boat ſomewhere on the
River <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where I am, yet I think I muſt take the other reſolution: For, my friend <hi>Mercury!</hi>
here is a world of news ſtirring. Among the <hi>Patentees</hi> and Projectors which thou
broughtſt me a while ſince, there is one of them the moſt miſchievous Pate that ever
was. He is become our Kings earwig, and ſeeds it with damnable projects: He hath
propoſed to him the building of a Bridg over this River, and hath endeavoured to
make it appear to him it were more commodious then my Boat, becauſe then the
Shades might at any time paſs over in troops, without ſtaying at all on the ſhore,
as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ow they do. Beſides all this, it is taken into conſideration, that the ſouls of
Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſts which come hither to ſtay a while, and return into other bodies, might paſs
over the bridge thick and threefold. And which is more then all, there are many
proud ſpirits of <hi>Princes, Captains,</hi> and rich <hi>Patentees,</hi> which would enter Hell, ſome
in <hi>Sedans,</hi> ſome on <hi>horſe-back,</hi> and ſome in Coaches; all which might be eaſily
provided for. <hi>Pluto</hi> would gain much by this deſign; for where now they give the
corps but a ſheet, men would not then diſmiſs it without ſome rich robe, and they
would bury it with its richeſt treaſures, ſeeing the dead party permitted to carry
them into hell. Now I do not ſuffer in my Boat nor bag nor baggage, for fear of
being overloaden; and if any one have ever ſo little, he leaves it behind on the
ſhore, where I lay it up, and that hath been ever my greateſt profit. Our King ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

been informed of it, and being deſirous to appropriate all that to himſelf, he will
very ſhortly cauſe the water-ſledges of his Bridge to be planted: I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I ſhall receive the Toll ſhall be taken of thoſe that paſs over; but if I ſhould,
yet would my gains be much diminiſhed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Charon</hi> having thus ſpoken, <hi>Mercury</hi> promiſed him his endeavours to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
for him with <hi>Pluto:</hi> And thereupon being come to the ſhore, he enter'd Hell,
and went to look for the King of Shades. Having found him in his chamber, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
with <hi>Proſerpina</hi> of his antient Loves, he invited them both to <hi>Jupiters
Banquet.</hi> Having recover'd the Earth again, he remembred him that he was yet to
ſpeak to <hi>Peace, Honour, Victory, Vertue</hi> and <hi>Fame:</hi> which he was ſomwhat trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at, for he knew not where to find all theſe Deities. At laſt bethinking himſelf
that they muſt needs reſide in good houſes, he went to a certain Kings palace; and
having put on the form of a Page, he ask'd the firſt Courtier he met, whether he
knew not where <hi>Vertue</hi> was? He ſhew'd him up a narrow pair of ſtairs, telling him
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43725:55"/>
he ſhould find her there. <hi>Mercury</hi> went up to the very top, and thence into divers
chambers, where he finds a ſort of people diverſly imploy'd. Some were at Dice,
and at every caſt, caſt out blaſphemies, as if their imprecations had been words of
conjuration to make them win. There were others diſcourſed of certain publike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
wherein yet they regarded nothing but their private intereſts. And there were
a many others whoſe imployment was to ſing, dance, drink, and court: Yet there
wanted not to be in the place <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Orators,</hi> who maintained all their actions
<hi>vertuous.</hi> But <hi>Mercury</hi> was not deceiv'd in them; and he diſcovered well enough
at the end of a Gallery, <hi>Fraud, Flattery,</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> debating the fortune of a
Favourite. Having asked them where Vertue was, theſe lewd Goddeſſes laugh'd,
and told him they had no acquaintance with her, becauſe ſhe was ſo rough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly,
that ſhe underſtood not ſo much as to obſerve civility and correſpondence
with the world; and that he ſhould never find her but among ruſtick and ſimple
people. He preſently vaniſht away; and having fled into a very ſavage place, he
enters a little cottage, where a poor Country-fellow lay a dying. Having asked him
ſome tidings of her whom he look'd for, the poor ſick man told him, that while he
lived his endeavour had been ever to have her in his company; and that ſhe had
juſt left him, having commended him to his good <hi>Genius</hi> to conduct him to the
<hi>Elyſian fields:</hi> but that he believed not his children had retain'd her, though it had
been always his deſire ſhe ſhould have been entertained by them. <hi>Mercury</hi> being
ſomewhat troubled at this, bethought him it was moſt likely <hi>Vertue</hi> was among thoſe
who taught her precepts to others: And ſo he went into an Univerſity among the
<hi>Philoſophers;</hi> but there he found nothing but <hi>Vociferation, Pride, Doubt,</hi> and <hi>Vanity.</hi>
He walkt all up and down, and at length entring into the <hi>Library,</hi> he perceives the
Goddeſs he look'd for ſeated among the Books. Having ask'd her what ſhe did
there, ſhe told him ſhe had no other abode; and that though many came thither
to ſeek her, yet they never carried her away with them when they had found her.
<hi>Mercury</hi> told her that he came to invite her to ſupper in the Palace of <hi>Olympus,</hi>
whereat ſhe was very joyfull, for ſhe had long ſince wiſh'd to quit the earth as well
as <hi>Juſtice.</hi> He thereupon ask'd her where he might find the other Deities he
look'd for, and whether <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> ever came into her company? No, ſayes
ſhe, go ſeek thoſe that drink luſtily, and thoſe that are great Gameſters, or
that are exceſſively expenſive, there you have them. As for <hi>Peace,</hi> ſhe is only
among thoſe that have nothing, and <hi>Victory</hi> among thoſe that can beſt deceive.
<hi>Mercury</hi> having had this intelligence, went preſently to ſeek for thoſe Deities, who
all promis'd him to come to the Banquet; except <hi>Fame,</hi> who excus'd her ſelf, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That it was not for her that <hi>Ambroſia</hi> was made, and that ſhe fed on nothing
but Wind. <hi>Mercury</hi> obſerving ſhe had a hundred Mouths, bethought him it was
well done of her not to come to <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Palace, ſeeing ſhe muſt have brought
<hi>Famine</hi> along with her, and that <hi>Juno</hi> would not have bidden her very welcome,
taking her rather for a Monſter then a Goddeſs. After that, the Ambaſſador
found <hi>Aurora</hi> in a Wood, where ſhe ſought a <hi>Huntſman,</hi> whom ſhe was in love
with: Having done his Meſſage to her, he returned to the palace of Mount
<hi>Olympus,</hi> to ſee what they did there. As for the Gods which were <hi>fellow-Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
at his Fathers table, he invited them not, the Ceremony as to them was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.
He found them all employed in the preparations of the <hi>Banquet;</hi> and divers
others who were oblig'd to ſome attendance to their great King, were already
come. <hi>Vulcan</hi> who is accuſtomed to be near the Fire, had the charge of head-Cook,
and was aſſiſted by the <hi>Cyclopes,</hi> whom he had brought with him. He was a
pleaſant ſpectacle in his Green Waſtcoat, his White Apron, and Black Night-cap
coming down over his ears. The firſt Meſs they prepar'd was <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> which
they diſguiſed infinite ways, becauſe that food which was very common among the
Gods, was not of any delicacy, when dreſs'd after the uſual manner. <hi>Vulcan</hi> made
ſome into Broth, ſtew'd ſome, fry'd ſome, and ſome he dreſs'd hotch-potch wiſe,
and ſome he diſpoſed like Oat-Cakes. But all that being no great matter, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that ſeeing he was reſolved to make a ſolemn BANQUET,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43725:55"/>
there muſt be other meats. <hi>Jupiter</hi> having given him commiſſion to take what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
he pleas'd, he caus'd <hi>Plato</hi> to be call'd, and ſome other <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> whom
he had purpoſely ſent for out of the <hi>Elizian Fields.</hi> He commanded them to aſſiſt
him, and to make appear they were not altogether unprofitable in the world, as
they had been often reproach'd; <hi>Plato</hi> was charg'd to make ready his <hi>Ideas,</hi> which
muſt needs be very delicate food for Divine Palates; and another Philoſopher,
whoſe Tenent had ever been, that <hi>ſouls</hi> were <hi>Corporeal,</hi> received order to take the
<hi>ſouls</hi> of ſuch beaſts as dyed and eſpecially of thoſe which were ſacrificed, and roaſt
them on broaches, or make Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>'d-Pies of them. This is the moſt ſolid nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Gods, and they are obliged to <hi>Vulcan</hi> whoſe invention was the cauſe
they were not loſt. Yet <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who was only task'd with making the Sauces,
came all in a fume to <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and told him, in maintenance of his own Doctrine,
that he was to blame, and that thoſe poor ſouls which he caus'd to be maſſacred,
had ſometimes lodg'd in humane bodies, and that they ought to return thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and that the Gods deſired not to make their food of the ſouls of men. But it
was to much purpoſe that he cryed out, the other Philoſophers ruſh'd into the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
telling him, that though they were the ſouls of men which they made ready,
yet they ſhould think themſelves very happy to become the nouriſhment of the
bodies of the Gods, and to be made a part thereof. Notwithſtanding all this, when he
ſaw the neck of ſome Pullet ſtruck off, he cryed out as loud as if his own throat
had been Cut. Beſides, he did nothing but diſturb the Cocks, being deſirous to beat
his <hi>Numbers</hi> into their heads. He taught them, that there ought to be ten peeces in
every fryed Meſs, that ſo it might not be without harmony, and that it might have
all its conveniences and proportions; and if they dreſſed any <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> he inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to diſpoſe it into three Meſſes, affirming that that number was the meaſure
of all things, and that the Gods delighted in an uneaven number. <hi>Vulcan,</hi> who
underſtood nothing of all this Philoſophy, took the Ladle out of one of the Kettles,
and ſtriking him therewith with as much fury and good will as if it had been a dog
that had eaten a ſhoulder of Mutton, bid him not interrupt him any further, and go
and make uſe of his Arithmetick in the Hall, to ſee if there were that number of
Trenchers and Chairs that ſhould be. That which had angred this Maſter-cook the
more was, that in making towards him, he had with his crooked Leg overturn'd
a Meſs of <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> which had been put on the hearth to be kept warm; ſo that he
repented him he had not made Minc'd-meat of that Philoſopher, as he had done
of the ſouls of Beaſts. When his anger was paſt, conſidering, that all that was
prepared was not too much for ſo great an Aſſembly of Gods, he found the means
to dreſs them another moſt excellent Service, but he muſt firſt propoſe it to <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
without whoſe permiſſion nothing could be done. He went therefore and told him,
that among the Celeſtial bodies there were many living creatures, which did not
any good there; and that there would never fall out a better opportunity to eat
them then now. <hi>Jupiter</hi> would not conſent, ſo that <hi>Vulcan</hi> was fain to ſpeak to
him to this effect; May it pleaſe your Majeſty, It is a long time ſince you have
made any Entertainments, and they ſay, no feaſt like that of a Miſers: It is to no
credit to be at the expence of a ſmall matter. <hi>Mortalls</hi> will not bear you that
reverence they do, if they come to know you keep not better chear then they:
Do you not obſerve how they kill the Beaſts they have on <hi>earth,</hi> for their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
why will not you do the like by thoſe you have in <hi>Heaven?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Jupiter</hi> overcome by the reaſons of his Son, bid him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſend his <hi>Cyclopes,</hi> to take
down all the Signs that were good Proviſion. The buſineſs was as ſoon done as
ſpoken; ſo <hi>Brontus, Pyragmon</hi> and ſome others of the Scullions brought away the
<hi>Hare,</hi> the <hi>Swan,</hi> the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> the <hi>Whale,</hi> the <hi>Ram,</hi> the <hi>Bull,</hi> the <hi>Crab,</hi> and the
<hi>Fiſhes,</hi> all which they made ready in divers manners: Nay, they did not ſpare
the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Bear,</hi> the <hi>Hydra,</hi> nor the <hi>Wolf,</hi> and ſome other Beaſts, whoſe
fleſh was thought ſomewhat hard and indigeſtible: For <hi>Vulcan</hi> affirm'd they were
already half bak'd, becauſe they had been ſo long faſtned to ſtars.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the meat was thus in making ready, <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Iris</hi> made it their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43725:56"/>
work to accommodate all within the Palace. It was built of <hi>Petrifi'd</hi> Clou'ds, and
the walls were enamell'd with ſuch a diverſity of colours, that they defi'd all Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry.
There wanted nothing but the ſweeping of the floor, wherein thoſe God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes
were ſomewhat at a loſs for a broom. In this trouble comes in <hi>Aeolus,</hi> with
a great bunch of Keys at his Girdle. He had lock'd up all the <hi>winds</hi> within their
Caves, except the <hi>Zephir,</hi> which as his Minion, went always with him, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up his train. He perceiving the trouble of the Queen of the Goddeſſes, ſwell'd
up his Cheeks, and blew ſo about the Hall, that he eaſily drove out all the duſt
before him. His Miſtreſs <hi>Flora,</hi> who could not forſake him, came preſently after,
with divers other Nymphs, who ſtrew'd Flowers all about. <hi>Hercules, Mercury,
Caſtor, Pollux,</hi> and other of the houſhold ſet the Tables right, laid the Cloathes,
and plac'd the chairs. Theſe moveables were made of the <hi>Trees,</hi> into which men
had been of old <hi>Metamorphos'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> having put on their beſt cloathes, came in to entertain the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and preſently after entered <hi>Ceres,</hi> who caus'd to be brought in as good bread
as ever was bak'd; and after that <hi>Bacchus,</hi> with <hi>Pan</hi> and the <hi>Satyres,</hi> who were
loaden with bottles, which they diſcharg'd themſelves of near the ſide Table. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus</hi>
who follow'd them was the Butler, and was already ſo drunk, that it was not
thought he could have drunk any more; he ſtumbled ſo oft, as if his legs had been
made of Tough, ſo that they gave him a chair, which came in good time for him
to repoſe his panch in, which was ſwollen like the Sail of a ſhip in a good wind.
While <hi>Ceres, Bacchus,</hi> and all the Gods of the Fields were in their Complements,
<hi>Pluto</hi> came in with his wife, who ſince her going to <hi>Hell,</hi> was become ſo fottiſh,
that ſhe had forgotten all manner of Civility and Complement. She made a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezy
to the Company, and with a ruſtick ſimplicity came and ſaid to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> We
muſt confeſs indeed Father, you do us a great favour to invite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> to Supper here, we
were ſad enough at home; when we were gotten into our Chariot for to come out of
hell, our <hi>Dog</hi> came and leapt upon me, and did ſo lick and kiſs my cheeks with all his
three tongues, that I could hardly part with him. I thought once to have brought
him with me, he had at leaſt done you ſome ſervice in turning the ſpit; and then
you will not believe what a pretty Cur it is, he dances on his hind feet, and fetches
any thing you caſt to him. You have done better to have left him behind you,
Daughter, ſays <hi>Jupiter,</hi> for beſides that, it is not a Dog to be carried in ones ſleeve,
we have others here whom he might have bitten with his ſix ranks of Jaws. Do you
not know-well, that we have here a <hi>Dog</hi> among the <hi>Stars?</hi> Tis he that picks the bones
of the Celeſtial Fowl, which is ſometimes eaten at our Table, and as for yours, he
ſhould only pick the bones of dead men? But how comes it you have not brought
my ſon <hi>Minos</hi> along? If we ſhould have brought him, replyes <hi>Pluto,</hi> aſſuming
the Diſcourſe, the two other <hi>Judges,</hi> and the <hi>Deſtinies,</hi> the <hi>Furies</hi> and <hi>Charon</hi>
would have come too, and in the mean time you know they cannot quit their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
for one moment, without a deſign of deſtroying all mankinde.</p>
                        <p>As <hi>Pluto</hi> ended his Remonſtrance, the arrival of <hi>Mars</hi> dazzl'd the Aſſembly
with the glittering of his Armour. His Muſtachoes were turn'd like the Gard of
a Poignard, that ſo it might ſeem his very face was armed, and his eyes were fiery,
as thoſe of a Lyon in a fury. Yet was there nothing but what was honorable in his
Salutations to <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the reſt; and <hi>Venus</hi> entring thereupon into the Hall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
who ſpoke nothing but of vanquiſhing others, confeſſed himſelf overcome. She
was attended by her <hi>Son</hi> and the three <hi>Graces,</hi> who had ſpent the whole day in
dreſſing her. After her came in <hi>Pallas,</hi> who in the midſt of her gravity had ſome
features, that rendred her <hi>Amiable:</hi> And then came the <hi>Moon,</hi> and her <hi>Brother</hi> the
<hi>Sun,</hi> who having retain'd ſome of his beams about his head, ſufficiently enlightned
the place. He was ſo Complemental, that he would ſalute the Ladies one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but as his mouth was near that of <hi>Juno's,</hi> to kiſs her firſt: ſhe ſtarts back pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
feeling the heat of his muſtacho's, which began to burn her cheek. <hi>Jupiter</hi>
perceiving it, told him he was to blame, that he had not bath'd his chin in cold
water, when he laid aſide his fires. You do not conſider, that I was in ſuch haſte to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43725:56"/>
come hither, replyes <hi>Phoebus,</hi> that I had not the leaſure to caſt my ſelf into the ſea,
where my fair Hoſteſs <hi>Amphitrite</hi> ever prepares me a bathe. She entertains me there
at mine Hoſt's Table, I am afraid ſhe'll make me pay for to day, though I ſup not
with her.</p>
                        <p>While he ſaid this, <hi>Neptune, Amphitrite, Palemon,</hi> and many other Sea-Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
arriv'd, who told him that he was not ſo rigorouſly dealt with as he would
make believe, and that he had his lodging very cheap. Their diſpute was not heard,
becauſe <hi>Saturn, Janus,</hi> and the other ancient Gods came in at the ſame time, whom
they were on all ſides buſie to receive. There was only <hi>Juno,</hi> who was not well
pleas'd with their coming. When ſhe ſaw <hi>Janus</hi> with his two faces, ſhe cryed out
to her husband, did I not tell you that you would ruine your ſelf? You counted
but one perſon in attendance to your Father, and behold there's two. This glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<hi>Janus</hi> hath two great faces, and two huge mouthes, which can each of them
devour as much meat as four. I am reſolved he ſhall not be entertained here; he
ſhall not be at our Table, for he will ſtarve all the reſt. Let him go to the gate, 'tis
his ordinary charge to keep it. Alas, what do you trouble your ſelf Sweet-heart!
ſays <hi>Jupiter:</hi> What will my Father ſay, when he hears you will not have him bring
along with him one he makes ſo much of. Conſider, that though <hi>Janus</hi> hath two
mouthes, yet he hath but one belly and two hands, ſo that he can eat no more then
any of the reſt, and his body can contain no more then what is reaſonable. The
mouth which he hath behinde, ſerves him to no purpoſe but to draw in the wind
which comes that away: And I muſt tell you beſides that, he may be of good uſe
at the Table, ſeeing that out of reſpect to <hi>Saturn</hi> he muſt be admitted; for now I
think on't, he muſt be placed towards the ſide Table, that with his hind-eyes he may
look to the wine, which this doting <hi>Silenus</hi> will not husband ſo well, and ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that theſe drunken <hi>Satyrs,</hi> who are to wait, drink it not all: As for the Office
of Porter, do not you trouble your ſelf, for I have given it the <hi>Sagittary</hi> of the
Zodiack.</p>
                        <p>While <hi>Jupiter</hi> gave his wife theſe conſolations, the Gods made ſport with <hi>Janus,</hi>
who to make appear to them that there was nothing to be found fault with as to
his perſon, went and kiſt <hi>Venus</hi> with the mouth behinde, and with his hands draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him one of the <hi>Graces,</hi> kiſs'd her with the mouth before. There's a Wag,
ſays <hi>Phoebus,</hi> he ſhould have two wives, he hath this advantage over us, that he can
kiſs two at once. But you may ſay as well, ſays the ſubtil <hi>Prometheus,</hi> that he may
at the ſame time receive four boxes in the ear.</p>
                        <p>In the midſt of this jeſting, <hi>Aurora,</hi> the <hi>Muſes,</hi> and ſome others arrived; ſo
that there was a great noiſe of Chariots, and neighing of Horſes at the Palace gate.
<hi>Jupiter</hi> ſeeing all the Gueſts were come, commanded the <hi>Banquet</hi> ſhould be ſerved
up. The <hi>Sun</hi> and his <hi>Siſter</hi> had light enough about them, to chaſe away the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity
of the Hall; however, to obſerve order and decency, they faſtned to the
walls certain plates of gold, which inſtead of Torches had Armes of ſilver, and at
the hands thereof, there were ſo many ſtars nailed.</p>
                        <p>Hereupon <hi>Mercury,</hi> who was the <hi>Clark</hi> of the <hi>Kitchin</hi> enters, with the <hi>Fawns</hi>
and <hi>Satyrs,</hi> who brought up Meſſes, which he diſpos'd upon the Table. <hi>Jupiter,
Saturn, Pluto, Neptune, Juno, Venus,</hi> and the reſt of the Company having waſh'd
their hands in the water of <hi>Eridan,</hi> ſate them down without any diſpute, every one
according to their quality. The King of the Gods, according to the cuſtom of all
great Princes, had his <hi>Phyſician</hi> on the one ſide, and his <hi>Jeſter</hi> on the other. And
that was <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> and <hi>Momus,</hi> the one whereof was there to overſee what
meats were to be eaten, and the other to carp at the actions and words of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
The firſt bout <hi>Momus</hi> had, was with his Maſter, telling him, that he knew
not the reaſon why he had not invited <hi>Diſcord</hi> to his Banquet, no more then he had
not done at the Marriage of <hi>Thetis,</hi> and therefore he muſt expect ſhe ſhould come
to ſow ſome diſſention to trouble the Feaſt; and that there is not on Mount <hi>Ida,</hi>
any Shepherd able to decide the differences of the Divinities.</p>
                        <p>If there be no more illuſtrious Shepherds on the Mountain of <hi>Ida</hi> (ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43725:57"/>
the Narration of <hi>Montenor,</hi> be it known, there is at this preſent one at the
foot of the Mount of St. <hi>Geneuieuſue,</hi> and let not the Gods be any thing troubled, I
am as able a Iudge as <hi>Paris.</hi> All this is long ſince paſt, ſays <hi>Montenor,</hi> do not think
it a thing preſent. There's no queſtion but that if you had been in the world when this
<hi>Banquet</hi> was made, <hi>Momus</hi> had remembred you: I pray do not any further diſturb
the Gods at their meat: A Maſons Boy will have his hour. <hi>Montenor</hi> having ſo
ſaid, obtain'd ſilence, and having look'd into his Paper, went on in this manner:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iupiter</hi> anſwered <hi>Momus,</hi> that he had well conſidered what he ſaid, and that he
had already taken order that their enjoyments ſhould not be interrupted. And if
he had not invited <hi>Diſcord,</hi> nor the <hi>Furies, Famine, Envy, Sadneſs</hi> and <hi>Poverty,</hi>
whoſe company is ever unpleaſant, he would ſend them each their Meſs, that ſo they
might not grumble.</p>
                        <p>While this paſt, the moſt part of the Gods took bread: <hi>Saturn</hi> cut it with his
<hi>ſithe, Bacchus</hi> with his <hi>pruning-hook, Mars</hi> with his <hi>cymiter,</hi> and divers of the reſt
with <hi>Ceres</hi>'s <hi>ſickle</hi> which ſhe lent them. And as for meat, <hi>Neptune</hi> took him ſome
with his <hi>trident; Pluto</hi> with his <hi>ſcepter,</hi> which is made in the faſhion of a <hi>fork; Venus</hi>
with the point of her Sons <hi>dart;</hi> and the daughter of <hi>Latona</hi> would needs be doing
with the point of her <hi>javelin,</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> with the top of her <hi>lance.</hi> For the Gods
are never without their Arms, no not when they are at table; becauſe if they had
them not about them, they could not be diſtinguiſhed one from another. As for
example, if you ſee a picture or ſtatue of <hi>Mercury,</hi> how will you know it is he, if he
have not his <hi>Caduceur?</hi> It ſtood them upon at leaſt to have about them the marks
of their Divinity, as <hi>Jupiter</hi> who had his <hi>thunderbolt,</hi> which his <hi>Eagle</hi> held in his
beak cloſe by him. Yet he thought it not handſom to permit the Gods to cut bread
with their Arms; for <hi>Saturn</hi> in uſing his great Sithe had already ſaluted his Goſſip
<hi>Janus</hi> in the jaw-bones with the handle of it, and had drawn blood at his teeth.
<hi>Mercury</hi> was much blamed, that he had not taken order for knives and forks at the
table, ſo that he was fain to go immediately to ask for ſome of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> who had
enough: So he came immediately back, and furniſh'd all the company.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Momus,</hi> whoſe chiefeſt deſire was to ſee the the Gods quarrel, reaſſum'd his
diſcourſe, and ſaid to <hi>Prometheus,</hi> Thou art now very proud to eat at the table of
the Gods, whereas time was when thy own Liver was the food of birds. Do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
my antient miſeries, replies <hi>Prometheus;</hi> it ſuffices that <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath pardoned
me, knowing my offence was not ſo great as he had thought: He thought, that
having formed the body of a man, I impudently came even to heaven to ſteal fire to
animate it: But I made appear to him my more modeſt carriage; I only had the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the Burning-glaſs, which when I expos'd to the Sun, I drew his fire to
me without ſtirring from earth. I am glad of the occaſion to tell thee thus much,
before ſo many other Gods who knew it not before.</p>
                        <p>It is a very commendable thing, ſayes <hi>Saturn</hi> interpoſing in the diſcourſe,
to forget old quarrels: Should I ſuffer any thing to be ſaid of what hath
happened to <hi>Prometheus,</hi> I ſee it would be my turn at length to be made Table-talk.
In the mean time let there no ſtories be made of my fortune; I am no other then
what I would be. It is true, time hath been I ſate on the ſame throne whereon <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
now ſits; but it was no longer then Innocencie dwelt among men; and now
that they are become miſchievous, I would not be oblig'd to govern them. While
I reign'd, they cared not for riches; and if that Age was call'd the Golden age, it
was becauſe their ſouls were of gold, and not their Plate. Can it be imagin'd that I
who cauſed others to live with ſo little ambition and avarice, am troubled at the
loſs of my Kingdom? and may it not eaſily be diſcovered that it became me to ſhake
hands with the affairs of the world, for to enjoy that tranquility which others had
enjoyed by my means?</p>
                        <p>While <hi>Saturne</hi> ſaid thus, <hi>Momus,</hi> who knew he contemn'd not the royalty but
becauſe he could not obtain it, went and made a thouſand wry faces behind him, and
had a great itch to anſwer him: but he was hindred by a loud ſhout of laughter,
which hapned at the lower end of the table. <hi>Iupiter</hi> deſirous to know the occaſion,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43725:57"/>
it was told him, that the God <hi>Terminus,</hi> who had no arms at all, had bowed down
his head into a Platter for to eat ſome <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> dreſs'd with Nectar-ſawce, and
that the Meſs was ſo hot, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> off his noſe and lips. What pitty it is,
alas poor <hi>God!</hi> (ſays <hi>Momus</hi> with a Scoggin-geſture) I know not who hath maim'd
him in that manner; he hath neither legs nor thighs, yet had he but arms and
hands, he might go on his Arſs like a Waſh-bowl, whereas now he muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
carried in a Chair like a ſick body to an Hoſpital. Thou which mak'ſt a
Laughing-ſtock of him, ſays <hi>Iupiter,</hi> my will is, thou ſhouldſt go and feed him.
With all my heart, ſays <hi>Momus;</hi> and thereupon going behinde him, he took ſome
meat on a Trencher, and having given him a little bit, he eat up the reſt himſelf.
<hi>Iupiter</hi> ſeeing his Knavery, bid him come away from him, ſeeing he fed him after
that rate; and bid <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> who ſate next him, have a care of him. After that,
obſerving that there were divers others complained that the Meſſes were too hot,
he commanded <hi>Zephyrus</hi> to take ſome courſe therein; ſo this God getting up on
his Chair, did ſo much ſhake his wings, and blow with his mouth, that all was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
cooled.</p>
                        <p>But this was not all, for at the other end of the Table there was the God of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi>
who was much troubled, becauſe he could not eat at all, and who thought
it was to no purpoſe to have invited him to the Banquet, if he had not the power
to do as others did. Time hath been, that he was contented only with putting his
finger on his mouth, to hinder himſelf to ſpeak; but of late he had found out a
more aſſured courſe, and that was by locking his two lips together with a Padlock;
yet this invention brought its inconvenience along with it, eſpecially at this time, he
being not able by reaſon thereof to put one bit into his mouth. He made ſigns
to thoſe whom he conceiv'd his friends, to take compaſſion on him; but there
every one was for himſelf; and <hi>Fate,</hi> who kept the Key of this Padlock, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
himſelf to bring it with him. There was no other way, but to ſeek to <hi>Vulcan</hi>
who had been the Smith, and had made it. He underſtanding well the pain that poor
God was in, out of Charity ſent one of his Cyclopes, who with one ſtroke of his
hammer broke it aſunder; but it put the God of Silence into the danger of loſing
half his teeth, for the blow light upon his Chin, and was like to have batter'd to
pieces his nether Jaw. He afterwards a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e, but not without difficulty, and
much pain; for it was a long time ſince his teeth had been in any employment. The
action of his eating was ſo ill-favoured, that he made ſport to all at Table; yet
was it ſoon over, and all were quiet and well pleas'd, except <hi>Venus,</hi> who complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that <hi>Priapus,</hi> who ſate next her, lay ſo heavy upon her, that he had well nigh
over-heated her. She had on a Robe ſo thin and tranſparent, that one could not be
well aſſured whether ſhe were clad or naked; ſo that that good Companion, blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like a horſe that ſmells his oats, clapp'd his hands ever and anon upon her thigh,
and was much amaz'd he felt nothing but ſilk. <hi>Jupiter</hi> fearing ſome ſcandal might
ariſe through his incontinence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> caus'd him to be plac'd next to <hi>Minerva,</hi> who being
all armed, admits not ſo eaſie embraces, and is ſomewhat a terrible Miſtreſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Venus</hi> ſwore by <hi>Styx,</hi> that thence forward ſhe would never be clad ſo thin,
nor ſhould the <hi>Graces,</hi> nor her <hi>Son:</hi> Whereat <hi>Momus,</hi> jeering, ſaid to her, Do
you think to be <hi>Venus,</hi> and not go ſtark-naked? how ſhould the Gods know you?
and your Son when he is once cloath'd, will he be taken for what he is? what hath
he to do with cloathing, ſeeing he never feels any cold? But I pray how would
you cloath him? ſhall he put on <hi>Breeches?</hi> or ſhall he ſtill were a <hi>Bib?</hi> I ſee what
the matter is, you would tempt fortune; it will not coſt you much to cloath him;
for he is ſo little, he may be put into ones pocket; and beſides, the ſuit you ſhall
make him, will laſt him a long time, for he grows not at all. But tell me, I pray,
hath he given over crying in the night? Doth the little Knave keep his bed clean?
doth he not Caca in his Quiver for want of a Chamber-pot? Can he feed himſelf?
how many teeth hath he? If you are troubled with him, your beſt courſe were to
beſtow him on ſome Princeſs on earth; ſhe might haply be very tender of him, and
would play with him, as if he were ſome little Dwarf.</p>

This divine Jeſter directed all theſe encounters to <hi>Cupid,</hi> who to be reveng'd of
him began to make ready his bow: but <hi>Venus</hi> perſwaded him, that the green and
yellow <hi>Capuche</hi> that <hi>Momus</hi> wore was proof againſt his darts. In the mean time
<hi>Momus</hi> by the order of <hi>Iupiter</hi> commanded the <hi>Tritons,</hi> who ſtood by all this time,
to play on their Cornets, and appointed ſome <hi>Fawns</hi> to play on their Flutes, that
by the ſound of their Inſtruments they might not ſuffer the jaw-bones of the Gods
to be idle. He himſelf plaid his part with them on the bells he had at his knees,
wherewith he made a ſpecial noiſe in dancing. He had alſo a ſtick with two Swine-bladders
full of peaſe faſtened to the ends, wherewith he kept time with the reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſwollen cheeks of the Loud-muſick, which muſt needs yield an excellent har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Courſe was hardly on the Table, but the Gods were extreamly
amaz'd at the new ſort of meats that was ſerved in to them. The <hi>Ideas</hi> they found
moſt excellent: yet <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> Let your Majeſty commend this
to others; this kind of meat is not cordial for you, it is too windy. <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Fate</hi>
hearing this, took all to themſelves, and it found them no more work then a Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry
to a Swine: though the Doctor told them alſo, that he knew well their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and that thoſe <hi>Idaeas</hi> would prove purgative to them, and that he foreſaw
it would give them the ſquirt. As for the ſouls which were fryed, he permitted <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
to feed of them, aſſuring him they were extreamly nutritive. Hence grew an
occaſion of drinking abundance of wine and nectar, for <hi>Vulcan</hi> had ſpic'd the ſauces
a little too much. <hi>Ganimede</hi> gave <hi>Iupiter</hi> to drink, <hi>Hebe</hi> to <hi>Iuno,</hi> and the <hi>Satyres</hi> to
to all the other Gods. Now the good <hi>Ianus,</hi> who had been charg'd to ſee that theſe
brave Cupbearers did not drink, had in the beginning well diſcharg'd himſelf of his
duty, and had rail'd at two Satyres who had confuted a bottle; but at length his
faithfulneſs was corrupted: They promiſed him, that if he would ſay nothing, they
would give him as much as any ſix others. So that having accepted this propoſition,
while one preſented him a glaſs before, another gave him one behind. In the mean
time the <hi>Satyres</hi> drank by turns at the ſide-table, without any fear of <hi>Silenus,</hi> who
by this time was fallen aſleep in his chair, and ſnored ſo loud that he made almoſt as
much noiſe as the muſick. Howbeit <hi>Ianus</hi> had two faces, yet had he but one head;
ſo that the wine and nectar which he had liberally taken fumed into his brain, and
ſomwhat troubled it: And being now arrived to a loſs of all modeſty and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
he drank a health to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> deſiring he would pledge him. <hi>Bacchus</hi> ask'd
for wine; but the Waiters being buſie about ſomwhat elſe, heard him not. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
himſelf ſo careleſly attended, took his knife and knock'd ſeven or eight times
on the table as hard as he could for to make them hear: which action was very ill
taken, for it ſeem'd by that he thought he was in ſome Tavern. Yet <hi>Iupiter</hi> paſs'd
it by, knowing the good humour of the Companion, and being deſirous to give
<hi>Ianus</hi> and him their loads, Hola there I ſays he, Fill them their wine. Sing my boys:
begin <hi>Ianus,</hi> thou art the challenger in this combat. What will your Majeſty have
me ſing? replies <hi>Ianus:</hi> ſhall I ſay ſomwhat of this liquor that elevates the heart?
Sing what thou wilt, ſays <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Ianus</hi> ſung what he knew, and that
ſo admirably, that never came there any thing neer it: For the mouth before was
the Baſe, and that behind the Treble; ſo that he alone made an excellent muſick of
two parts, except that ever and anon it was interrupted by a certain hiccock which
diſcovered the generoſity of his heart, that ſtill thruſt back any thing that was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſtefull
to it. <hi>Bacchus</hi> having taken his full bowl, ſung,
<q>Great <hi>Alexander</hi> ſo lov'd Wine.</q>
making withall an harmonious clattering with two Trenchers one againſt another;
He burthen'd his ſong with turning of his eyes, and ſuch waggiſh poſtures, that it
made all the company very merry. This egg'd every one to further debauchment,
and it came ſo home, that the very Goddeſſes were at their <hi>Rubies on their
nails.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>

Upon this <hi>Mercury</hi> uſher'd in the third Courſe, which conſiſted altogether of
<hi>celeſtial</hi> living creatures: There was both <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>fiſh;</hi> ſo that there was no ſmall
amazement at this diverſity of meats. <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſaid, he would have the pleaſure to
let the company gheſs where ſuch different ſervices could be found; and that after
ſupper he would tell them the truth. The moſt part fed, without deſiring to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
what it was; and there remained not the fourth part.</p>
                        <p>As for the laſt Courſe, it was very ſumptuous: For <hi>Pomona</hi> had brought of all
ſorts of fruits, and the Cooks had made bak'd devices. <hi>Proſerpina</hi> took a great deal
of Tart and Biskets, and put into her pocket, ſaying it was for her darling <hi>Alecto.</hi>
This was not thought well-beſeeming; and it was eaſily ſeen that the good Lady
thought herſelf at ſome Country-wedding. But they had not time to ſpeak of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there were heard ſuch loud cryings at the entrance of the Hall, that every one
asked what the matter was. <hi>Mercury</hi> came and told them, that it was only the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi>
of <hi>Mars</hi> were at cuffs with the <hi>Pages</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> for the leg of the ſoul of a
Turky-hen, which they had ſnatch'd from thoſe that took away. <hi>Iupiter</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> to be ſent to them to teach them ſilence. For as for <hi>Harpocrates,</hi>
who was the God of <hi>ſilence,</hi> he could not now hold his peace himſelf, ſince his
mouth was opened; and therefore was ſo much the further from being able to make
others hold theirs: Beſides, it was now but fitting he could enjoy the preſent ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
which he took in ſpeaking, while he had the means and liberty. It muſt be
ſuppoſed the pleaſure he took in it was ſo much the greater, by how much it was
more then ordinary with him. Not to mention, that the good chear he had made
had ſo poſſeſs'd his brain, that he had forgotten his Quality.</p>
                        <p>This tumult being appeaſed, they look'd towards <hi>Ianus,</hi> who being quite drunk
was grown very inſolent. When ſupper began, he had put on his <hi>Serpent</hi> that bites
its own tail, like a Scarf; but now he had taken it off to beſtow it about the ears of
thoſe were near him; and he would needs go play the Tumbler, and make hey-paſſes
as if it had been through a hoop, had they not hindred him. For want of this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
he beſet himſelf to prattle with both his tongues together. His two mouths
abus'd one the other, contradicted and belyed one another; and preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
friends again, defied one another to drink. If the one laugh'd, the other
cry'd; and if he had promiſed any thing with the mouth before, he perform'd never
the more for that, for that behind recall'd it, ſaying it had not conſented thereto.
Beſides, the face he had backward was the more ancient; and to ſeem knowing, it
would never be of the ſame opinion with the other, which was its younger brother.
<hi>Iupiter</hi> ſeeing <hi>Iuno</hi> did nothing but lowre at all this, caus'd the good <hi>Ianus</hi> to retire,
and be diſpos'd on ſome bed. Then the Table was taken away, and the nine <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Vulcan, Momus,</hi> the <hi>Cyclops,</hi> the <hi>Tritons,</hi> the <hi>Satyres,</hi> and the reſt that had waited
had the leiſure to ſup. As ſoon as they had done, the <hi>Tritons</hi> were ſent for to make
the company dance by the noiſe of their Cornets. Having begun a Brawl, <hi>Iupiter</hi>
took <hi>Inno; Mars, Venus;</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> his <hi>Siſter;</hi> and ſo every one his Mate: among
the reſt <hi>Fate</hi> took <hi>Fortune;</hi> and 'twas a pleaſant ſight to ſee him dance in his night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gown
with that light Goddeſs, who being ever accuſtom'd to go on a bowl or a
wheel, frigg'd it ſtrangely on a firm floor: ſhe ſhak'd him ſo vigorouſly, that one
of his ſlippers ſlipt off his foot, and his night-cap fell off his head, and his ſpectacles
fell down, which he had put on to ſee if he obſerv'd his paces aright. <hi>Vulcan, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
Mercury,</hi> and ſome others were not in the dance; they had an itch to play
ſome knaviſh prank to make merry the company, and that was to act a Comedy.
<hi>Vulcan,</hi> who was not much acquainted with matters of that nature, ſaid there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no more then to take a certain Piece of a Greek Poet's, wherein the Author had
made all ſpeak ſo, as they could eaſily find what they had to ſay. That would be too
ruſtick, ſays <hi>Mercury;</hi> we muſt doe ſomewhat that's new. We have here in the
houſe the <hi>Muſes,</hi> which are more knowing then the <hi>Poets,</hi> ſeeing they inſpire them:
Yet to tell you the truth, they will not ſhew us any thing proper for us, ſuch is their
pretence to chaſtity and reſervation; and I do not ſee how thoſe that make Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43725:59"/>
can imagine they aſſiſt them therein, when they never make any themſelves.
However I muſt tell you that we will not want for Poetry, if we pleaſe, though we
have neither <hi>Homer</hi> nor <hi>Heſiod;</hi> for we have <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> that talk as
ſtrange things as the Poets. <hi>Vulcan</hi> liking well of this, called theſe Philoſophers;
and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> being acquainted with the deſign of theſe Gods, ſaid to them,
As to the ſubject and diſcourſes of your Comedy, ſeek out another Author: but if
you will diſguiſe your ſelves and entertain the company with a Mummery, I promiſe
you my beſt aſſiſtance: I underſtand the buſineſs of <hi>Lots</hi> as well as any, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
that of the Dye; I can make you caſt <hi>paſſage</hi> at every caſt. I can tell a little
how to cheat too, ſays <hi>Mercury;</hi> Come, let's do that, there needs not ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
That ſaid, they reſolved to repreſent the divers qualities of Mortals, which
was a cuſtom they had ever obſerved, meerly to be in ſome degree reveng'd of men
who ever in their Comedies repreſent the Gods.</p>
                        <p>While they were looking for cloaths and vizards to diſguiſe themſelves, the other
Gods broke off their revelling; and having ſeated themſelves up and down, began
to talk merrily of their antient Loves. There was only <hi>Saturn</hi> would bear no part
in theſe enjoyments; but went to hold <hi>Ianus</hi> his head, who was diſgoring into
his twice double-lin'd Cap. Being return'd, he made the whole preſence laugh; for
he began diſcourſes ſo ſimple and fond, as ſoon diſcover'd he was ſo old that he had
renewed his infancie. In the mean while <hi>Venus,</hi> deſirous of ſome other diverſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
jeer'd <hi>Iupiter</hi> for having forc'd him ſo often to change ſhape: The beſt thing ſhe
ſaid to him was, that he had not practiſed his Transformations ſeaſonably, and that
it was not for <hi>Europa</hi> that he ſhould have chang'd himſelf into a <hi>Bull,</hi> but for <hi>Io</hi>
whom himſelf had chang'd into a <hi>Cow;</hi> becauſe if they had both had the bodies of the
ſame Animal, they had done better together, and they might have generated a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of little Calves which might have been deified, and might have graz'd very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
in heaven. <hi>Jupiter</hi> deſirous to prove in the firſt place, that the moſt chaſte
Deities have been ſometimes overcome by Love, as well as himſelf had, brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
play the <hi>Suns</hi> Siſter who was neer him, and ſhewed how ſhe had been in love
with <hi>Endymion</hi> and <hi>Hyppolitus.</hi> But ſhe alledged for her defence, that ſith ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſaw the one but when he was aſleep, ſhe could not receive any Love-enjoyment
from him: And that as for the other, ſhe loved him not for any reaſon but becauſe
he had ſpu'd himſelf chaſte; and that if he had yielded at her firſt aſſault, ſhe would
have deſpiſed him. <hi>Venus</hi> in the mean time told <hi>Neptune</hi> in his ear, She hath ſome
reaſon indeed to ſlight my Son's <hi>torch;</hi> for 'twere to much purpoſe for her to be
burnt by it, when it ſhould burn no body for her: I never fear'd her being the
fourth among thoſe that ſhould ſtrive for the <hi>golden</hi> Apple; ſhe's the moſt ugly here,
and her face is as round as a Tabor. If her face be withall big, replies <hi>Neptune,</hi> ſhe
is by ſo much the more proper to be beloved, for many may kiſs her at once. But
you conſider not, replies <hi>Venus,</hi> that when her Lovers expected a whole face, they
ſhould find but half a one: do you not know ſhe changes every quarter of a month,
and that ſometimes ſhe increaſes, and ſometimes decreaſes?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Venus</hi> having ſpoken thus of the <hi>Moon,</hi> ſumm'd up what detractions ſhe could of
all the other Goddeſſes, thinking by that means to advance her own beauty. She
had her belly-full of jeering at the ugly viſage of <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> and her cloaths which
were not in faſhion, and of her dreſſing, which was ſo unhandſom, that it was eaſily
ſeen that the infernal <hi>Furies</hi> were her ordinary Tire-women. She muſt needs alſo
take occaſion to laugh at the extravagant dreſſing of old <hi>Cybele,</hi> who had Cities and
Caſtles on her head. But <hi>Aurora</hi> who was ſomwhat neer her, came and ſaid to her,
Do not jeer at her fair Cypris; it would ſomwhat puzzle you to find out a more
commodious faſhion for an antient and modeſt Goddeſs as ſhe is: I ſpeak what I
know; for ever ſince the beginning of the world I am her Tire-woman, and every
morning I give her a Gown according to the ſeaſons, ſometimes embroidered with
pearls and flowers, and laced with green, and ſometimes ſet out golden har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſts
or ſilver ſnows.</p>

                           <pb n="70" facs="tcp:43725:59"/>
While <hi>Aurora</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> were thus engag'd in a tattle, <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſpeaking of the
Loves of the reſt as well as of his own, ſaid, that ſeeing they had all taken the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
not to have abated one laſcivious prank they could have plaid, he was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd
at any thing but one, which was, that the fair <hi>Cytheraea</hi> Queen of <hi>Vnchaſtity,</hi>
after ſo many adulteries and inceſts, had not committed that of lying with her own
ſon; and that never any ſuch imagination entred the brain of any <hi>Poet.</hi> This propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
was cenſured abominable: So that <hi>Jupiter</hi> being oblig'd to change diſcourſe,
ſpake thus to the whole Aſſembly. I would not erewhiles diſcover unto you what
meat you fed on in the laſt courſe; you ſhall not any longer be in any doubt of it:
They were the celeſtial living creatures that you were preſented with. <hi>Venus</hi> told
me but now, that I was to blame for not having transform'd my ſelf into a <hi>Bull,</hi> for
to enjoy <hi>Io</hi> when ſhe was a <hi>Cow,</hi> whence might ariſe a generation of little Calves to
people the heavens: But I ſhould have been ſorry to have had ſuch childreu; for
when I ſhould no more endure Beaſts in ſo brave a country, I muſt have been forc'd
to kill them with the reſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Jupiter</hi> had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but all the Preſence murmur'd againſt him, and
eſpecially thoſe who were any thing concerned in the buſineſs. <hi>Bacchus</hi> was angry
for having loſt his <hi>Ram, Hercules</hi> his <hi>Hydra;</hi> and every one complain'd, that the
Creatures which were dedicated to them were taken out of a place where they did
them ſo much honour. The <hi>Sun</hi> cry'd out above all the reſt, ſaying he cared not
whether ever he walk'd any more through the heaven, now that his ordinary <hi>Land
lords</hi> were not in the twelve Innes where he uſed to lodge. To be ſhort, 'twas ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
concluded that <hi>Jupiter</hi> was to blame for putting to death a ſort of beaſts
which did him no hurt, and which beſides belong'd not to him; and that he ſhould
rather have kill'd his own <hi>Eagle,</hi> or his Wife's <hi>Peacock,</hi> and not entertain his gueſts
at their own charges. You are angry at a ſmall matter, ſays <hi>Jupiter:</hi> Is there any
reaſon there ſhould remain any Beaſts in Heaven, when we ſend ſo many generous
Captains and learned Philoſophers to Hell? What ſervice had we from ſo many
creatures, unleſs it were to find paſtime for the petty Gods, as <hi>Ganimed</hi> and <hi>Cupid,</hi>
who made it their employment to lead them up and down in a ſtring? Moreover, if
we had had he and ſhe of every one, you might ſtand upon't that ſome profit might
be made of them, and that they might bring forth young: But they were all diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable;
and if they had once but been any thing hot, I leave you to conſider
what kind of monſters they had produced; as if the <hi>Bull</hi> and the <hi>Hydra</hi> had gone
together, or the <hi>Ram</hi> and the <hi>Bear.</hi> What's more then all; there would not have
been any ſhould have had any milk fit to make cheeſe of, and I ſuppoſe there's none
will avow it had been any great revenue to go and milk them every day for nothing.
But if haply it be ſaid they had ſome feathers or furs which would have ſerved us to
ſome purpoſe, I have done well to kill them, that we might have them. And to the
end there ſhould be no partiality uſed as to all the other Signs of heaven, both ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and inanimate, I have caus'd them all to be taken away, leaving nothing but
the Stars to give their ordinary light. As for the <hi>Demy-Gods</hi> &amp; <hi>Demy-Godeſſes,</hi> as the
<hi>Centaure</hi> and <hi>Andromedes,</hi> I have alſo caus'd them to be removed, to wait on me in
my palace: And as for whatever was inſenſible, I have diſpos'd all to thoſe uſes
whereto they are moſt fit, as the <hi>Crown</hi> to put on <hi>Iuno's</hi> head, and the <hi>Bowl</hi> for my
ſelf to drink in. As for the River <hi>Eridan,</hi> I have not conceiv'd we have any need
of it; for it runs ſo ſlowly, that it is but as dead water, which is not good either to
drink or waſh any thing withall; and we had much ado to get ſo much clean water
as to waſh our hands before meat, which we have been fain to ſtrain through a cloth
to make it look a little clearer: Therefore I have cauſed certain holes to be made
in that part of heaven where that River is, ſo that it ſtill glides down upon the earth;
and I believe men are ſomwhat amaz'd to ſee it rain ſo plentifully. Now it is partly
for their ſakes that I have taken all theſe Signs out of heaven; 'tis for to puniſh
them for the contempt which a while ſince they were guilty of towards me: They
ſhall not henceforward have the pleaſure to ſee the heavens diverſified with ſo many
figures, whence they eaſily foreſaw things to come.</p>

And this is the Remonſtrance which <hi>Jupiter</hi> made to the reſt of the Gods; and
to ſay truth, he had entertained ſuch a jealouſie againſt <hi>Bacchus, Love, Sleep,</hi> and
ſome others, who many times were ador'd in his ſtead, that he was big with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to bring ſome miſchief on Gods and men together. Yet was there not one in
the Company durſt diſcover his reſentment, bethinking themſelves, that if he was
truly angry, he was powerful enough to ruine them. The fair <hi>Phoebus</hi> well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
the day when he had baniſh'd him out of heaven, and reduc'd him to a poſture
of begging in the earth, till at laſt he was commended to ſome petty King to be his
Cowherd. There was not one who could not call to minde ſome ſuch token of
his indignation; but as they were ruminating on this ſad ſubject, <hi>Comus</hi> enters the
Hall, with a Torch in his hand. <hi>Momus</hi> follow'd him cloath'd like a King, and
<hi>Vulcan</hi> dreſs'd like a Queen; but he would have been ſo much the more diſguis'd,
if he could have forborn limping. The other Maskers were clad, ſome like Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
others like Philoſophers, and many like Tradeſmen. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> dreſt like a
a Fool, was going to expreſs the moral of the Mask, while there enters of a ſudden
into the place a ſort of people which no body knew. <hi>Iupiter</hi> thought they had had
relation to the former Maskers, but <hi>Vulcan</hi> and his fellow Actors had not brought
them in. The firſt of the troop, who had a Flaxen curl'd head of hair, and a
Crown of <hi>Lawrel</hi> on his head, advanc'd as far as the midſt of the Hall, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on a Harp he had in his hand, ſnng theſe words, O great <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who art ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to render juſtice to all the world, how long wilt thou ſuffer there ſhould be
Gods Gods and Goddeſſes that intermeddle with the charges of others, and are not
content with their own? Behold, here we are a company of Divinities, depriv'd of
all wealth and honors, who come and demand thy aſſiſtance. I will tell thee one
thing that never came into the conſideration of the Gods. There are in this place
a ſort of Affronters, who beſides the charge which hath been given them, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached
upon ours, and have made believe we were not in the world, whence it
hath hapned that we were not invited to thy Banquet. That yong Gallant that
ſtands by thee, who pretends to ſo much beauty with his golden Muſtachoes, ſhould
he not be content with the conduct of that Chariot which brings the day with it;
but that he muſt withal be the Conductor of the <hi>Muſes?</hi> 'Tis I That am he, I am
the true <hi>Apollo,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Latona,</hi> and the God of <hi>Propheſie, Poetry</hi>
and <hi>Muſick;</hi> and he is but the Son of <hi>Tytan,</hi> and ſome obſcure Divinity. Here

                        <p>This <hi>Apollo</hi> would have ſung more; but his ſiſter coming forwards as ſoon as he
had ſpoken of her, came and ſaid to <hi>Luna,</hi> What Impoſture is this! Thou mak'ſt the

'Tis well known, that when thou ſhineſt in heaven, I am ſeen hunting in the woods.
I believe thou art ſo impudent as to ſay thou mayeſt be in ſeveral places, and that

                        <p>This <hi>Diana</hi> had no ſooner began this Harangue, but ſhe was interrupted by ſome
other <hi>Divinities,</hi> who had the like complaint to make. There was a God of <hi>Time</hi>
that oppos'd <hi>Saturn;</hi> and a <hi>Minerva, Pallas;</hi> inſomuch, that there was not one in
<hi>Iupiters</hi> Aſſembly that was not challeng'd for ſomewhat; and he himſelf not being
exempted, knew not well what to ſay. The confuſion was ſo great, that they would
not hear one the other ſpeak; ſo that the Maskers ſeeing their deſign diſappointed,
put off their Viſards, for to ſpeak face to face to thoſe that gave them offence.

Every one ſtrove to give the moſt antient records he could of the power then in
debate; and he that gave the beſt account of his genealogie, carried it. The moſt
part referr'd the difference wholly to the judgment of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras:</hi> but
they excuſed themſelves, profeſſing their incapacity in that point. <hi>Jupiter, Saturn,</hi>
and <hi>Fate</hi> were of opinion the buſineſs ſhould be referr'd to <hi>Homer, Heſiod,</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognis,</hi>
and ſuch other <hi>Poets</hi> as had treared at large of their original and power. But
there was not any one had the patience to ſtay till they were ſent for to the <hi>Elyzian</hi>
fields: beſides it was conſidered they could not give much ſatisfaction, becauſe it had
been their ignorance and careleſneſs that had caus'd all the diſorder, in ſtead of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the glory of the Gods, and had every foot ranked among them infamous
Princes; being ſo little thrifty of <hi>Divinity,</hi> that they attributed it to a Tripe-woman
<hi>ſconc'd</hi> at the corner of a ſtreet, if it happened ſhe was their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Gods</hi> being now quite ignorant whom to addreſs themſelves to for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding
of this difference, diſputed the matter with that earneſtneſs, that there began
a furious quarrel among them. <hi>Bacchus</hi> cut the noſes and ears of all came in his way
with his <hi>pruning-hook<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and <hi>Ceres</hi> did the like with her <hi>ſickle: Apollo, Diana,</hi> and
<hi>Cupid</hi> ſhot a world of <hi>arrows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> The <hi>Muſes</hi> broke their <hi>Harps</hi> and their <hi>Timbrels</hi>
on the heads of thoſe ſaid any thing to them: <hi>Venus</hi> paid <hi>Proſerpina</hi> about the ears
with one of her <hi>patins,</hi> and thruſt pins into her breech: <hi>Saturn</hi> cut the hams of
thoſe he met with his <hi>ſithe:</hi> But above all, <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> were moſt terrible,
the one for his <hi>ſword,</hi> the other for her <hi>lance.</hi> Thoſe that had no arms caſt ſtools at
one anothers heads: And there was not any but was in the charge, except the God
<hi>Terminus:</hi> He had all the while kept his arſe warm on a cuſhion, where he ſate
moſt majeſtically, believing all ought to give him place, and that he was thought ſo
redouted that they durſt not aſſault him. But he was much deceiv'd; they ſcorn'd
to ſtrike ſuch a ſimple wretch, whom they thought not able to hurt any body, nor
had any other faculty then that of Reſiſting.</p>

                           <hi>Iupiter</hi> miſtruſted now that <hi>Diſcord</hi> had rais'd this ſedition, becauſe ſhe was not
reſpected as ſhe ſhould have been: She had not had her meſs brought her ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
and <hi>Sleep</hi> who had receiv'd charge to ſet her abed, leſt ſhe ſhould come and
diſturb their enjoyments, was faln aſleep himſelf, having gotten drunk in the Kitchin
among the Turn-ſpits, whereof he was one. She therefore being awake, and having
a deſire of revenge, made it her buſines to ſtir up the <hi>modern Gods</hi> againſt the <hi>antient.</hi>
And <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſeeing that blows were dealt in the diſorder by all, without conſidering
whether they were friends or foes, knew that the final ruine of ſo many different
Divinities was neer at hand: And not deigning any other but himſelf ſhould have
the honour to end this difference, he hurl'd his Thunder-bolt among the Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
not caring to deſtroy himſelf withall. This blow was ſo effectual, that his
Palace was turn'd to aſhes with it, and ſince that time there hath not been any Poet
could tell us what became of all thoſe were in it: But the more knowing ſort of
men, who I expect ſhould give me ſome credit, will hence eaſily inſer that all thoſe
falſe Gods are not now in the world; and if there cannot any more be ſeen in the
heavens thoſe living creatures they had plac'd there, it's to be ſuppoſed they were all
eaten up at this Banquet, as I have told you, and that there remained nothing but
Stars. And if men cannot obſerve the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>chariots</hi> drawn by horſes,
it is becauſe thoſe great Luminaries have their dependance on an Infinite Power
who makes them go alone, without having occaſion to be drawn by thoſe excellent
Waggoners which the folly of Poets had beſtowed on them. Whoever therefore
that ſhall any more mention theſe powerleſs Divinities, after he hath heard what we
have deliver'd of them, let him aſſure himſelf he ſhall be taken for one, who eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing but what the <hi>Antients</hi> have left us, imagines it a matter of great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

                        <p>For my part, if you think it ſtrange I have related all you have heard, know I
receiv'd it from <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who at the beginning of the fray of the Gods went out
of the Palace, and finding at the gate the Bow of <hi>Iris</hi> which is the Ladder of heaven,

lid down along to the earth; where having a long time wandred up and down,
a fancy took him to turn <hi>Iackdaw,</hi> as he had ſometimes been a <hi>Cock.</hi> I had
bought him of a Bird-ſeller, and had made him ſo tame that he would come and
feed out of my hand. One day he jump'd upon my table, where there was an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet
in a great character: After he had divers times pointed at certain Letters
with his bill, I ſate me down and obſerved him, imagining there might be ſomwhat
of deſign in it, as indeed there was; for not being able to ſpeak, he acquainted me
with his fortune by that invention. I ſhould have ſpent many long dayes to put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the letters he touch'd, and exactly write the words; and beſides I miſtook
ſometimes, and miſobſerved the characters: So that my Daw bethought it to take
ink in his bill, and to write me down his intentions, to ſpare me that trouble. By that
means I got from him one part; and for the other, he told it me with his tongue,
which by little and little began to be unbound, and ſo gave me the full relation of
the <hi>Banquet of the Gods.</hi> I think this learned Bird was unwilling I ſhould know any
more from him: For as ſoon as the laſt Letter of the diſcourſe I received from him
was finiſh'd, he flew away through a window which I had left open, not thinking
he would ever have forſaken me.</p>

HEre <hi>Montenor</hi> gave over reading, there being no more in his Papers; and
<hi>Anſelme</hi> affirm'd, that all he had heard was infinitely pleaſant; but he
wondred at one thing only, which was, that the Gods took no <hi>Tobacco</hi>
in ſuch an illuſtrious Debauchery. <hi>Tobacco</hi> is the laſt courſe in hell, ſaid
<hi>Montenor,</hi> 'tis no Celeſtial food; yet <hi>Pluto,</hi> who could not forget his ordinary diſh,
carried ſome always about him, and 'tis to be conceiv'd, that after this famous Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
he did take ſome. The Author aſſur'd it, and told me at the ſame time, that
there was not any but <hi>Prometheus,</hi> who would taſte of this new diſh. And that he
hath not mention'd it, was becauſe he conceiv'd that did nothing againſt the Poets:
no more hath he ſaid, that <hi>Mars</hi> durſt drink neither wine nor nectar, and that he had
by him ſome Diet-drink in a bottle, which <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> had preſented him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he drank now and then, becauſe <hi>Venus</hi> had given him the Running of the Reins.
In like manner divers other undeſcent things have been paſt by, leſt it ſhould have
prov'd of ill example to the Readers; and particularly there hath been nothing ſaid
of <hi>Priapus,</hi> who beſides what hath been mentioned of him, play'd ſome other pranks
of his profeſſion. The Author reſerves all that for the Commentaries he intends
upon his <hi>Banquet of the Gods;</hi> and in the mean time theſe good things are only
ſpoken under the Roſe, and to Good-fellows.</p>
            <p>But we are yet to know the opinion of our noble <hi>Shepherd</hi> of this Piece. In good
faith the Author is a crafty knave, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> yet he hath a good wit, 'tis his own
fault, if he make not good uſe of it, but I ſhould have wiſht, he had ſpoken of the
Gods more reverently then he hath. You do not apprehend the buſineſs, replyes
<hi>Montenor,</hi> do you not ſee it is his deſign to abuſe them? The Ancients have left
us many monſtrous volumas, wherein there is neither reaſon nor conduct. Every
one feigns and imagines a world of Divinities, as they pleaſe themſelves; and if one
hath aſſign'd them ſuch a father and mother, he that writ after him, hath found
them others. As for the places of their birth, and their ſeveral actions, they agree
as ill as the Clocks of the Suburbs do with thoſe of the City. Beſides, they relate
<hi>Metamorphoſes</hi> and other miracles, that have not any probability at all. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
would laugh at all this, and note, that all the Poets are much oblig'd to him, for
in this diſcourſe he hath clear'd up abundance of obſcure things, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
underſtood not, and whereof they could not give any ſhadow of reaſon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
all he hath ſaid of the the <hi>Thread</hi> of the <hi>Deſtinies,</hi> of the <hi>Signs</hi> of heaven, of
<hi>Aurora</hi> and the <hi>Sun;</hi> they are things, which though they render the Fables ridiculous,
yet give withal a greater diſcovery of their abſurdities. As for inſtance, The Poets
aſſure us that the <hi>Sun</hi> is a God fill'd with heat and light, who walking through the
heavens, enlightens us here; and yet they ſay withal, that having lent his Chariot
to <hi>Phaeton,</hi> he gave the world the day inſtead of the other, but that approaching
too near the earth, he was like to burn it up; what an abſurdity is this? for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Sun</hi> himſelf was not there, what light and what heat could there be? In
what manner have thoſe egregious Cockſcombs ever explain'd this? No, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
troubled themſelves to do it; for they ſpeak confuſedly of the power of their
Divinities, without laying any foundation for things. They have never given us
any certain information, whether that body which we ſee be the head of the God
<hi>Apollo,</hi> (as it is likely, becauſe there is an appearance of a face) or whether it be a
Torch he carries in his hand, or haply his Chariot all a fire. Some call him <hi>Phoebus</hi>
with the golden hair, others the Torch of the day, and others the burning Chariot.
How then ſhall we underſtand the Fable of <hi>Phaeton?</hi> without queſtion we muſt ſay
that there is in the heaven a great Globe of fire, which <hi>Apollo</hi> faſtens behinde his
Head, or behinde his Chariot, when he is to go his courſe, and that it was poſſible
he might have given it to his Son. But wher's he among the Poets, that hath thus
particulariz'd theſe things. It is my Author hath found out this ſleight, and hath
taught it me; doth he not ſay that the Sun <hi>faſtens his beams about his head?</hi> I ſhould
never have done, if I would ſpecifie all the places where he hath clear'd up the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.

Remember it, that you may obſerve them, and believe what I tell you, and
that is, that the diſcourſe I have now read to you, excels all the Poets have ever
writ. All will not grant you that, ſays <hi>Anſelme;</hi> conſider, that the <hi>Fables</hi> of
the <hi>Poets</hi> are <hi>Myſtical</hi> things, wherein all the ancient wiſdom lies hid. They have
done well to make you believe that, replyes <hi>Montenor:</hi> There is <hi>Notalis, Comes,</hi>
and ſome other Gentlemen of Leaſure, who have employ'd themſelves to make <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thologies,</hi>
and have found out thoſe expoſitions of the Fables, which never came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the imaginations of the Poets. But aſſure your ſelf, that if I had a minde to
moralize on the <hi>Romance</hi> of <hi>Melluſin,</hi> and <hi>Robin the Devil,</hi> I could finde out as
handſome things, as upon that of the <hi>Syrens</hi> and <hi>Hercules.</hi> What do you think
my Author hath ſaid any thing without reaſon? If the Night-cap and Spectacles of
<hi>Fate</hi> fall down in dancing, he ſhall tell you what it ſignifies, and he is able enough
to make a Methologie on his <hi>Banquet of the Gods.</hi> Be not angry, we eaſily believe
it, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and I aſſure you withal, that I have a great eſteem of the ingenuity of
this Author; but I would not adviſe him to print this piece by it ſelf, becauſe it is
too ſhort. My <hi>Genius</hi> tells me he is deſign'd to compoſe my Hiſtory? 'tis there he
may diſpoſe of it. What know you whether it will be convenient, ſays <hi>Anſelme:</hi>
Men laugh at thoſe who have foiſted into their <hi>Romances</hi> things which were not to
the purpoſe. I'll furniſh you with another invention, he muſt in its proper place
mention that the <hi>Banquet of the Gods</hi> hath been read to you, and then it ſhall be
put in the end of the Book by it ſelf. If divers Anthors I could name, had known
this cunning ſlight, their works would have been better by much, and they could
not have been tax'd to have interlarded them with Hiſtories and Verſes repeated to
ſo little purpoſe, that the Readers paſs them over when they meet them. Thus in
the <hi>Argemi,</hi> there are ſuch long diſcourſes as might make a Book apart, beſides that
fine Story of the <hi>Excrement,</hi> with the Verſes on that ſubject; which <hi>Barclay</hi> would
needs thruſt into his <hi>Romance,</hi> for to give it a better ſent in the world. Thou art Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrical,
friend, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> keep thy adviſe to thy ſelf, make thy own Hiſtory, after
thy own faſhion, and let me alone to take order for mine. This <hi>Banquet of the Gods</hi>
is not improper for me as thoſe pieces thou quoteſt. It treats of thoſe things which
have moſt relation to what I have in deſign; and it is ſo much to my purpoſe, that
I ſhall remember it as long as I live; and he that ſhould not put it in would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
an error, and ſhould not be a faithful Hiſtorian; for ſeeing it is true it hath been
read to me, it is neceſſary it ſhould be put down word for word, to ſhew what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
the diſcourſe might have, and what judgement I ſhould make of it. But
ſtay, ſeeing my renown is diſpers'd every where, and that the Painters have already
taken my picture, may it not be that ſome <hi>Romanciſt</hi> of this age hath already un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to write of my <hi>Loves;</hi> for there are thoſe who hunt every where for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to exerciſe themſelves on. I am clearly againſt it, that's a thing ought
not to be done without my approbation. He thereupon turn'd to the <hi>Stationer,</hi>
and ſaid to him, Sir, have you not THE LOVES OF THE SHEPHERD
LYSIS? No indeed Sir, replyes the Stationer, I do not know the Book; I do
not believe there is any hath ſuch a Tile. I am very glad on't replyes the <hi>Shepherd,</hi>
you ſhall ſee ſuch a thing one day, and you ſhall have the Copy of it. I acquaint
you that I am going to <hi>Forreſts,</hi> to run through divers adventures for to amplifie
the matter; and believe it, there will happen to me ſuch rare things, that when
they are well writ, as I hope they ſhall be, and that you ſhall make them be well
printed, there will ſell more of the Book, then any other in the world: For know,
that I obſerve the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Loving</hi> better then any lover that ever appear'd on the
Theatre of Hiſtory. I am ſorry I came not hither in my Shepherds habit, you
ſhould have ſeen that it became me better then that <hi>Celadon,</hi> who is in the Frontiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
of your <hi>Aſtraea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Stationer ſeeing that <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> could not forbear laughing at
theſe pleaſant extravagancies, could not chuſe but laugh too. There were ſome in
the ſhop who came to buy Books, and they were ſomewhat amaz'd at it; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the actions and words of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> did almoſt take him for what he was. A
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43725:62"/>
Sallad-wench that was in the ſtreet, quite raviſh'd with admiration to ſee him,
pluck'd by the apron one that cry'd Hot bak'd Pears, for to ſtay her and make her
partake of the pleaſure: Nay there was a Begger, who for being taken up there,
loſt a meſs of Pottage which he ſhould have had three doors off.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>Anſelme</hi> being in haſte to be gone, took five or ſix books, and paid the
Stationer for them. But <hi>Montenor</hi> looking what they were, ſaid, Certainly you have
not much to do with mony, ſeeing you beſtow it ſo ill: For my part, I am ſick at
the heart if I but hear read three lines of thoſe fopperies: Theſe books are as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to thoſe that read them not, as to thoſe that read them. You underſtand not
our affairs, ſays <hi>Lyſis</hi> to him: We buy theſe books for no other end but to ſee if
we can do greater wonders then what are related in them; you ſhall have your
ſhare of the pleaſure there will be to ſee them done: Aſſure your ſelf, that if the
Lovers in theſe hiſtories paſs two days without eating, I will four; and if they ſhed
tears as big as ones thumb, I will ſhed as big as ones head. You mean a pins head
perhaps, replies <hi>Montenor;</hi> and if you faſt all day, you will burſt with eating at
night. You are a ſcoffer, <hi>Montenor,</hi> ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> you ſhall find that my words and
my actions can well keep houſe together.</p>
            <p>That being paſt, he went into the Coach with <hi>Anſelme,</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he then had no horſe. <hi>Anſelme</hi> took this Gentleman home to ſupper: And
as he was ſtill ſhewing <hi>The Banquet of the Gods,</hi> which he had taken back from the
Stationer, he ſaid, that ſeeing <hi>Lyſis</hi> thought the Piece too ſhort to be printed by it
ſelf, he would return it to the Author. Nor made he any difficulty to tell them, that
he who had made it was call'd <hi>Clarimond,</hi> a Young-man of moſt excellent parts,
and one that liv'd hard by his houſe in <hi>Forreſts. Lyſis</hi> underſtanding ſo much,
was infinitely ſatisfied, promiſing he ſhould one day diſpoſe of him as he
pleaſed.</p>
            <p>He ſpent the night, and the beſt part of the next day in reading the books which
were bought: And the day of their departure being come, <hi>Montenor</hi> came to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme's</hi>
houſe, ſo that they went all three together in the Coach. They ask'd <hi>Lyſis</hi>
whether he knew how many leagues it were from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Forreſts?</hi> He anſwered,
that to his remembrance he had heard ſay there was a hundred. Who told you ſo
are deceiv'd, ſays <hi>Anſelme;</hi> and if they have counted a hundred leagues hence into
that Country, they have not known the neareſt way. But without any further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
as to that point, I'll bring you thither in two dayes. I make no queſtion
of that, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> it may be <hi>Love</hi> hath lent your horſes wings to make them go
faſter.</p>
            <p>They entertained themſelves in this manner with many excellent Poetical imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
by the way, as alſo in the Innes where they baited. In the evening they
reach'd a Village, whereof <hi>Montenor's</hi> Brother was Lord; the Gentlemans name
was <hi>Fleurial,</hi> and his Wife's was called <hi>Cecilia. Anſelme</hi> was willing to go ſee them
before he went to <hi>Brie,</hi> that <hi>Lyſis</hi> conceiving they went a great way, might believe
he was carried into <hi>Forreſts. Montenor's</hi> Siſter-in-law, who was a merry Grig, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
diſcover'd that the Young-man had not the ſoundeſt brain: And to be more
certain of it, ſhe ſet upon him and ask'd him why he was ſo ſad as he ſeem'd to be?
Such a courteous Lady muſt not be denied, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Know therefore that if I
am melancholick, the reaſon is, that I too much think on the beauties of one, whoſe
feir eye enchants me. What, ſhe is one-ey'd then whom you love! replies <hi>Cecilia;</hi>
for you ſpeak but of one eye. Pardon me, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> 'tis only that the beſt Poets
always uſe this phraſe, though their Miſtreſſes have two eyes: And if you will have
a reaſon of it, it is becauſe the beams of both eyes meet together as if there were
but one; or elſe becauſe there is but one eye that hurts, and the other heals. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
there are Lovers which ſay, that their Miſtreſſes have the Sun in one eye, and
the Moon in the other; and <hi>Ronſard</hi> believes that <hi>Caſſandra</hi> had <hi>Venus</hi> in the left
eye, and <hi>Mars</hi> in the right. But to return to my Miſtreſs: You are to believe
ſhe is adorn'd with the pillage of the <hi>Graces;</hi> and though ſhe have a hue of <hi>ſnow,</hi>
yet doth ſhe not ceaſe to ſet me on fire perpetually. Good God! if ſhe be ſnow,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43725:63"/>
and live in <hi>Forreſts,</hi> there muſt be care taken ſhe be not melted by the ſun, for it is
a great deal hotter there then 'tis here; and if we had now a little piece of her body,
we might make good uſe of it to put into the glaſſes to cool the wine. How could
that be, ſeeing I tell you it heats? ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Beſides, as for the ſun, ſhe fears it
not, for ſhe is a Sun herſelf. How happy are you then, when you are neer her! if
you have but a Sun-dyal, you may know what it is of the clock. That cannot be,
replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> for her rayes are ſo ſtrong, that they pierce through the opake bodies,
and make no ſhadow. Let us return to our firſt diſcourſe, that is to ſay concerning
the whiteneſs of my Shepherdeſs: You are to know ſhe hath a countenance of
<hi>milk.</hi> She hath an ugly one then, ſays <hi>Cecilia;</hi> why do you affect her? I ſay, of
<hi>curded-milk,</hi> replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> Do you apprehend me? I do, anſwers <hi>Cecilia,</hi> that ſhe
hath a countenance of Cows milk: but do not the Flies as they paſs by pitch on it
for to drink, and are there not ſome drown'd? All that are there eſcape ſhipwrack,
replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> for there are blown Roſes on her cheeks, whereon theſe filthy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
light and ride on them with as great pomp as if they were in a ſhip. If this
milk be good to make cheeſe of, ſays <hi>Cecilia,</hi> you will get much by ſuch a Miſtreſs,
ſhe will be a great revenue to you. That it is good to make cheeſe, I can aſſure you,
ſays <hi>Montenor,</hi> who over-heard them; for there are already yellow ſpots on the
cheeks of this Beauty, as there are on a cheeſe that hath been ſix moneths a ripening
in a cellar. Hold you your peace, ſays <hi>Lyſis</hi> to him; you ſpeak with little reſpect of
the Wonder of this age; 'tis well ſeen that you know her not. I return therefore
to what I ſaid before, that there are a many <hi>Roſes</hi> blown on the face of my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs,
and not <hi>Marigolds,</hi> as <hi>Montenor</hi> ſays.</p>
            <p>This perfect Lover was in the road to have ſpoken many other things to maintain
the glory of <hi>Charite:</hi> But the Maſter of the houſe broke off all theſe diſcourſes,
that they might ſit down to ſupper, where he would not permit any talk but of
drinking. After ſupper there paſs'd ſo many divers diſcourſes between <hi>Cecilia</hi> and
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> that ſhe was infinitely pleas'd with him, and the next morning her greateſt
regret was the departure of her gueſts. The ſecond day at evening, they being
neer the place where they were to go, <hi>Anſelme</hi> gave <hi>Lyſis</hi> notice of it, whereat he
took ſo great ſatisfaction, that he began to propoſe to himſelf what they ſhould do
when they were come to the banks of <hi>Lignon.</hi> As for you, <hi>Montenor!</hi> you are
well known there, ſeeing you have a ſeat there: But as for me and <hi>Anſelme,</hi> we
are not known there at all. Methinks I imagine we are already ſurrounded with a
world of Shepherds, who ask what we are: We muſt give them an account of our
ſelves, and declare the niceſt particularities of our life to all we meet, though we
know them not; for that hath been from the beginning the cuſtom in amorous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.
For my part, I know well enough what I have to ſay; but <hi>Anſelme!</hi>
haſt thou bethought thy ſelf? wilt thou ſpeak of <hi>Geneura</hi> or <hi>Angelica?</hi> I'll do
neither, replies <hi>Anſelme:</hi> I'll ſpeak nothing but fained things. I'll make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
I am ſome Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> and that I have already ſet out my <hi>Romance.</hi>
It will not be amiſs to lye a little, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> but I'll give thee an incomparable
ſhift, which I ſhould make uſe of my ſelf, were it not that I deſire nothing but to
poſſes <hi>Charite,</hi> and that there is no ambition can oblige me to leave the Country.
And it is this; Thou muſt not give any certain hints of thy race, take heed of that:
Make as if rather that thou knoweſt not who were thy father and mother; and that
ſome Shepherd finding thee as a ſheep was ſuckling thee, took thee up and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
thee ever ſince. By this means it may happen, that if ſome great Prince hath
loſt a child, he'll believe thou art he; and ſo redeeming thee out of obſcurity, thou
wilt be advanced to royalties. Who can tell, ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> whether there be any
Prince at preſent that hath loſt a ſon? and if there were any, do you ſuppoſe he would
acknowledge me for his? Woe is me! what a ſmall experience art thou maſter
of! replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I will give thee an infallible argument for what I ſay. Haſt thou
ever obſerved in Hiſtory, that any of thoſe that have been ſo expoſed to the
world in their cradles, hath not met with ſome great Lord who hath been
glad to be called his Father? Why may not thy fortune be as good as any of
theirs?</p>

While <hi>Lyſis</hi> was in theſe propoſals, <hi>Anſelme</hi> gave him a very ſober audience, as
if he had made it his deſign to make his advantage of what he ſaid; but bethink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf,
that they were now in the midſt of <hi>Brie,</hi> and that he already ſaw the
little River of <hi>Morin,</hi> he cryes out with great chearfulneſs, O Shepherd! now we
are come to the place where we deſire to be; Behold, there is the pleaſant River of
<hi>Lignon. Lyſis</hi> putting his head out of the Coach, There it is indeed, ſays he, it is
juſt ſuch as the books repreſent it to us. I ſee already the Bridge of <hi>Boutereſſe,</hi> over
which we are to paſs. But where is the Palace of <hi>Iſoura?</hi> where is <hi>Mont-Briſon,
Feurs,</hi> and <hi>Verdun? Montenor</hi> then ſhew'd him certain Steeples thereabout, and
made him believe they were the places he ask'd for. While they were thus engag'd,
another extravagancy coming into the minde of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> he cry'd out, O what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate
man am I! ſhall I enter into this Country with my City cloathes on?
What did I think on this morning, that I did not put on my Shepherds habit? I
muſt put off my cloathes preſently. Stay a little, ſays <hi>Montenor,</hi> we have but a
league to my houſe, we ſhall not meet any body till we come thither. <hi>Lyſis</hi> not
regarding this Remonſtrance, made the Coachman ſtay, and ſent a Lacquay after a
Mule of <hi>Anſelme's,</hi> which always went before with the luggage. There muſt needs
be had the Port-mantle, wherein the Shepherds habit was, and being gotten under
a Wall-nut tree, he put off the ſuit he had on, and put on the other.</p>
            <p>When he had done, he returnrd to the Coach, which drove on as before, and
was to paſs over the Bridge, which he called the Bridge of <hi>Boutereſſe.</hi> Ah! dear
waves, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſpeaking to the River, I believe you have no other ſource then
the tears of <hi>Lovers;</hi> but if you can now bear but ſmall wherries, you ſhall hence
forward be able to carry ſhips, ſo much ſhall I ſwell you up with my tears.</p>
            <p>While he ſpoke this he wept, but it was for joy; and being reviſh'd to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in ſo brave a Country, ſays he to thoſe with him, we muſt not delay any longer
to ſalute it; and having caus'd the Coach to be ſtaid again, and the boot taken down,
he enjoyn'd every one to kiſs the earth, as he did. I ſalute thee dear Country, where
<hi>Love</hi> hath his <hi>Empire,</hi> ſaid he, with his hat in his hand, receive me for one of thy
inhabitants, and I promiſe to render thee more famous then thou haſt ever been.</p>
            <p>Every one being gotten into the Coach again, after this Cermony, ſays he to
<hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>Anſelme,</hi> Methinks your names are not fit for Shepherds; will you
not change them? You are to know, that when a man turns Shepherd, he obſerves
the ſame cuſtom, as when he turns Monk, he muſt ever change his name, ye muſt at
leaſt diſguiſe yours. By no means replyes <hi>Monteonr;</hi> for we have each of us an
old Aunt, that hath no children, ſhe will not acknowledge us for her heirs, if we
ſhould quit the name of our family. Well, we will excuſe that, replyes <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but
you are both clad in gray Spaniſh cloath, will you ſubmit to no change as to cloaths?
But to ſay truth, this habit is <hi>Paſtoral</hi> enough in my judgement; keep it, I am very
well pleas'd with it; if mine were yet to make, I would have ſuch another. Gray
is ever good for the Countrey; and I will tell you how ſome diſtinguiſh the three
Eſtates of <hi>France:</hi> They ſay there are <hi>Red, Black</hi> and <hi>Gray;</hi> by the <hi>Red,</hi> is meant a
<hi>Gentleman;</hi> by the <hi>Black,</hi> a <hi>Citizen;</hi> and by the <hi>Grey,</hi> a <hi>Countreyman.</hi> Now I
have heard a very excellent diſcourſe on this occaſion; which is, That if the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
of <hi>France</hi> commonly go in Scarlet, they do it to the end, that if they were hurt,
they might not ſee their own blood run down their cloathes, and be thence diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and that their adverſaries not obſerving it neither, might not think to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
advantage thereby. As for <hi>Schollars</hi> and Lawyers, that they are in <hi>black</hi> is,
becauſe their principal employment is to write, and becauſe they will not wear a
colour, which might receive any injury from ink. And if the <hi>Peaſantry</hi> wear gray,
'tis that being always in the duſt, it might not be ſo apparent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> did much admire theſe excellent obſervations; and <hi>Lyſis</hi>
reaſuming the diſcourſe, diſcover'd much diſatisfaction that he was not cloath'd as
they were, and among other things, ſpake theſe words, <hi>I doubt not but my cloathes
are enough after the Paſtoral mode: but the ſtuff likes me not, becauſe it ſmells ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the Ayr of</hi> Paris. <hi>It was good enough at St.</hi> Cloud, <hi>which is but eight or nine
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43725:64"/>
miles diſtant from</hi> Pompe, <hi>I do not ſay that of the New-bridge, I mean that of cloathes.
How I hate the ſumptuouſneſs of that proud Citie! The Porters go there in their ſilks,
and I fear me the exceſs will ſhortly come to that height, that your Coblers will have
their Aprons of perfum'd Leather, the Carmen carts of Ebony, and the Waterbearers
will have their yokes embroider'd, and have chains of gold inſtead of leather ſtraps.
Lyſis</hi> having ſaid this, was perſwaded he ſhould not hate his own cloathes, ſeeing
they were made, and that all his actions were guided by a good Genius, who had
not counſell'd him to wear it, if he had not thought it convenient; ſo that he was
not now troubled at any thing, but that it came into his minde, that he had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to bring his Gitarhe from <hi>Paris.</hi> Having acquainted <hi>Montenor</hi> with it, he bid
him not trouble himſelf; and told him, he would furniſh him with a very good one
at his houſe. That's very well, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> now I ſhall not be uſeleſs here, no more
then others: All Shepherds ſhould play on ſome inſtrument, for to recreate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in their ſolitude. But ſtay, what an important thing have I forgotten beſides!
Ah! my dear <hi>Sheephook</hi> where are you? I have left you at <hi>Anſelme's</hi> houſe. That's
no great matter, ſays <hi>Montenor,</hi> I promiſe to furniſh you with one worthy the hand
of fair <hi>Paris. Lyſis</hi> aſſured of that, made no further complaint, but fell to obſerve
the fields on both ſides with much content. A Little after, they came to a plain
Countrey-houſe, which was <hi>Montenors,</hi> where they alighted; and not long after,
Supper was brought in. <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who dreamt not while he was eating, that the
night came on, would needs walk out after Supper, but <hi>Montenor</hi> calling for a candle,
told him, it was bed-time, and that ſome reſt were neceſſary after the wearineſs of
the journey, and that the next day there would be leaſure enough to ſee the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
The Shepherd would not believe him, and notwithſtanding all the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they us'd, to detain him, he went out of the houſe, having not the patience to
expect day, that he might the better obſerve the <hi>Mountains,</hi> the <hi>Rocks,</hi> the <hi>Springs,</hi>
and the <hi>Woods.</hi> He croſs'd the fields up and down, without any heed at all, out of
an imagination that he was in <hi>Forreſts;</hi> and though he could not ſee his hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, yet he conceiv'd he took notice of the places. Here, ſays he, hath <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
many times entertain'd <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> and <hi>Lycidas, Phillis;</hi> there's the wood where was
the falſe <hi>Druid,</hi> and I think I am not far from the houſe of <hi>Adamas:</hi> While he
ſaid ſo, he came near an old decay'd houſe, whence there iſſues a great Dog, that
came and bark'd very earneſtly after him. He bethought himſelf, that if he could
catch him, he would be very fit to keep his ſheep, when he ſhould have any; ſo he
made towards the Dog, thinking by this fine Complement, to make him quiet.
Melampus, <hi>poor Cur! come to me, I will be ſo good a Maſter to thee, that thou wilt not
deſire to change thy form into humane, ſuch an eaſie ſervice wilt thou have under me.</hi>
Notwithſtanding all this cajolling, the Dog bark'd ſtill; and <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
a Coward, runs away, and having got two or three ſtones, caſt them at him.
The Dog ran after him, and bit him in the legs, ſo that he made him make yet more
haſte to be gone. When he ſaw himſelf out of danger, he reſted himſelf a while
to take his breath; which when he had done, fearing ſome worſe miſchance, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to return to <hi>Montenors;</hi> but he was above an hour ere he found his way, and
'twas by chance he found it at all. He forgot not to relate the misfortune had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to him, and he complain'd much of the great diſcourteſie of the Dogs of <hi>Forreſts.
Anſelme</hi> having ſomewhat comforted him, he went to bed where they had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him.</p>
            <p>The next morning, all the houſe being up, he admir'd the weather was ſo fair,
and ſaid, that he thought it was not the ſame Sun in that Countrey, as in the <hi>Iſle
of France;</hi> ſo much did he think it more reſplendent, but he attributed that to
the preſence of his Shepherdeſs. After dinner, there hapned an opportunity to ſee
her; for <hi>Anſelme</hi> had deſign'd to wait on <hi>Angelica. Montenor</hi> gave order for the
ſadling of three horſes, and ſo went into the Court with <hi>Anſelme</hi> and the <hi>Shepherd.</hi>
What do you intend to do? ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> for my part, I will not ride, it is not the
cuſtom of Shepherds: Go you thither if you will, and I will take my own time to
follow you; for I will not do a thing that none of my Predeceſſors ever did;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43725:64"/>
I'll rather not ſee <hi>Charitie</hi> at all: I know ſhe would laugh at me, if I ſhould. Before
I become a Cavalier, I'll ſtay here for good and all, I tell you plainly. <hi>Montenor,</hi>
give me your Gytar to employ my ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And now I think on't, where's the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hook
you promis'd me? methinks I have not any preſence at all, if I have
not one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montenor</hi> deſirous to ſatisfie him, carried him into a Cabinet; where he ſhew'd
him his Gytar, and afterward gave him a very handſom Sheephook, that had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
been a Shepherds of his own. That done, he perſwaded <hi>Lyſis</hi> to get a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back:
but he would by no means do it, ſaying it was not handſom to be on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
with a Sheephook in ones hand. So that <hi>Anſelme,</hi> to determine all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts,
was fain to cauſe the horſes to be put into the coach; whereupon they got in
all three, and were brought to <hi>Oronte's</hi> caſtle. <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> were very
glad to ſee him in that Country, where they had not much company; and were
very inquiſitive to know what had happened to the Shepherd, ſince they had
ſeen him.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> were treating the Ladies, <hi>Lyſis</hi> asked one of the
Lacquays where <hi>Charite</hi> was? He anſwered him, that he knew her not: So that
the <hi>Shepherd</hi> began to be angry. In the mean while the Kitchin-maid came in; and
knowing well enough what he meant, told him that his Miſtreſs was in the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drobe.
He went and courted her with that reverence he thought became him: And
the Fair one, who was not any thing proud, return'd his civility, and pray'd him to
ſit down. He was ſomwhat loth to do it, ſaying he ſhould ever be on his knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her: But at length, becauſe he would not contradict her, he took a chair and
ſate down. As it is the firſt talk of thoſe who have no other thing to ſay, to ſpeak
of the weather; <hi>Charite</hi> ſays to him, that ſhe found it very hot. I am very glad,
ſays <hi>Lyſis</hi> to her, that you begin to feel the heat which you make others ſuffer: I
would the Gods were pleas'd that you alſo knew how much you have hurt me!
Who? I! ſayes <hi>Charite:</hi> It muſt then be when we play'd at St. <hi>Clou</hi> with the
Kitchin-maid. But what hurt have I done you? Have I ſcratch'd you, or prick'd
you with ſome looſe pin, or have I trod on your foot? You are in the right on't,
wretch that I am! replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> The <hi>nails</hi> of your <hi>allurements</hi> have <hi>ſcratch'd</hi> my
mind; the <hi>points</hi> of your <hi>features</hi> have <hi>prick'd</hi> me; and the <hi>foot</hi> of your <hi>diſdain</hi>
hath <hi>trod</hi> on that of my <hi>perſeverance:</hi> but above all, you have ſtruck me to the
heart. You ſhould be dead if it were ſo, replies <hi>Charite.</hi> But with what have I ſtruck
you? With the <hi>miracles</hi> of your <hi>Beauty,</hi> ſays <hi>Lyſis.</hi> Do not tell me ſo, replies <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite:</hi>
how ſhould I be beautifull? I am blacker then the Crook in the chimney.
If you are a Crook, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> (who thought himſelf oblig'd to be pleaſant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every thing a Miſtreſs ſaid) it is ſuch a one as ought only to be uſed in the <hi>chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys</hi>
of the <hi>Gods,</hi> where there is no <hi>fire</hi> made but that of <hi>Love.</hi> Thrice happy, nay
four times ſhould I be, if I could be metamorphos'd into ſome celeſtial <hi>Kettle,</hi> that
I might be hang'd upon it; for I would not upon any acount be ſeparated from
you. You are pleas'd to ſay ſo, replies <hi>Charite.</hi> If I am pleas'd to ſay ſo, replies <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi>
it is becauſe I am pleas'd to ſpeak the truth; and it is well known that a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Shepherd as I am cannot be well without you. Your diſdains are your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
ſays <hi>Charite.</hi> I do not ſubmit my ſelf without reaſon, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> yet
do but meaſure me according to the greatneſs of my affection, and not by the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of my deſert, and though I am a Shepherd, ſcorn me not, ſeeing the fair <hi>Cythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi>
hath affected <hi>Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nis</hi> and <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> who were come ſo far ſhort of my quality,
that they were but underling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charite,</hi> who underſtood nothing of all this, thought the entertainment ſomwhat
importunate; and <hi>Angelica</hi> oblig'd her very much, by calling her away about ſome
buſineſs. Thereupon <hi>Lyſis</hi> came back to <hi>Leonora,</hi> who told him that ſhe was not
well pleaſed that he had forſaken her company. Having made his excuſes, he came
to ſpeak to her of the reſolution ſhe had taken to retire into the Country; and
thence took occaſion, by a word of excellent diſcourſe, to commend and magnifie
unto her the delight of a <hi>Paſtoral</hi> life: And at laſt ſays to <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>Anſelme,</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:43725:65"/>
You ſee that my Lady here approves of what I ſay; and that it will be to your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
renown, that you after my example have forſaken the reſidence of Cities:
You have begun well; but he does nothing, that finiſhes not. Are you not reſolved
that we buy each of us his Flock, and go keep them in the fields? There is no need
of that, ſays <hi>Anſelme:</hi> I know there have been Courtiers have clad themſelves as
Shepherds, yet never were maſters of any ſheep: If they had been ask'd where their
Flocks were, they ſaid they had left it ſomwhere afar off in the cuſtody of the dogs.
I do not believe that, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> ſhew it me written. <hi>Anſelme</hi> by good fortune
light, on a ſide-table, on <hi>Diana of Montemajor:</hi> where after he had turn'd over a
good many leaves, he ſhewed him that <hi>Delicio</hi> and <hi>Parthenio</hi> had put on Shepherds
weeds, without ever having any ſheep: And beſides all that, he cauſed him to call
to mind, that in <hi>Aſtraea</hi> there were many Knights had done the like. Yet was he not
convinc'd; and his reaſon was, that ſuch people were but half-Shepherds, and that
a man ſhould aſpire to perfection; and that to avoid idleneſs, 'twere good to have
the care and conduct of a Flock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montenor</hi> told them, that the difference was not ſo eaſily decided; and that
his advice was, to have it referr'd to the arbitration of a Gentleman, a friend of his,
who was very expert in thoſe caſes. <hi>Lyſis</hi> asking him what his name was, <hi>Montenor</hi>
anſwered, it was <hi>Clarimond,</hi> the Author of <hi>The Banquet of the Gods;</hi> and that it
were fit they went to him about it. Whereupon they took leave of <hi>Leonora</hi> and her
daughter, and of <hi>Orontes</hi> and <hi>Florida,</hi> who came in ſomwhat late, and were much
amaz'd at the diſcourſes of <hi>Lyſis.</hi> Being gotten into the Coach, they drew towards
<hi>Clarimond's</hi> houſe, which was but a league off: And the Shepherd could not to
his mind expreſs the content it was to him to go viſit a perſon whom he imagin'd
of ſo extraordinary merit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> had a Caſtle, which being moted about was very handſom and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile:
But <hi>Lyſis,</hi> when he ſaw it, thought it better then it was; he call'd the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traves
Pillars, and the Corniſhes Milſtones unpoliſh'd, wherewith he ſaid it was built.
When they were come into the Court, an antient Gentlewoman, who was <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's</hi>
Mother, came out to receive them, and led them into the Hall, where they
were to ſtay for her ſon; who was gone abroad with his Peece, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to return. She had a glaſs of good freſh wine in the houſe; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
thoſe who were come to ſee him might be thirſty, ſhe call'd for ſome, and
caus'd to be brought in certain Sweet-meats. <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> drank;
but when it came to the Shepherd, he refuſed. <hi>Clementia</hi> (that was the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans
name) deſiring <hi>Lyſis</hi> might drink, went and took the glaſs out of the
Maids hand, and preſented him with it her ſelf. I will not by any means, ſayes he:
You are deceiv'd in me, <hi>ſage Felicia!</hi> I would rather ſwallow poiſon, then take
your draught of oblivion. And with thoſe words he runs out into the Court,
to the great aſtoniſhment of all that were preſent. They follow'd him thither
to ſee what he would ſay; and thereupon comes in <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who imbrac'd his
friend <hi>Montenor,</hi> and bid much welcome to the other two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clementia</hi> was extreamly troubled that <hi>Lyſis</hi> would not drink out of her
hand; and ſhe thought it was out of ſome fear he had that ſhe might poiſon him.
But her Son having brought them all back again into the Hall, and ſeated them,
<hi>Anſelme</hi> waved the diſcourſe, and fell to complement with <hi>Clarimond,</hi> telling him
he ſhould be very glad of his acquaintance, his Works having made ſuch a good
impreſſion in him of his worth. Whereupon <hi>Montenor</hi> came, and ſpoke of
<hi>THE BANQVET OF THE GODS,</hi> which he had divers
times read with great attention. And <hi>Clarimond</hi> fearing that Piece might not
give ſo generall ſatisfaction, whatever might be ſaid of it, ſpoke to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:43725:65"/>
            <p>I Have obſerved in the ancient <hi>Poetry</hi> ſo many <hi>abſurdities,</hi> which ſtrike at all
<hi>judgement,</hi> that I could not poſſibly ſuffer them. Beſides, were they not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory,
ſomewhat might be built on them. But there is a perpetual wandring in
their obſcurities, and I know not how it came to paſs, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> did not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
thoſe who preſented them with ſuch <hi>Fables</hi> for <hi>Divinity.</hi> All I make the <hi>Gods</hi> do
in their <hi>Banquet,</hi> is irriſory and ridiculous; and yet you will finde, if you look nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly,
that I make them not guilty of any action, which may not be deduc'd out
of what others have ſaid of them. But if the ancient Poets were blameleſs, how
much more are the modern, who are not blinded with Paganiſme, and yet cannot ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
mentioning the fained Deities, that were ador'd of old? I ſhall one day more
particularly charge the latter, and ſhew them their folly. Theſe are they that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
us with <hi>Love-ſtories;</hi> nothing can reconcile me to <hi>ſilence,</hi> as to this kinde of
writing. All thoſe that put themſelves in this employment, advance ſuch things as
are clearly incompatible with probability.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> would give no long attention to this Diſcourſe, without replying, O how
art thou guilty of the blindeneſs which thou reproacheſt others with! ſays he to
<hi>Clarimond.</hi> What! when thou findeſt ſome incomparable things in a Book, thou
believeſt them not! If thou art not able thy ſelf to honor a Miſtreſs with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
teſtimonies of fidelity, doth it thence follow there is no Lover that is?
Take notice, that when my Hiſtory is written, it will be taken for a Fable,
as are the adventures which are found in the Poets, in whom thou haſt no faith
at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> was much ſurpris'd at this ſally; and <hi>Anſelme</hi> deſirous to diſcover
unto him the humor of the Shepherd, ſpoke to <hi>Lyſis</hi> in theſe words, Be not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with <hi>Clarimond,</hi> you know wherein you may have need of him. Imagine
that all he hath ſpoken, hath been by way of <hi>Paradox;</hi> he would ſhew his wit by
ſpeaking againſt the truth: But let us enter into ſome other diſcourſe. Tell me
why you would not take the wine out of the Gentlewomans hand? 'Twas becauſe
I thought my ſelf in the Palace of the <hi>ſage Felicia,</hi> replyes <hi>Lyſis:</hi> ſhe gave a drink
to <hi>Sirenus,</hi> to make him forget <hi>Diana;</hi> but whatever rigour <hi>Charite</hi> may exerciſe
over me, I will ever adore her. Ah! unfaithful <hi>Sirenus!</hi> was it poſſible thou
couldſt ſay thoſe words which are written, and ſo finely couch'd in <hi>Montenor?
It may come to paſs, ingrateful Shepherdeſs, that thou ſhalt ſeek me, when I ſhall
hide my ſelf from thee. O Jupiter!</hi> where are thy <hi>Thunderbolts?</hi> why are they
not hurl'd at the guilty head of this Shepherd? <hi>Anſelme</hi> taking him aſide, bid
him take heed what he ſaid; and that he was now in <hi>Forreſts,</hi> and not in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Sirenus;</hi> and that beſides, he much wrong'd <hi>Clementia,</hi> to take her for a
Sorcereſs.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Clarimond</hi> much aſtoniſh'd at the Extravagancies of <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
was acquainted by <hi>Montenor</hi> of what madneſs he was poſſeſs'd. I have now
found what I have a long time ſought after, ſayes <hi>Clarimond:</hi> I vow to you, I
have us'd all the endeavours I could to infuſe <hi>Romantick</hi> Imaginations into a
Perſon I know, but he is now fallen into a ſilent Madneſſe: I believe your Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
is of a more Frolick humour. Beſides, it is not amiſſe to encourage ſuch
people in their Imaginations; for by that means you raiſe their mindes to the
higheſt pleaſures. And thence comes that ordinary Saying, That to be happy
in the world, a man ſhould be either <hi>KING</hi> or <hi>FOOL;</hi> becauſe if the
one have the greateſt real Pleaſures; the other hath the greateſt Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
He therefore that cannot be <hi>KING,</hi> let him endeavour to become a
<hi>FOOL.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe ended, <hi>Clarimond</hi> entreated the Company to ſtay Supper with
him; But <hi>Montenor</hi> told him, their comming to him was with the deſigne to
carry him to Supper elſewhere; and his entreaties were ſo powerful, that they
made him leave his Mother. <hi>Lyſis</hi> having ſpoken by the way, how his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43725:66"/>
refus'd to keep a flock: <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſaid, That they moſt be ſuffered to live
after what mode they pleas'd: but that as for his part, he would not be ſo dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull,
but was content to become a perfect <hi>Shepherd. Lyſis</hi> commended
him for his good intention; and told him, that if he would <hi>Embarque</hi> himſelf
with him upon the <hi>Amorous</hi> Main, he ſhould never ſuffer <hi>Shipwrack,</hi> and that
he was a good <hi>Pilot</hi> in that Navigation: but that he muſt reſolve to imitate him
in all things, if he deſired to live <hi>happy.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>YSIS</hi> being at Table at <hi>Montenor's</hi> with the reſt, there was
preſented to him ſome <hi>Toad-ſtools,</hi> excellently well dreſs'd
They importun'd him to eat of them: but he having taken
two ſpoon-fulls on his trencher, eat ſeven, and returned the
reſt into the diſh. This is not without ceremony, ſayes the
Shepherd: I will be as myſterious as the Prieſts in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
who do all things in a certain order, and obſerve a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
in thoſe things which moſt delight their Divinities.
The number of <hi>four</hi> is dedicated to the <hi>Sun;</hi> that of <hi>two,</hi> to the <hi>Moon;</hi> and that
of <hi>three,</hi> to <hi>Venus.</hi> So will I order it, that <hi>Seven</hi> be dedicated to the Goddeſs <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite:</hi>
becauſe there are ſeven letters in her Name, I have eaten ſeven Toadſtools,
ſeven peeces of fry'd meat, ſeven peeces of bread, and I will drink ſeven glaſſes of
wine, though I ſhould burſt. In good faith, a very excellent Philoſophy! ſay <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond:</hi>
I will be of your ſect, Shepherd! but the Miſtreſs I ſhall chooſe muſt have
at leaſt <hi>nineteen</hi> letters in her name, that when I ſhall be at ſome great feaſt, I may
freely importune all to preſent me with good bits to ſuch a number, leſt I ſhould
commit a ſin againſt the Divinity I am to adore. This muſt not be an argument for
Gluttony or Profaneneſs, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> And beſides thou conſidereſt not that he
that would imitate me, as thou doſt undertake to do, muſt as well expect pains as
pleaſures, according to the Number dedicated to his Goddeſs. I ſometimes walk
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43725:67"/>
ſeven times about the Garden in honour of <hi>Charite,</hi> out of a deſire I have that even
my <hi>walking</hi> may be to her <hi>glory:</hi> I read one Book ſeven times; I behold my ſelf
ſeven times in the glaſs; if I find it hot, I unbutton ſeven buttons of my coat; and
before I go to bed, I make ſeven reverences before my Miſtreſſes <hi>picture.</hi> But if I
am conſtrain'd to do ſomwhat wherein I have neglected to keep account, as to pitch
the bar four times, I return to it again myſelf and make up the number of ſeven. And
if ſomebody gave you four cuffs on the ear, replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> would you not be
willing to receive three more to make up your fortunate number? If it be ſo, you
ſhall have the blows and all the other misfortunes; and for my part, when it comes
to matter of eating, I ſhall be he will eat by number. But in the firſt place, free my
mind of a difficulty: If of all things that are before me there be but five in every
diſh, and that there be ſix letters in my Shepherdeſſes name, muſt I eat nothing at
all, out of a fear to violate your fine myſterious Arithmetick? This queſtion is full
of ſubtilty, anſwers <hi>Lyſis;</hi> learn then, that not to be wanting to thy duty, thou muſt
take but three peeces, and cut each of them in two, or elſe take but one and divide
it into ſix. But take notice that this is no handſom number, and there is none like
that of <hi>ſeven,</hi> which is attributed to <hi>Charite:</hi> There are <hi>ſeven</hi> Planets, the <hi>ſeven</hi>
Stars, <hi>ſeven</hi> Ages of man, <hi>ſeven</hi> Days in the week; and I could make other obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
beſides, to make it appear that by a happy fatality it comes to paſs, that the
faireſt of all the Shepherdeſſes hath <hi>ſeven</hi> letters in her name. But for the preſent
I ſhall ſay no more of it, ſeeing <hi>Clarimond</hi> makes matter of abuſe of ſuch ſerious
things. He hath reaſon for what he doth, as I have too, replies <hi>Anſelme,</hi> were it for
nothing elſe but that you are extreamly miſtaken in the number of the letters of
your Miſtreſſes name, for there muſt be more then ſeven; for ſhe was never call'd
<hi>Charite.</hi> There you are deceiv'd your ſelf, ſays <hi>Lyſis, Love</hi> himſelf hath nam'd her
ſo; and if ſhe have any other name, it is only given her by the vulgar that know
not how they ought to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charimond</hi> hearing this, began openly to abuſe <hi>Lyſis's</hi> Arithmetick: But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
he might give him occaſion to be angry, he abated to a fair compliance
with him. The Shepherd avow'd he was of a very pleaſant humour; and that he
preferr'd a frolick and free diſpoſition, ſuch as his was, before another man's who
ſaid nothing, yet did not think the leſs for it. Thereupon <hi>Anſelme</hi> ask'd <hi>Lyſis</hi> in
what poſture his Loves were, and whether he thought himſelf in the favour of
his <hi>Charite.</hi> He anſwer'd, he was not far from it, and that it was the matter
and reaſon of his cheerfulneſs. But <hi>Anſelme</hi> returns to him in this manner: You
conſider not what you ſay, Shepherd! For if your Miſtreſs love you already, and
is ready to grant you what you ſhall demand, you will not have any brave occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to make appear your fidelity. This ſhould be your affliction; and it ſhould be
your deſire that ſhe were <hi>cruel</hi> to you, that ſo there might happen to you ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
adventures. Your reaſon is very ſpecious, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but I fear me there
may be ſome want of truth in it: Welcome is better then diſdain, whatever may be
ſaid to the contrary. But you ſee that <hi>Aſtraea</hi> hath diſdain'd <hi>Celadon,</hi> after ſhe had
once loved him, ſays <hi>Anſelme;</hi> Do you hope to be better dealt with? What will
you adviſe me to do then? ſays <hi>Lyſis.</hi> There is no doubt, replies <hi>Anſelme,</hi> but
that you ſhould caſt your ſelf, as he did, into the River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> at the leaſt harſh
word you ſhall receive from <hi>Charite.</hi> Let there be then three Nymphs on the ſhore
ready to take me out of the water, reply'd <hi>Lyſis;</hi> for what can I tell whether they'll
be there, if notice be not given them before-hand? I might be drown'd in the mean
time, for I cannot ſwim. It was out of a full intention to be drown'd, that <hi>Geladon</hi>
caſt himſelf into the water, ſays <hi>Anſelme:</hi> Do you the like, and you ſhall be look'd
after: Faithfull Lovers never miſs relief; you ſee <hi>Damon</hi> was ſav'd, and taken out
of a River. I will not truſt to that, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Let me have two Hogs-bladders
under my arms, and I will confidently caſt my ſelf into <hi>Lignon.</hi> That's very wiſely
ſpoken, ſays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> but for my part, who am yet but an Apprentice in Love,
I will not preſume to caſt my ſelf into the water; I muſt leave that honour to my
Maſter who is more knowing then <hi>I; I</hi> will not plunge my ſelf but in wine: And
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43725:67"/>
now I think on't according to the <hi>Poets,</hi> it is only proper to the <hi>Sun</hi> to caſt himſelf
into the water: yet in the time of Vintage, they ſay, he doth not lye down in the
Sea, but gets into one of the Fats of <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s Wine-preſs, where he treads the
Grapes, and that's the reaſon he looks ſo red ſometimes when he riſes. That's an
excellent imagination; well ſaid Shepherd, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> thou art worthy to be
my Comrade.</p>
            <p>Upon this Supper was ended, but ſo, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> fail'd not to perfect the number
of ſeven, both in the fruits, and in drinking. That he was not drunk was, becauſe
he drunk but ſmall Glaſſes. The cloath being taken away, he went to the place
where the Gitarhe was, which <hi>Montenor</hi> had given him, and never conſidering
whether it were in tune or no, he returns playing a <hi>Saraband.</hi> O God, cryes out <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond,</hi>
what do we hear? Hath <hi>Apollo</hi> committed ſome new fault, that hath caus'd
<hi>Jupiter</hi> to baniſh him out of heaven? Comes he once more hither among the <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds?</hi>
Is it not the ſweet ſound of his harp that tickles our ears? <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſtaid a
good while, playing in the next Chamber to <hi>Montenors;</hi> being very proud they
took him for the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Muſick,</hi> and thinking no leſs then that he might eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
others. <hi>Clarimond</hi> continued ſtill to ſpeak, and ſaid, Oh! I am raviſh'd I
am enchanted! O what Melody is this? I ſwoun! ſome vinegar here quickly to
comfort my heart. <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>Anſelme</hi> made the like exclamations; but at length
<hi>Lyſis</hi> appears to them laughing, and they gave him a thouſand praiſes for knowing
ſo well how to charm mens mindes by his harmony. Why have I not now ſome
excellent Ayr? ſays he: There is no other way but to compoſe one, that ſhall
draw after me the moſt inſenſible things. Tis fit I ſhould preſently make ſome verſes.
I ſhall be much more fortunate, having this inſtrument in my hand; for with the
ſound of a Lute or Gittarhe the wandring <hi>Muſes</hi> are recollected, as the Bees are
at the noiſe of a Kettle. <hi>Clarimond,</hi> I muſt have thy aſſiſtance to compoſe a Song,
that I may the ſooner have done. I ſuppoſe thou haſt a good faculty in making
of Verſes, thou art ſuch an ingenuity, that art of all Profeſſions. I do not
meddle with <hi>Poetry,</hi> replyes <hi>Clarimond;</hi> and if you deſire to know how much I have
ſometime belabour'd my ſelf about it, and for what reaſon I have quitted that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
hear the laſt Verſes I made: I'll repeat them to you.</p>

               <hi>Clarimond</hi> having repeated this Sonnet, which was much commended by the
Company; ſaid, he had made it the beſt he could, that it might not be ſaid, if it
were ſeen, that he had done well to quit Poetry, becauſe he underſtood not much
of it. But ſeeing thou confeſſeſt thy ſelf, that the charms of Poetry are powerful,
ſayes the <hi>Shepherd</hi> to him, Why canſt not thou diſpence with them in the buſineſs
of <hi>Love,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Muſick</hi> are the two Chamber-maids of <hi>Venus?</hi> Be not
too ſure of that, anſwers <hi>Clarimond;</hi> for if in the very diſpraiſe of Verſes, I have
made other Verſes, 'tis becauſe that being to ſpeak to <hi>Poetry,</hi> I would pay her in
her own coyn, and ſpeak in her own Language. I'll tell thee one thing, replyes
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſeeing thou art reſolved not to make any more Verſes thy ſelf, thou ſhalt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
teach me the Rhimes; for I do not know them all; and withal, I muſt tye thee
not to have any thing further to do with my work, leſt thou become ſo inſolent,
as to pretend to the credit of it.</p>
            <p>This being agreed on, <hi>Clarimond</hi> bid <hi>Lyſis</hi> beware he made not ſuch imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Verſes as no man would regard; and not do as a certain <hi>Court-Poets</hi> did, who
made Verſes for a Mask, which were ſo poor, that they were never read after that
night, but were forgotten the next day; ſo it was laid by way of abuſe, that he had
not give his works to the <hi>light,</hi> but to the <hi>dark.</hi> Fear not that misfortune, ſayes
<hi>Lyſis</hi> to him, though I ſhould make Verſes for a <hi>Serenade,</hi> they ſhould not want
day if they were but preſented to <hi>Charite:</hi> But what do I ſay, that they ſhall not
want day, will they not beſtow day on this age, they ſhall be ſo excellent? If thou
whom I have deſign'd to write my Hiſtory, wilt dedicate thy book to <hi>Charite,</hi> as
thou muſt needs do, aſſure thy ſelf it will be truly put to light, ſeeing the light of
her eyes ſhall enlighten it. Thou knewſt not before, that the heavens had reſerved
thee for this dignity; know it now, and diſcharge thy ſelf faithfully. Forſake me
not; and take notice of all I ſhall ſay: I was once minded, that my Hiſtory ſhould
have been printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> but it ſhall not; I will not have Mercenary Mechanicks
employ'd about it, there are Nymphs will take the charge on them here in ſome
Cave, they ſhall have Characters of ſilver, and ſhall not uſe ſo much ink as gold
and azure. Happy will the paper be, whereon ſhall be imprinted my famous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures!
Happy the hands ſhall be employ'd about it! happy they who ſhall read
ſuch noble things! but much more happy the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis</hi> that ſhall have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
them, and thou <hi>Clarimond</hi> that ſhall have deſcribed them!</p>
            <p>After this gallant diſcourſe, <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſeeing he was content his Hiſtory ſhould
be in Proſe, promis'd him to do it, though he had no great forwardneſs to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the pains. There was a bed made ready for him in the ſame Chamber where
<hi>Lyſis</hi> was already a-bed. The Shepherd would not ſuffer him to take any reſt at
all; one while he ask'd him for an <hi>Epith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te,</hi> another while for a <hi>Rhime: Clarimond,</hi>
who was as merry a Lad as any in <hi>France,</hi> told him always the oddeſt words he
could think on, purpoſely to put him out. At break of day, as he began to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep,
<hi>Lyſis</hi> riſes, and awakens him by his running up and down the Chamber, and
crying out, I have found it, I have it, it is the beſt humor of a Song that ever was.
I know what meaſure the Stanza's ſhall be of, and it ſhall be ſet to a better air then
ever <hi>Guedron</hi> was author of. Is there then no poſſibility of ſleeping with you? ſays
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> you have interrupted me in as fine a dream, as ever I dream'd And what
didſt thou dream of? tell me, ſayes <hi>Lyſis.</hi> I dream'd that you were an <hi>Aſs,</hi> replyes
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> and that <hi>Charite</hi> was another, and that you were put into a Cart for to
draw it. This is <hi>Emblematical,</hi> replyes <hi>Lyſis:</hi> if the God <hi>Morpheus</hi> hath repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to thee that I was an <hi>Aſs,</hi> 'tis to ſignifie the <hi>Travels</hi> I undergo with <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
That might very well be, ſays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> but you are not a <hi>Goddeſs,</hi> like that
of <hi>Apuleius:</hi> and if <hi>Apuleius</hi> under the likeneſs of an Aſs meant a man, you who
have a contrary deſtiny, carry an Aſs in the likeneſs of a man. Whether it be ſo or
no, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> it matters not: but if thou haſt ſeen <hi>Charite</hi> like a ſhe Aſs, it is to
denote, ſhe hath good ears, and that ſhe very well hears my ſighs. And if we were
drawing a cart: O happy preſage! 'tis to ſhew we ſhall be both ſubject to the
ſame yoke. But it is to be known, what will be the conſequence of it: I pray thee
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43725:68"/>
friend make an end of thy dream. I may ſleep again, ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> but do you
think I can faſten on the ſame dream as I pleaſe my ſelf? See whether you can do
it your ſelf, and ſo accompliſh what I have begun. Alas! I cannot, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi>
I muſt wake for to ſpeak to the Muſes, who are not ſo liberal of their entertainments
when 'tis once hig-day, becauſe they are aſham'd to be ſeen ſpeaking with men.
Certainly their chaſtity is remarkable, not to come to men but in the night I replies
<hi>Clarimond.</hi> Do not jeer, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> what I ſay is true: But there is another thing
hinders one from ſleeping; <hi>Love</hi> doth ever ſtand Sentinel on my bolſter with his
bow in hand, leſt <hi>Sleep</hi> might enter into mine eyes: Before I can be overcome,
that Sentinel muſt be knock'd down. <hi>Clarimond</hi> return'd nothing to this, becauſe
he would have a little reſt: And <hi>Lyſis</hi> believing he would dream again, made no
noiſe at all leſt he ſhould awake him; by which means he had the opportunity to
ſleep a good while after.</p>
            <p>When he awoke, he found <hi>Lyſis</hi> quite dreſs'd, very buſie about his Verſes. He
had already dedaſh'd away above ten ſheets of paper, writing down a Stanza, and
then blotting it out to put another in ſtead, and then daſhing out that to put down
the former. He had ſpoil'd at leaſt ſix Pens, by biting them at the ends; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all the Stationers ſhops in the Country could not have furniſh'd him, had he
been to compoſe ſome heroick Poem. His nails were already gnawn to the very
ſtumps; and he put himſelf into ſuch a diverſity of poſtures in his imaginations, that
he was quite wearied out. <hi>Clarimond</hi> pittied him, obſerving that when he could
not light on the end of a Verſe to his mind, 'twas ſuch a vexation to him, that he
made more wry faces then a Cat that had ſwallow'd muſtard. Whereupon he riſe
preſently; and having ſeen in what forwardneſs his work was, he reform'd what
was amiſs, and gave him directions for to accompliſh the whole peece. <hi>Lyſis</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
promiſed himſelf all the credit, though he had been willing to be aſſiſted; for
he was reſolv'd to lye with confidence. <hi>Clarimond</hi> did not much regard it: And
<hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>Anſelme</hi> being come to viſit him, he told them himſelf that the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
had made an admirable Copy of Verſes. Whereupon <hi>Lyſis</hi> being intreated to
ſhew them, began to read them in a magnificent tone. They were theſe:</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Montenor</hi> ſaid he was ſomwhat in doubt whether the ſo often repeating the word
<hi>Charite</hi> was not a fault. But he was anſwer'd, that it was very elegant; and that he
that did not acknowledge it, was no good Judge. To which <hi>Lyſis</hi> added, that that a
name was the faireſt ornament of his Verſes; and that he thought one time to make
Stanza wherein there ſhould be nothing elſe. As for <hi>Anſelme,</hi> he admir'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
which indeed was not to be found fault with, for there ſeem'd to be a many
Eccho's repeating the complaints of a Lover. But the <hi>Shepherd</hi> was wiſe enough
not to diſcover that the deſign came from <hi>Clarimond.</hi> That which was conceiv'd
moſt cenſurable, was, that the Shepherd had no cauſe to make any ſuch complaint.
To which he anſwer'd, that never any Lover, ſuch as he, could be without affliction;
and if he feign'd himſelf dead, 'twas only to move <hi>Charite</hi> to ſuccour him. Do you
not ſee that all things have compaſſion on me? ſays he: Nature herſelf believes not
I am alive; the Heaven is to day all dark, it is becauſe it mourns for my departure.
Not to diſſemble, there is no ſuch matter, ſays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> But you Gentlemen of
the Tribe of Poets never denominate your Miſtreſſes <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>favourable,</hi> or <hi>cruel</hi>
and <hi>rigorous,</hi> but according as one of theſe words is neceſſary to make up the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or rhime of your Verſes: And when your thoughts are taken up about ſome
<hi>favour</hi> done, that they might hit right, it's a ſmall matter with you to call the Ladies
<hi>ungratefull.</hi> So that it may be ſaid, they are whatever you are pleas'd they
ſhould be.</p>
            <p>The amorous <hi>Shepherd</hi> return'd nothing to this railing, for he heeded it not, his
mind being taking up to conſider of an aire for his Song. He at laſt made up one
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43725:69"/>
with the beginning and end of two other ayrs which he knew before, and yet he
conceiv'd there was nothing of all this which came not from himſelf. When he had
ſung it, all confeſs'd it was admirable; and becauſe it was pretty late, they went to
dinner. <hi>Clarimond</hi> a while after, went his ways, ſaying, that ſome domeſtick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
call'd him away, and that his good mother would conclude him loſt, if he did
not return in ſome time. <hi>Lyſis</hi> remembring himſelf, that he had not yet ſeen the
Shepherds of <hi>Forreſts,</hi> becauſe his Loves had ſtill diverted him, entreated <hi>Montenor</hi>
to bring him acquainted with them. They are no leſs then two leagues off this
place, replyes <hi>Montenor,</hi> I am not now at leaſure to go ſo far: If you will not
go along with me, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I'll leave you preſently and go my wayes: how
will you have me ſpend my time here? ſtudy your Song, ſays <hi>Montenor,</hi> that ſo you
may not be ſurpris'd in any thing you do. There indeed you are in the right replyes
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> that's a thing of no ſmall conſequence.</p>
            <p>Having ſo ſaid, he went and lock'd himſelf into his chamber, being all alone with
his Gitarrhe, and would do nothing the remainder of that day, but learn the air of
his Song. In the mean time <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>Anſelme</hi> went a hunting: when they
were return'd, he came to Supper with them, which being done, he entreated <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme</hi>
to lend him one of his Lacquays to go with him as far as <hi>Charite's</hi> houſe. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme</hi>
having given him permiſſion to take which he would of them, he would not
take <hi>Gringalet,</hi> becauſe he began to diſcover he was too much a Wag: He choſe
<hi>Champagne</hi> his fellow Lacquay, who was a great Lad, and one whom he thought
tractable enough: ſo having taken leave of the company, he took him along, not
forgetting his Gitarhe; for his deſign was in good earneſt to give his Miſtreſs a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renade.
Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> would not take the pains to follow him, nor indeed
was it his deſire they ſhould, as having no need of ſo many witneſſes. The way
ſeem'd not to him either long or tedious: ſo ſoon did he recover <hi>Oronte's</hi> houſe,
where having put his Gitarhe in tune, he began to play, and withal ſung his air. His
muſick was ſo good, that <hi>Champagne,</hi> who might well be ranked among the duller
ſort of people, was not much taken with it. There was ſuch a conſort between his
voyce and his inſtrument, as made a muſick as delightful as the braying of an Aſs
would do, with the noiſe of the wheel of a mill. But the beſt ſport was, that for
to feign a <hi>Syncope,</hi> he deſcended by degrees, that at laſt he ſung ſo low, that he could
not be heard. The air being finiſh'd, he plaid certain Sarabands, with which his
ſighes bear a part, and at every ſhake he fetch'd one from the bottom of his breaſt.
Notwithſtanding all this, he was ſo far unfortunate, that his Miſtreſs heard no more
of this <hi>Serenade,</hi> then ſhe had done of that at St. <hi>Cloud;</hi> and there were only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
dogs, who by their noiſe diſcover'd their attention to this muſick As for his
own part, he was not ſo taken up in what he did himſelf, but that he heard the touch
of a Late the other ſide of <hi>Orontes</hi>'s houſe. Follow me <hi>Champagne,</hi> ſaies he to the
Lacquay, here is ſome ſignal adventure preſents it ſelf. When he had ſo ſaid, he
drew nigh the place where they had heard the Lute; but then they heard it, as if it
been farther off: and the more they came forward, the more did it ſeem to draw back.
At length having paſs'd through a many trees, they came into a field, where they
ſaw ſome body going before them, but could not diſcern who it was. They fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
it leaſurely, till it entred a little wood, towards which <hi>Lyſis</hi> ran as faſt as he
could: Ha! <hi>Champagne,</hi> ſaies he, 'Tis an <hi>Hamadryad</hi> that we ſaw but now; it was
come out of this Wood, to give my Miſtreſs a Serenade as well as I. Now it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to its reſidence again: we muſt needs follow it, to give it thanks for this
courteſie. <hi>Champagne</hi> ſaid it was time to return home, that they ſhould not ſpend
their time ſo vainly; and that he might go into the Wood as far as he pleas'd, but
that for his part, he was content to ſtay for him at the entrance. <hi>Lyſis</hi> hearing that,
flung himſelf immediately into a hedge, which though it were ſomewhat thick ſet,
yet with much ado he made his way through. He heard the Lute ſtill, ſo that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from one ſide to the other through the trees, he thought at length to finde the
<hi>Hamadryad;</hi> but when he could hear nothing at all, he began to cry out, Whither
do you run away from me? fair Nymph, 'tis not for to do you any violence, that I am
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43725:70"/>
come hither: alas! my affections are engag'd elſewhere. Wherefore do you hide
your ſelf from me? come and bear a part in muſick with me: Are you already lock'd
up within your bark? While he made thoſe complaints, he had ſo travell'd up and
down the Wood, that <hi>Champagne</hi> could not hear him. He call'd him divers times, but
ſeeing he anſwered not, and that it were a folly to look after him in the dark, he
return'd to <hi>Montenors,</hi> to whom he gave an account of his loſs. He was much
blam'd by his Maſter, who made no pleaſure of any misfortunes that hapned to <hi>Lyſis.</hi>
Yet it was conceiv'd it would be no hard matter to finde him again, if there were but
any ſearch made for him the next morning. In the mean time, <hi>Lyſis</hi> being as much
troubled as poſſibly he could be, embrac'd all the trees he met with, and asked them
tidings of the Nymph he had loſt. After he had thus employed himſelf an hour or
two, he came among a ſort of thorns &amp; briars, beyond which he perceiv'd the fields.
He thought to finde <hi>Champagne</hi> there ſtill, for the time had ſeem'd ſo ſhort to him
that he imagin'd he had not been in the Wood above half a quarter of an hour.
When he ſaw it was to no purpoſe to call, and that the other anſwered not, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair'd
not to return alone; but he was ſo far from knowing the way, that he went
far enough out of it, and for ſome two hours follow'd certain unknown pathes. At
length wearineſs forc'd him to caſt himſelf into a Thicket, where he reſted till day,
When the Sun had darted on his eyes, and oblig'd him to open them, he breaks
forth, and ſayes, O how well have I paſs'd this night, methinks, better to my minde
then on a Feather bed! O how fine a thing it is to riſe at a ſtart, without having any
occaſion of a man to help me on with my cloathes! O what a pleaſant adventure
have I gone through! and what a truly <hi>Romantick</hi> thing it is to lie on the hard
<hi>ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the end of this diſcourſe he went out of the thicket, and having his Gittarh
ſtill in his hand, he beſet himſelf to play, to ſalute the new day, and conform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the birds, who were already warbling their notes. He went on ſtill, till he
came to a little Hamlet, where keeping ſtill the ſame poſture, he ſtill ſcrub'd over
certain tunes. There were five or ſix children at a door, who ran after him ſinging
divers tunes, and pull'd ſo much at his coat, that he was fain to ſtay, and play be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them to buy his quiet, and appeaſe them. There was one among them, went
and told his mother, that he had heard muſick; ſo that ſhe thinking it had been
ſome poor Lad, that went from houſe to houſe to play before children, carried him
a piece of bread and cheeſe. He was ſo hungry, that he could not refuſe what was
preſented, and having eaten it up, he drank at a little fountain in his way.</p>
            <p>Thence he thought it was his beſt courſe to go ſeek out the Shepherds of <hi>Forreſts</hi>
then to return to <hi>Montenors,</hi> ſeeing he would not bring him to them. Now there
was very little paſture-grounds in that quarter; he met not ſo much as with any
Shepherds of the Countrey; and for what other people came in his way, they were
only Carters, whom he vouchſafed not to trouble himſelf with, though they lookt
upon him with admiration. When he ſaw any little hill, he was impatient till he came
to the top, to ſee what was beyond it; and if a thicket came in his way, he muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
go through that, to ſee what were behinde. At laſt he meets a <hi>Hermite,</hi> who
walk'd along a hedge ſide, ſaying his <hi>Breviary.</hi> He preſently imagin'd him to be a
<hi>Druid,</hi> and making a low reverence to him, Father, ſaies he, do me the favour as
to tell me whether I am yet very far from the paſtures where <hi>Celadon</hi> and <hi>Aſtraea</hi>
feed their flocks. The <hi>Hermite,</hi> who never had read any <hi>Romance,</hi> anſwers him,
That he knew not thoſe people he named. But tell me, whence come you with your
rebeck? Let us look out for a place to ſit down, ſayes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and you ſhall have
my hiſtory:</p>
            <p>Father (continues he, being ſate on a hillock with the <hi>Hermite)</hi> the <hi>Iſle of
France</hi> is my Country. In theſe parts, <hi>Montenor</hi> is my entertainer, <hi>Anſelme</hi> my
friend, <hi>Charite</hi> my enemy. It is true, there is ſome ſweetneſs in her enmity, and I
was in hope the laſt night to have charm'd her with the ſweet ſound of my Gitarhe.
You know that the nights are ſo quiet, that there is nothing heard but the winds, and
the noiſe of the ſprings, nor had I any thought to violate their their ordinary ſilence;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43725:70"/>
for I have been the cauſe of no noiſe, but that of my ſighs, and that of the fountain
of my tears. I have lain on no other bed then that which nature afforded me: And
<hi>Aurora,</hi> who is a very charitable Lady, ſeeing me this morning, had compaſſion on
me; ſhe wept very much, and 'tis not to be thought it was for the death of her ſon.
The <hi>Hermite,</hi> who was not guilty of much ſtudy, apprehended nothing of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
all he could pick out of it was, that he thought it well done to lie on the
ground for to mortifie the fleſh. He was forc'd to ſay to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that above all things
he was deſirous to know what profeſſion he was of. All my employment is to <hi>love,</hi>
replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> if I <hi>write,</hi> if I make <hi>verſes,</hi> if I <hi>walk,</hi> if I <hi>meditate,</hi> all is for to learn
how to <hi>love</hi> well. You are a happy man, ſays the Hermite, if ſo be you love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Divinity: If you will ſerve that, ſtay with me and take the habit of
Monk, we ſhall ſpend the reſt of our days with much pleaſure together: Nor indeed
can I think otherwiſe then that you are a Vagabond, and that it were better you
had ſome retreat. <hi>Lyſis</hi> diſcovering by this that he had to do with an <hi>Hermite,</hi> ſaid
to him, Know, Father, that I have found the true tranquility of life. 'Tis true,
there are many which turn <hi>Monks,</hi> to withdraw from the vanities of the world:
but I have choſen another condition wherein there is a like felicity: I am turn'd
<hi>Shepherd</hi> not long ſince, do you not ſee I have taken the <hi>habit?</hi> To tell you no lye,
when my friends ſaw me take it, they endeavoured as much to make me quit it again,
as if they had ſeen me enter'd among the bare-leg'd <hi>Carmelites;</hi> but all their cryes
have been to no purpoſe. Whereupon the Hermite told him, that his beſt courſe
were to follow his firſt inclination, if ſo be it were not ill: however, to ſhew him
where he ſpent his life, he led him to his Cell, which was very well accommodated.
<hi>Lyſis</hi> having drank ſome wine out of his begging-jack, deſired him to ſhew him the
right way to <hi>Montenor's;</hi> becauſe that meeting no body that could bring him to
the Shepherds of <hi>Forreſts,</hi> he was reſolved to go back thither. The Hermite told him
it was above nine miles to the houſe he ask'd for, and that he ſhould make haſte if
he had a mind to recover it before night. Thereupon <hi>Lyſis</hi> took leave of the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,
aſſuring him that if he had not been a <hi>Shepherd</hi> he would have been a <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,</hi>
and promiſing he would endeavour to ſee him again one time or other. He
follow'd a great road that he had ſhew'd him; and as he went along he did nothing
but meditate on this laſt adventure. He was ſomwhat ſorry he had not ſtaid with
the Hermite, becauſe it came into his imagination that he underſtood Magick, and
that he could have taught him many ſecrets.</p>
            <p>He had not gone five miles, but he came to the Wood where he had look'd for
the <hi>Hamadryad;</hi> but he knew not it was the ſame. It belong'd to one called <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
who at the end of it had a houſe. This Gentleman was a great friend of <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's:</hi>
who returning from <hi>Montenor's</hi> houſe, had met him and acquainted him
with the excellent humour of <hi>Lyſis.</hi> He therefore having had notice that the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
was to give <hi>Charite</hi> a Serenade, would needs give her one too, and was come
to play on the Lute before <hi>Oronte's</hi> houſe at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>It began to grow dark when <hi>Lyſis</hi> enter'd the Wood; ſo that not being able to
ſee much, a certain fear ſeiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d his ſoul. Is not this Wood conſecrated to ſome God!
ſaid he in himſelf: Behold here is a place ſo deſert, that no body comes into it, if
he be not out of his way: Never any Shepherd nor Graſier enter'd it, and there was
never heard the noiſe of an axe in it: I dare not ſo much as lean againſt theſe buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
ſuch is my fear they may loſe ſome of their leafs, and that I commit ſo many
murthers.</p>
            <p>He advanc'd ſtill with much reſpect, till he perceiv'd <hi>Hircan,</hi> who was walking in
an Alley with a wand in his hand. He preſently believ'd he was a Magician that
dwelt there; and making him a low conge, he ſays to him, I crave your pardon
that I am come to diſturb your ſolitude: Had you not deſired I ſhould have ſeen
you, you might have employ'd your Art to hinder my entrance into this Wood:
But I believe you are content I ſhould come before you, ſeeing you have permitted
it, and I hope you'll give me leave to addreſs my vows to the Divinities which you
adore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:43725:71"/>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> hearing this, knew preſently he was the man that <hi>Clarimond</hi> had given
him a character of; and being very glad of this rencontre, told him he might freely
come on any place that belong'd to him, even into his houſe, which was ever open
to perſons of merit.</p>
            <p>I am then to give my thanks to the <hi>Deſtiny</hi> that hath brought me hither, replies
<hi>Lyſis:</hi> A poor Lover, as I am, may receive much aſſiſtance from ſuch a man as you;
you know the properties of herbs and ſtones, and by your Magick you afford reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to all that are afflicted. <hi>Hircan</hi> perceiving by this, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> took him for an
Enchanter, would continue him in that opinion, and anſwered him thus: You are
not deceiv'd, if you believe that nothing is impoſſible to my charms: When the
Moon is ecclipſed, it is I that have drawn her from heaven for to lie with me; and
of the chaſteſt of all the Goddeſſes I make my Concubine: I caus'd one morning
ſuch an Earthquake, that all the pots and kettles were overturn'd, and all manner of
houſholdſtuff was turn'd topſie-turvie: Sometimes I ſtay the Rivers, and hinder
them to pay their tribute to the Sea: I root up the Trees of the Forreſt as eaſily as
a Labourer plucks up the ſtalks of corn; and if I have ſome meſſage to ſend any
where, I command the Spirits as I do my Lacquays. You ſhall not be deſired to
do ſo great things for me, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> nor do I deſire you ſhould cauſe the Trees
of my neighbour to remove into my ground, nor that you give the ſcab to the ſheep
of my Rival: All I deſire to know, is, whether my Miſtreſs loves me or no, and
whether I ſhall one day receive the ſatisfaction of my wiſhes. Come, you ſhall
ſup with me, Shepherd! replies <hi>Hircan</hi> to him: We'll conſider of thoſe things
hereafter.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid ſo, he led him into his Caſtle; which was ſo well built, that the
Shepherd imagin'd it had been the workmanſhip of the Spirits, as the Palace of
<hi>Armida.</hi> So that he was fully ſatisfied that this was no counterfeit Magician, ſuch
as <hi>Clemantes</hi> was who deceiv'd <hi>Galathea. Hircan</hi> was a very looſe perſon, and
had then with him a very handſom Gentlewoman that he entertain'd for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
He made <hi>Lyſis</hi> believe ſhe was a Nymph of the waters, that he had conſtrain'd
by his charms to come and live in his Caſtle. When ſhe had been told of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the perſon, ſhe would needs make ſome ſport with him. Being at table
only they three, ſhe ſtill caſt on him ſuch languiſhing and amorous looks, as if ſhe
had been deeply in love with him. Whenever he perceiv'd it, he bow'd down his
head as a baſhfull Girl, and durſt not look on her. After ſupper, <hi>Hircan</hi> left him
with her, ſaying he would go into his Study to conſult with the Spirits about his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
She talk'd with him about divers things; but chiefly ſhe was inquiſitive to
know certain particularities of his Loves, which he reckoned up to her with much
modeſty. The Magician being return'd, told him, that all he could diſcover was,
that by perſeverance he ſhould overcome <hi>Charite:</hi> but that thence-forward he
ſhould find it a hard matter to come to her, becauſe <hi>Leonora</hi> kept her very cloſe.
There is a remedy for that, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> I will diſguiſe my ſelf to go and ſee her:
Cannot you by your art give me ſome other form then what I have, and ſo render
me ſuch as I may not be known? I will conſider to night what face you ſhall take,
replies <hi>Hircan:</hi> Set your heart at reſt, and to to bed where I have appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> went his way cheerfully to bed full of great hopes; and the next morning
the Conjurer coming to him caus'd him to put his head into a pail of water, while
he mumbled certain barbarous words over him; which when he had done, he ſaid
to him, Aſſure your ſelf that you are now like a handſom Country-wench: You
have now no more to do, but to go immediately to <hi>Leonora;</hi> I know ſhe wants a
Maid, doubt not but ſhe'll take you, and by that means you ſhall ſee <hi>Charite</hi> when
you will, and enjoy all the pleaſure in the world. <hi>Lyſis</hi> having a confidence in this,
went down into the Kitchin: All the Servants had the watchword given them,
What would you, fair Maid! ſays one; whence come you? Another by way of
abuſe, ſwore he would willingly give his old breeches for her maidenhead. <hi>Lyſis</hi>
was out of himſelf for joy at this; and runs laughing to <hi>Hircan,</hi> for to give him
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43725:71"/>
the commendations of his art. He was ſo impatient, that he took leave of him and
the <hi>aquatick Nymph;</hi> and taking a Lacquay for his guide, took his way to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s
houſe. He was not gone fifty paces from the houſe, but he meets a Countrey wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
being deſirous to try whether ſhe took him for a maid, he went and made
her a low courteſie; and ſaid to her, with a counterfeit voyce, Good morrow Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſip!
pray ſhew me the way to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s Caſtle, I am a poor maid out of my way.
Truly (anſwers the Countrey woman grumbling) I would not ſuch a maid lay a
night with my daughter, I ſhould fear ſhe might bring me more. What! you
have no compaſſion on thoſe of your own ſex, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> I pray ſhew me the way,
this Lad knows it not; mark what may happen, if I come not ſoon to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s:
I may be met by Shepherds, or Swineherds, or it may be by <hi>Satyrs,</hi> and then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
the flower of my virginity.</p>
            <p>Thereupon the Lacquay laughing, told the woman, that it was a maid that he
conducted: but ſhe grew a little angry, and purſuing her way, told them, they were
affronters, and bid them make ſport with ſome other. The Shepherd ſeeing this, knew
that the charm of <hi>Hircan</hi> was not ſo ſtrong as he had conceiv'd, but he preſently
bethought him, that it was his own fault, becauſe he had ſtill mans cloathes on,
which had not been chang'd with his body: ſo that he would needs return to the
Magician for ſome remedy. He told him what he thought of it; and <hi>Hircan</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
him, that when he had maids cloathes on, he might a great deal better deceive
the world then in a mans. The watery Nymph was thereupon call'd for to dreſs
him. He put off all to his drawers, which done, ſhe put on him an under-petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat,
and on that a green coat, and a gray waſtcoat, and coiff'd him after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
of <hi>Brie.</hi> She ſighed ſo deeply in dreſſing him, that the Shepherd could not
but ask her what ſhe ailed. Alas! I ail nothing, ſaies ſhe, but that though I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
your ſweet company, yet you forſake me to go to a Bitch, a Tygreſs, and a
ſhe-Wolf. Ah me! what ſay you, <hi>Synopaz</hi> (replies the Shepherd, who imagin'd
ſhe was ſo called) take heed the heavens puniſh you not; for my part I excuſe you,
it is not you that ſpeak, but Rage and Jealouſie.</p>
            <p>By this time he was quite ready, and <hi>Hircan</hi> having brought a looking-glaſs, he
beheld himſelf therein, and cry'd out through exceſs of joy, O God! it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
more to reſemble a Shepherdeſs then I do: Here's nothing left of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> but a ſoft down that ſhadows my chin. That's not much, ſaies <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
there are many women have more beard then that, and among others, my own
Kitchin-maid. However, let it be taken off, if you will. It is not to be much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at, if I have a little, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> for 'tis three years ſince that a golden fleece
hath adorn'd my face; though it might be very decent, yet I have ſhorn it once
in eight days, and have rub'd me every morning with a pumice ſtone, to hinder it
to grow, that I might ſeem the younger; but particularly, to be ready to diſguiſe
my ſelf like a maid, when there ſhould be any occaſion, as I have ever had a deſire
to do. <hi>Lyſis</hi> having ſo ſaid, <hi>Hircan's</hi> man took off what hair was on his chin. Then
did he believe, that his change of cloathes, together with the charm, was enough
to deceive all the world. Beſides that, <hi>Hircan</hi> told him, he would be at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s
while he ſhould be ſpeaking to <hi>Leonora,</hi> to perſwade her to take him into her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
He preſently took horſe, to be there the ſooner, and <hi>Lyſis</hi> in the mean time
took his time to go thither, with his former guide. <hi>Hircan</hi> being come to <hi>Orontes,</hi>
told him the pleaſant adventure had hapned to him. <hi>Florida, Leonora,</hi> and <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica</hi>
were alſo acquainted with it, and were impatient to ſee the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphos'd
into a maid: So all that were preſent being in a good humor, they
reſolved to entertain him for to paſs away the time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> being on his way, bethought him what name he ſhould take. There was
none ſeem'd more gentle, and more paſtoral to him, then <hi>Amarillis,</hi> ſo that he
took that; and when he view'd himſelf ſometimes in his Shepherdeſſes habit, he
ſaid in himſelf, No, no, there is no ſhame to put on this garb, when <hi>Love</hi> commands
it. The great <hi>Alcides</hi> chang'd his <hi>club</hi> into a <hi>diſtaff,</hi> and put on <hi>Joles</hi> gown inſtead
of his Lyons skin. Was not <hi>Poliarchus</hi> cloath'd like a maid, and was called <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crine?</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:43725:72"/>
and did not <hi>Celadon</hi> do the like, and was called <hi>Alexis?</hi> This is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
ſubject of <hi>Romances,</hi> and an amorous hiſtory is never good, if there be not a
young man puts on maids cloathes; or a maid a mans. I appeal to all thoſe who
paſs away their days in that delightful reading. I would to God <hi>Charite</hi> would
imitate me, and put on the habit of my ſex, as I have put on that of hers. Then
muſt ſhe pretend to love me, and if we were married, the change of cloaths would
not deceive any body; all would be very well.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe noble thoughts, the diſguis'd Shepherd came to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s
houſe; and having ask'd to ſpeak with <hi>Leonora,</hi> he was carried into the hall, where
ſhe was, together with the reſt of the Company. <hi>Hircan</hi> ſtood up preſently, and
ſaid to her, <hi>Madam,</hi> here is a maid wants a ſervice, ſhe is a kinſwoman of my far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
wife; if you will take her, I will be accountable for her true ſervice. <hi>Leonora</hi>
bid her draw near, and ſtriving as much as ſhe could to refrain laughing, ask'd her
what ſhe could do. <hi>Amarillis</hi> promis'd to do any thing was commanded her with
a little ſhewing. I ſee well, ſaies <hi>Leonora,</hi> how the caſe ſtands, this maid is not good
for the Chamber, nor for the Kitchin, but may ſerve to do ſomewhat every where.
What ſay you as to wages? you need not think of that, replies <hi>Hircan,</hi> you ſhall
reward her according as ſhe ſhall have ſerved you: So <hi>Leonora</hi> reſolved to take this
fine ſervant, who preſently told her name, whereat thoſe that were preſent could
not any longer forbear laughing. As for <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> ſhe look'd like a ſcar-crow in
a Hemp-yard. Her back was long and flat, as if ſhe had carried a flat basket on it,
and for her breaſt, it was no more plump then a Trencher; the reſt was ſtreight,
as if it had been a diſtaff ſwadled about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> being gone away, they gave <hi>Amarillis</hi> divers things to do, which ſhe
did as well as any other ſhould have done. She laid the cloath, rinſed the glaſſes,
and made clean the chambers, and all with ſuch modeſty, that all wonder'd at it.
The fair one durſt not as much as lift up her eyes, and when ſhe was at dinner with
the men, ſhe would have been very much out of countenance, had it not been
that there were other maids as well as ſhe, and eſpecially <hi>Charite,</hi> whom ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
conſidered and view'd. The men and maids knew all that it was <hi>Lyſis,</hi> but
they were expreſly forbidden to diſcover that they knew any thing, nor to call her
by any other name then <hi>Amarillis;</hi> ſo that leſt ſhe might betray any thing, there
was but little ſpoken to her.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon came thither <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Montenor,</hi> who had ſent their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
all about to look for <hi>Lyſis,</hi> of whom not having receiv'd any tidings, they were
come to <hi>Leonora,</hi> to have ſome news of him. She told them, that ſhe had not ſeen
him, and thereupon call'd <hi>Amarillis,</hi> to bid her do ſomewhat. As ſoon as they
ſaw her, they were ſo ſurpris'd, that they ſaid not a word, but when ſhe was gone,
<hi>Anſelme</hi> cryes out, well Madam, if that be not <hi>Lyſis,</hi> it is a Maid extreamly like
him. <hi>Leonora</hi> told him, he was not miſtaken, and acquainted him what adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
the Shepherd had run through at <hi>Hircans</hi> the Magician. <hi>Anſelme</hi> was infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleas'd at the narration, and went into a Chamber where <hi>Amarillis</hi> was. She
made as if ſhe knew him not, nor did ſhe diſcover her ſelf; ſo that he left her, and
beſet himſelf to talk with <hi>Angelica.</hi> About an hour after came <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
whom he had ſent for; then was the time come, that they reſolved to make
good ſport with the new maid. <hi>Clarimond</hi> made it his buſineſs to play tricks with
her, and would have kiſt her. She thruſt him back ſtill as hard as ſhe could; but that
which moſt diſcover'd her was that ſhe could not ſufficiently counterfeit her ſpeech,
and inſtead of ſpeaking like a ſimple Country wench, ſhe ſpoke a quaint Court
phraſe. Let me alone ſays ſhe, at every word, I would be touch'd no more then if
I were a veſtal. Be quiet, you would raviſh me; have you any attempt on the
Candor of my Chaſtity, and would ſee the wack of the Veſſel of my Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency.</p>
            <p>Sometimes ſhe ſpoke of her ſelf in the maſculine gender, inſtead of the feminine,
yet no body ſeem'd to take any notice. <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſet on her ſtill with fine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements,
in which he call'd her his <hi>Goddeſs</hi> and his <hi>Nymph:</hi> They could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43725:72"/>
laughing to ſee that he gave ſuch qualities to a Wench ſo ill dreſt; and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi>
ask'd whether the Nymphs wore coifs? You need not doubt but there are
ſome that do, ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> for they are ever dreſt according to the faſhion of the
Countrey where they reſide. That's the reaſon that thoſe of the river of <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
wear coifes, ſuch as are made at <hi>Meaux<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and thoſe of the River <hi>Seine</hi> wear french<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
after the <hi>Paris</hi> faſhion.</p>
            <p>There paſt divers other pleaſant diſcourſes on the like occaſions; but all this was
not much; for they conceiv'd they might have made much more ſport with <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillis:</hi>
yet they made as nothing were, and thoſe who were not of the houſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
every one to his own home, leaving <hi>Leonora</hi> and her new maid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amarillis</hi> paſs'd over four days with all the ſatisfaction in the world. They had
aſſign'd her a little chamber, where ſhe lay alone, and never went out before ſhe was
fully dreſs'd by a glaſs ſhe had. Though ſhe ſpoke not to <hi>Charite,</hi> but as to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ordinary ſervant, yet ſhe thought the heavens very favorable to her, that ſhe
had the opportunity to ſee her when ſhe pleas'd. <hi>Leonora</hi> was not weary of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her, for ſhe took a pleaſure to ſee with what diligence ſhe ſerved her; and on
the other ſide, ſhe fear'd not any ill report might come to her houſe by her means:
She was of thoſe that are in love by way of contemplation, whoſe pleaſure are
rather thoſe of the minde, then thoſe of the body; and ſhe always ſet before her
eyes the chaſtity of <hi>Alexis,</hi> who when he had his Miſtreſs naked in his arms, had
not the preſumption to do any thing to her: if ſhe thought it a happineſs to love
<hi>Charite,</hi> ſhe thought it no leſs to be her ſelf loved by <hi>Marcel, Orontes</hi>'s Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
This young Lad made excellent ſport with her when he ſpoke to her of love,
but ſhe thought his diſcourſes nothing but vanity. When ſhe look'd into the glaſs,
ſhe thought her ſelf very handſome; and ſhe was not far from a misfortune dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
as that of <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> for the ſoul of <hi>Lyſis</hi> lov'd that countenance of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillis</hi>
which ſhe ſaw, that made her often kiſs the glaſs, that ſhe might be mouth
to mouth with that Shepherdeſs: though ſhe beheld her ſelf ſo often, yet is it not
to be thence inferr'd, that ſhe was any of the beſt dreſs'd in the world. You will
tell me, that her amorous imaginations made her ſo negligent; but there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe in the wind; 'twas becauſe ſhe knew not ſo well how to trick up her ſelf,
and could not make her ſelf as fine as <hi>Synopa</hi> had made her the firſt day.</p>
            <p>When ſhe had been five days with <hi>Leonora, Anſelme, Montenor,</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi>
came thither without any noiſe. They had not been there all that time purpoſely to
ſee what <hi>Amarillis</hi> would do in the mean while, and that time they had ſpent in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
viſits, and hunting. The diſcourſes of <hi>Lyſis</hi> had engag'd <hi>Orontes, Florida, Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora</hi>
and <hi>Angelica</hi> to read Romances, for to know more of his principles, and to
make the better ſport with him. <hi>Clarimond</hi> had no ſooner propos'd that <hi>Amarillis</hi>
muſt be accus'd of unchaſtity, but every one was in doubt how the accuſation ſhould
be carried on. After they had conſulted together, <hi>Leonora</hi> is ſeated in the Court
on a high chair, and <hi>Florida</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> one on the one ſide, and the other on
the other on ſtools. Preſently <hi>Amarillis</hi> is ſent for by two Sergeants, who binde
her hands behinde her, and drag her in a rough manner to the place, without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing to her, though ſhe conjur'd them to tell her, wherein ſhe had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
When ſhe was come before <hi>Leonora,</hi> they made her ſit down on a low ſtool,
like a Criminal; which done, <hi>Orontes</hi> approaches with ten or twelve perſons, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and Gentlewomen about him, who had been ſent for out of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
but came not there for any reaſon but to make a number, and were not to
ſpeak any thing, as Mutes in a Play. I have ſent for this maid to have her puniſh'd,
ſays <hi>Leonora</hi> to <hi>Orontes;</hi> what do you accuſe her of. He thereupon puts on a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
countenance, and ſpoke to this purpoſe;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:43725:73"/>
               <hi>I</hi> Am very ſorry, Madam, that I am conſtrain'd to importune your chaſte ears with
a plea full of impurities; but ſeeing it is better to ſpeak of vice, and to diſcover
it, then to paſs it over unpuniſh'd, I ſhall with confidence acquaint you what
enormous crimes <hi>Amarillis</hi> hath committed. You charitably had receiv'd into
your houſe this vagabond Wench, who diſguiſs'd a while the miſchief ſhe had within her;
but to the diſhonor of this houſe where ſhe hath been ſo well entertained, it hath not been
long ere ſhe diſcovered what ſhe was; and having with the eyes of concupiſence look'd
on the beauty of my man <hi>Marcel,</hi> ſhe could not be at reſt till ſhe had brought him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend
to her lewd deſires; you know he hath thoſe features in his face, that there is
not a maid within twenty miles about, which is not in love with him: but this would
engroſs to her ſelf what all the reſt deſired, and by ſubtil allurements hath prevailed
ſo far, that he hath ſtained the purity of his continence. He is not the only man hath
been ſo ſerved, and if he hath gone aſtray, he is to be pardoned, as far as his ſimplicity
hath exceeded his evil intentions; but as for this ſhe-wolf, I demand ſhe may be puniſht
according to the Laws which have ever been obſerved in this Countrey, againſt thoſe
that ſin by fornication, as ſhe hath done. Madam, do me juſtice; conſider the enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the caſe, which is the pollution of this houſe; beſides corrupting the chaſtity of
a yong man, that was chaſter then <hi>Hippolitus.</hi> He was alſo my hope, and I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to marry him to my Farmers daughter, of whom he might have gotten legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
children, whereas now he is undone for ever. He hath loſt his honor; his faireſt
flower is already gathered, he is not now fit for any body. Let us at leaſt have the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to ſee her dye, who hath been the cauſe of it, that ſo this misfortune may be
repaired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orontes</hi> having made this Speech, <hi>Leonora</hi> asked <hi>Amarillis,</hi> whether ſhe had
any thing to ſay againſt it? She anſwered, That ſhe denied all was laid to her charge:
So that they ſent for <hi>Marcel,</hi> to know the truth. He came like a Ninny weeping;
and ſays to <hi>Leonora,</hi> It is true, Madam, that this maid hath forced me to what I had
no minde to do. After ſhe had for a great while caſt her ſheeps eyes at me, ſhe told
me laſt night, that ſhe had caught a great cold, and that ſhe did nothing but cough;
but that which troubled her moſt was, that ſhe lay alone, and had no body near
her to ſay, <hi>God bleſs you.</hi> Hereupon ſhe was ſo importunate with me, that I could
not be at reſt till ſhe had prevail'd to do her that good office: and to be brief, I
was fain to lie with her laſt night, and that hath been the occaſion of this miſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.
If it be expected I ſhould proceed any further in this ſtory, ſhame will ſtop
up the paſſage of my voyce, and I dare ſpeak no more.</p>
            <p>There <hi>Marcel</hi> gave over, and <hi>Amarillis</hi> aſſuming the diſcourſe, cryes out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
Ah miſchief! where wouldſt thou ſeek what thou ſhouldſt ſay more? have
I deſired thee to do any thing to thy diſhonor and mine? and thou haſt lien with
me? Let the earth open now and ſwallow me up, if there be any ſuch thing. Doſt
thou not remember, that when ever thou wouldſt but kiſs me, I have thruſt thee
back with as much diſdain as if thou hadſt been a monſter? wilt thou imitate <hi>Paae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi>
who accus'd <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> that had ſleighted her; and becauſe thou haſt not been
able to force me, wilt thou ſay that I have forc'd thee? Alas! Is there no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
here that will ſpeak for me? He ſhall plead for Innocency it ſelf.</p>
            <p>In ſaying ſo <hi>Amarillis</hi> look'd about of all ſides, but there was no body offered
any thing in her defence: nor had ſhe any witneſſes to prove that ſhe had always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
the careſſes of <hi>Marcel;</hi> and on the contrary, that it was he had come in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her. All the ſervants came and bore witneſs, that they had ſeen her look
very wantonly on that Lad; and there was none but had ſomewhat to ſay, even
<hi>Charite</hi> her ſelf, who came and ſwore, ſhe had heard her ſigh before him. There
was the ſurpluſage of his misfortune, ſhe durſt not contradict that fair <hi>Charite,</hi>
but was content to ſay within herſelf, that ſhe wondred to ſee <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s Miſtreſſe
ſpeak againſt <hi>Amarillis,</hi> who had ſome features like thoſe of that Shepherd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:43725:73"/>
While ſhe was in this conſideration, and durſt ſay no more, <hi>Leonora</hi> making as
if ſhe conſulted with her ſiſter and daughter, ſpoke to this effect:</p>
            <p>THe Complaint of <hi>Marcel</hi> and his Maſter being heard, as to what they affirm,
That <hi>Amarillis</hi> hath corrupted this yong man, and hath betrayed her honor; and
foraſmuch as the ſaid maid hath always denyed it, We ordain, That ſhe be put to the
tryal of her chaſtity before there be any further proceeding, according to the cuſtom of
this Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amarillis</hi> was very well content with this judgement; ſo that preſently the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<hi>Plate</hi> was ſent for, which was kept among the treaſure of the Caſtle. Thoſe
which were preſent, ſpoke of it as a thing that were really ſo; and affirmed, that
none but chaſte perſons could tread on it, without burning the ſoles of their feet.
There was one of the maids would needs go for it; but <hi>Orontes</hi> ſaid to her, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
not thou thy ſelf, I prethee, in this buſineſs, thou knowſt too much diſtimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I will not be accountable for thee. Know, that thoſe who are but guilty of
the leaſt matter that can be, dare not touch this Plate. It muſt be only ſent for by
little children, of whoſe chaſtity we are aſſur'd. Let the Gardeners two daughters
bring it: whereupon the two little children were led where hung the braſs Plate,
whereon the maids dry'd the bands when they ſtarched; they brought it away, and
plac'd it in the middle of the Court. <hi>Amarillis</hi> thought all theſe things real; for
ſhe had obſerved ſuch an other adventure in the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> hiſtory; and if they
would try her by fire, ſhe call'd to minde a certain <hi>Melite,</hi> whereof there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made in the Loves of <hi>Clitophon</hi> and <hi>Leucippus,</hi> who was put to the tryal of
water. While ſhe was ſtripping her ſelf for to go upon the Plate, a ſturdy Groom
making as if he were curious, touch'd it with the top of his finger. But he drew
back preſently, crying out, I burn, I burn, my hand is roaſted. Thou art well enough
ſerved prophane Raſcal, ſayes <hi>Orontes,</hi> thou wouldſt not believe a thing that ſo
many others have tryed. Couldſt thou forget that thou hadſt paſs'd all thy youth
in Bawdy-houſes? And yet doſt thou pretend to Chaſtity after all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amarillis</hi> obſerving this adventure, fell into ſome amazement, and being ready
to tread upon the Plate, ſhe was a little afraid of burning. As for <hi>Amarillis,</hi> ſayes
ſhe in her ſelf, I am ſure ſhe is chaſt; but as for <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I am not ſo certain: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
my feet ſhall not be burn'd, for it is in body and externally that I am <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillis,</hi>
and am not <hi>Lyſis</hi> but in ſoul, ſeeing a Magician hath changed my Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
            <p>Having by this ſubtility reaſſur'd her ſelf, ſhe recovers her courage, having before
examined her whole life paſt, and conſidered, that if the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis</hi> had ſinn'd,
it had been only by deſire, and that he had never committed folly with any of his
members. It being at laſt reſolved, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Amarillis</hi> were as clear as when
they were born, the accuſed party went bare foot upon the Plate, and remained on
it a long while without feeling any heat; nor indeed was there any reaſon it ſhould
be hot, for it was above two days ſince there had been any fire under it. Some
that were preſent, cry'd out thereupon, Come thence <hi>Amarillis,</hi> you are chaſt,
we are ſatisfied you have been too much perſecuted. O <hi>Amarillis!</hi> the Queen of
fair and chaſt ones, what light you caſt from that place. There is no other fire on
that Plate, but that of your eyes. She came down infinitely pleas'd at theſe Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations;
but <hi>Orontes</hi> crying out louder then any of the reſt, came and ſaid, That
this proof was not to be credited, and that it was not true as to her particular.
<hi>Amarillis</hi> is a Sorcereſs, I know it well enough, ſhe hath ſome charms to ſave her
from burning. Let her be ſtrip'd naked, that her characters may be taken from
her, and then let her be condemned to the fire, or be caſt into the River with a
millſtone at her neck.</p>
            <p>Thereupon <hi>Leonora</hi> bid them ſee whether ſhe had any Witch-craft about her;
which command given, all the Lacquays that were there fell upon her. One took
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43725:74"/>
away her coif, another her waſtcoat, but ſhe immediately cover'd her head with
her apron, that her hair might not be ſeen, which was too ſhort to be a maids.
<hi>Clarimond</hi> upon this, iſſuing out of a place where he lay hid, came and delivered
her out of the hands of thoſe mercileſs miniſters of juſtice; and having carried her
into a corner where ſhe might fit her cloathes about her, went and caſt himſelf on
his knees before the Judges. Have pitty on an innocent creature, Madam, ſayes
he to <hi>Leonora,</hi> if it be your deſign to put her to death, becauſe you thirſt after her
blood, let me be in her ſtead, and let mine be ſpilt for her. I am ſo ſurpris'd with
her beauties, that I am willing to dye for her. You ſay ſhe hath charms about her,
it is true, ſhe hath thoſe of her eyes, that have no other operation but on me, and that
to hurt me; and if ſhe have any other beſides, to ſave her from the burning of the
ſacred <hi>Plate,</hi> I confeſs it is I that have given them her, unknown to her. It is I
that am the Sorcerer: tis I that am guilty, let there be made ready a pile of fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,
that I may be caſt into the fire. I ſhall ſuffer no more then what I do every
day; the fire I ſhall be caſt in, will not be more ardent then that of the fair eyes of
<hi>Amarillis.</hi> If you alledge ſhe is not only guilty of Witchcraft, but alſo of Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
for which ſhe is nevertheleſs worthy to dye, I will alſo ſuffer the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for her in that caſe, ſo ſhe may live; nay, you ſhall give me a thouſand deaths
if you deſire it. You underſtand not your ſelf, friend, replyes <hi>Leonora,</hi> know you
not that all crimes are perſonal, and that they who have committed them are onely
to be puniſh'd. If you are ſo deſirous to dye, you ſhall both dye together. Make
haſte there, and bring ſome faggots, and ſet them afire. <hi>Leonora</hi> had no ſooner
pronounc'd that cruel ſentence, but abundance of Crackers were fired at the gate,
and <hi>Hircan</hi> iſſues out of a flame of Pitch and Roſin, like a Ghoſt in a Play. He held
in his hand a lighted Torch, that made a great ſmoak; and the better to act the part
of a Magician, he had a long Caſſock of black Canvas. The whole preſence ſeem'd
to be much troubled at his coming, and every one ran his way: ſo that it was eaſie
for him to ſeize on <hi>Amarillis,</hi> whom when he had diſpoſed into a Coach that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the gate: Fear not, fair Shepherd, ſays he to her, I am thy friend <hi>Hircan,</hi> who
am come to ſuccour thee in thy neceſſity. Thoſe who had deſign'd thee to death,
may now ſeek after thee to little purpoſe. My Chariot is drawn by horſes wing'd
like Gryphons, who in a ſhort time will bring us to my houſe.</p>
            <p>The adventures paſt had ſo ſurpris'd <hi>Amarillis,</hi> that ſhe knew not where ſhe
was, but at length coming to her ſelf; and knowing <hi>Hircan,</hi> ſhe thank'd him for
the favour he had done her. She told him that he ſhould have brought <hi>Clarimond</hi>
alſo away with him; becauſe that he being detained as her ſurety, they would put
him to death for her. Do not trouble your ſelf for that, ſays <hi>Hircan,</hi> one of my
ſpirits hath carried him away, he is by this time at home. May we alſo be conducted
along with the like dexterity, replyes <hi>Amarillis:</hi> for <hi>Claudian</hi> ſpeaking of the
Chariot of <hi>Triptolemus,</hi> ſays, That the roads of the ayr are as dangerous as thoſe
of the ſea.</p>
            <p>The Coach went a good pace, while they were ſo diſcourſing; ſo that in a little
while they came to the Magicians Caſtle: <hi>Amarillis</hi> had much ado to perſwade
her ſelf that ſhe was ſtill <hi>Lyſis:</hi> ſhe had quite forgotten that perſon, and it ſeemed
ſtrange to her to be called by that name: ſhe felt her ſelf in thoſe parts which
ſpeak a man, and though ſhe found there what was wont to be, yet was ſhe not
confident it was there. This doubt could ſhe not be delivered of, till the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
as if he had us'd a Countercharm, had caſt a little water on her head, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome barbarous words. Which done, he reaſſumed his Shepherds habit, and
went and related to the Nymph <hi>Synopa</hi> all the Adventures he had run through.</p>
            <p>All this was the deſign of <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Anſelme,</hi> who had ſent for <hi>Hircan.</hi> They
flaid at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s Caſtle with the reſt of the Company, and had good ſport and
laughing at all the follies of the amorous Shepherd. Every one affirmed, there was
nothing comparable to his converſation, and that they had now really ſeen a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
adventure, which before had never been ſeen but in writing. But if they
were ſatisfied, <hi>Lyſis</hi> (how hard I finde it not to call him ſtill <hi>Amarillis)</hi> was no
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43725:74"/>
leſs. He ſaid, that that had hapned to him which was not in any Hiſtory in the
world: There was in the <hi>Faithfull Shepherd</hi> a Shepherdeſs of the ſame name, who
had been falſely accuſed to have been diſhonour'd; and in a later <hi>Paſtoral</hi> that he
had read, there was another Shepherdeſs accuſed upon the ſame account; but that
it was never heard that a Shepherd having put on Maids cloaths, had been call'd to
queſtion for any ſuch thing. In all manner of adventures he ſtill exemplified out of
divers <hi>Romances,</hi> which I ſhall not name: And it is not much to be wondred at if he
produced many examples to the ſame purpoſe; for it is obſerved that thoſe rare wits
that compoſe them, are ſo furniſh'd with invention, that they can hardly advance
any thing which they have not ſtoln from others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having his ordinary cloaths on, was already weary at the Magicians, and
had a mind to go viſit <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>Anſelme:</hi> He took the ſame Coach wherein
he came, and returned to them. They were come home from <hi>Orontes</hi>'s; and aſſoon
as they ſaw him, they ſtood as amaz'd, and ask'd him where he had been all that
while. Do you not ſee that I have ſtill my Gitarrhe in my hand? ſays he, ſmiling:
I have been to give my Miſtreſs a Serenade; it is but one day ſince I went hence.
You have then ſlept away ſix in ſome cave, replies <hi>Montenor:</hi> In the mean while
you have loſt a fair deal of time; you have not ſeen a Maid that <hi>Leonora</hi> had, who
ſeem'd to us well as handſom as <hi>Charite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> who was in another chamber, came in thereupon, and avow'd the
Laſs was ſo handſom, that he was deſperately fallen in love with her, and that he
knew not how ſhe was taken away from him. <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſmiling, would not any longer
conceal the truth; and ſo ſaid to them, You have been deceiv'd, my dear friends!
it was I that acted the part of <hi>Amaryllis:</hi> Now I tell you, but ſay nothing of it at
<hi>Orontes</hi>'s, leſt <hi>Leonora</hi> be angry with me. Every one ſeemed to be raviſh'd with
admiration, and above all <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who could not give over ſaying, Shall I hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
love nothing but an Idaea? where ſhall I find the fair Nymph that hath
wounded me? Ah, <hi>Lyſis!</hi> ſeeing ſhe is in thee, I muſt change my love into an
honorable friendſhip. There was nothing elſe talk'd of all ſupper-time; and the
next day after dinner they went all to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, who ask'd the Shepherd where he
had been for the ſpace of ſeven or eight days, all which time they had not ſeen him.
To which he anſwered, that he had been viſiting certain Shepherds of the Country.
When they had given over queſtioning him, he took his time to go and entertain
<hi>Charite</hi> aſide, where ſhe was at work at ſome linnen. <hi>Incomparable Shepherdeſs!</hi>
ſays he to her; how long will you not regard my love? Know you not that <hi>Lignon</hi>
ſhall return to its ſource, the Trees ſhall be leafleſs in the Spring, and <hi>Love</hi> without
his <hi>quiver</hi> and <hi>torch,</hi> before the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſhall ceaſe to adore you? Will you
ever be a <hi>Crocodile,</hi> to draw men to you and devour them? or a <hi>Gorgon,</hi> or a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſa,</hi>
to change hearts into rocks of conſtancie, whereas your own is a rock of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain?
Ha! well fare thou <hi>Diamantin!</hi> ah <hi>Anaxeretes!</hi> The Shepherd had no
ſooner ſaid ſo, but <hi>Charite</hi> runs away from him, and goes &amp; ſays to <hi>Leonora,</hi> Truly
Madam, I cannot any longer ſuffer this <hi>Lyſis;</hi> he doth nothing but abuſe me.
Whereupon he drew near and ſaid, that he call'd heaven to witneſs he had ever
courted his Miſtreſs with as much reſpect as if ſhe had been ſome Divinity, and that
he had not ſpoken to her but in quaint terms taken out of the Poets, and that all
his diſcourſes were perpetual citations. Then he repeated what he had ſaid; and
<hi>Leonora</hi> thinking it very ſignificant, bid <hi>Charite</hi> learn what Complements were, and
to receive her ſervant more kindly thenceforward. However he entertain'd her not
any further at that time; for they had engag'd him into a diſcourſe about other
things.</p>
            <p>Being returned to <hi>Montenors,</hi> and having a mind to walk into the fields a little
before ſupper, he met a Country-man, whom he asked where he intended to lodge
that night. He told him, at <hi>Coulommiers.</hi> That put him into a little ſtudy; for it
ſeems he had heard ſay that that Town was but thirteen leagues off <hi>Paris,</hi> whereas
he thought himſelf a hundred diſtant from it. At which <hi>Coulommiers?</hi> ſays he to
the Country-man. At <hi>Coulommiers</hi> in <hi>Brie,</hi> ſays the other. You are miſtaken, friend,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43725:75"/>
replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> You talk of lodging in <hi>Brie</hi> to night, whereas you are now in <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,</hi>
there is a great diſtance between them, I know well the Geography of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I know my way as well as you can tell me, replies the Country-man: I have gone
this way theſe thirty years, you ſhall not need teach me. And ſo kept on his way,
leaving <hi>Lyſis</hi> in an unſpeakable aſtoniſhment. A while after he met another man,
that came from that quarter where the other went: In what Country are we, ſays
he to him? you'll do me a favour to tell me. You know better then I, Sir, ſays the
other to him; what think you? are we not in <hi>Brie!</hi> In <hi>Brie!</hi> replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſure
we are in <hi>Forreſts;</hi> do you not ſee I am clad like a Shepherd? But whence come
you now? whither go you? do you intend to lodge to night at <hi>Montbriſſon?</hi> 'Tis
a great way thither, replies the Traveller, I know it well, it is my own Country; I
would I were there! but I am but a league off <hi>Coulommiers,</hi> through which Town
I came, and I ſhall lie to night at the firſt Town where I find good lodging. <hi>Lyſis</hi>
was now more amaz'd then before; and he could not reſolve whether <hi>Brie</hi> were
tranſported to the place where <hi>Forreſts</hi> ſhould be, or whether he himſelf had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
leap'd out of one Country into the other. He ſpake with much earneſtneſs
to this Traveller, who anſwered him as ſeriouſly, and gave him ſuch reaſons as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
him that he had been deceiv'd. The vexation it put him to was ſuch, that he
would not return to <hi>Montenor's.</hi> The man he met ſeem'd to him to be a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd
fellow, ſo that he reſolved to indent a friendſhip with him, though his face
was ſomwhat of the rougheſt. Having asked him what he was, he gave this account
of himſelf: About five years ſince (ſays he) I was by profeſſion a Journyman-Joyner,
and had the occaſion to faſten a board in the Study of a Learned man that
liv'd at <hi>Paris:</hi> He entred into talk with me; and finding my diſcourſes to his mind,
he told me, that if I would ſerve him, he would make me a knowing man. Now he
had found out the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone</hi> of Knowledge; and in the papers he cauſed to
be ſtuck up and down the City, he promiſed the Abridgment of thoſe <hi>long Studies.</hi>
I quitted my former profeſſion, for to become learned under him: And I ſwear to
you, that having ſerv'd him ever ſince till now, he hath taught me very excellent
things. I know not what's become of him ſince: I left him about a ſmall difference
that hapned between us; and now I travel up and down <hi>France,</hi> teaching what I
know to children. You never heard of any thing more admirable then what I know;
I ſpeak readily on any ſubject is given me; my name is <hi>Carmelin.</hi> Seeing you are
ſo eloquent, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> let me hear what you can ſay of <hi>Vertue. Vertue</hi> is ſo <hi>fair,</hi>
replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that if men could ſee her <hi>naked,</hi> they could not but fall in <hi>love</hi> with
her: They ſay, that at <hi>Rome</hi> it was neceſſary to paſs through her Temple to that of
<hi>Honour.</hi> As Silver is of leſs eſteem then Gold, ſo is Gold then Vertue. She it is that
takes deep root in the field of our ſouls, but all other things fade and fall like the
flowers of the meadow. And what ſay you of <hi>Pleaſure?</hi> replies <hi>Lyſis. Pleaſure</hi>
is the moſt importunate Miſtreſs in the world, ſays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> the wages ſhe gives
us in the end are diſeaſes and deſpairs: It abounds with honey and gall; if it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
us with Hyppocras, there's wormwood in the bottom of the bowl: She is a
treacherous whore, that doth not embrace, but to kill you. As I am a <hi>Shepherd,</hi>
cryes out <hi>Lyſis,</hi> here are as many <hi>French Margarites</hi> as ever I heard in my life:
It is clearly ſeen that you have moſt exquiſite obſervations, and excellent common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places.
You are the man I want, I ſhall never meet with a better companion. I ſee
you are an unſetled perſon, you ſhall ſtay in this Country with me. A ſmall matter
maintains us, if you will but turn Shepherd as I am; for invitations are ſo forced
upon me, that I am hardly able to ſatisfie thoſe that would have me to dinners and
ſuppers. Know you what a <hi>Paſtoral</hi> life is? The <hi>Paſtoral</hi> life is the happieſt in the
world, replies <hi>Carmelin; Shepherds</hi> are <hi>content</hi> with the little they have, and he
that is <hi>content</hi> is <hi>happy.</hi> The Naturaliſts teach us, that the thunder falls on the talleſt
trees, and not on the loweſt ſhrubs; ſo calamities aim at great perſons, and paſs
over poor ruſticks. Say you ſo! there is the word indeed, ſays <hi>Lyſis</hi> out of exceſs of
joy: what an able man are you! you ſpeak nothing but ſentences. What wonders
ſhall we do, if you live with me! We will make Books, we will crack Arguments,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43725:75"/>
and Harangue it before the Nymphs. I will give you a Miſtreſs, if you have not
choſen one already. You ſhall court her, and receive ſignal favours from her; but
you muſt reſolve to ſuffer ſomewhat before you obtain her, for ſhe is a moſt
diſcreet Shepherdeſs. Will you not treat her with fine amorous Complements?
They ſay, that in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> there was a ſtatue of <hi>Memnon,</hi> which when the Sun
ſhone on it, made an harmonious ſound, ſayes <hi>Carmelin;</hi> in like manner, when you
or any other perſon of equal merit ſhall dart your rayes on me, I ſhall ſpeak thoſe
things that ſhall ſatisfie your ears. The cuſtom of <hi>Perſia</hi> being to make preſents
to the King, a poor handy-craftsman that met <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and had nothing to
give him, went and fetch'd a little freſh water, and preſented him with it. So I
ſhall not indeed preſent you but with ſmall matters, but you will eſteem them much,
if you meaſure them by my good will, knowing that I have not the treaſure of
<hi>Craeſus.</hi> Do not quote ſo much, ſayes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> let us return to the ſtatue of <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
I think I am of the ſame humour. As ſoon as ever my head is ſmitten by the
heat of the Sun, I begin to ſneeze. But to ſpeak of what concerns you, without
any further digreſſions, I ſwear to you that you will finde thoſe pleaſures with me,
that neither the moſt powerful words of your eloquence, nor mine can ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> who was not the wiſeſt in the world, was raviſh'd with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of <hi>Lyſis.</hi> Upon this there paſt by a Countrey-fellow, of whom the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
ask'd the way to <hi>Clarimonds</hi> Caſtle; he told him he was going that way, and
bid him follow. <hi>Lyſis</hi> did ſo, being reſolved to go thither, becauſe he had a good
opinion of the diſpoſition of that Gentleman. He found him at home, for he had
left <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>Anſelme.</hi> But <hi>Clarimond</hi> was amaz'd to ſee him, and as'd him
why he had left his good friends. They are cheats, replyes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> they have brought
me hither, making me believe it was the Country of <hi>Foreſts,</hi> and 'tis <hi>Bry;</hi> but if I
be a Shepherd, I ſhall live as happily here as elſewhere. My mother hath diſcharg'd
the Shepherd ſhe had, ſays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> will you take his place; the condition is
not to be contemned, you ſhall have wages, and ſhall be well entertain'd: In the
morning your Scrip ſhall be well furniſh'd, and at night you ſhall have as much
pottage as you will. To propſe this to me, is to treat me unworthily, replyes
<hi>Lyſis;</hi> know, that I will not keep any ſheep but what ſhall be my own, I will not
be a Hireling. 'Tis not out of any neceſſity I take this condition, but for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
of this kinde of life. 'Tis upon the ſame grounds that ſo many Shepherds
of <hi>Arcadia</hi> and <hi>Forreſts,</hi> who are come from noble houſes do the like. But you
that have ſworn to turn Shepherd with me, tell me, where is the memory of all
your oathes? I have forgot nothing of what I promiſs'd you, replies <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
but I cannot yet perform it, becauſe of ſome buſineſs I have to do of my
mothers, which I may not by any means neglect. A man muſt put away all <hi>cares,</hi>
before he can be a <hi>Shepherd</hi> as you are. You are in the right, replyes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and
in the mean time this honeſt man here, will bear me company. He is a knowing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
hear him ſpeak, that you may ſee what he is.</p>
            <p>When he had ſo ſaid, he ſhewed <hi>Carmelin</hi> to <hi>Clarimond;</hi> who preſently ſaid to
him, It ſeems you are a Companion of this brave Shepherd. <hi>Vertue</hi> will ſoon have
<hi>Companions,</hi> anſwers <hi>Carmelin. Pliny</hi> and <hi>du Vair</hi> ſay, that the ſtone <hi>Panthaura</hi>
draws to it ſelf whatever is near it; ſo vertue draws all the world after it. How!
he quotes Authors, ſaies <hi>Clarimond:</hi> you ſee it, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> he is the principal
diſciple of the <hi>Authour of the Abridgement of Long-ſtudies.</hi> Nay, then I do not
wonder that he is learned, replyes <hi>Clarimond,</hi> there are none but excellent perſons
come out of the School of ſuch a Philoſopher.</p>
            <p>That paſt, <hi>Clarimond</hi> gave order Supper ſhould be made ready, ſeeing he muſt
needs entertain theſe new gueſts, notwithſtanding his mothers niggardlineſs. While
they were at table, <hi>Carmelin</hi> diſplayed the excellency of his knowledge, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
about temperance. There were none, <hi>Lyſis</hi> excepted, but could eaſily ſee,
that he ſpoke like a Parrot, and that he had by heart things he underſtood not:
for he pronounc'd the words falſe, never ſtopp'd at any period, nor ever elevated or
let fall his voyce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:43725:76"/>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> propoſing to him what he ought to do to be a Shepherd, told him, that
in the firſt place he muſt chooſe a fine name, and quit that of <hi>Carmelin,</hi> which was
not ſo proper for a man of their quality; and that he would have him called <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rydon,
Thyrſis</hi> or <hi>Melibeus;</hi> but <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſaid, that his Father and all his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
had been call'd ſo, and that he would not do them the injury to change
their name. You muſt at leaſt diſguiſe it whatever come on't, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and ſo
making a diminutive of it, I will call you <hi>Carmelinet,</hi> or <hi>Carmelinthus,</hi> or <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindor;</hi>
theſe words have the full ſent of a <hi>Romance.</hi> When I have ſaid a thing, I
am reſolute to obſerve it, ſays <hi>Carmelin.</hi> Well, ſeeing you are inconvincible, keep
your former name, replyes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I know what's to be done. To give an Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of this name of <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I will have it derived from <hi>Charmes,</hi> to ſhew that
you make <hi>Charms</hi> or <hi>Verſes,</hi> or that you deſire to make ſome. While this paſt,
<hi>Lyſis</hi> obſerving the countenance of <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and all the reſt of his body, found
much that he had ſomewhat to object to. You muſt alſo change your Phyſiognomy
to be a Shepherd with me, ſays he to him, you are as naſty as a Pedants boy: your
hair's as greaſie, as if it had been waſh'd in ſallet oyl; your beard is in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
as if it had never known what a raſor nor ciſers meant, and that you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been trim'd but with a wiſp of lighted ſtraw, or with the ſhells of burnt nuts, as
<hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant was. I obſerve alſo on your muſtachoes, certain little pearls
which fall out of your noſe like dew. That hair muſt be taken away, where the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundicities
of the common ſhore of you brain are ſtopp'd. Do you not ſee that
I have the chin as clear as any <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor? why would you ſuffer your beard
ſo long? or do you keep it for a bib to ſave your ruff, when you eat porredge?
you muſt alſo have waſh-balls for your hands, which are as earthy, as if for want
of a plow, they had turn'd up an acre of ground; nor muſt you forget to keep
your nails ſhort, which towards the top are of a ſlate colour, and are ſo overgrown,
that they may be uſed for lanthorns, or may ſerve for ſhooing-horns. This cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
made <hi>Carmelin</hi> hold his peace a while; but at laſt he ſwallowed down his
ſhame in a glaſs of wine, and promiſs'd to make himſelf as neat as the Bridegroom
of a Country Village.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſent a man to <hi>Anſelme,</hi> to bid him not trouble himſelf about <hi>Lyſis;</hi>
and ſo commanded a Chamber to be prepared for the two Shepherds. Having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
a little while after ſupper, they went to bed all three. The next day <hi>Lyſis</hi>
being unwilling to defer his being a Shepherd in good earneſt any longer, propoſs'd
it to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and ſeeing that he was more willing to be his ſervant then his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
becauſe he was very poor, he was reſolved to take him to his ſervice; yet
not commanding him any thing but what was eaſie and honorable: So he gave
him money, and bid him go buy ſheep in ſome market, and withal, charg'd him
not to forget to take off his beard, and cleanſe his hair. When he was gone, <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
came and drew <hi>Lyſis</hi> into ſome diſcourſes about his Loves; and asked him,
if he had not yet receiv'd ſome ſignal favour of <hi>Charite.</hi> He anſwered, that his
own over-reſpect towards her, had hindred him. Aſſure your ſelf Lover, ſayes
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> that fortune favours confidence, nay temerity. Contemn the reſiſtances
of your Miſtreſs; maids do not run from us, but to be follow'd and overtaken.
They fight not, but to be overcome, and are pleaſs'd they are not the ſtrongeſt.
If your lips may touch theirs, you muſt not be content with that: for he that hath
obtain'd a kiſs, and proceeds no further, ſhews himſelf unworthy of what he hath
receiv'd. You'll bring me the examples of many chaſte Shepherds, but they are
all Cockſcombs; there are divers others more to be commended then they, who
have made their Miſtreſſes leap again.</p>
            <p>A certain ſtrange pleaſure came thereupon, and tickled <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and for to be
ſomewhat ſatisfied in his love, he reſolv'd to follow <hi>Clarimonds</hi> advice, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
to arrive at ſome enjoyment. In this conſideration he went out to walk
ſomewhere near the Caſtle. He had not been out half an hour, but he perceives two
women on the highway, who came leaſurely towards him. At length he perceiv'd
it was <hi>Orontes</hi>'s gardeners wife, and the fair <hi>Charite.</hi> He went behinde a hedge, that

he might not be ſeen: And as they went along, ſays <hi>Charite</hi> to the other, I muſt
reſt my ſelf before I go any further; let's ſit down here. They preſently ſate them
down on the graſs: So that <hi>Lyſis</hi> putting on what confidence he could, came and
accoſted them. They acquainted him that they were going in pilgrimage to St. <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aere.</hi>
But he immediately changing the diſcourſe, began to praiſe the beauty of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi>
which was increaſed by the heat ſhe had by going. The Gardeners wife, who
underſtood nothing of all this, riſe up and ſaid to her companion, that ſhe would go
leiſurely before, and that ſhe could not endure to be ſitting. The Shepherd ſeeing
himſelf all alone with his Miſtreſs, would put in practice that are of Loving that
<hi>Clarimond</hi> had taught him; and in the firſt place taking the fair hand which had
ſtollen away his heart, he would needs kiſs it. <hi>Charite</hi> draws it back preſently, ſo
that he was forc'd to ſay to her, If you will not give me leave to kiſs naked this thief
of my heart, I'll draw your ſmock-ſleeve over it, and kiſs it ſo; will you not permit
me? People are fain to kiſs Reliques through a glaſs.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid ſo, he ſtrived ſo much, that he kiſs'd the bare hand: And believing
he ought in conſequence endeavour ſome greater victory over his ſweet enemy,
Ha <hi>Charite!</hi> ſays he to her with dying eyes and an amorous geſture, Now that we
are alone, whoſe fault is it that we imitate not <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Cloe,</hi> and that we ſtrip
not our ſelves naked as they did, to go and waſh together in ſome fountain here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts?
There is one I know hath ſo much umbrage, that the Sun who ſees all
things cannot diſcover us there: I muſt lie on thy breaſt, ſeeing thou art my Altar,
and that I am the Victim that is to be laid on it. Wilt thou not ſuffer that my half
be glued to thine? Is there no means that both of us together make an <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was no ſooner delivered of theſe words, but his Miſtreſs underſtood well
enough what he meant; for it is a maxim, That a maid cannot be ſo ſimple
but ſhe will apprehend this, in what terms ſoever it be ſpoken. So that <hi>Charite</hi> riſe
up, and going her ways ſaid to him, Fear not, Impudence! but aſſure thy ſelf that
I'll tell my Lady of this; thou comeſt to diſturb my devotions with thy follies: If
ever thou comeſt to our houſe again, thou ſhalt find the door ſhut. <hi>Lyſis</hi> riſing
up, cries out, O Virgin more tender then the vine-bud! thou runſt away from me
faſter then the young Fawn doth from the mercileſs tooth of a Bear: I do not run
after thee like a Wolf for to devour thee; I am no <hi>Myrmidon,</hi> nor ſavage <hi>Dolopus.</hi>
Alas! ſtay till thou hear me, or hear me till I come to thee: Thou flieſt like an Aſp
whoſe tail hath been trod on. Notwithſtanding this complaint, ſhe kept on her
way ſtill: which ſo amaz'd him, that he durſt not run after her, but remained as
immoveable as a ſtatue. Oh how often did he curſe the advice of <hi>Clarimond,</hi> which
had procured him nothing but the disfavour of <hi>Charite!</hi> Oh how did he now wiſh
he had ſaid nothing at all to her, and that he had been as mute that day as the fiſh
in the river <hi>Moſin,</hi> which muſt no more be called <hi>Lignon!</hi> Oh how he wiſh'd he
had had no more uſe of his members then a Paralytick, before his Miſtreſs, that ſo he
might have done her no violence! But what was paſt could not be recalled; all his
recourſe now was to ſighs and tears.</p>
            <p>Dinner-time was ſlipt away in theſe imaginations: So that <hi>Clarimond</hi> wondring
he returned not, went out to look after him. Having found him weeping at the foot
of a tree, Ah <hi>Clarimond!</hi> ſays the Shepherd to him, wonder not that I weep; it is
for to water this Elm, and to make it grow in requital for the ſhadow it hath given
<hi>Charite</hi> when ſhe fate under it. But alas! if thou wouldſt know another cauſe of my
weeping, it is that I have offended that fair one by thinking to put thy doctrine in
practice. It may be you have not carried your ſelf diſcreetly in the buſineſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> and you have betray'd the myſterie. How is it poſſible I ſhould do
amiſs? ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſeeing I ſaid not one word to her which I cannot ſhew in very
good Authors. 'Tis therefore becauſe ſhe is not ſo well read, ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> and
before you ſhould have entertained her in that manner, you ſhould have brought
her to read. There's the ſecret! replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> But ſeeing you are the cauſe of my
misfortune, you are obliged to find out ſome remedy, and to make my peace with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43725:77"/>
her. I beſeech you remonſtrate to her, that if <hi>I</hi> have ſpoken of making the <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyne,
I</hi> meant no hurt thereby: Is it not well known that heretofore men were
double; but that to puniſh their iniquities, they were divided in two? That's the
reaſon that every one is ſo deſirous to find his other half, and by joyning it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to make up a perfect creature. Now there may be a juncture without fin, as
that of wills and deſires: And I may well ſay that was the manner I meant. And if
<hi>Charite</hi> abhor theſe copulations, let her beware the judgment of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> He hath
given men notice, that if they return to their offending him, he will further divide
every half in two. Seeing ſhe will not hear of joyning herſelf, the Gods might juſtly
divide her in that manner: And do you think it would be a fine ſight to ſee her in
two parts, each of them having but half a noſe, half a mouth, one eye, one ear, one
buttock, one thigh, and one foot, with which ſhe ſhould go leaping like a Flea, and
ſtraighten herſelf up again like a Bob. 'Twere great pitty to ſee her in that poſture,
ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> ſhe muſt know ſo much: If you were to ſatisfie your love in the
enjoyment of her, you muſt bring thoſe two parts together, which would be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
trouble: And then if you ſhould be jealous, conſider what means there
were to look to ſuch a woman; while you had one half with you in your own bed,
the other would be in your neighbours.</p>
            <p>After theſe learned conſiderations, <hi>Clarimond</hi> perſwaded the Shepherd ſo far
of the poſſibility of qualifying <hi>Charites</hi> cruelty, that he got him home to eat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.
Thence they took their way to <hi>Hircan's</hi> Caſtle, for diverſion ſake, and went
all by eaſe diſcourſing of the miracles the Magician did. When they were come
thither, <hi>Hircan</hi> carried them into the Garden, where <hi>Lyſis</hi> had never been before.
When he ſaw it was ſo fair, it ſeem'd to him to be the reſidence of the Spring, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and Autumn, becauſe there was all ſorts of Flowers, and all ſorts of Fruits:
He thought that <hi>Hircan</hi> had for ever baniſh'd the Winter thence by the force of
his charms. Being in a Walk which was broad and very cloſe at the top, he was ſo
much taken with it, that ſtretching out his arms he cryes out, Ha fair Walk! thou
ſhalt have of my Verſes, I ſwear it to thee; thou deſerveſt I ſhould make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of thee ſome time or other. Out of that he goes into a Bowre, built for to
elude the heat of the day: There he ſees a Spring ſo well painted, that he ſays to
the reſt, Come not ſo neer, we ſhall be wet. And perceiving a Horſe excellently
well drawn in a field, he brake forth into this fuſtian: See you how that horſe runs!
you will loſe him, <hi>Hircan;</hi> why do you not tie him to ſome tree? He runs away
from himſelf! he leaves himſelf behind! While he was thus buſie, <hi>Hircan</hi> turning
a little Cock, made the water iſſue out in good earneſt out of a Plank below, by a
many holes, O wonder! cries out <hi>Lyſis,</hi> running away: I knew this Magician had
thwarted the courſe of nature: whereas in other places the water falls down from
heaven to earth, here it iſſues out of the earth, as if it would threaten heaven:
Or is it that this peece of earth will weep in its turn, for the pains which I
ſuffer?</p>
            <p>There was with <hi>Hircan</hi> a Couſin of his, called <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who was come to ſee
him. He wondred much at what <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſaid, as never having heard any thing equally
extravagant. He took aſide one of the ſervants, and ask'd whether he knew him.
He anſwered, that he knew no more of him, then that he was one become a Fool
through an exceſſive love he bore to <hi>Catherine, Leonora's</hi> Chamber-maid. He was
yet more to ſeek; for he knew the Wench, and thought it impoſſible ſhe ſhould
cauſe ſo much love: He knew ſhe was of a fair complexion, and that ſhe was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
flaxen-hair'd; but ſhe had in requital ſome features in the face, which were
ſo far from handſom, as were ſufficient to raiſe her the eſteem of deformed. He
therefore not being ſatisfied, ſpake to <hi>Hircan</hi> of it, who in few words acquainted
him with the diſeaſe of <hi>Lyſis.</hi> When he underſtood it, he goes and confidently ſets
upon the Shepherd, ſaying to him, I hope you'll pardon my curioſity, if I ask you
who you are; For ſeeing you have an extraordinary manner of ſpeaking, I am very
deſirous to learn it: All thoſe of whom <hi>I</hi> have enquired concerning it, can give me
no ſatisfaction at all. <hi>I</hi> never refuſed any man living what thou askeſt me, ſays the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43725:77"/>
Shepherd, know then that I am <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and let that ſuffice thee. That's not enough,
replies <hi>Fontenay;</hi> know then, replies the Shepherd, that I am a Lover of the fair
<hi>Charite.</hi> All this is nothing, ſays the other to him: what Profeſſion are you of?
What an importunate fellow art thou? ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> ſeeſt thou not I am a <hi>Shepherd?</hi>
doth not my habit diſcover ſo much? But that you may not quarrel with words,
nor take things literally, I tell thee, that I am not of the number of thoſe ruſticks
whoſe reſidence are the fields: I am of thoſe, whoſe hiſtories are committed to
<hi>Romances,</hi> which are every day made, and whoſe actions are repreſented by the
Players on their ſtages. In good faith Maſter (ſaies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who could conceal
nothing he knew) I think you are the ſucceſſor of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of <hi>Manca,</hi> and
that you have inherited his folly. After he had been <hi>Knight-Errant,</hi> he would be
a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> but he dyed in the deſign; and I believe you would be Shepherd in his
ſtead, and continue his extravagancies. You lye, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I do nothing but of
my own invention, I never imitated him you ſpeak of; and if I have read his hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
it hath been by the way. He was a fool, who imagin'd himſelf a Lover of <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea,</hi>
when he had never ſeen her: whereas I have the advantage to converſe with
<hi>Charite</hi> every day. He underſtood nothing of the ſoveraign <hi>felicity.</hi> 'Tis not in
Arms it will be found, there is nothing but trouble, and the minde thereby becomes
brutiſh: 'Tis in keeping of Flocks, that there is profit and pleaſure. <hi>Fontenay</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Shepherd beginning to be hot; to vex him the more, ſaid to him: Thou
giveſt me the lye, infamous wretch, aſſure thy ſelf thou ſhalt give me ſatisfaction.
What doſt thou think thy ſelf to be? thou art the contempt of all the world. That
<hi>Charite</hi> for whom thou ſigheſt ſo much, cares not for thee, and 'tis of me that ſhe
is paſſionate: every day ſhe courts me. and yet I will not be catch'd by her entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for I have a many other Miſtreſſes handſomer then ſhe.</p>
            <p>Here it was that <hi>Lyſis</hi> was all afire, he was making towards <hi>Fontenay</hi> to ſtrike
him; but <hi>Hircan</hi> held him by the arm, and carried him a walking another way,
while <hi>Clarimond</hi> entertain'd his enemy. <hi>Lyſis</hi> ask'd <hi>Hircan,</hi> whether he had not
ſome Magical glaſs, wherein he might ſee whether it were true that <hi>Fontenay</hi> was
beloved by his Shepherdeſs. <hi>Hircan</hi> told him, that he had broken his, out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
that he had once ſeen a Miſtreſs of his in the arms of one of his Rivals,
and that he had not yet had the leaſure to make another; but that he could tell him
what he deſired to know, by ſome otherwayes; and that if <hi>Fontenay</hi> had offended
him any way, he would ſee him reveng'd of him. Thereupon he ſhew'd him a
little grove of his, and told him, that all thoſe trees he ſaw had ſometimes been men
that he had metamorphos'd, becauſe they had done ſome injury to him or his
friends, and that to inrich himſelf in a moment, he found nothing ſo eaſie as to
make a forreſt of his Enemies, which ſhould be full grown timber, and ready for
the ax. <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who had a while before read <hi>Ovids</hi> Metamorphoſes, where there
are things far more incredible, eaſily believ'd this. He reſolv'd to be ever a friend
of <hi>Hircans,</hi> both that he might not hurt him, and might aſſiſt him to puniſh thoſe
that ſhould injure him.</p>
            <p>A while after, <hi>Hircan</hi> having carried the company into the houſe to a Collation,
<hi>Lyſis</hi> ſaid not a word to <hi>Fontenay,</hi> contenting himſelf not to look on him. <hi>Synopa</hi>
was there, who as ſhe was as impudent as need be wiſh'd, ſhe went and ſaid to the
Shepherd before all that were preſent, Ah! inhumane heart! wilt thou never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the torments I ſuffer for thee? Behold the thing obſerv'd in all <hi>Paſtorals,</hi>
ſayes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> a Maid ever loves him that affects her not: In <hi>Montemajor, Seluage</hi>
purſues <hi>Alanio, Alanio</hi> courts <hi>Iſmenia, Iſmenia Montan,</hi> and <hi>Montan Seluage:</hi> So
<hi>Synopa</hi> follows me, I <hi>Charite, Charite</hi> deſires <hi>Fontenay,</hi> and <hi>Fontenay</hi> deſires ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Shepherdeſs, who haply loves another Shepherd, that can affect none then
<hi>Synopa.</hi> Is not that a fine wheel, and as good as that of <hi>Pythagoras?</hi> We'll run
one after another in the fields, holding by one another behinde, as children do at
a certain play whereof I have forgat the name. <hi>Charite</hi> ſhall ſay, Go not ſo faſt
my <hi>Fontenay;</hi> and <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſhall ſay, Stay my <hi>Charite,</hi> at leaſt let me dye in your
preſence: and then <hi>Synopa</hi> ſhall come after, and ſay, Forſake that ingrateful one
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43725:78"/>
               <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and ſtay with with her that lives not but for thy ſake. I do not wonder at the
diverſity of all our affections, for it muſt neceſſarily be ſo; and there were never
any Paſtorals ſeen, wherein that hath not been obſerved: But it is withal to be noted,
that one day all ſhall be reconciled, and by the power of ſome God, it ſhall come
to paſs, that every one ſhall love what he ſhould love, as it happens in the end of
every good hiſtory, which ever concludes with marriage.</p>
            <p>Every one ſeem'd to admire theſe excellent reaſons; ſo that <hi>Lſis</hi> thinking he
had ſpoken mightily to the purpoſe, was very well ſatisfied. Yet when he had left
<hi>Hircans</hi> houſe, there came ſomewhat into his memory, that animated him againſt
<hi>Fontenay.</hi> Had it not been for that, he would have return'd back to the Magicians,
for he was not well ſatisfied with <hi>Clarimonds</hi> mother; but to remain where his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was, he could not by any means ſubmit to. <hi>Clarimond</hi> having ſpoken to him
of the injury he had receiv'd, heightned his ſpirit to revenge: ſo that he was much
to ſeek what he ſhould do. You muſt fight, ſayes <hi>Clarimond,</hi> there's no other way;
ſend <hi>Fontenaie</hi> a Challenge, he is a man of his weapon, he'll meet you in the field.
I have diligently peruſed all books of <hi>Shepherdrie,</hi> replyes <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but I never found
any Shepherd that fought a duel: And if any one hath taken Arms, as <hi>Celadons</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did, it was not well done, and it was a tranſgreſſion of our Ordinances. I am not
ſuch an enemy to Laws, as to be a tranſgreſſor of them, as he was; and yet it is
not out of Cowardize, for if it were to fight with Sheephooks, I ſhould be the firſt
in the charge: or if it were to be at ſlings, to caſt peeble ſtones, I ſhould make one,
it hath been my exerciſe ever ſince I was a little boy: There's nothing becomes us
better; and tis certain, <hi>David</hi> had but a ſling to overcome <hi>Goliah.</hi> He was one of
the moſt eminent Shepherds in the world, and therefore muſt be imitated in all
things. You muſt then ſend <hi>Fontenaie</hi> word, that you will fight with him at the
ſling, replyes <hi>Clarimond.</hi> Let's not be ſo haſty, ſayes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> it may be he'll come
and ask me pardon for the injury he hath done me.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe diſcourſes they retch'd <hi>Clarimonds</hi> Caſtle, where they found <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
return'd. 'Twas much beſides the expectation of <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who thought that
ſtrange face having gotten ſo much money of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> would have gone his way, and
not have brought him any ſheep, as many would have done in the like caſe. But
he was as good as his word; for he conſider'd that he could hardly meet with a
better fortune, then he expected from his new Maſter, with whom he was to live as
his Peer and Companion. He bethought him, he was lodg'd in a Caſtle, whereas
before he underſtood not any thing above a Cottage: and above all, he was much
pleas'd to eat at a Gentlemans Table, whereas before, he had hardly ever eaten a
meals meat, but in ſome wretched Victualing houſe But what was yet more, he had
ſometimes heard read ſome few leaves of the <hi>Pleaſures of a Paſtoral life,</hi> the charms
whereof had fully captivated him. He had therefore been at a ſmall Market Town,
where he had bought a dozen ſheep dearer then they were worth, for he was not
much skil'd in the imployment. He had alſo been at the Brokers, and chang'd a black
ſuit he had on, for a gray one, and had trim'd himſelf <hi>Lyſis</hi> thought him very ſpruce
and neat, though he was not fully ſhav'd, and had long muſtachoes; for he ſaid he
might eaſily take off that when he had a minde to diſguiſe himſelf into a maid, to go
and ſee his Sweetheart: As for the Flock, though it was in an ill caſe, yet was he
ſatisfied with it, both in regard he was in ſuch impatience to have one, that he would
take the firſt preſented it ſelf; and that he thought it a glory to feed it: ſo that
whereas it was now very lean, he would within a while make it very fat.</p>
            <p>After Supper he began to conſider, that <hi>Clarimonds</hi> mother did not bid him ſo
welcome as he expected as indeed it was true: the good Lady being much given
to zeal and devotion, was not well pleas'd to ſee a fool at her Table. He conceiv'd
himſelf oblig'd to take a Lodging elſewhere, and hire ſome little Cottage for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and <hi>Carmelin.</hi> This conſideration was accompanied with a many other deſigns,
which requir'd ſudden execution: ſo that he call'd his man, and ſaid to him, Put
the Flock into the ſtable, if it be not already, bring me my Gittarrhe, give me pen,
ink and paper, look out for a houſe for me, go and ſee how <hi>Charite</hi> doth, preſent
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43725:78"/>
my ſervice to the <hi>Magician</hi> and his <hi>Nayad;</hi> Tell <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Montenor,</hi> I am no
longer their friend. Thou art nothing vigilant, A man muſt tell thee all thou haſt
to do. <hi>Carmelin</hi> took a little ſnuff at this, and began to complain of the haſtineſs
of his maſter, whoſe commands were ſo far from a poſſibility of execution, that they
could not well be underſtood. But <hi>Lyſis</hi> made his excuſes for it, that being in his
<hi>reſueries</hi> he had ſpoken all came into his mind. So that he deſired nothing but his
Gittarrhe, which they were fain to ſend to <hi>Montenor's</hi> for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> having heard him a while playing on that Inſtrument, ſaid the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
was moſt excellent and raviſhing; but that it was a far greater recreation for
one to decipher his paſſions, whether it were in proſe or verſe. He was of the ſame
opinion; and putting away his Gitarrhe, ask'd for pen and ink to write a Letter to
<hi>Charite.</hi> 'Twas a thing ſeem'd ſo far neceſſary, as it concern'd him to know how
much he was in her favour, and whether ſhe ſtill bore him any grudge. He ſate up
all night about it, and did nothing but write down and blot out a thouſand conceits;
but at laſt he brought it to that paſs, as it ſhould not ſuffer any further alteration.
And though it was not yet day, he went and awoke <hi>Clarimond</hi> for to communicate
it to him; for he was not ſo ſcrupulous now as when he writ his firſt Letter, which
he would not ſhew <hi>Anſelme.</hi> And theſe were the Contents of it.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

            <p>The Shepherd was wholly raviſh'd at the repetition of it, and proteſted he had
ſurpaſs'd himſelf in this Letter; and <hi>Clarimond</hi> avow'd as much, by reaſon it was
full of a certain more then common ingenuity. And indeed he was in the right;
for <hi>Lyſis</hi> had many good Intervals, in which ſo many <hi>Idaeas</hi> thronging into his fancy,
it was very hard that now and then he ſhould not hit on ſomwhat that were good.
Certainly for this humour it was happy enough; and by this he lets us underſtand
why a <hi>Love-Letter</hi> was call'd a <hi>Pullet,</hi> a thing which many that uſe the word wholly
underſtand not. <hi>Clarimond</hi> therefore having admir'd his invention, he was content to
believe it would find no leſs eſteem with his Miſtreſs, and that there was no hardneſs
of heart whatever that this could not ſoften. Nay, the agitations of his paſſions
were ſuch, that he was in a ſtrong belief that <hi>Charite</hi> would immediately command
him to attend her; nay he did not ſtick to ſay, that if he were to paſs the Sea like
<hi>Leander</hi> to ſee his <hi>Hero,</hi> he would do it cheerfully. But <hi>Clarimond</hi> envying him this
enjoyment, and deſirous to affront the fable, ſaid, That the poor <hi>Leander</hi> muſt needs
be too cold, after having paſs'd an arm of the Sea, (as he did every time) to enjoy
his Miſtreſs; and that he muſt be a luſty man indeed, if after all that he were <hi>ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant;</hi>
and that it had been better to have hired ſome Barge to paſs from one ſhore
to another, or elſe to have ſteer'd it himſelf, and that for his part he knew no reaſon
why he might not hide himſelf all day in ſome obſcure houſe ſomewhere neer the
lodgings of his fair <hi>Hero,</hi> that he might ſave ſo much trouble, and be the fitter to
viſit her at night. <hi>Lyſis</hi> replyed, that aſſuredly that Lover wanted not his hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
to all this; and that though the ſtory was not the moſt probable in the world,
yet was it not to be miſtruſted as to the truth of it, being reported by ſo many good

               <hi>Lyſis</hi> was not willing to enlarge himſelf in this diſcourſe, becauſe he was at this time
more imployd about bringing to paſs his own loves, then to conſider by what means
others enjoy'd theirs. Nay, ſo impatient was he, that he left <hi>Clarimond</hi> to ſeal his
Letter, and in all haſte call'd <hi>Carmelin</hi> to go carry it to <hi>Charite.</hi> But <hi>Carmelin</hi> was
ſo ſound aſleep, that he had much ado to make him wake. Thou lazie fellow, quoth
he, haſt thou a mind to bury both body and ſoul in theſe fathers? Seeſt thou not
that the Sun begins to ſcatter his beams upon the vaults of heaven? He is now a
gilding of the Mountain-tops, and it will not be long ere he kiſs the loweſt herbs:
Yea, the Husband-men withdraw out of the boſoms of their wives, where they had
ſlept as on a pillow; and the Birds warble out their acclamations, to welcome
the Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> being forc'd to awake, ſaw that indeed it was break of day; ſo that
<hi>Lyſis</hi> gave him his Letter, with commands to carry it to his Miſtreſs. He rubbing
his eyes, which by this time were half open, beſeech'd him to tell him what kinde
of woman ſhe was, and where he might finde her. If thou ſeeſt her, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
thou wilt know her well enough; ſhe is a Sun that enlightens all the world, and
cannot ſuffer any ecclypſe. Then, ſayes <hi>Carmelin,</hi> you write to the Sun for ought
I know; as I am an honeſt man, you muſt finde another Meſſenger, for my part
I cannot flie ſo high; would you would ſend it poſt by ſome bird. Thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandſt
not, anſwers <hi>Lyſis,</hi> or at leaſt wilt not underſtand I ſpeak of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs
<hi>Charite,</hi> that dwells in the Caſtle of <hi>Orontes,</hi> any body will tell thee
the way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> being in bed, heard all this diſcourſe, and call'd <hi>Lyſis</hi> to him, telling him
that he did ill for to ſend <hi>Carmelin</hi> to carry a Love-Letter to his Miſtreſs, and that
poſſibly he might be beaten by the way. I can help all this, anſwers <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I have
ſometimes read a Bood, called <hi>The Temple of Venus,</hi> where there are many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſecrets for concealing of Letters; among others, that of ſending them by
Doves, that will carry them. But it were too much for me to deſcend to the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any; for upon better thoughts I finde, that I have another deſign much
better. The Chicken that run about <hi>Orontes</hi>'s houſe, will now and then get out into
the ſtreet; I will tie my Letter to one of their legs, and it ſhall carry it into the
houſe, where <hi>Charite</hi> may receive it. It is an excellent invention, ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:43725:79"/>
but methinks <hi>Charite</hi> ſhould have notice beforehand: And if you could make ſuch
an addreſs to her, you might deliver her your Letter without making uſe of ſuch an
artifice, which for the preſent is not at all neceſſary. But, ſays he, I know another
invention better then this: Your Shepherdeſs, you are to note, is a little ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipp'd;
when ſhe is at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe is ever eating of Penny-pyes; you had beſt entreat
a Pye-woman to put it into one of her Pyes, and there ſhe'll be ſure to find it. We
are not now in the City, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and poſſibly ſhe hath chang'd her cuſtom;
beſides that, ſuch <hi>Pullets</hi> as mine uſe not to be put in Paſte. You are very much in
the right on't, Maſter, ſays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> for poſſibly ſhe may be ſo hungry, that ſhe
may eat cruſt, fleſh, and paper all at a bit; for I think a <hi>Love-Letter</hi> may be very
good meat, ſo that there be verjuice enough to it. <hi>Love</hi> take my ſoul! (ſays
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> that had a mind to ſwear after the new faſhion) this is the beſt <hi>Droll</hi> in the
world; I ſee, <hi>Carmelin,</hi> thou art a pleaſant fellow, and I well underſtand thou wilt
make my time ſhorter and leſs tedious to me. But hear me! in all thy jeſts be as
carefull to touch my Miſtreſs, as thou wouldſt a Deity. I am content, ſays <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin;</hi>
and for your Letter, you need not trouble your brain to Philoſophize upon
any of theſe rare ſecrets; aſſure your ſelf I'll find means enough to deliver it to
Madam <hi>Charite:</hi> This very buſineſs ſhall diſcover my ingenuity unto you. But 'tis
neceſſary, that I be firſt convinced ſhe is a perſon of honor I am directed to, and
that all your addreſſes to her are for no other end then marriage, and that in the
face of the Church, otherwiſe you muſt finde ſome other to carry it; for I am as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of my reputation as the apple of my eye. I muſt anſwer, ſayes <hi>Clarimond</hi> in
this for your Maſter, that he doth not ſend you to be his Pimp, but on a juſt and an
honeſt errand. It coſts not ſo much to call any thing by an honorable name, but ſince
you are ſo ſubtil do your duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> left <hi>Clarimond,</hi> for our Shepherd would needs ſet his man a
little on his way. He caus'd the ſheep to be brought out of the fold, but wanting
a Sheephook, he was not a little diſcontented, yet had he no mind to ſend to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenors</hi>
for his own. But becauſe he could not endure to be without one, he fell
upon this pretty imagination: he found a long painted ſtaff, which he thought fit
for his purpoſe; and having taken a card, he tyed it with a thread to the head of it.
Now, as Good-luck would have it, it fell out to be the <hi>Queen of Hearts,</hi> which
exceedingly pleas'd him; inſomuch, as he did not ſtick to ſay, that nothing could
better become that place, in reſpect it put him in perpetual remembrance of his
Shepherdeſs, who was really the <hi>Queen</hi> of his <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Deſires.</hi> Furniſh'd with
this Sheep-hook, he left <hi>Clarimonds,</hi> and with a Country man named <hi>Bertrand,</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at his cottage door, he enquir'd of him, whether he could lodge him, his man,
and his ſheep. The man reply'd, Yes; and ſhew'd him his lodgings, which <hi>Lyſis</hi>
lik'd very well. He agreed with him for five groats a week, beſides his promiſe,
that for what bread and fruit he had of him, he ſhould be paid for daily: This
being concluded, he ſhew'd his man which was the way to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s houſe; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
implor'd the favour and aſſiſtance of the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> parted with him. He got
up on a little hillock, and thence look'd after him, as long as he could perceive him;
but having loſt the ſight of him, he began to be afraid he might not do his errand;
for he conſidered, that <hi>Charite's</hi> name was <hi>Catherine du Verger,</hi> and he was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
troubled, that he had not told his ſervant her true name, that he might the
more eaſily make his addreſs to her. However, he could not repent of what he had
done, when he remembred himſelf that he was oblig'd by a vow made to <hi>Love,</hi> not
to name his fair dear otherwiſe then by the incomparable name of <hi>Charite:</hi> So that
falling into the depth of Extravagancy, he perſwaded himſelf that her name was
really <hi>Charite,</hi> and that ſhe was call'd ſo of all that knew her. As this quieted him
not a little, ſo he fell into very chearful thoughts; and fain'd to himſelf, that there
was no doubt but <hi>Charite</hi> would receive his Letter, and the contents thereof would
be ſo happy, as to be the Object of her Eye, and the Subject of her Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>

Mean while his Flock fed where it found any thing to feed on; and as good luck
would have it, a great Dog came into the way, as it were on purpoſe to keep them.
<hi>Lyſis</hi> had ſo much wit, as that when he came from <hi>Clarimond's,</hi> he had furniſh'd his
Scrip with a great piece of bread, which unknown to the ſervants had been left out
of the Bing. He threw a piece of it to the Dog; and having clapp'd him o'th' back
and ſpat in's mouth, preſently grew acquainted with him. So good friends they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came,
that <hi>Lyſis</hi> made account he was fully his ſervant; ſo that he had no other
care to take for him, then to give him a name worthy of both the dog and his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
This imployed his whole underſtanding; and conſidering that he was to name
him according to his qualities, he could not reſolve whether to call him <hi>Truſty, Stout,</hi>
or <hi>Watch.</hi> But all theſe names being common, and therefore not ſuiting with his
humour, after profound meditation he light on this excellent one. The dog was
all <hi>white,</hi> only that he had the muzzle <hi>red</hi> This fell very fit for his thoughts; ſo
that he call'd him <hi>Muzedor,</hi> that is, a <hi>muzzle</hi> of <hi>gold,</hi> or a golden muzzle. <hi>I</hi> need
not tell you how proud he was of this brave adventure; for he remembred that
he had read in ſome <hi>Romances</hi> the name of <hi>Muſedorus,</hi> which (ſetting aſide the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
which he gave it) ſignifies in <hi>Greek</hi> the <hi>gift</hi> of the <hi>Muſes.</hi> This brought
him to ſuch an opinion of himſelf, that he thought himſelf able to give names to as
many perſons as could ſtand in the Plains of <hi>Beauſſe;</hi> and conceiting himſelf at this
happineſs of invention, he thought fit to beſtow a name upon every piece of his
equipage. He bethought him, ſeeing the <hi>Knights-Errant,</hi> whom he eſteemed no
other then fools and mad-men, took a liberty to give names to their <hi>horſes</hi> and
<hi>ſwords;</hi> that <hi>Shepherds,</hi> who were far their betters, ſhould not be depriv'd the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of giving names to their <hi>Dogs, Sheep-hooks,</hi> and <hi>Scrips.</hi> 'Twas not certain
whether his Sheep-hook had ſometime belong'd to a Country-Monaſtery, or that
<hi>Clarimond</hi> had made uſe of it in a Maſque, wherein he repreſented <hi>Thyrſis:</hi> Certain
it was, that it was painted <hi>green,</hi> and <hi>gilt</hi> in ſome places; ſo that <hi>Lyſis</hi> thought fit
to call it <hi>Green-gilt,</hi> or <hi>Gilt-green:</hi> And both thoſe names ſeeming to him very
proper, it rais'd a mighty controverſie in him which he ſhould take. Till he could
abſolutely decide the buſineſs, he thought beſt to keep both; and while he was in
theſe thoughts, he went on ſtill, driving his ſheep before him. There was one of
them broke into a Vineyard, the reſt follow'd; and after all the Dog, who fell
preſently to the grapes. The Shepherd himſelf could not refrain, but broke his faſt
on them: But as he was picking up and down, not thinking what he was doing, ſo
much was he taken up with his <hi>names,</hi> there comes a rude Churl with a halbard in
his hand, and takes him by the collar, and ſays to him, Come your way to priſon
immediately, you ſhall pay damage for this; is it no more with you to eat what
belongs to poor people? <hi>Lyſis</hi> endeavoured what he could to get out of his hands;
but there came up two other Country-fellows, who alſo laid hold on him, ſo that
he thought it not ſafe to ſtand out any longer. What's this? ſayes one of them,
(ſeeing the ſheep and dog) he hath brought his Cattel alſo into the vineyard; they
ſhall be our ſatisfaction. He ſeeing that two were enough to conduct <hi>Lyſis,</hi> left
him to his companions, and brought on the Flock after them: As for the Dog, he
alſo follow'd barking at them that held his maſter. Do me the favour at leaſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
me without noiſe, ſays the <hi>Shepherd:</hi> You need not hold me, I'll go quietly,
provided you'll tell me what place you intend to lodge me in, ſeeing you make me
run ſo faſt. Do you not ſee that I am a Vineyard-keeper? (ſays the Fellow with
the halbard:) If we do not meet with out Judge to take order with you, we muſt
put you in priſon till he come. Take heed what thou doſt, royal Vineyard-keeper,
replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I know not before what Judge thou wilt bring me; but know that
I acknowledge none but <hi>Pan,</hi> in whatever concerns Shepherds: I will not be judg'd
by men, nor yet by women, out of whoſe hands I eſcaped when I was <hi>Amaryllis:</hi>
There are none but the Gods above me; for even when I was at St. <hi>Clou,</hi> I was my
ſelf Judge in a caſe between <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Geneura.</hi> And as for the priſon, alas!
where canſt thou find one narrower to put me in then that I am in already for the
fair <hi>Charite?</hi> Howbeit let us go forward, to ſee what will be ſaid to us.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:43725:80"/>
            <p>After this he went along with the Country fellows without any reſiſtance. And
as the Towns are very neer one to the other in <hi>Brie,</hi> they had not gone a quarter
of a league, but they came to certain Country-houſes, out of one whereof there
comes a <hi>Pettyfogger</hi> with a beard like a Goat, a noſe like a Turky-cock, with white
Breeches, a Doublet of black ſerge, and a Hat that required no great labour to be
ſcaled. He was the Judge of the place under <hi>Hircan,</hi> who was Lord of the ſoil, and
had all manner of juriſdiction civil and criminal in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>The Keeper perceiving him, told him how he had found <hi>Lyſis</hi> in the vineyard,
and what ſpoil he made there. But the Shepherd preſently aſſuming the diſcourſe.
Are we not in the ſecond Golden age? ſays he to him; Ought not all the fruits of
the earth to be common? Beſides, among <hi>Shepherds</hi> as we are, ſhould there be any
regard to <hi>Laws,</hi> which are only made for ſtrangers?</p>
            <p>The Judge apprehended not any thing of all this, and was ready to paſs a ſevere
ſentence againſt him: But as good fortune was, <hi>Hircan,</hi> who had been a hunting,
paſs'd by. <hi>Lyſis</hi> having perceived him, leap'd for joy, and thought that the dogs
that were about him were a Kennel of Devils that aſſiſted him. Deliver me, ſays
he to him, out of the hands of theſe Savages here! when I was a Maid, a Woman
judg'd me; and now that I am a Man, <hi>I</hi> muſt be be judg'd by a Man. This is a
great diſhonouring of <hi>Love,</hi> who is the King of my ſoul; and of <hi>Pan,</hi> who is the
King of my body and goods. <hi>Hircan</hi> ſeeing <hi>Lyſis</hi> was in a deal of trouble, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
he ſhould be ſet at liberty. They ſaid he had eaten their grapes: But <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
making anſwer that that was no great matter, they were forc'd to obey their
Lord. <hi>Lyſis</hi> having his ſheep at his own diſpoſal again, call'd his Dog to him, who
came and fawn'd on him. So that ſeeing himſelf in a poſture to return into the fields,
he took leave of the Magician, who had ſo ſeaſonably delivered him now this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, and was infinitely pleas'd to have met with the opportunity to do him
that courteſie.</p>
            <p>While he drove his Flock a feeding up and down, <hi>Carmelin</hi> had almoſt recover'd
<hi>Orontes</hi>'s Caſtle, and asked for the Shepherdeſs <hi>Charite</hi> of all that he met. He could
not learn any thing of her, only he was told that <hi>Orontes</hi> had had a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> but
he had neither wife nor daughter. He was much troubled at this, ſo that he deſpair'd
to get any tidings of her. Keeping ſtill on his way, he comes neer <hi>Hircan's</hi> Wood,
where <hi>Synopa</hi> and another Gentlewoman were walking. When ſhe perceiv'd him,
ſhe ask'd him whether he went, and whom he belong'd to. I belong to the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> replies he, and I think my buſineſs is with you: I think you are the
Shepherdeſs <hi>Charite:</hi> for you have there a fine Comb-caſe, and a fine white Apron.
<hi>Synopa</hi> being very deſirous to know what meſſage <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſent his Miſtreſs, reſolv'd
to abuſe the man; and having affirm'd to him that ſhe was called <hi>Charite,</hi> ſhe took
him aſide to know what his errand was. He freely delivered her the Letter, which
ſhe had no ſooner read, but to make <hi>Lyſis</hi> deſpair, ſhe ſays to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> Return to
thy maſter, and tell him that which he will not be glad to know, that is, that my
diſpleaſure will never end; that he hope not any favour from me, he deſerves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but diſdain: As for the <hi>Pullet</hi> he mentions, unleſs it be good to make a <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſee</hi>
of, I care not what become of it.</p>
            <p>With that ſhe turn her back on <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who wiſh'd he had not met her, and
thought it better not to carry his maſter any news at all, then to bring him ill. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he returns, and having found him, he ſimply related to him all the Shepherdeſs
had ſaid. What eloquence were able to expreſs <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s ſadneſs and dejection, which
was without meaſure! But what neceſſiry is there to ſpeak of it, ſince we could not
any way better deſcribe it then by ſilence; a diſcontent which was ſo violent as made
himſelf be ſilent for a long time, lying along on the ground as a man half dead?
At length he riſes up, and ſeeing <hi>Carmelin</hi> went here and there as if he look'd for
ſomewhat, he ask'd him what he wanted? I look for a Spring, where I might get
ſome water to caſt on your face, to recover you out of your ſwound, ſays <hi>Carmelin.</hi>
Alas, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> wherefore goeſt thou ſo far to look for any, ſeeſt thou not there is
enough running down my cheeks? Behold theſe tears that bathe my face, they have
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43725:81"/>
brought me to my ſelf again, but it hath been only to give me the means to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.
Ah! Regret, ſadneſs, deſpairs, madneſs, puniſhments, ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

my ſelf? Alas! now you may be your own keepers; if <hi>Carmelin</hi> and <hi>Muſedore</hi> do
not take you into their charge.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Carmelin</hi> endeavoured to comfort him: but ſeeing he did but loſe his
labour, he would have brought him along to <hi>Clarimond's,</hi> to ſee if that Gentleman
might better remove his diſquiet. But <hi>Lyſis</hi> told him, that though he ſaw the day
was neer retiring, yet would he not ſtir from the place; and that he would patiently
expect what it were the pleaſure of the Gods to do with him. <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſeeing his
obſtinacie, went and ſtabled the Flock at the Coutry-mans where they were to
lodge, and return'd to him with a good piece of bread, and a quarter of a pound of
cheeſe, for to recover his ſpirits: but <hi>Lyſis</hi> would not eat a bit, only entreated him
in the name of what he lov'd beſt in the world to retire till the next morning, and
to leave him there to be eaten by the wolves, if the Deſtinies had ſo ordained it.
When <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſaw it was night, he had no mind to paſs it over with him, but we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

for having ſo ill managed his ambaſſage, though (to ſpeak truth) it was no fault
of his.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Shepherd</hi> was in a Meadow, where though he lay all the while on the ground,
yet he ſlept not at all: He did nothing but turn himſelf from one ſide to the other,
and talk ſometimes to the Trees, and ſometimes to the Springs, as if they had heard
and could have anſwered him.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen it began to dawn, the diſconſolate Shepherd perceiving
but a weak light, imagin'd, that thence forward the world
ſhould have no more light then that of <hi>Aurora,</hi> from
morning to night, by reaſon of the ſadneſs which the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
were in for his misfortune. But that imagination did
but increaſe his torment; ſo that he was reſolv'd to make
ſuch loud complaints, that <hi>Charite</hi> might hear them from
the houſ where ſhe lived, which was a good league off. <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond,</hi>
who was wont to walk a little as ſoon as he was
up, heard his cryes, as being not far from the place; and accidentally meeting <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin</hi>
at the ſame time, he learn'd of him the deſpair of his Maſter. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
went both to him, whither when they were come: What, ſays <hi>Clarimond</hi> to
him, will you continue there ſtill? Shepherd, of what do you intend to <hi>live?</hi> Alas!
replyes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ask me rather what I ſhall <hi>dye</hi> of; and I will anſwer you, I will dye
of <hi>Love.</hi> I do not hope any thing from <hi>Charite,</hi> ſhe abhors me, and will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to hear me ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>Thereupon <hi>Clarimond</hi> ask'd <hi>Carmelin,</hi> whether <hi>Charite</hi> was ſo cruel in good
earneſt. If you had ſeen her when ſhe ſpoke to me, replyes <hi>Carmelin,</hi> you would
have taken her for a Tygreſs in a womans dreſs; but it muſt be withal confeſt, that
ſhe was the faireſt Tygreſs that ever was ſeen. Her eyes did ſo ſparkle, that as I have
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43725:82"/>
heard from my Maſter, and other amorous perſons, they ſeem'd to be a fire; and
I did really imagine that they did caſt ſquibs and crackers at me, as the Boys uſe to
do at mid-Summer. See there, Is not that it I ever believ'd? ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſhe was
then poſſeſt by that ſpirit of choler which is ever about her. It is long ſince that
ſhe hath threatned to conſume me. But O ye Gods! you have ordain'd otherwiſe
of me, and your Revelations this night have taught me, that your pleaſure is I
ſhould be ranked among the <hi>Metamorphoſes,</hi> that I might be added to thoſe of <hi>Ovid.</hi>
This is no deluſion <hi>Clarimond;</hi> you might have obſerved, that when ever the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
know not what to do with a man, and yet would ſhew compaſſion on his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings;
they change him into ſome new form. I believe it, ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> and ſince
it muſt be ſo, let us conſider how to bring about things, and we ſhall finde all will
be well. Take you ſuch a courſe, as that of a diſconſolate and a deſperate Lover, as
you are now, you may be chang'd into a free and contented man, that you may
with as much eaſe ſlight this your ingrateful Shepherdeſs, as ſhe doth you, and
that will be a very excellent <hi>Metamorphoſes.</hi> You do not apprehend this Miſtery,
replyes <hi>Lyſis;</hi> for inſtead of being chang'd into the contrary, the change is ever
into ſome thing that ſuits with the former humor. As for example, a Thief ſhall
be transform'd into ſome ravenous Bird; a cozening companion, into a Fox; and
a tractable perſon into a ſheep. Now that I am upon the point of loſing my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſhape, I muſt ſeriouſly put my ſelf into ſome good humor, that I may not
be Metamoaphos'd into ſome unpleaſing creature. However, I have one ſecret ſhall
bring me into a great eſteem; and it is this, I will not take a form that any other
hath already had, and my deſire is, to have a Metamorphoſis, that was never yet
talk'd of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> had already diſcover'd, that his Maſter and his ſenſes were at a diſtance;
but yet he did not think they were gone ſo far aſtray, as that he ſhould imagine ſuch
groſs Extravagancies. Nevertheleſs, ſeeing <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſeriouſly liſtening to him,
and calling to minde what he had heard ſpoken of the ancient <hi>Metamorphoſes,</hi> his
piercing inginuity was at a loſs what to think of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having by this time made an end of ſighing and ſobbing, lifted up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a little, and bid <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſit by him. Well, come, ſayes he to him, let's put
the caſe that the Gods will give me the liberty to chooſe the form I am to take,
what will you adviſe me to? for my part, ſays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> if your caſe were mine,
I ſhould wiſh to become a little <hi>Shock. Charite</hi> would <hi>kiſs</hi> you, would <hi>trim</hi> you,
would <hi>feed</hi> you out of her own hand, and you ſhould <hi>lie</hi> with her. Do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
a little what pleaſure you ſhould have. That's handſomly propos'd, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
but there is a dog already in the houſe, againſt whom the Cats, which are at leaſt
ſeven or eight, are in perpetual hoſtility, and do often give him ſuch clawing em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
as he takes very unkindely. I ſhould not be well pleas'd to be ſcratch'd
in that manner by them. Be then Metamorpos'd into a <hi>Flea,</hi> replyes <hi>Clarimond,</hi>
you ſhall leap up and down her body, you ſhall go into the boſom of your Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs,
and thence a little lower, the reſt I leave it to your ſelf to imagine. But
if <hi>Charite</hi> catch me, replyes the Shepherd, ſhall I be proof againſt her nails; and
then what will become of poor <hi>Lyſis?</hi> I am not for any of all theſe, I think there
is nothing better then to be turn'd to ſomething without life; for then no body
meddles with one, but I am ſuffered to laſt as long as I can. I do not ſpeak of Plants,
for they live; I mean ſome ſort of moveables and neceſſary things; as for inſtance,
a <hi>Looking-glaſs,</hi> and that form I think very fit for me, for I have already <hi>Charite's</hi>
picture drawn in my heart. I ſhould repreſent her face as well preſent as abſent;
but withal, I would not receive any other images, and it ſhould be in vain for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to come to look in me. Now when one is thus chang'd into a moveable, one
is not for that inſenſible, but the ſoul retires into ſome corner. Maſter, without
diſpleaſing you, ſays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I have as excellent inventions on this occaſion as
your ſelf. Change your ſelf into a <hi>Smoak,</hi> and ſo you ſhall touch the delicate skin
of your <hi>Charite,</hi> or elſe into ſome <hi>Gorget,</hi> and you ſhall touch her breaſts, and
ſhe will waſh you with her own hands! methinks it would come very ſeaſonably,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43725:82"/>
for you are grown very foul by lying on the ground to night. But a better then any
is to be chang'd into a <hi>Knife:</hi> I'll be the <hi>Pedlar</hi> that will go and ſell you to her, and
ſhe ſhall put you into her own ſheath, and wear you at the ſide of her virginity:
That were indeed a fair transformation! Thou haſt given over to ſpeak learnedly,
<hi>Carmelin!</hi> replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I believe the vexation thou art in to ſee me thus afflicted,
hath caus'd thee ſome loſs of wit. Thy two firſt Changes, methinks, are not glorious
enough for me; and for the laſt, it is a moſt impertinent one, and very dangerous.
Seeſt thou not that if I were a Knife, it might happen that I might cut the fingers
of my <hi>Charite,</hi> which I ſhould be infinitely ſorry for. Do not thou interpoſe thy,
ſelf any more in this affair: Go immediately home, and bring away my Flock, or
rather thy own, into the fields.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> was forc'd to obey his Maſters command. He was no ſooner gone, but
<hi>Hircan,</hi> who was taking a walk all alone to ſee his friend <hi>Clarimond,</hi> came into the
very place. Being perceived by <hi>Clarimond,</hi> he ſaid not a word, becauſe he would not
interrupt <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s diſcourſe; and beſide, he ſaw the other made ſigns to him to that
purpoſe. <hi>Hircan</hi> coming ſoftly behind the Shepherd, to frighten him a little,
would needs turn his hat round; but he gave it ſuch a turn, that he toſs'd it into the
branches of a <hi>Willow</hi> that was over againſt him, where it ſtuck faſt. <hi>Lyſis</hi> being
turn'd about towards <hi>Hircan,</hi> gave him but a ſlight ſalute, becauſe he had no deſire
to laugh: He would needs have his Hat again, though he imagin'd himſelf on the
point not to have any further occaſion for it. As ill luck would have it, neither
<hi>Clarimond</hi> nor <hi>Hircan</hi> had any ſtick to beat it down, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> had carried
away the ſheep-hook with him to bring the Flock abroad. The Willow-tree was
ſomwhat high; yet he made a ſhift to get up, by putting his foot into ſome holes
that age and rottenneſs had made in it: But as his ſtretch'd out his arm to reach his
hat, he ſlides down ſuddenly and falls into the hollow of the tree, which time had
ſo gnawn, that there was place enough for a man. There was nothing in ſight of
him but his head and his arms, which he ſtretch'd on both ſides to take hold of two
great branches; and being in this poſture, he began to cry out thus: There needs
no more conſiderations, <hi>Clarimond!</hi> the buſineſs is effected; 'tis to no purpoſe
now to deliberate in what manner I ſhall be metamorphos'd, it is the pleaſure of my
Deſtiny I ſhould be chang'd into a <hi>Tree.</hi> O god! I feel my <hi>legs</hi> grow longer, and
begin to change into <hi>roots,</hi> and ſpread themſelves into the earth; my <hi>arms</hi> are now
<hi>boughs,</hi> and my <hi>fingers branches,</hi> I already ſee the leaves ſprouting out; my <hi>fleſh</hi>
and <hi>bones</hi> are chang'd into <hi>wood,</hi> and my <hi>skin</hi> hardens, and is chang'd into <hi>bark.</hi> O
ye ancient <hi>Lovers,</hi> that have been Metamorphos'd, I ſhall henceforward be of
your quality, and I ſhall be eternally celebrated as well as you in the works of the
<hi>Poets!</hi> O my dear friends who are preſent, receive my laſt farewell, I am not any
more to be reckon'd among men!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> were ſo amaz'd to hear him break out in that manner, that
they knew not what to ſay of ſuch an Extravagancy. At laſt <hi>Clarimond</hi> approaches
the tree, and ſaies to the Shepherd, Come out thence; ſhall I help you out? when
you are once out, you'll finde you are what you were always. The heavens hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me to come hence, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and you may perceive the bark that aſcends
by little and little, and will immediately cover my mouth, ſo that I ſhall not be
able to ſpeak any more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſeeing this folly, thought <hi>Hircan</hi> the cauſe of it, and that <hi>Lyſis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
him a Magican, believed withal, that he had bound him up in that tree. He
therefore ſoftly entreated him to retire; and when he was at ſome diſtance off, he
did his utmoſt endeavour to perſwade the Shepherd to come out of the place where
he was, but he prevailed nothing with him; for he anſwered him only with <hi>ſighs;</hi>
and buſied not his minde, but in certain imaginations, which muſt needs have been
the moſt remarkable in the world. <hi>Clarimond</hi> having beſtow'd an hour in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring
to deliver him out his Extravagancy, return'd home, where he found
<hi>Hircan,</hi> who kept his mother company. Having broke faſt together, they took
horſe, and went to viſit <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>Anſelme,</hi> and to acquaint them with the
ſtrange adventure of the Shepherd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:43725:83"/>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> in the mean time, who had been gone to bring the flock abroad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
his Shepherd-apprentiſhip, and deſirous to ſee his Maſter, drew towards the
place, where he had left him. He was not a little amaz'd to finde him in a Willow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree;
and having ask'd him what he did there, the Shepherd replies, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the propoſitions of Metamorphoſes that had been made before, the
Gods had chang'd him into a tree. O Maſter! ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> you miſtake your
ſelf, your face is as fair as ever it was. Do but come out, and you will finde you
are ſtill a man. Behold, there's your hat among the bows. I'll bring it down with
my ſheephook: will you not have it on your head? you'll catch cold elſe. Alas!
that which thou takeſt for a mans head, is the great end of my <hi>Boal.</hi> It is not the
cuſtom to cover it, neither with hat nor night-cap, for it would hinder it to grow:
I muſt henceforth be always in the ayr. Why do you believe you have no head,
replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> do I not ſee your hair, which is frizzled like the wool of one
of our ſheep? Thou art deceiv'd friend, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> 'tis not <hi>hair</hi> but <hi>moſs.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this <hi>reſuerie,</hi> which <hi>Carmelin</hi> could not comprehend, he beat down
the hat, and made a ſhift to put it on his Maſters head. But <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſhrug'd himſelf
ſo, that it fell down. You are very obſtinate, ſays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> why will you not
put on your hat, though you are become a Tree? you have your doublet and
breeches on, I ſuppoſe. Alas! friend, anſwers <hi>Lyſis,</hi> if I had had my hat on when
I was Metamorphos'd, I ſhould have had it ſtill, nor would I deſire it ſhould be
taken from me but I had it not; ſo that now it is not fit I ſhould wear any. My
meaning is you ſhould put it on now, becauſe you are ſtill a man, as well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
as any between this place and <hi>Paris,</hi> replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and I give it you not
as you are tree; for if you were really one, neither ſhould you have any need of
cloathes; and to prove that you are ſtill the ſame <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I ſhall bring you no other
reaſon, then that you are ſtill clad like a Shepherd, and that if you were a tree, you
ought to to be ſtript of all your cloathes. Wo is me! how abſurd thy reaſons are,
ſays <hi>Lyſis.</hi> I ſee well thou ſpeakeſt for thy own advantage: Thou wouldſt fain take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
my Shepherds habit, that thou mightſt go and ſel it in the Brokery at <hi>Paris,</hi> and
advance thy ſelf by what thou ſpoileſt me of; but aſſure thy ſelf, thou ſhalt never
have it. It's become part of my ſelf, and it is now nothing but a thick bark, which
is upon my skin; which being a more tender one, is covered with this, as thou
mayeſt ordinarily obſerve in trees. Upon ſuch skins the ancients wrote, before the
invention of paper: Yet I do not tell thee this, to the end thou ſhouldſt come
and disbark me for to write Letters to thy Miſtreſs. I am a ſacred <hi>Tree,</hi> which may
not be touch'd, but by the <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Charite,</hi> and it is principally to the ſervice of
that fair one, that I am devoted. She may come and grave her characters upon
my trunk: I will ſuffer it without groaning. I underſtand not all this, replies <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin:</hi>
though you your ſelf ſhould be changed, I ſhall never believe that your
cloathes are ſo too; for what have they to do with your <hi>Loves?</hi> have they receiv'd
ill entertainment from ſome Shepherdeſs? Thou underſtandeſt not the Divine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> if thou hadſt, read <hi>Ovid,</hi> who is the moſt famous <hi>Divine</hi> among
the <hi>Poets,</hi> thou mightſt have learn'd, that the <hi>cloathes</hi> are ever Metamorphos'd, as
well as the <hi>body:</hi> and when he ſpeaks of a man changed into a <hi>Flower,</hi> a <hi>Spring,</hi> or
a <hi>Bird,</hi> he doth not ſay he was ſtrip'd beforehand. Nay, when <hi>Atlas</hi> was chang'd
into a Mountain, his long gown, that had many folds, made many deſcents and
ſtony eminences therein. Read good Authors, and thou wilt importune me leſs with
thy fooliſh demands. I am almoſt perſwaded of all this; but that which troubles
me moſt, and indeed makes me ſpeak ſo much, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> is, that I muſt now
quit all the hopes I had of you. I ſhall not enjoy thoſe pleaſures with you, which
you promiſed me I ſhould. That's it will make me grieve a good while.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Carmelin</hi> made many complaints, which were very natural; for his wit
lay in ſuch a way, that it might ſeem he came into the world to no other end, but
to make others laugh; and abating ten or a dozen ſentences out of Common-places,
which he had learned as a bird in cage, he knew nothing but a kinde of ruſtick ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility,
wherein he was ſharp enough. He ſpoke enough to have moved his Maſter,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43725:83"/>
but Love had ſo diſturb'd his brains, that he could not approve any thing, but his
own imaginations. Two or three hours ſlipt away in their entertainment; and at
length there comes <hi>Anſelme, Montenor</hi> and <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who had made haſte to dine,
for to come and ſee <hi>Lyſis.</hi> As for <hi>Hircan,</hi> he had been entreated to go home, leſt
his preſence might be a torment to that poor Shepherd. They began to remonſtrate
to him, that it was worſe then to be hypo condriack, for him to imagine as he did,
himſelf changed into a tree, when he was as much a man as any of them. When
they ſaw he perſiſted in his opinion, they bid the Lacquays fetch ſome ſtools, on
which when they were gotten, they endeavoured by force to pull him out of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
ſeeing he would not come out by fair means. That made him cleave faſter to
the boughs then before, and cry out ſo loud, that <hi>Muſedor,</hi> that was ſtill with
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> began to bark at thoſe that drew him. Ah! faithful Dog, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
thou haſt that ſimpathy in thee, that though I am not a man thou knoweſt me. Take
example by him, you that have ſometimes been my friends; have at leaſt as much
compaſſion on me as he. Will you own leſs pitty then a beaſt? Perſecute me no
more.</p>
            <p>After this complaint, he cries out louder then at firſt, and kept himſelf ſtill ſo faſt
to the tree, that they conſidered they ſhould rather pull off his arms, then get him
out of the place, for he was poſſeſſed with ſuch a fury, as made him mighty ſtrong.
His good friends were loath to hurt him, and ſo gave over, to bethink them of
ſome better invention for to get him out of the tree. They ſent for a faggot, and
ſet it a fire near the Willow, as if they intended to burn it. That did nothing, but
make him double his complaints, and cry out as if he already felt the flame, and think
it impoſſible ever to come out. When they perceiv'd that the ſmoak blinded him,
they cauſed the fire to put out; and <hi>Clarimond</hi> having called for a Wood-feller, he
bid him cut down the Willow, ſeeing <hi>Lyſis</hi> would not out. At the firſt blow of
the Ax, the Shepherd gave a ſhreak, that I believe might have been heard three
leagues about; and afterward ſpake thus, Ah! impious fellow, what doſt thou?
I am a tree conſecrated to <hi>Diana.</hi> Iron never did me any violence; I was as pure
a Virgin as my Goddeſs. Fearſt thou not a clap of thunder will conſume thee?
Let live a poor Shepherd under this bark, he doth thee no hurt here.</p>
            <p>Upon that, <hi>Clarimond</hi> bethought him to ask him, What Shepherd! have you
forgotten what you ſaid to me erewhiles? you affirmed to me, that the bark was
aſcending over your mouth, and that you ſhould ſpeak no more, and now we ſee
the quite contrary. If you are a Tree, you ſhould not ſpeak; the other Trees
hereabouts ſay nothing at all. Doſt not thou alſo perceive that I am an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Tree? replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I am not like my neighbours; I am a Prophet, like thoſe
Trees in <hi>Dodona's Grove;</hi> and that is the reaſon the Gods have continued me the
uſe of my voyce: Ask me any thing, I ſhall make thee a pertinent anſwer. This
place ſhall henceforth be more frequented then the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and I ſhall
be an Oracle to all the world. For my part, I ſhall ask you but one thing Maſter,
ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> for any thing elſe I ſhall never trouble your faculty of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Since you know what's to come, tell me how long you will yet continue
Mr. <hi>Tree.</hi> I believe all the company is as deſirous to know it as I: I ſhall be a Tree
as long as it pleaſe the Gods, anſwers <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and if thou think I do not ſatisfie thee
fully, take this particular ſecret, that all thoſe whoſe buſineſs it is to foretell things,
know all things, but what ſhall happen to themſelves; and this ought not to ſeem
ſtrange, for <hi>Fate</hi> hath ſo ordain'd it, that it might have a Prerogative over men
for to abate the Preſumption, which otherwiſe were likely to poſſeſſe their
mindes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſeeing <hi>Lyſis</hi> perſiſted ſtill in his Errour, was much trouble; for he had
rather have ſeen him in his frolick humours, that he might have brought him back
to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s <hi>Leonora</hi> was a woman ſo reſerv'd, that he could not ſpeak with her
when ever he deſired, nor yet with her daughter. The Extravagancies of <hi>Lyſis</hi> which
were ſome recreation to thoſe Ladies, had been very ſerviceable to him, and had
procur'd him many entertainments: So that he did his utmoſt to perſwade him to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43725:84"/>
live as he had done before: What will you do within this tree, ſays he to him?
who'll come ſo far to bring you any thing to eat? Do you think I'll take the pains?
Alas! Trees eat not, replyes <hi>Lyſis;</hi> on the contrary, they give much food to men:
Prethee trouble not thy ſelf any further about that. When thou thinkſt to oblige
me, thou doſt the contrary. I have been angry enough with thee, for telling me
this Country was <hi>Forreſts;</hi> but now I pardon it, and I believe all hath been done
by an expreſs fatality. All theſe words will not fill your belly, ſaies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> do
you hope to live by ayr, and ſuck in the mind that paſſes by? I do not think you
have eaten any thing theſe two days; for yeſterday you took only a piece of bread
in your ſcrip, which was no more then would have ſufficed your Dog. Away,
away, tell me not on't: An empty Belly, and a hollow Brain-pan go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>All wondred at what <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſaid; and <hi>Clarimond</hi> pittying the Shepherd, who
had faſted ſo long, ſent home for ſome meat for him. His Mother, who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
charitable, and had heard talk of <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s madneſs, came thither her ſelf
for to make him eat; but all her Remonſtrances were to no purpoſe. 'Twas plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to hear the reaſons which the Shepherd brought her to prove he was a Tree.
<hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> could not but laugh at it, which ſo troubled the good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that ſhe was forc'd to tell them that it was more Chriſtian-like to pitty a poor
man, then to laugh at him. For to appeaſe her a little, they alſo endeavored to
make <hi>Lyſis</hi> eat; and coming at laſt to foul means, ſeeing they could do nothing by
fair, they caus'd his teeth to be opened with a ſtick, and thruſt in a little meat into
his mouth, but he preſently ſpat it in their faces. <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who was a piercing
wit, ſays thereupon to him, Mr. <hi>Willow,</hi> if you cannot eat, will you not drink ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what?
I have brought along with me an excellent drink, it is as good as Nectar of
the firſt preſſure. Trees neither eat nor drink I tell you, replyes <hi>Lyſis:</hi> ſhall I never
perſwade you to't? How are you now miſtaken, replyes? <hi>Clarimond;</hi> how could
the Plants grow, if they were not water'd? I'll give you leave to water me, ſayes
the <hi>Willow,</hi> but it muſt be at my root; and beſides, you muſt only make uſe of clear
water. Wine will do better, replyes <hi>Clarimond,</hi> it's a ſecret that all Gardeners
know not; nay, I will caſt it above, and it ſhall moiſten you ſo much the more:
Know you not, that the rain falls ſtraight down on the tops of the trees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> having ſaid ſo, would improve the occaſion, believing he had already
prevail'd with <hi>Lyſis</hi> to drink: He got upon a ſtool, and put into his mouth a tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
he had ſent for; which done, <hi>Champagne</hi> pours into it at leaſt three pintes of
wine. The <hi>Willow</hi> was very well content to ſwallow it; and ſaid to <hi>Clarimond,</hi> I
muſt needs confeſs, dear friend, that thou knoweſt well how to order Plants. My
pith is all moiſten'd by this liquor thou haſt given me; and my ſap, which is the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
moyſture of trees, is made much more vigorous thereby. I told you ſo, anſwers
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> I will now give you a taſte of another brevidge, that is more nutritive.
Having ſaid ſo, he ſoftly ſpoke to <hi>Champagne</hi> to go and ſee if there were not ſome
good broth at his houſe ready. The Lacquay returns preſently with ſome Pompion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pottage,
that had been made for the Plough-men. They gave him that alſo through
the tunnel; and when ever the bread that had been crum'd in it would not paſs
through, they forc'd it down with a little ſtick, as if they had been charging a piece
of Ordnance. The <hi>Willow</hi> receiv'd all very quietly; for though he believ'd that
trees ſhould not eat, yet his belly told him the contrary; and as it was not much
acceſſary to his follies, ſo was it well pleas'd it had gotten ſomewhat to feed on:
When all was done, and that the tunnel was taken from his mouth, he breath'd three
or four times, as not being able to have contained any longer, the paſſage of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
having been ſo long ſtop'd. At length, ſayes he to <hi>Clarimond,</hi> this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
watering is not ſo liquid as the firſt, and yet I muſt confeſs it is not the worſe
for it. Now you are furniſh'd till to morrow, ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> but I beg it of the
Gods, that you may ſhortly live after another maner among men.</p>
            <p>Having ſo ſaid, he conſidered, that to prevail any thing with <hi>Lyſis,</hi> all muſt be
done by fair means and artifice as he had done, and that he might not be diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43725:84"/>
any further, his advice was, that all ſhould retire. They all ſupp'd at his houſe,
and in the mean time <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who had been left alone with his Maſter, ſeeing
the night come on, ask'd him whether he would come away and lodge in ſome houſe,
ſince that the night before he had not reſted much, had lien in the fields. And
where haſt thou ever ſeen beds made ready for trees? anſwers the <hi>Shepherd-Willow.</hi>
It would be a fine ſight to ſee me a-bed between two ſheets with my earthly roots,
my back cover'd over with moſs, and my leafy branches. But if I ſhould have a
minde to lie down, thinkſt thou I could do it? Muſt I not always ſtand upright?
Seeing you would have me imagine that you are a tree, I am content it ſhould be
ſo, replyes <hi>Carmelin;</hi> but tell me, why did you not order your change ſo, as that
you might have been ſome more delightful, and more uſeful tree then you now are?
you are of thoſe wretched Willow trees, which are good for nothing but to binde
Hoops about with, and make Baskets of. It had been much better to have been ſome
good Pear-tree: When you had been cut down, men would have made of your
wood ſtately chairs, whereon Kings and Preſidents would have ſate; and you might
have born good Pears, which I would have carried to your Miſtreſs. Thou doſt
but thread impertinences together, <hi>Carmelin,</hi> replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> for beſides that thou
corrupteſt my name, thou doſt moſt unworthily deſpiſe me, by ſaying I ſhould be
good for nothing; for that is my happineſs; and though my wood were the faireſt
in the world, yet ought it not to be cut, becauſe it were no other then the maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my limbs, and the committing of a ſignal murther: Whoever ſhall touch
me, deſerves a halter, as much as if he had maſſacred the true Shepherd <hi>Lyſis.</hi> As
for the fruit thou wouldſt have me bear, whereof <hi>Charite</hi> ſhould eat, it's an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of thy little wit; for if that fair one hate me, ſhe will not eat any thing
comes from me, beſides that I ſhould have the misfortune to be taſted by others
as well as ſhe, which would be a great diſcontent to me. Seeſt thou, <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
all the good I hope is, that my Shepherdeſs may come one day into this place
with her companions, and that they will dance about me a poor and deſolate
willow, and ſing every one a ſong. I ſhall anſwer them firſt by the ſhaking
of my leaves, then I will bow down my boughs to the ground in reverence of
<hi>Charite;</hi> and laſtly, I will make ſuch a ſad complaint to her, that ſhe ſhall be
moved with compaſſion. Do you believe ſhe'll take you for a tree? ſays
<hi>Carmelin:</hi> for I aſſure you, the Gentlemen who are newly gone hence, and are
your very good friends, laugh in good earneſt at it, and you have perceiv'd it your

Get thee gone, or hold thy peace, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> For I will bend one of my biggeſt
boughs, and diſcharge it over thy ſhoulders ſo effectually, that I ſhall ſend thee into

rare things of them? If it hath been ſeen heretofore that men have been changed
into Trees, why may it not happen now as well? Are there none but the Authors
of old, that have ſeen and mention'd ſuch things? Let men read th' <hi>Endymion,</hi> a

and approved by all the world: When any ſhall ſpeak of me, confute them with
that authority.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Willow</hi> was in this diſcourſe, the heavens began to be dark of all ſides,
both becauſe the Sun was paſs'd into the other hemiſphere, and by reaſon a many
clouds gathered together from all parts. <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſeeing that, bid his maſter good
night, that he might lodge the Flock. <hi>Muſidore</hi> follow'd him wittingly; for he was
ſuch a friendly Cur, that he was for him that gave him moſt; and ſince <hi>Lyſis</hi> had
not given him any bread, he ſtuck to his ſervant who provided for him. The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43725:85"/>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> was no ſooner come to his lodging, but it rain'd very heavily, ſo that
he was ſore troubled for his maſter. Yet could he not pitty him, when he conſidered
that no hurt happen'd to him, whereof he was not himſelf the cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Tree wherein <hi>Lyſis</hi> was, had the boughs ſo ſcattered, that it gave him not
the leaſt ſhelter. The water that quickly got through his thin cloaths, was ſoon felt,
though he imagin'd himſelf within a Bark. No mad imagination could divert him
now; but he muſt quit the boughs whereto he had been faſtened all the time, and
ſhrunk himſelf down as low as he could poſſibly. In the midſt of his hypocondriack
imaginations he ſaid in himſelf, That indeed a watering like that in the afternoon
was not to be refus'd; but that as for this he had receiv'd then, he was not pleas'd
with it, exceſs being ever hurtfull. He was afraid his wood might rot away, if it
rain'd long in that manner; and he thought it but reaſon that ſuch fair Trees as he
ſhould not be left deſolate in the fields; and that if they could not be tranſplanted
into houſes during foul weather, 'twere fit there were certain Cales made them.
This brought him into a little indignation, that he was not a Tree in the Garden of
ſome great Prince, who cover'd his Grove with ſlate, with glaſs-windows in it.
That ſeem'd a very good way to him, for the convenience of ſuch Trees as himſelf.
But the ill luck was, he was bare-headed; and though his mind was much perplex'd,
yet he could not but think of his Hat, which <hi>Carmelin</hi> had carried away with him,
ſeeing he would not put it on. It had done him a courteſie then. At length the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
having pitty on this poor Fool, left off pouring water on his head: The clouds
were diſpers'd, and he had leiſure enough to dry his cloaths by his own natural hear.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Montenor, Anſelme,</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> having ſent for <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
learn'd of him how he had left his Maſter, and where he was; and reſolved not to
trouble him, to ſee what would come of it, and whether he might have the patience
to be there all night. They lay that night in the Caſtle where they were: but as for
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> he would needs go home to his Hoſt. The good man wondring to ſee
him return without <hi>Lyſis,</hi> as he had done the night before, ask'd him where he was.
He told him he was chang'd into a Tree, or that he imagin'd he was ſo: whereat he
was wonderfully aſtoniſhed. He enquired of him further, out of what deſign they
kept ſheep. <hi>Carmelin</hi> anſwered, There was no hurt in that; but that if the queſtion
were asked his maſter, he would give a better account of it then he could. <hi>Bertrand</hi>
receiving no better ſatisfaction, he and his family went quietly to bed, and the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
apprentiſe did the like.</p>
            <p>About three hours after, it being very fair weather, the Moon began to ſhine
very bright; and <hi>Lyſis</hi> looking on her, ſaluted her in theſe words: Thou art wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
fair <hi>Diana</hi> with the ſilver-forehead; whither runn'ſt thou ſo faſt? Art thou
prick'd forward by ſome new Love? Methinks in this ſilence I hear from this place
the ſmack of the whip wherewith thou doſt ſo ſprightfully drive thy horſes; thou
wouldſt in a manner make them go poſt. Stay a little for to behold the fortune
which is befallen to a poor Shepherd.</p>
            <p>As the Shepherd ended theſe words, he ſaw three <hi>Nymphs</hi> come out from between
the trees of a Thicket hard by; and if they were not ſuch, he at leaſt thought them
ſuch. The firſt was cloathed in a mantle of Canvas ſilver'd over, and the two other
with white Fuſtian. While they came ſtill neerer and neerer him, Fair <hi>Hamadryads!</hi>
ſays the moſt viſible amongſt them, do me one favour; tell me one thing I deſire
much to be aſſured of: Is it true, that the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis</hi> was yeſterday metam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orphoſed
into a Tree? There's nothing more certain, replies one of them; and we
are infinitely happy to have him our brother: He was the Phenix of all Lovers, the
glory of his age, and the object of the vows of all Shepherdeſſes.</p>
            <p>The ſolitude of the place, the words of the Nymphs, and the gliſtering of their
cloaths in the moon-ſhine, raviſh'd the Shepherd into admiration; his eyes were as
much charm'd as his ears. What addition to his extaſie was it to hear the ſhining
Nymph continue thus: Can I by no means know in what place remains this happy
Tree, which encreaſes the number of thoſe of this Country? We are juſt at it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
the other: Do you not perceive that Willow, which I do not remember I
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43725:85"/>
ever ſaw before in that place? ſhall we go thither? <hi>Synopa,</hi> we will ſpeak to our
Brother, and know how he does: And he'll tell us how he findes himſelf, ſince he
hath chang'd his nature. 'Tis a noble curioſity, replies the firſt Nymph: let us go,
it may be he will be diſpleas'd to ſee me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having heard <hi>Synopa</hi> nam'd, was much amaz'd, and by her ſpeech he knew
ſhe was the <hi>Nayad</hi> of the Magician <hi>Hircan.</hi> The <hi>Nymphs</hi> by this time being come
near him, one of the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> ſaid to him, Alas! dear Brother, what do you
there all alone? will you not enjoy the pleaſure of the ſeaſon? Come out thence,
and recreate your ſelf with us. What ever you are fair <hi>Nymphs,</hi> anſwers the
<hi>Shepherd Willow,</hi> pardon me, if I cannot go with you; for my Deſtiny hath ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of me, that I cannot come hence. You are miſtaken, replyes the <hi>Hamadryad,</hi> I
have been a Shepherdeſs as well as you have been a Shepherd, and I am now me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphos'd
into a Tree as you are, but I keep within my bark but only the day.
We muſt recreate out ſelves in the night. I'll never believe that, if you bring me not
an authority for it. That you ſhall have enough, ſaies <hi>Synopa,</hi> have you not obſerv'd
in the Ode, that <hi>Philip Deſportes</hi> hath made of a Country life, that when the Sun
gives place to the Moon, the Nymphs meet together in the Woods, and dance and
jig it, and get green gowns? 'Tis a <hi>Poet</hi> of reputation, will you not believe him? I
do believe him, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> but he ſpeaks only of <hi>Nymphs,</hi> he doth not mention
<hi>Demi-Gods.</hi> They are underſtood, ſaies <hi>Synopa;</hi> for would you have us dance alone?
we muſt needs have ſome males among us. If we have not you, and ſuch as you are,
we muſt be forc'd to take in the <hi>Satyrs</hi> into our company. And what would you
do there; grow wilde again? 'Tis true, in the day time you dare not venture out,
leſt your Divinity might be ſeen of men; but in the night, that all the worlds aſleep,
you muſt take your time to be merry, and tread the graſs and your cares under your
feet. There are thickets hereabouts, where there are always <hi>Dryads,</hi> and <hi>Hamadryads,
Nayads</hi> and <hi>Napeans,</hi> 'tis thither you muſt go along with us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> hearing this, believ'd all the Nymph ſaid was true; and as there is nothing
ſooner brings fools to ſee reaſon, then ſuffering; the inconvenience he found to be
ſo long in the hollow of a tree, perſwaded him it would not be amiſs to go out for
a while. He was fain to put his whole ſtrength to winde himſelf up, and at length
he delivered himſelf out of captivity, and leap'd down. My dear Siſters, quoth he
to the Nymphs, if I ſin, the Gods pardon me, for your perſwaſions are the cauſe
of my offence. Fear nothing, ſaies <hi>Synopa</hi> to him, aſſure your ſelf, you'll finde
nothing but what ſhall pleaſe you among us. But Siſters, ſaies ſhe to the others,
ſhall we go and ſeek out ſome private retreats, where we may not fear the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes
of the <hi>Satyrs.</hi> I do not know any hereabouts, replies the <hi>Hamadryad,</hi> and we
have <hi>Lyſis</hi> for our Protector. Let's go couragiouſly to a little Meadow hard by;
having ſaid ſo, they three went on apace, and left <hi>Lyſis</hi> to follow, which he did
with much ado, for his legs were grown ſo ſtiff, having been ſo long lockt up, that
when they were come to the Meadow, he ſate him down on the graſs, and the
Nymphs about him. While he was yet giving his thanks to <hi>Synopa,</hi> that ſhe had
remembred him, he hears a certain harmony, that made him prick up his ears, as a
Cat that hears a Mouſe cry: It was a Lute, very unhandſomely ſet to the violin;
but a little after the violin ceas'd and there was only heard the Lute and a Voyce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
which made very excellent muſick. The Aire was one that had been made
in a Mask, preſented lately to the King by certain <hi>Nayads. Lyſis</hi> hearing it, had
the curioſity to enquire who the Muſician was: You ſhall ſee, it is the God of the
River <hi>Morin,</hi> ſaies <hi>Synopa</hi> to him; it muſt needs be he that plays on the Lute, for
he plays excellently well on it. As for her that ſings, it is a Nymph of a Fountain
hard by, called <hi>Lucida;</hi> and for him that plays on the Violin, it is a <hi>Forreſt-Demi-god,</hi>
who of a Shepherd was, as you are, chang'd into a tree. We ſhall have good
company to night, I warrant you, and good ſport withal.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Synopa</hi> ended theſe words, the three perſons ſhe ſpake of came, and made
it appear ſhe was not miſtaken. The God <hi>Morin</hi> had a Beard to his Girdle, and
Hair hanging down over his Shoulders, with a Crown of Reeds on his Head. He
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43725:86"/>
had on a Waſtecoat and Breeches like a Seaman, of white Canvas; as thoſe Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
at <hi>Paris</hi> who catch Eels, on their greateſt Feaſt-day. As for him that
plaid on the Violin, he had on a gray Suit, like a Countrey man; and the Nymph
of the Fountain <hi>Lucida,</hi> was in ſilver'd Canvas like <hi>Synopa.</hi> Theſe two <hi>Nayads</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
and kiſt one the other when they met; which done, <hi>Synopa</hi> turning to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
Father, ſaies ſhe, behold, here's a time invites us to dance, it is ſo clear and
calm. 'Tis true, it rain'd a little a while ſince; but as for us Divinities of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
it hurts us not; our channels are fill'd by that means. The God of the River
falls preſently a ſnoring like a Swine; whereat <hi>Lyſis</hi> wondring, pulls <hi>Synopa</hi> by the
fleeve, and ask'd her what language the Gods ſpoke. 'Tis the language of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
replies <hi>Synopa,</hi> there can none underſtand him but the <hi>Fiſh</hi> and the <hi>Nayads:</hi>
'Tis great pitty, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that a God of his age hath not learned to ſpeak <hi>French,</hi>
What do you wonder at, replies <hi>Synopa,</hi> he muſt ſubmit to his deſtiny. There are
alſo other Gods, who partaking of the diſpoſition of their hoſts, are as mute as
Carps: But this doth not commonly make much noiſe, becauſe he would imitate
his own waters, which run ſlowly, and ſeem as if they were aſleep, like thoſe of
the Lakes: but this hinders not but that he can play excellently well on any muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
inſtruments, and dance.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Nymph</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld this diſcourſe, the God of the River very ſeriouſly view'd
the <hi>Hamadryads,</hi> as if he had never ſeen them before: So that <hi>Synopa</hi> went of a
ſudden, and ſaid to him, What do you dream on Father, that you do not ſee a new
<hi>Demi-god</hi> that's here among us? Here is he that ſometimes was the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis:</hi>
he was the glory of your Banks: he is now a <hi>Willow,</hi> and you ought to love him on
that account, ſeeing there are no other trees on your Banks. The God of the River
made a ſign with his head, and went and embrac'd <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but he gave him ſuch a
hug, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> cryed out, O dumb God! ſays he, doſt thou expreſs by thy arms
that which thou canſt not with thy tongue? let me go, I ſhall burſt elſe, thou cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
my wood; wilt thou make it as ſmall as ſaw-duſt? In ſaying ſo, he gave ſuch a
jerk, that he got out of the hands of the God; and went and told <hi>Synopa,</hi> that he
had rather loſe the friendſhip of all the world, then meet with many ſuch Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But when <hi>Synopa</hi> had told him that the rudeneſs of that God was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
as to his embraces, and that in other things he was very good company, he
was appeas'd; and the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> having made the motion of paſſing the time in
dancing, he was ready to make one. The whole company making a round, the
Nymph <hi>Lucida</hi> ſung a Song, and afterwards the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> did every one the like.
When it came to <hi>Synopa,</hi> ſhe ſung a kiſſing Song; and being near <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſays to
him;
<q>
                  <l>Gentle <hi>Willow</hi> come and dance,</l>
                  <l>And with arms akembo prance;</l>
                  <l>Take her whoſe beauty you muſt prize,</l>
                  <l>And freely kiſs her eyes</l>
                  <l>In whoſe ſweet face moſt Beauty lies.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He goes in among them, and looking very big about him; It matters not, ſaith he,
where I kiſs her I ſhall chooſe; the Poet that made that Song, hath not ſaid <hi>eyes,</hi> but
for rhime ſake. After this he goes and addreſſes his Complements to an <hi>Hamadryad,</hi>
and kiſt her with a good will: And you are to note, that he did it with an amorous
ſubtilty, that ſeem'd to him very excellent. He ſhut his eyes in the action, ſo to
deceive himſelf, and imagine that he kiſt <hi>Charite:</hi> But he found himſelf deceiv'd
more then he thought, for that Nymph was of ſuch a rough fleſh, that ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
grated the skin off his lips, whereas in his opinion, his Miſtreſs was of more
tender complexion. Being come to his own place again, he whiſpers to <hi>Synopa,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I will not kiſs any more theſe <hi>Hamadryads,</hi> there's no pleaſure in it. It is ſoon
diſcover'd they are wooden <hi>Nymphs,</hi> their skin is as rough as the bark of a
tree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:43725:86"/>
               <hi>Synopa</hi> ſmil'd to hear him; and when ſhe had ſung in her turn, ſhe went and gave
him a kiſs which pleas'd him better: Ha! ſaies he to himſelf, how ſoft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
are theſe Nymphs of the waters, in compariſon of thoſe rugged <hi>Hamadryads.</hi>
I muſt avow, that this laſt kiſs hath taken away the hurt, which I had received by
the other. He thought there was a great deal of pleaſure to ſport it ſo innocently;
and yet he wondred how it came to paſs, that <hi>Nymphs</hi> of reputation, and <hi>Hama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dryads</hi>
ſo ſtately and gallant, amus'd themſelves to ſing ſuch Songs as Country-Chamber-maids
do. There was but the Muſician <hi>Lucida</hi> who ſang another kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Song, which was very well compos'd, and pleaſed him much. Being deſirous
to taſte of all ſorts of meat, he went and kiſt the Nymph that ſang, and was more
ſatisfied, then with <hi>Synopa;</hi> becauſe it ſeem'd to him, that ſhe was yet of a ſofter
complexion, and handſomer. This rais'd him into ſo good an humour, that he
would have been content to do nothing elſe all his life. But one of the <hi>Hamadryads</hi>
preſently began another Song which was very ridiculous, and wherein they made
him dance ſo much, that he was quite tyred. <hi>Morin,</hi> becauſe he ſang not, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
thereof caper it in very ſtrange poſtures.</p>
            <p>At length every one being weary, they all lay down on the graſs; where <hi>Lyſis</hi>
having taken breath a while, addreſſed himſelf to all the company in theſe words.
Ye great <hi>Divinities</hi> of this Country, ſince that <hi>Fate</hi> hath decreed my abode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, I ſhould wiſh the honour of your more particular acquaintance, to the
end that when ever I ſhall ſee you, I may not ſo far forget my ſelf, as not to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you the civilities which are due unto you. Therefore now that we have the
leaſure, tell me, if ſometime you have not been ſomething different from what you
are now; and what hath been the occaſion of your <hi>Metamorphoſes. Divine Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
ſaies <hi>Synopa,</hi> your demand is ſo juſt, that here is not any preſent, that would
not be willing to give you ſatisfaction. The God <hi>Morin</hi> himſelf would have been
glad, if he could have diſtinctly ſpoken, that you might have had the Hiſtory of
his fortunes from his own mouth. He is known by the ſhaking of his head, and
the noiſe that comes out of his throat, whereby he ſignifies his conſent to any
thing. Becauſe he cannot, I ſhall tell you what you deſire to know of him.</p>

River of Marne.</head>
                        <p>IT was a long time before <hi>Pharamond</hi> became King of <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>Brie</hi>
had a King, the number of whoſe vertues was equal of that of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
His name was <hi>Briſefer,</hi> and his Son was called <hi>Morin,</hi> who is this
honeſt <hi>God</hi> whom you ſee. Now there paſt through this Countrey the
little Neece of a <hi>Fairy,</hi> who at her birth had had two gifts; that of
<hi>Beauty,</hi> and that of <hi>Metamorphoſes.</hi> If ſhe had a deſign to bewitch a man, ſhe
had no more to do but to ſhew him her natural countenance; which when ſhe
had done, ſhe put on what form ſhe pleas'd, as if her body had been made of
ſoft clay: She wandred about the world purchaſing of hearts; and all ſhe got
by her amorous looks, ſhe put them into a great Apron made like a Purſe, that
ſhe had about her. <hi>Morin</hi> had no ſooner ſeen <hi>Marne</hi> (ſo was the Nymph cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
but ſhe drew from him thoſe ſighs that would have been able to make a ſhip
ſail; and in teſtimony of his love, he made a deed of gift of his heart to her,
in the preſence of the Notaries of <hi>Cupids</hi> Kingdom. She faſtned this great heart
of his to a part of her Girdle, and made it afterward her Pin-cuſhion, which was
a great torment to him; for ſhe would be ever and anon thruſting of pins into
it. Yet her new Lover would have taken this Martyrdom as ſupportable, had
ſhe but accepted his ſervices. But as he ſpoke to her of it, being one day ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by her, ſhe made no more account of him, nor indeed was he any more in
compariſon of her, then the ſheath of a knife hanging by her ſide: For you
are to know, that ſhe was of a Gyant ſtature; however, ſhe was not eſteemed
the leſs for that, becauſe if a thing be good, and fair, and pleaſant, it is ſo much
the better if it be great; and there is no man ſo fooliſh, but he had rather have
a great Capon then a little one: So you are to believe, that if ſhe had great
cheeks, and great breaſts, ſhe had by ſo much the more <hi>Lilies, Roſes,</hi> and <hi>Pinks;</hi>
and if her eyes were as large as Bucklers, they were ſo much the more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for her Lovers to behold themſelves in. There was no calumny could obſcure
her glory, there was no default could be objected againſt her but her cruelty. The
truth is, ſhe was ſomewhat touch'd with that vice; and as ſhe never boild her
Kettle, but with the fire of the affections ſhe had enflamed; ſo did ſhe never
waſh her hands, but in the tears of her Lovers. You might ſee every morning
her Chamber-maid ſtanding at her door, holding a great Tray, whereinto thoſe
poor wretches went and pour'd their tears, that there might not be want of that
water, and ſometimes the cruel one went and held her own murthering hands
under. <hi>Morin</hi> was one of the firſt that paid her this duty, yet ſhe regarded him
no more then the laſt years ſnow. He therefore reſolved to get that by force,
which he could not by fair means; and being powerful in his fathers Kingdom, he
got a great number of Souldiers about <hi>Marn's</hi> houſe, who made ſo many works
and paliſadoes about it, that it was thought ſhe could not get away without his
leave. He enters into the <hi>Nymphs</hi> Court, where ſhe was walking all alone; but
when he thought to embrace her, he was much amaz'd that ſhe vaniſh'd away. He
ſearch'd for her all about, and could finde nothing but a ſpacious Quadrangle,
which to his obſervation had ever before been cover'd with dry earth, but now
was carpeted with <hi>graſs.</hi> That gave him occaſion to imagine it was the fair <hi>Marn</hi>
had been ſo Metamorphos'd; and being deſirous to enjoy her any way, he went
into the houſe to look for a ſickle to cut that graſs. Being return'd with one in
his hand, he findes the place dry as before, and found nothing in the Court but
a <hi>Sheep.</hi> Wo is me! ſaies he, is't this ſheep that hath eaten up my graſs? how proud
ſhe is to have my Miſtreſs in its belly! ſhould I adore or puniſh it? But before
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43725:87"/>
I reſolve, I'll go and ſee my ſouldiers. He had no ſooner turn'd his back, but he
bethought him that it were a ſin to pardon the ſheep. But turning himſelf back,
he ſaw a <hi>Wolf</hi> in ſtead of it, whereat he was extreamly vex'd, believing that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had devoured the other. Now it was nothing but <hi>Marne,</hi> who to avoid the
dangers wherewith he threatned her, chang'd herſelf from graſs to a ſheep, and
from a ſheep to a wolf. At laſt he ſuſpected ſome ſuch thing; but deſirous ſtill
to enjoy her, he endeavoured to ſurpriſe the beaſt, offering it a peece of fleſh,
and prevail'd ſo far, that he put a chain about her neck, and ty'd hen up in the
ſtable. He by this time thought himſelf ſure of what he deſired, and that he
ſhould now enjoy his Miſtreſs whether ſhe would or no. But the whole edifice
immediately took fire, and was all burnt in an inſtant. It was to no purpoſe to
caſt water on, the flame was never the more quench'd, nay it laſted after all the
combuſtible matter was ſpent, nor was there any more Wolf to be ſeen.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Morin</hi> ſeeing this, could not bethink him of any better invention then to put
on a Caſſock of Stone-allum, which had been a Prieſts in the time of his anceſtors,
wherein he was able to endure in the midſt of the flames without being burned,
that ſo he might embrace his Miſtreſs: But as he was going to accompliſh his
deſign, he could ſee nothing but a great River. Wretch that I am! ſays he, this
water hath quench'd my amiable fire. And thereupon caſts himſelf headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it: but finding no ſatisfaction that way, and being in danger to be drown'd
becauſe he could not ſwim well, he came out preſently, and contented himſelf to
take his Lute and play mournful airs upon her banks. The water ran perpetually,
and was diſgorg'd into the <hi>Seine:</hi> For from that time the Gods being offended
with <hi>Marne,</hi> who had diſdain'd ſo faithfull a Lover, ſeeing ſhe was chang'd into
a River, ordained that ſhe ſhould always continue ſo, and there put an end to her
metamorphoſes. <hi>Morin</hi> advertiſed of the decree of the Gods by one of their
Prieſts, was ſo tranſported with diſquiet and deſpair, that he lay down all along
on the ground, and began to diſtill into tears; He wept in ſuch abundance, that
his tears became a little <hi>River.</hi> The Gods having compaſſion on him, made him
ſubject to the ſame decree as his Miſtreſs; ſo that whereas the other Gods of
Rivers have Pitchers under their arms, out of which flows their water, it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to ſee how his iſſues at his eyes. Having ſpent all his moiſture to ſupply his
ſource, he had the liberty to wander in his own channel, which from that time
disburthen'd it ſelf into <hi>Marne,</hi> to the end that if they have been aſunder while
they were in a mortal condition, they might be joyn'd together now that they
are immortal. But the brave <hi>Morin</hi> doth no longer remember his ſorrows paſt;
and ſeeing that <hi>Marne</hi> doth no more reſpect him now then ſhe did before, and
that ſhe is always with the God of the <hi>Seine,</hi> whom ſhe loves better then him,
he takes as much pleaſure to be with us as with her; and if he hath loſt the uſe
of his voice, that loſs is recompenc'd by the melody of his Lute which he hath
kept ſtill.</p>

                        <head>The Fable of the Fountain Synopa.</head>
                        <p>KNow then <hi>Lyſis,</hi> replies <hi>Synopa,</hi> that I am the daughter of a Duke of
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> who promis'd me no meaner a match then a King of
FRANCE; but for all he could do, I would not ſubmit to the
yoke of a marriage, which did not any ways pleaſe me. I was much
enclin'd to hunting, and I was ever in the woods ſometimes, with a Javelin, and
ſometimes with a bow and arrows. <hi>Diana</hi> having heard talk of me, invited me
to be of the quire of her Nymphs; and taking an affection to me, ſhe gave me
one of the chiefeſt places about her perſon, which was to give her Dogs meat.
Having my hand on her Altar, I ſolemnly ſwore, I would obſerve chaſtity as
long as I liv'd, but I have ſince had much ado to keep my ſelf from breaking
this oath: For I was paſſionately courted by an Earl of <hi>Champagne,</hi> who being
come to my fathers Court, gave me ſo many aſſaults, that he was ſometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the very point of ſtorming my honor: he proteſted I had brought him into that
ſlavery, that he ador'd whatever had relation to me; and confeſt himſelf a ſlave
to the fleas of my Greyhounds. He ſuffer'd ſo many torments for my ſake, that
he purpoſely learn'd Arithmetick, that he might give me the number of them;
and playing with me one evening at picquet, he took the counters and reckon'd
them, and the total ſum came to three hundred thouſand, ſix hundred twenty ſix
and a half, not counting the ſmaller ſorrows and cares of leſs conſequence. This
was an excellent invention, and if the Lovers of this age had it, there ſhould be
but a few Miſtreſſes which ſhould be trip'd down, and fall with their faces up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
Yet preſently calling to minde my vow, I continued as firm as a rock, and
brought my Lover to ſuch a deſpair, that he ſwore he would caſt himſelf head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
from ſome mountain, if he ſhould meet with one high enough. His laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
was to writing, and he ſent me ſo many Letters, that he made paper dear
in the Country; and continued his addreſſes, till the Solicitors and Pettifoggers
petitioned againſt him. I made no other thread (ſo little did I regard them) of
all his Miſſives, then to winde up thread on, or to wrap up a piece of wilde Boar
in, if I had a minde to preſent ſome Neighbour or Goſſip, when I was come home
from hunting. <hi>Diana</hi> being advertis'd of his continual applications to me, caus'd
me to be bath'd in a certain fountain of hers, which hath a propriety to make
thoſe that go into it all <hi>Ice,</hi> if they waſh but three times in it: ſo that being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with coldneſs, his ſighs could not enflame me. But to remedy this, he goes
into a certain Temple of <hi>Love,</hi> that was near his own abode: The Prieſts of the
place had in their cuſtody a certain fire, that was ſo powerful, that nothing could
ſtand againſt it. This devout Pilgrim made ſo many prayers to the Divinity of
the place, that at length he merited ſo far, as that he obtained a little beam of
that flame, which he made faſt in a box of <hi>Diamond.</hi> He came to ſee me with
this treaſure, and finding me in a Wood, tired out with hunting, and ſitting on
a pile of faggots, he caſt his fire on me, believing he ſhould warm me in ſpight
of my teeth: And indeed the truth is, the heat was but too violent, for I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
began to melt; and as I was nothing but <hi>ice</hi> before, I was turn'd into <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and water'd all the fields about. The Gods touch'd with my diſaſter, ordain'd,
I ſhould thenceforth be a <hi>Fountain,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> am ſtill. But now that <hi>I</hi> am an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Nymph, <hi>I</hi> am diſpenc'd of that vow <hi>I</hi> had made when <hi>I</hi> was a mortal maid;
and <hi>I</hi> am not oblig'd to chaſtity, any further then <hi>I</hi> will my ſelf: So that the
Magician <hi>Hircan</hi> being in love with me, <hi>I</hi> have ſuffered my ſelf to be overcome
by his charms, and have liv'd with him a certain time fully and honorably. But
having left him to day, and taken my own liberty, <hi>I</hi> may henceforward be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> if ſo be he will conſent thereto: And though my waters are far from
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43725:88"/>
this Countrey, yet <hi>I</hi> will bring them into this place, for to water the root of his
fair tree.</p>

                        <p>SEing you are deſirous to have the relation of my fortune, ſays <hi>Lucida,</hi>
know that I am daughter to a Lord of this Country; and that ſince I
was fifteen years of age, I fell in love with one of his Gentlemen. He was
ſo beautifull, that he had never ſeen his like but in a glaſs: His hair was curled
like a <hi>Holland</hi> Water-Spaniel, and his countenance had as much vermilion as a
Roſe of <hi>Provence.</hi> All he did was with ſuch a grace, that if he playd on the Lute,
I took him for <hi>Apollo</hi> the younger; and if he ſhot with a bow, I took him for
<hi>Cupid</hi> the elder, for his beard was already ſprouted out. His attractions were ſo
powerfull over me, that being one day neer a Table which was very duſty, with
my finger I writ thereon, that <hi>Lucida</hi> was dying for him. But the Gallant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
it not; and having ſworn to me that he could not love me, it was ſuch
an affliction to me, that I ſickned on't and kept my bed. The <hi>Love</hi>-feaver took
me ſo violently, that I did nothing but drink night and day, ſo that my diſeaſe
turn'd to a Dropſie, and I became as big as a Ton. All the Phyſitians in the
Country that viſited me were at a loſs of their Latine; but when they had all
given me over, there was a knowing Chymiſt made me take an excellent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
That made me piſs ſo much, that there iſſued out of my body great
brooks, and then it was that the Gods bethought them to change me into a
<hi>Fountain.</hi> I do ſtill piſs at certain times into the Ciſtern of my ſource, that it may
not dry up; and ſo I ſhall piſs to the end of the world, and yet ſhall never be

            <p>I find no difficulty in this Metamorphoſis, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> for your body continues
in the ſame being as to its form, but not as to its nature, which is become immortal;
and as concerning your Urine, it hath only been chang'd to Fountain-water. But
when I conſider the adventure of <hi>Synopa,</hi> I cannot ſo eaſily underſtand it: For ſhe
ſays, that being all Ice, the fire diſſolved her: If it be ſo, how is it that ſhe hath a
body ſtill? Yet we ſee it is ſo; and the Gods not having diſcover'd the ſecret to her
no more then they let children know what way they have been formed in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
belly, the poor Nymph hath given us no account of it. But I'll explain it to
her. The reaſon is, becauſe the Gods, when they have metamorphos'd a humane
body into a Fountain, diſpoſe the ſoul into another body which is compoſed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatick
vapours. There was never any Poet, nor other that hath commented on any
of them, ever imagin'd this, though they attribute bodies to the Deities of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and this is the reaſon they have left us in ſo much ambiguity. Nor may I be
afraid to boaſt that I am guilty of as learned conſiderations, that if a God came now
down on earth, I ſhould not court him for excellent imaginations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:43725:89"/>
I am very much oblig'd to you for ſo excellent an inſtruction, ſays <hi>Sinopa:</hi> in
recompence whereof, ſeeing you cannot ſee my abode, be pleaſed to ſee <hi>Lucida's.</hi>
That ſhall be when ever you are diſpoſed, replies <hi>Lyſis.</hi> Let's go preſently, ſays
<hi>Lucida,</hi> it's very good being there; I'll ſhew you the way. Having ſaid ſo, they
all riſe up, and having croſs'd certain meadows and thickets, this noble Company
came to a Brook which ran between two vallies. The God of the River, and the
Nymphs having taken up their coats, went into the water, which came up to half
the leg, and <hi>Lyſis</hi> was obliged to do as much: He ſometimes complain'd that he
was forced to go in that manner: but <hi>Lucida,</hi> who led him, excus'd his want of
courage, ſaying that he who was not a God of a Fountain, was not accuſtomed to
walk in the water as they were; and to comfort him, ſhe ever aſſur'd him that it
was not far to her grot.</p>
            <p>At length they came to a high ſtony eminencie, where was the ſource of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
The earth was very hollow in divers places; ſo that <hi>Lucida</hi> eaſily perſwaded
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> that there was her abode. Then ſhe takes up her coats a little higher then
they were before, and piſs'd ſo loud, that he heard it. O fair aquatick Nymph!
cries he out, ſtay your ſelf, I beſeech you; I ſee proofs enough of what you have
told me, it is certain this Brook hath no other recruit but what you piſs; but if you
ſhut not your cock, I ſhall be afraid of a deluge: I pray take heed; for though I
am a Tree, and that I keep above the water, and am not drown'd, yet my timber
would rot in time.</p>
            <p>The God <hi>Morin</hi> hearing this diſcourſe, thought it ſo pleaſant, that he could not
hold himſelf from laughing a little outright: So that <hi>Lyſis</hi> wondring at it, He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
(ſays he) to laugh very decently, there's hope he may in time learn to ſpeak
<hi>French. Lucida</hi> having given over piſſing, anſwered, that ſhe doubted not but
that in time he might be taught all good things; but that for the preſent they muſt
go to a collation in her grot. They all came out of the water; and he that played
on the <hi>Violin,</hi> and the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> went away and ſaid nothing, ſo far that they
were quite out of ſight. <hi>Synopa</hi> ſate next to <hi>Morin,</hi> and <hi>Lucida</hi> next to <hi>Lyſis.</hi>
Theſe two Nymphs did not much weigh the wetting their legs, for it was not cold,
it only made them the more frolick. <hi>Morin</hi> diſcovered a great affection to <hi>Synopa;</hi>
and having felt her breaſt, kiſs'd and embraced her often: And ſometimes he put
himſelf into ſuch wanton poſtures, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> knew not what to ſay of it; however
at laſt he concluded it was the cuſtom of the Gods of the waters, but he would have
gladly known whether it was alſo the cuſtom of the Deities of the thickets. <hi>Lucida</hi>
taking him by the hand, wrung it hard between her own, and ſometimes brought it
to her mouth: but ſuch was his ſhamefac'dneſs, that he durſt do nothing, though
the temptation was very great. It fortunately came into his mind to deſire <hi>Morin</hi>
to play an aire or two on his Lute, to which <hi>Lucida</hi> ſhould ſing; for he would have
gladly entertain'd her, but knew not how to begin.</p>
            <p>It was not long ere the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> and the <hi>Violiſt</hi> return'd with bottles and baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
which ſoon ſilenc'd the muſick; they had brought bread, and great pieces of
Pye-cruſt, and a peece of Gammon of bacon, with good wine, and ſome boxes of
Sweet-meats. <hi>Morin</hi> and <hi>Synopa</hi> having begun to eat, <hi>Lucida</hi> ſaid to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> And
will not you, <hi>rural Demy-god!</hi> do as we do? What, is there not any thing here
that you like? will you ſlight me ſo? No, that I do not, aſſure your ſelf, anſwers
<hi>Lyſis:</hi> but you know that we <hi>Trees</hi> do not eat any thing, we do nought but drink;
we are not like you <hi>Fountains,</hi> who eat and drink all is given you, we cannot devour
in that manner. 'Tis true, you Trees cannot, ſays <hi>Synopa;</hi> but you who are the
Souls of the Trees, you may eat any thing. I'll never believe it, ſays <hi>Lyſis.</hi> I'll give
you an example for it, ſays <hi>Synopa:</hi> There is your Comrade as to fortune, that eats
like a Wolf.</p>
            <p>In ſaying ſo, ſhe gave the <hi>Violiſt</hi> what to be doing withall; who having a good
ſtomach, ſoon made an end of all: whereat <hi>Lyſis</hi> much wondring, and ſeeing the
<hi>Hamadryads</hi> eat too, he would needs try whether he could do the like. Having eaten
a piece of Pye, it ſeem'd very favoury to him; but after that, all he had to do was to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43725:89"/>
chew the cud. His ſtomach increas'd for what he had eaten; and he thought all had
been brought, not too much for himſelf. One of the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> having fill'd a
glaſs of wine, he obſerved that <hi>Synopa</hi> and <hi>Lucida</hi> drank it not ſo, but daſh'd it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
half water. I wonder you ſhould do ſo, ſays he; what need have you to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
water with your wine, ſeeing you your ſelves are already all water, and that that
liquor loſes ſufficiently of its force when it is within your bodies? We only do this
out of cuſtom, anſwers <hi>Synopa;</hi> we muſt needs obſerve an antient ceremony. But
if I am not deceived, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> you do this in remembrance of the education of
<hi>Bacchus</hi> among the <hi>Nymphs</hi> of the <hi>Fountains,</hi> who for that reaſon requires water
ſhould be mixed with his liquor.</p>
            <p>While he ſaid ſo, the <hi>Violiſt</hi> having eaten enough, began to recreate the company
with the ſound of his Inſtrument; ſo that <hi>Lyſis</hi> calling him into his mind, deſired
him to give them a more ſolid diverſion, and briefly to relate upon what occaſion
he had been metamorphoſed, and what life he had led before.</p>

tranſported, and ſo reſpectfull, that they dare not touch their Miſtreſſes. In theſe
very firſt approaches, he could imagine no leſs then that he had been in the <hi>Elyzian</hi>
fields. <hi>Synopa</hi> did him a great diſcourteſie, when ſhe ſpoke of departing: He
thought it proceeded from her jealouſie of his enjoyments. Yet conſidering it was
almoſt day, he was content to retire, and went the ſecond time into the water with
the other Divinities, which thought themſelves oblig'd to bring him back. When
they were come neer his Tree, <hi>Synopa</hi> told him that he muſt neceſſarily reſolve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
two dayes were paſt, whether he would take her or <hi>Lucida</hi> to his Miſtreſs, and
that they would not any longer languiſh in expectation. He told her, that he would
conſider of it, and immediately he would needs get into his bark. Stay a little, ſays
<hi>Lucida</hi> to him; we'll give you a Hat, you have not any, and there was none of us
till now had the wit to take notice of it; if you continue bare-headed, you may catch
a cold. I am exempted from that inconvenience, fair Nymph! replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> A
head of wood, as mine is, the weather cannot ſo eaſily hurt, as a mans which is of
fleſh and bone. It is true, that the better to preſerve the complexion, it were not
amiſs to have a hat: But in regard I had not my own on when I was metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
it was not ſubject to change; ſo that now it is not fit for me, nor any other
hat. I apprehend your meaning, ſays <hi>Synopa;</hi> you will not have a Caſter or a
Beaver, but you would ſuffer one of wood, that were conformable to your nature.
'Tis right, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and my own hat ſhould have been of that ſubſtance, if it had
been metamorphos'd with me. You ſhall preſently have ſuch a one as ſhall become
you, replies <hi>Synopa:</hi> And in ſo ſaying ſhe takes from one of the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> a
Goblet of <hi>China</hi>-wood, wherein (becauſe they would be ſerved with an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
more divine and poetical) they had drunk at the collation, and put it on the
Shepherds head. This wooden Night-cap was ſo narrow, that it would not come
on the crown of his head, ſo that he caſt it away as being not fit for him, if <hi>Synopa</hi>
could not make it bigger. The fault is not in the Cap, ſays <hi>Synopa,</hi> it is in your head
which is too great; it muſt be ſmooth'd about. You are miſtaken, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi>
Do you not conſider that if the hat were large enough, it would eaſily come on my
head? And do you not ſee too, replies <hi>Synopa,</hi> that if your head were leſs, it would
ſerve you well enough? Their conteſtation on this nice difficulty laſted a good
while; ſo that at length <hi>Lucida</hi> ſaid, that that muſt be done which could be moſt
eaſily; and that being the Cap could be made no bigger, a hatchet muſt be ſought
for to leſſen <hi>Lyſis</hi> his head round. That muſt not be, ſays he to her, it would hurt
me too much, 'tis better to be bare-headed. You ſee, ſays <hi>Synopa,</hi> that the wood
of this young <hi>Cypreſs</hi> is cut off every day to make new Inſtruments withall, he fares
never the worſe for it: The bodies of Trees, have they not their ſuperfluities as well
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43725:90"/>
as thoſe of men? put the caſe your nails were par'd or your hair cut, as if you were
ſtill a Shepherd. I think that if but one of your leaves were taken off, you would
imagine your ſelf on the rack: Yea, though I ſhould ſuffer no hurt, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
I muſt be left entire, for I am a <hi>Sacred</hi> Tree.</p>
            <p>While he ſaid ſo, the God <hi>Morin</hi> felt in the basket, where was the remainder
of the Collation; and having found a great hollow box, wherein there had been
marmalade, and whereof there was ſtill a little at the bottom: he preſented it to
<hi>Synopa,</hi> ſpeaking to her by ſigns, This is it I wanted, ſaies ſhe, and putting it on
<hi>Lyſis</hi>'s head without further conteſtation, it hapned to be very fit. The bottom of it
was ſo well pitch'd, that it clung to his hair, it needed no ſtay, Being thus arm'd,
and the company having promis'd to ſee him again the night following, they took
leave of him, and went a little way off, where waited a Coach for them, to carry
them to <hi>Hircan's,</hi> who was he that had plaid the part of the God of the River
<hi>Morin. Lucida,</hi> was a jovial widow of the Neighbourhood; The <hi>Violiſt,</hi> his own
man; and the <hi>Hamadryads,</hi> two of his maids. All theſe had he diſguiſed, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to deceive <hi>Lyſis,</hi> believing there would be as much entertainment with him as
at the greateſt revelling in the world; and that they made him believe he was dumb,
was leſt his ſpeech might diſcover him. Now he had not forgotten to give every
one his Cue, that they might not fail to ſpeak in <hi>Poetical</hi> and <hi>Romantick</hi> terms. As
ſoon as they came home, they went to bed to reſt them after this diverſion; and
in the mean time <hi>Lyſis,</hi> though abus'd, was as well ſatisfied as they, believing he had
really ſeen thoſe divinities, which before he had only ſeen in the imaginations of
them which his books furniſh'd him with, by which means he became more a fool
then he had ever been.</p>
            <p>With much ado he got into his Tree, but he was no ſooner in, but his belly
began to gripe, becauſe he had taken cold by being ſo long in the wind and rain.
He lifted himſelf up a little, and having untyed his Codpiece-point, ſate a croſs one
of the boughs, and was a good while diſcharging himſelf of a burthen did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
importune him: which done, he put himſelf into the poſture he was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
and ſeeing <hi>Aurora</hi> began to appear, he entertain'd himſelf with a world of
fantaſtical imaginations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who had ſlept well all night, thought it time to get up, and come
abroad with the flock; and withal, to ſee what humor his Maſter was in. Well,
ſays he to him, are you ſtill a <hi>Willow,</hi> as you were yeſterday? I never was, ſayes
<hi>Lyſis;</hi> and it was only the miſtake of ſome <hi>Nymphs</hi> to call me ſo. 'Tis true, I am
a tree, but not a common tree. The Gods have had more conſideration of me,
then that my body ſhould be ſubject to a vulgar Metamorphoſes. Knoweſt thou
not, that thoſe whom the Poets mention, are ever chang'd into trees that were
never ſeen in the world before, and that they are the principle of their being? I
am a new tree added to nature, and if thou wouldſt know my name, 'tis <hi>Lyſis.</hi> All
the trees mention'd in <hi>Ovid,</hi> bear the names of thoſe from whom they came. And
that's a thing I thought not on till now. But all thoſe new trees you ſpeak of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> do they not afterwards become common. 'Tis very true, anſwers
<hi>Lyſis: Myrrha</hi> being once chang'd into a tree of her name, there hath been a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
afterwards ſeen in <hi>Arabia</hi> of the ſame kinde. Well, and is that ſame <hi>Myrrha</hi>
in all thoſe trees? ſaies <hi>Carmelin.</hi> Thou art very ſubtil, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> know ſhe
is only in the firſt, and that the others are graffs, or proceed from the kernel, and
are but the Progeny of the former. It ſeems then, that you may alſo have in time
a very fair race, if God be ſo pleas'd, replies <hi>Carmelin:</hi> well be it ſo; but <hi>I</hi> pray
tell me, is it any delightful thing to be what you are? Ah! <hi>Carmelin,</hi> cryes out
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> thou putſt me on an excellent ſubject. Alas! <hi>I</hi> never could believe there
had been ſo much pleaſure to be a tree, as there is. Thou art ſo gallant a man,
that <hi>I</hi> dare tell thee a thing of importance, though <hi>I</hi> ſhould hazard ſome puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for diſcovering the ſecrets of the <hi>Divinities.</hi> Know then, my friend, that the
lives of the greateſt Monarchs is tedious and diſpleaſant in compariſon of ours.
<hi>Diana</hi> no ſooner ſhews her ſilver-face, but the <hi>Demi-Gods,</hi> and the <hi>Nymphs</hi> of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43725:91"/>
the <hi>Thickets,</hi> and the <hi>Aquatick Divinities</hi> meet together in the meadows, where
they divert themſelves in all manner of recreations. The God <hi>Morin</hi> himſelf did
me laſt night the honor to come and ſee me, with the <hi>Cypreſs</hi> and <hi>Lucida. Synopa</hi>
and two <hi>Hamadryads</hi> did me the ſame favour. <hi>We danc'd,</hi> we <hi>ſung,</hi> we <hi>plaid</hi> one
with another, and the graſs of thoſe meadows bear yet the mark of our footſteps.
<hi>Lucida,</hi> who is a Nymph of a Fountain, brought us into her brook; we croſt her
waters, and were not wet to my thinking; for they divided to give us a paſſage;
making over us a vault of chryſtal, under which was a pleaſant walk. At length we
came to her Grot, which was ſet out with more branches of corral, ordinary ſtones,
mother of pearl, and all ſorts of ſhells, then all thoſe of St. <hi>Germains.</hi> There ſhe
made us a magnificent collation; where <hi>I</hi> learn'd that trees eat, and are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
depriv'd of all the contentments of this world. But all that's nothing to the
pleaſure of being among Nymphs ſo fair as was our hoſteſs; before whom <hi>Diana</hi>
was ſo much aſham'd to appear, that ſhe for the moſt part vail'd her ſelf with a
cloud. O! ſhall <hi>I</hi> tell the reſt! ſhall <hi>I</hi> preſume to divulge thoſe ſilent careſſes,
whereof <hi>I</hi> receiv'd the favour, without entreaty? Yes, <hi>I</hi> dare tell thee, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thou come near me, and that this <hi>Zephyr</hi> which flies about here overhear it not:
he's ſuch a babler, that as ſoon as he knows any thing of news, he tells it every
where, and blows it into the ears of thoſe that paſs by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> being come near, his Maſter went on in his diſcourſe, and told him the
ſecret; which was, that he had kiſt his Nymph, and had touch'd her breaſt. As <hi>I</hi>
am an honeſt man, Maſter, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> oblige me to what you pleaſe, ſo that
you force me not to believe what you now tell me. I am but ſo much the gladder to
hear thee ſay ſo, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſeeing thou wilt not believe me: I infer, that my
felicity is ſo great that it is incredible: and if henceforward I endeavor to prove
any thing I ſay to thee, it ſhall ſignifie no more, then that it hath not been my
fault that thou haſt not believed me.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Lyſis</hi> was ſaying this, <hi>Carmelin</hi> did nothing but ſmell; and at laſt caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his eyes on the willow, he perceives a yellow liquid matter that ran down from
the top to the bottom. Ah! Maſter, ſaies he, drawing backward, what have you
done there? What a naſty man are you? if any people of quality come hither to
ſee you, they'll ſpoil their cloathes as I have done. Having ſo ſaid, he took off a
little ordure that was on his cloathes, and with a ſharp ſtone ſcrap'd off what was
on the bark of the willow. Gather dear <hi>Carmelin,</hi> ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> gather it, gather
it; be a good husband, it is the firſt fruits of the tree <hi>Lyſis.</hi> 'Tis a precious gum that
it ſweats out. <hi>France</hi> will now be as happy as <hi>Arabia:</hi> from me proceeds a drug as
excellent as the tears of the mother of <hi>Adonis,</hi> or thoſe of the ſiſters of <hi>Phaeton:</hi> ſave
it, ſave it, and carry it to ſome Apothecary. 'Tis fair humane dung, that may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on the noſes of your <hi>ill-willers,</hi> ſaies <hi>Carmelin:</hi> will you make me an arrant
fool. Thou art already ſenſeleſs enough, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> deſtroyſt thou a liquor which
thou mighteſt ſell dearer then incenſe, amber or myrrhe: or is it becauſe thou haſt
no viol to preſerve it? ſeeſt thou not this box that I have on my head, take it if
thou canſt, for to put thy drug in? I have already ſeen it, replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> what
ſervice does it you? It hath been given me inſtead of a hat, anſwer <hi>Lyſis,</hi> but I
believe that being it is wood, it is already incorporated into my head. Whether it
be or no, replyes <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I care not much to be informed. O inconſiderate man!
ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> art thou ſo indifferent in all things! The time may come, that when
my wood ſhall begin to ſweat and weep, opening all its pores, there may paſs by
Shepherds, who will not be ſo diſdainful as thou art, who look'ſt on all the riches
which I profer thee with as much ſcorn, as if thou wert a diſciple of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>
or <hi>Epictetus:</hi> They'll think themſelves but too happy, if they can gather
of my yellow amber. I give them free leave to take it, ſays <hi>Carmelin:</hi> but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they taſte of it. As for what I have taken away, will you that I go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
it to thoſe fine Ladies that come to viſit you. Alas! my friend, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
they are not ſeen in the day, we appear only at night. But I am ſure I ſee your
face, and a part of your breaſt, replies <hi>Carmelin.</hi> What thou now ſeeſt, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:43725:91"/>
is a body and head of wood. Your face then is painted with fleſh-colours, ſaies
<hi>Carmelin;</hi> and if you are a man of wood, what do you think you ſhall be good
for henceforward, unleſs 'twere to ſtand in a Stable to hang Saddles and ſuch
things on?</p>
            <p>As they were thus engag'd, <hi>Anſelme</hi> being behind them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ries out, A wooden
head may alſo ſerve for a bable for children to play withall. I pray thee do not
abuſe me, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Know that if my wood were to be cut down for any uſe, it
ſhould be to make the Statues of the Gods. Pardon my firſt fally, that hath put
me into a little ſcoffing humour, replies <hi>Anſelme;</hi> I honour you ſtill, and that very
much, and my buſineſs hither is to know how you do. My maſter is as well as can
be, ſays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he eats and drinks like a man. Is it true, incomparable <hi>Willow!</hi>
ſays <hi>Anſelme?</hi> I am not ſo called, replies <hi>Lyſis.</hi> How then? ſays <hi>Anſelme.</hi> I am
called <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſays he.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> upon this was of opinion, ſeeing he fed quietly, and would be called
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> that he had recovered his wits again, and that he did no longer imagine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Tree, which indeed was the madneſs of his madneſs; I mean a ſecond mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
added to the firſt, which was that of turning Shepherd. But when he asked him
whether he would come and breakfaſt at <hi>Clarimon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'s,</hi> he anſwer'd, that the <hi>Rural
Deities</hi> did not eat in the day, and that he kept his ſtomach till night, at which time
he was to feaſt with thoſe of his own condition, and not with mortals. <hi>Anſelme</hi> was
much troubled that he had ſo much over-reckon'd himſelf, and that he found him
ſtill in his error: So that coming neer him, he gave him an account how he had
ſpent the night before, which made him hope he ſhould ſpend a many more as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily;
but more particularly he told him who had put that flat box on his head,
which was much like the gilt inſcriptions over Saints heads in Country-Churches.
<hi>Anſelme</hi> having had a ſhort relation of all this, did more then ſuſpect it was <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
had plaid theſe tricks with him: He preſently goes his way to <hi>Clarimond's</hi> to
give him and <hi>Montenor</hi> the ſtory; and as ſoon as they had broke faſt, they went to
ſee this counterfeit God of the River, who found them much more ſport when he
told them all the particularities of this nocturnal adventure. They would have been
very glad for once to have known ſo much as he did; ſo that making it their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to go and viſit <hi>Lyſis</hi> at night with the other Deities, they reſolved not to ſee
him all that day, leſt they ſhould have had any occaſion to perſwade him he was no
Tree, and that if he ſhould believe it, they ſhould miſs the contentment they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
'Tis true indeed, that <hi>Anſelme</hi> having taken him into his charge out of the hands
of his Kinſman, was obliged to endeavour the cure of his folly; nor indeed was he
wanting as to the deſire to do it: but he thought fit to delay it as long as he could;
and if he pretended to perſwade him to come out of the Willow, 'twas only to carry
him up and down, and by his means make oftner viſits to <hi>Angelica:</hi> So that he
would not do much, till he had made otherwiſe all the ſport he could with him.
<hi>Hircan</hi> being of the ſame opinion, they plotted together how to make <hi>Lyſis</hi> a man
again by a ſecond Metamorphoſis, when they had made what mirth they could with
him as he was; for they were ſomwhat afraid he might really come to ſome hurt,
if he ſhould continue long in his habitation of the <hi>Willow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> had all this while the company of <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who ſet on him ſtill with a
many notable objections, to ſhew that he was no Tree: but ſeeing that he prevail'd
nothing, he left him and went home for his dinner, which he had forgotten to bring
with him. Thoſe who had obſerv'd <hi>Lyſis</hi> a diſcreet perſon in ſome other things, and
for the moſt part ſpoke eloquently, will haply be much amaz'd to find him ſo <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriack,</hi>
as to imagine himſelf a <hi>Tree:</hi> But they are to believe, that in all this
there is not any contradiction or difficulty; and that this Shepherd, though he ſaw
all the world derided his opinion, yet did ſtill perſiſt in it, and had been much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
to quit it, out of a deſire he had it ſhould be true, that ſo he might raiſe the
greater admiration in others.</p>
            <p>While he was deeply engag'd in his frantick imaginations, two men on horſ-back
rode along in a way not far from his tree: They perceiv'd his head with a box on
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43725:92"/>
it; and not being able at a diſtance to diſcover what that antick figure meant, they
were ſo curious as to go to him. How now! what do you there friend, ſays one to
him; are you put to ſcare away the birds? Methinks there's no great neceſſity of
it, here's no hemp-yard hereabouts. Or is't not that you are a hunting, and that
you have laid your Nets ſomewhere? Have you not alſo put ſome Lime-twigs on
your head? The Bird-lime, methinks, comes down along your hair; 'tis very ill
beſtowed there for to take any thing.</p>
            <p>This he ſpake becauſe of the Marmalet which trickled down <hi>Lyſis's</hi> head. But
the <hi>rural Demy-god</hi> anſwers them thus: Preſume not to enquire of any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
me, ye prophane men! Get you gone hence, and come not within a hundred
paces, leſt you pollute a ſacred place. He that had ſpoke laſt, knowing by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
that <hi>Lyſis</hi> was not of the wiſeſt, was content only to ſtrike him with his wand
over the wooden bonnet, and ſlighting him, kept on his way with his Companion.
The blow he gave him ſtruck down the box over his noſe, ſo that he could not ſee
any thing; which importun'd him much, becauſe the Flies ſwarming to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malet,
took occaſion to tickle him in the face. Now both his arms were ſtretch'd
out and held by the branches of the Willow, according to his wonted poſture; and
thoſe he durſt not let go, believing he ought always to be in that poſture, to make
it appear that he was a Tree; and that if he had made uſe of his hands, and ſome
one ſhould haply overſee him, he muſt needs think he derogated from his quality.
All his remedy was to ſhake his head, which he did ſo effectually, that the third time
he ſhook down the Box, and was not much troubled at the loſs of it, by reaſon he
began to be weary of it. A little after comes <hi>Carmelin,</hi> ſuffering his Flock to feed
as he came, and feeding himſelf on a piece of bread and bacon. I forgot one thing
I ſhould have ſaid to <hi>Anſelme</hi> erewhile, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I ſhould have deſired him to
ſend me my Gittarrhe for to recreate my ſelf in my ſolitude, but more particularly
for to bear a part at night with the other Divinities. Why ſhould not I be ſuffered
to do ſo? I have ſeen a <hi>Cypreſs</hi> that plays well on the Violin: we have now the
ſame Sciences as we had when we were humane, and our Exerciſes are alike. I tell
you once more, anſwers <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that I'll never believe a <hi>Cypreſs-tree</hi> can play on
a Fiddle, unleſs I ſee it. There is a remedy for all this, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Become a
Tree, and thou ſhalt ſee all the miracles done by ſuch as we are: I would to god
thou wouldſt! and that thou wert planted by my ſide, that we might recreate our
ſelves by ſome excellent diſcourſes: There are other trees good ſtore about me, but
they ſpeak not; and if there by any <hi>Demy-gods</hi> or <hi>Demy-goddeſſes</hi> under their barks,
they are very ill condition'd. If a man could be a tree only for one day, replies
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> not to diſſemble, I ſhould willingly be one, ſuch is my deſire to know
whether all you have told me be true. But what ſhould I do to be of your quality?
Thou muſt mention it to the gods, and in the mean time be in love with ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
Miſtreſs. That will require a long time, ſays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and I am impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
My advice then is, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that thou make a deep pit in the earth, and
thruſt thy ſelf into it up to the belly; it may come to paſs, that thy legs may take
root and faſten in the earth, and then 'tis but for ſome friend of thine to come and
water thee, that thou mayſt bloſſom. Go ſeek others to follow your advice, ſays
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> I have no mind to rot alive: Think you it would be a fine ſight to ſee
me planted there without any means or ſubſiſtence? 'twere ſuch an humour as
would invite all within fifty leagues about to come and ſee me; I had rather at any
adventure lock my ſelf up, as you do, in the belly of a Willow. Have I not once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
told thee that I was not in a Willow, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> what makes thee forge all
theſe <hi>Chymaera's?</hi> I'll ſpeak no more, ſays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> I deſire only to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I may ſee the recreations you have in the night, without adding to the number
of trees. I know not, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> for Divinities have ſuch ſubtile bodies, that
men cannot perceive them; however the trial ſhall coſt thee nothing.</p>
            <p>The maſter and the man had divers other diſputes on this ſubject; and <hi>Carmelin</hi>
at laſt reſolv'd to participate in the adventures of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> if it were poſſible. The
dancing and kiſſes whereof he had ſpoken to him, ſo tickled his imagination, that he
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43725:92"/>
would very fain make one in a company that ſpent their time ſo well. But the great
charm of all was the <hi>Collation,</hi> whereof he ſaw ſome proofs, which almoſt convinc'd
him of all the reſt. He had ſtumbled on the box of Marmalet, which was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of the Banquet; and though good ſtore of earth had gotten in, yet did he
not ſtick to take out what was in't, and when he had done, lick'd it about with his
tongue. Being drawn in by theſe delicacies, he brings home his Flock betimes, and
leaving word that they ſhould not look for him that night, he returns to his maſter.
Their diſcourſe then was of their future entertainments: And among other things
<hi>Lyſis</hi> told <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that if he could enter him into the fraternity of the <hi>Rural
Deities,</hi> he knew an <hi>Hamadryad</hi> that might he wrought on to be his wife; and that
if her complexion was not ſo delicate, ſhe had in amends a ſtrong and lively body.
That would not be amiſs, ſays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> for I do not love thoſe women that play
the cockney ſo much: But I'll have a good portion with her. 'Tis a great queſtion
whether theſe Nymphs have any thing in marriage, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> We ſhall further
conſider of it, when we come to the beating of the buſh.</p>
            <p>It was by this time pretty far in the night, when <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who lay at the foot of
the tree, was overcome by ſleep, though the diſcourſes of his Maſter were very diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
What pitty it is that the adventures of <hi>Lyſis</hi> hapned in a place ſo little advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
for his glory, and the profit of the people! He was in a Country ſo deſart, that
all the day there were but two men ſaw him; and now the night was come, there
was none to hear the excellent diſcourſes he had with <hi>Carmelin.</hi> If ſuch brave things
had been done within a league of <hi>Paris,</hi> as it might be at <hi>Charenton</hi> or <hi>Gentilly,</hi>
what a world of people would have come to viſit two ſuch rare perſons! But it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
that the brave Nobility thereabouts were acquainted with them, that by that
means his friends might have an account of him.</p>
            <p>The time of the Mask being come, <hi>Lucida,</hi> who had all the while remained at
<hi>Hircan's,</hi> was cloathed as ſhe had been the night before, as alſo <hi>Synopa,</hi> the <hi>Cypreſs,</hi>
and the <hi>Hamadryads.</hi> As for <hi>Anſelme, Montenor,</hi> and <hi>Clarimond,</hi> they were clad as
Gods of the River like <hi>Hircan,</hi> that ſo they might not ſpeak, leſt they ſhould be
diſcover'd. The whole troop of theſe haſty Divinities being coached, alighted about
a quarter of a league from the place where was the incomparable <hi>Willow.</hi> The <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi>
playd on his Violin, and the reſt followed him dancing. <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
ſleep, ſoon heard the harmony, and preſently calls out to <hi>Carmelin:</hi> Awake
thou lazy fellow, awake! The Nymphs are come; prepare they eloquence, that
when they ſhall ask thee any thing, if they take thee for a man, it may not be
for an ordinary perſon. Call to mind the <hi>Common-places,</hi> through which Learning
hath been <hi>ſiring'd</hi> into thy mind, by which means thou haſt not been troubled with
the reading of any ancient Author. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was awaked by theſe words, which he
imperfectly or half heard: And his maſter by this time perceiving the <hi>divine</hi> troop,
got cheerfully out of his tree, to ſhew his diligence to receive them. <hi>Lucida</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him firſt, he made her a low conge: which the Nymph returning, ask'd him
how he had done ſince their laſt interview. I have always been very jovial, anſwers
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> and I am ſure my branches have ever ſince been very flouriſhing, for I liv'd
in hope to ſee you again: And beſides I have good news to tell you; and that is,
that I conſidered that I am not a <hi>Willow,</hi> but the <hi>tree Lyſis,</hi> a tree whereof the name
was never known before; and I know there comes out of me a certain Drug more
precious then Amber. Seeing every one brings hither of their own Fruits, and
that your <hi>Hamadryads</hi> furniſh us of their <hi>Cherries</hi> and <hi>Apricocks,</hi> I am ſorry I have
not brought what my Bark brings forth: You might have dry'd it in the ſun to
make Neck-laces and Bracelets of it. The Deities were very much pleaſed at this
imagination; but they would have had more ſport, had they known what amber
he ſpake of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who who was much aſtoniſh'd to ſee ſo many ſtrange perſons, was in
ſuch a fear, that he durſt not but keep cloſe to his maſter: So that <hi>Synopa</hi> having
perceiv'd him, Dear brother! ſays ſhe to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who is that behind you? Who
ſhould it be! anſwered <hi>Lyſis;</hi> See you not it is my ſhadow, and that the Moon
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43725:93"/>
ſhines very bright? No ſuch matter, ſays <hi>Synopa;</hi> I ſmell raw fleſh here, we are
betrayed: Here is a Mortal; let us be gone, my companions! With theſe words
ſhe runs away as faſt as ſhe could, and was immediately follow'd by the whole troop.
So that <hi>Lyſis</hi> beſet himſelf to run after them, ſpeaking to them as loud as he could
in theſe words: Whither run you dear <hi>Divinities!</hi> ſtay a little; He whom you
ſhun is but a miſerable Shepherd: If you ſtay not here, he and other men will have
ſome ground to believe that you fear them, ſince you dare not appear before
them.</p>
            <p>All that ran away were by theſe words ſtay'd; and being aſſembled in a meadow,
they made as if they had taken heart, and ask'd <hi>Lyſis</hi> who he was that accompanied
him. 'Tis the Shepherd <hi>Carmelin,</hi> anſwers he: When I was a man, he was my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of fortune; that ſhould oblige you to eſteem him, were there no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
but beſides that, he hath many excellent perfections: Fear not to ſhew your
ſelves to him. <hi>Juno, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> ſhewed themſelves to <hi>Paris,</hi> who was a little
lewd Raſcal, that was not ſo good a man as he. This man is a Shepherd who ſtands
upon his honour and reputation; and to tell you the ſecret of all, it was his deſire
to ſee our nocturial recreations. This curioſity proceeds from an ingenuity, which
ought not to be fruſtrated of its expectation: We muſt hear thoſe that invoke us.
We will receive him into our company, ſays <hi>Synopa,</hi> on condition he'll be faithfull.
He ſhall be, as I am a <hi>gummy Tree,</hi> replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> But by your favour, I ſee three
Divinities which I know not. They are Gods of Rivers who are come with <hi>Morin,</hi>
ſays <hi>Synopa;</hi> they live ſometimes in the <hi>Sein,</hi> and ſometimes in the <hi>Marn. Lyſis</hi> upon
that faultes them, and they embraced him, a little more gently then their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had done the night before. That done, <hi>Lucida</hi> ſaid ſhe would bring the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
into a very pleaſant place; and going before them, ſhe reſted not till they had
gone a quarter of a league. <hi>Carmelin</hi> went among the reſt, but not without much
reſpect, ſtill holding his Maſter by the skirt, leſt they might loſe him.</p>
            <p>When they were come into a ſquare Cloſe, ſo well beſet with trees, that it was
almoſt like a Hall, the <hi>Cypreſs</hi> plaid Coranto's, and the Gods of the River took in
the Nymphs to dance. <hi>Lyſis</hi> admired their good diſpoſitions: but <hi>Lucida</hi> took
him off that admiration, telling him they had learn'd to dance from their <hi>Carpes.</hi>
There being no reputation to ſtrive with them that way, he would not dance but to
Songs. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was in the dance, wherein there was required ſuch activity as
made him glad to find his legs. This exerciſe having wearied them all, they ſate
down on the graſs; and <hi>Lyſis</hi> made it his buſineſs to inform himſelf of the new
Gods of the Rivers. <hi>Synopa</hi> told him, they never had been men, nor had not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
any metamorphoſis, but were the children of others Gods, and yet could
not ſpeak. This paſt, it was propoſed to go to ſome little verbal recreations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
the Gods of the Rivers were not fit, becauſe there was always ſome word to be
ſpoken. They therefore withdrew from that divertiſement, and were content to
liſten to the harmony of <hi>Morin</hi>'s Lute. <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who was buſie at play with the
reſt, thought the time very tedious, and the <hi>Collation</hi> long a coming; ſo that ever
and anon he was at his Maſter asking, And when comes this <hi>conſolation? Lyſis</hi> thus
importun'd, knew no remedy better then to find him ſome excellent employment
to divert his mind; and having broke off the game they were at, My fair ones!
ſays he to the Nymphs, now ſhall you receive the incomparable ſatisfaction of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my gentle Shepherd. And thereupon turning to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he ſays to him, Make
a ſpeech in the <hi>demonſtrative</hi> kind, in commendation of theſe <hi>Nayads</hi> and <hi>Hama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dryads,</hi>
and thoſe <hi>aquatick</hi> Gods. Excuſe me, Sir, I beſeech you, anſwers <hi>Carmelin;</hi>
my books ſpeak not of any ſuch Nations. What ſayeſt thou, ignorant Sot! ſays
<hi>Lyſis:</hi> wilt thou make me be affronted, in not anſwering to what is expected from
thee? muſt my boughs, which are always <hi>green,</hi> now put on <hi>red,</hi> and <hi>bluſh</hi> for ſhame
of thee? Come hither, ſays he, ſpeaking to him in his ear, knoweſt thou nothing
where there is mention of <hi>Beauty,</hi> or the effects of <hi>Love?</hi> That thou muſt in the
firſt place ſpeak to theſe Nymphs, and afterwards thou mayſt conſider of a <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick</hi>
of the Gods. I can diſcourſe excellently on <hi>Beauty,</hi> replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> let
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43725:93"/>
me alone: can you not at firſt ſpeak as you ſhould, I can never underſtand one half
of your barbarous names, you ſpeak nothing but Latine to me. In three words of
yours, there are ever four cannot be underſtood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> having thus ſaid, kneel'd down on one knee before the Nymphs, and
made them this diſcourſe, <hi>Fair Ladies, hide your bright eyes from me, they make me
dye: yet no, do not hide them, they give me life; yet do, for they have ſtoln away my
heart: yet do not, for if they had taken away my heart, they had with it taken away
my ſoul.</hi> And this is in the firſt Chapter of my book of <hi>Collections:</hi> The ſecond
ſpeaks thus much, <hi>O</hi> BRIGHT EYES! <hi>you are not eyes, but Suns: Suns!
no, ye are Gods: but ſince you are Gods, how comes it you are the cauſers of my death?
Alas! I ſee you are eyes as to your Eſſence; Suns for your brightneſs; and Gods for
your power; and that the occaſion of your coming down on earth, is to make me ſuffer.</hi>
I wiſh I knew what to ſay to theſe Gentlemen with the great beards; but I believe
there is not any book extant that mentions them, and it may be, they are deaf as
well as dumb. Get thee gone, ſeeing thy diſcourſes are ſo impertinent, cryes out
<hi>Lyſis:</hi> What need was there thou ſhouldſt ſpeak of thy <hi>Collections?</hi> And muſt
thou withal, ſo far forget reſpect, as to ſpeak to <hi>Goddeſſes</hi> as if thou wert in love
with them? Why may he not, replies <hi>Lucida,</hi> he ſhall not be diſdain'd: he ſhall
have for his Miſtreſs the greater of the <hi>Hamadryads.</hi> I give you thanks for him,
ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> he ſhall endeavor to deſerve this favor; be pleas'd to excuſe him, if
you think he hath committed any folly; for the ſplendor of your bright faces had
ſo dazled him, that he was quite out of himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucida</hi> upon that viewing <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſaw he had not on the fine cap they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd
on him; She ask'd him the reaſon of it, and withal told him, he was very
negligent of his health. I have already told you that my body was impaſſible,
replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and beſides, as for your fine covering, I have caſt it away for this
reaſon, that among all the <hi>Gods,</hi> I never ſaw any one pictur'd with a hat on, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be <hi>Mercurie,</hi> who wears one as the badge of his dignity; and as for <hi>Heroes</hi>
and illuſtrious perſons, I have ever obſerv'd them bare headed, unleſs it were ſome
few that had helmets on; but that proves nothing, they wore them not but in
fights.</p>
            <p>There had been advanc'd more ſuch conſiderations, had not <hi>Synopa</hi> come and
ſaid, that they had diſcours'd ſufficiently; and that it was time to collation. <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
commended her a thouſand times within himſelf for her profitable advice, while
the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> diſcharg'd their baskets of a many good things they had brought
and diſpos'd them on the green graſs, which was all the Table-cloath they had.
The God <hi>Morin</hi> came near <hi>Synopa,</hi> and told her ſomewhat in her ear, which <hi>Lyſis</hi>
perceiv'd not: In the mean time <hi>Carmelin</hi> was help'd by his Maſter with the wing
of a cold Turkey, which he fell preſently on with his fingers, knowing that hands
were made before knives; but as he was putting a piece into his mouth, <hi>Synopa</hi>
withheld his arm: Be not too haſty, Shepherd, ſaies ſhe to him, you are not yet
permitted to eat with us. We muſt firſt waſh you in one of our fountains: What
did <hi>Lyſis</hi> dream on, that he hath given you your portion? he was like to ſerve
us a fine trick. We muſt have gone to the God <hi>Pan,</hi> for to entreat him to purifie us
all. I was ignorant of this Ceremony, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I beg your pardon, if I have done
any thing amiſs: I never read what you ſpeak of in any Poet. However, it muſt
be believed ſo, and good bathing will do <hi>Carmelin</hi> no hurt, it may conduce to his
health. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was thinking what a pleaſure it were to be waſh'd by ſuch fine
Ladies; but he wiſh'd it might be juſt then, that ſo he might collation with the
reſt, and he ſaw they did not make any haſte to do it. They had taken away the
meat from him, and withal fed ſo earneſtly, and with ſuch ſtomacks, that there
needed no long time to diſpatch all that was; which conſideration made him ſick
at the heart.</p>
            <p>The Divinities having ended their collation, <hi>Synopa</hi> thought it time to go and
bathe him, and to ſet all the reſt in a forwardneſs: but he angrily anſwered, that
it was to no purpoſe, ſeeing there was nothing to be eaten. <hi>Synopa</hi> reply'd, that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43725:94"/>
it were ſo much ſpar'd another night that he ſhould come and ſee them.
Then comes <hi>Lyſis</hi> and whiſpers to him, bidding him go where ere they ſhould carry
him, and that it would be a means for him to ſee the Grots of the <hi>Nayads,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had ſo earneſtly deſired to go. <hi>Carmelin</hi> crediting him, went quietly with
the fair Deities; but when they were come to the brook of <hi>Lucida</hi>'s fountain:
<hi>Synopa</hi> ſaies to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> for your part, you need not be preſent at our Myſteries,
<hi>Morin</hi> you ſee, and two of the Gods of the River have left us, go your ways with
them. <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who earneſtly deſired to ſee their ceremonies, that he might be
initated in the divine Science, was much troubled, that he was forc'd to leave them.
But he was fain to go with <hi>Morin,</hi> and the two other Gods, who were <hi>Anſelme</hi>
and <hi>Clarimond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Synopa, Lucida, Montenor,</hi> the <hi>Humadryads,</hi> and the <hi>Cypreſs,</hi>
took <hi>Carmelin</hi> by the head and feet, and threw him into the water in his cloaths,
in a certain place that was deep enough. He found not ſo much pleaſure in his
handling as he had imagin'd, but it was much worſe with him when the <hi>Cypreſs</hi>
ſaid, that he muſt be ſtripp'd ſtark naked. When he had put off his breeches and
doublet, they tyed him by the arms to a willow that was on the bank, as if it had
been a piece of the ceremony; which done, they turn'd up his ſhirt, and whipp'd
him ſo long with Ozier twigs, that from crying mercy and begging, he fell a rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heartily at all the company; but <hi>Lucida</hi> told him, that the water could not
cleanſe him; and that there was within him a corrupt blood that muſt be whipt
out, ere he could be made ſo pure as to be admitted to converſe with the Deities.</p>
            <p>All having done him what miſchief they could, they return'd to their Randez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz,
and left him faſt tyed. <hi>Lyſis</hi> being by this time come near the place, where
his tree was, took leave of the <hi>Aquatick</hi> Deities, who bid him farewell, by ſigns
with the hands and conges. Being left all alone, he was much aſtoniſh'd that he
could not finde his abode, though the appearance of <hi>Auroroa</hi> made it ſomewhat
light. <hi>Hircan</hi> deſirous to try all means to bring him out of his imagination, had
given order, that while he was abſent, his willow ſhould be cut down at the root,
and carry quite away. Beſides all which, the place was ſo well made up with freſh
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urfs, that he could not perceive there ever had been any. <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſeeks all about,
and his hollow brain wanted no matter of imaginations upon this accident: Yet
though he could not finde his willow, he did ſtill imagine himſelf a tree; and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome body coming, he planted himſelf near the place where the willow had
ſtood: and becauſe he would do nothing before men, that were contrary to his
nature, he lifted up his arms, and widened his fingers, as though they had been
brances.</p>
            <p>In this poſture doth <hi>Hircan</hi> appear to him, in the ſame black ſuit which he had
when he delivered him out of the danger he was in at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s. O Tree! ſaies the
Magician to him, my will is, that from henceforth thou become a man. 'Tis not in
thy power to do it, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> they are the great Gods that have Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos'd
me. The greateſt Gods have but the power of Dwarfs if compar'd to me,
replies <hi>Hircan;</hi> and I will now ſhew thee the power of my charms. While he ſaid
ſo, he made a circle about him with a rod he had in his hand; which done, he read
certain barbarous words out of a great book. I ſee I muſt double my Enchantments,
ſays he to <hi>Lyſis;</hi> for thou art ſo ſelf-will'd, that thou reſiſteſt them. What wouldſt
thou do? replies he, wouldſt thou deprive me of all happineſs? Let me alone,
thou know'ſt not what is fit for thee, replies <hi>Hircan:</hi> thou ſhalt immediately be a
man, in ſpight of heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> earth and hell; and ſeeing thou wilt not get out of thy
bark to come to me, I will cauſe the winds to blow thee down. Thou ſhalt be put
out of thy abiding place, and ſhalt ſee that I can command all the powers of the
world. <hi>O you Kings of the air, and beeſoms of the earth</hi> (goes he on with a louder
voyce) you winds <hi>which blow, the one from the one quarter, and the other from the
othtr;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>from the North, and from the South. And you Boreas and Auſter,
I do conjure you by the pantofles of</hi> Fate, <hi>the old Gallogaskins of</hi> Saturn, <hi>and the
Cloſe-ſtool of</hi> Proſerpina, <hi>and by whatever elſe is venerable, and auguſt in the world,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43725:94"/>
that you blow againſt this tree, and bring it down in ſuch manner, as that it loſe its
vigor, and that I may change its form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Aſſoon as the Magician had pronounc'd theſe words, behold there appear'd a
brace of knaves all clad with feathers: He had no ſooner ſaid to them, <hi>O winds do
your duty!</hi> but they began to blow one on the one ſide, and the other on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> with certain bellows they had. Their cheeks withal were fluſh'd and
fiery, ſo that they ſeem'd ſo ſwollen up, as if they had been alſo to blow with their
mouthes, when they were weary the other way. Their action was ſo effectual on
the imagination of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that he thought they did him ſome violence; and as
if he had been much ſhaken, one while he bowed one way, another while another
yet kept his feet as firmly to the ground as he could. At length, after a good
while's reſiſtance, the North-wind blew ſo violently, that he thought there was no
way but to give place to him: ſo that being quite amaz'd at it, he fell to the ground.
The winds preſently vaniſh'd, or rather fled away; and the Magician having invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
all the powers of the Univerſe, pour'd ſome water out of a viol he had about
him on <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s head, and afterward ſprinkled it with duſt <hi>O tree</hi> (ſays he in the
action) <hi>my charms ſhall control the power of the Gods; and I now reſtore unto thee
the form and nature of a man, which they had taken from thee. I command thee to riſe
up. Lyſis</hi> riſe up immediately; but thinking to ſpeak to the Magician, he had made
ſuch haſte to get away from him, that he knew not which way he was gone; and as
for his part, he was in ſuch a fright, that he could not follow him. <hi>Hircan</hi> being
come to the place where the whole company ſtaid for him in the Coach, got in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
and return'd to his own houſe. 'Twas <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> who were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd
and perſonated the winds: but as they had been much pleas'd to ſee the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
of <hi>Lyſis;</hi> ſo were they afflicted, they had not alſo ſeen thoſe of <hi>Carmelin</hi>
when he was whipp'd. <hi>Synopa</hi> and <hi>Lucida</hi> gave them a long, yet pleaſant ſtory of
of him: and though they had all watch'd ſo long, yet no body had any minde to
ſleep: They choſe rather to return to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> to ſee what humor he was in.</p>
            <p>The imaginations which before had diſturbed his brains, were now diſperſed,
and having view'd himſelf all about, he fully believ'd himſelf a man; ſo that he
return'd to his hoſt, where having found his hat and ſheephook, he put himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his former Equipage; and having whiſtled to his dog, that ſlept at the door, he
renew'd his acquaintance with him. He drove out his flock out of the fold, and
brought it into the fields to graze, thinking himſelf oblig'd to return to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
employment.</p>

very ſtayedly, as it had been a man taken up with ſome
high thoughts; and gravely lifted up his ſheephook at every
ſtep, as a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pilgrim doth his ſtaff. He had not gone a
quarter of a league, but there paſs'd by a Coach, out of
which alighted <hi>Hircan, Anſelme, Clarimond,</hi> and <hi>Montenor,</hi>
all in their ordinary cloaths. Embracing them all one after
another, My friends, ſays he to them, you ſee I have ſuffered
a ſecond Metamorphoſis; I now ſalute you in the quality of a <hi>Shepherd:</hi> there is
<hi>Hircan,</hi> who hath made me reaſſume my priſtine form. We are as glad of this,
ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> as we were ſorry to have loſt you. But what do you think of it? are
you of our opinion? All I can ſay, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> is, that I muſt have patience in
ſpight of my teeth. It's true, I had much pleaſure when I was a <hi>Tree:</hi> but if it be
decreed I ſhould be ſo no more, I muſt reſolve to ſubmit: I ſuffer nothing now
which I have not already tryed; beſides that I am to conſider, that to ſhew my ſelf
a faithful Lover, I muſt not be troubled for having the means continued me to ſerve
<hi>Charite.</hi> Your conſtancie is commendable, my friend, ſays <hi>Hircan;</hi> and you are to
know that before you were made Man again, I had much ado to get up into heaven
and ſearch the Records of <hi>Fate,</hi> who is <hi>Jupiter's</hi> principal <hi>Clark;</hi> there I learn'd
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43725:95"/>
what ſhould become of you for the future, leſt I might have undertaken ſomewhat
contrary to thoſe decrees. It ſeems <hi>Lyſis</hi> is much oblig'd to <hi>Hircan,</hi> ſays <hi>Clarimond:</hi>
but Shepherd, if I may be ſo bold, what's become of your ſervant <hi>Carmelin?</hi>
Alas! now I think on't, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I doubt the Nymphs have gotten him away. He
was with me the laſt night among thoſe of the Divine company, whom he charm'd
with his eloquence, They made me believe that they had a deſign to bathe him for
purification-ſake, but would not ſuffer me to be preſent: ſo that now I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
they had ſome ill deſign, for he hath not yet been at his lodging. The Nymphs
have many nobler ſervants then he, ſays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> It may be that, ſince he left
them, ſome wilde beaſt hath devour'd him. Alas! it may be thou firſt the nail
on the head, cries out <hi>Lyſis;</hi> hath not ſome Wolf broke his faſt on my faithful
<hi>Carmelin?</hi> How have my thoughts been taken up till now, that I have not look'd
after him? Let us now do it; 'tis fit we had a care of him, his loſs would be very
conſiderable.</p>
            <p>Having ſo ſaid, he croſs'd the fields up and down, and all the reſt follow'd him:
He cry'd out as loud as he could, <hi>Carmelin, Carmelin,</hi> where art thou? my Friend,
my Minion, my Delight, my Love. And ſeeing he anſwered not; Queſtionleſs,
ſaies he, he is dead: we muſt provide for his Monument, and his Funeral Oration.
<hi>Lyſis</hi> at length came to the brook of <hi>Lucida,</hi> and as he walk'd along it, renew'd
his crying, Where art thou <hi>Carmelin?</hi> and preſently he heard a voyce, ſaying,
Here I am my dear Maſter; have compaſſion on the moſt miſerable Shepherd that
lives. Upon that he doubles his pace, and findes the poor <hi>Carmelin</hi> half naked tied
to a tree. Who hath faſtened thee there, my Friend? ſays he to him. What ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
people have thus affronted ſo ſweet a diſpoſition? No other but your <hi>Imps</hi>
hereabout, that have dragg'd me into their <hi>Crocks,</hi> replies <hi>Carmelin.</hi> Thy mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that the Nymphs and the Cypreſs have carried thee into their
<hi>Grots.</hi> Very right, ſaies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> the Devil take their Dances, their Sports and
their Collations, if a man muſt buy the ſight of them with ſo much miſchief as they
have done me. Thou may'ſt haply be miſtaken in them, ſaies <hi>Lyſis.</hi> I am not, ſaies
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> they were the very ſame, let me be untyed, and I'll tell you more. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Hircan,</hi> who carried a knife in his ſword ſcabbard, cut the miſchievous garters
wherewith they had tyed him. When he had gotten his cloathes on, he related
what had hapned to him, whereat every one extreamly wondred; for the Nymphs
were not accounted ſo miſchievous as he made them. But <hi>Lyſis</hi> interrupting his ſtory
came and ſaid to him, Be not troubled, the miſchief is paſt; and in recompence
thereof, I'll tell thee what thou ſhalt be very glad of. Know then, what came not
yet into my minde to tell thee, <hi>I am no tree,</hi> I am the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis:</hi> My vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath alſo hindered me to inform my ſelf of it, replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> yet I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſuſpected you had chang'd nature. Fair weather after it; let's forget what is
paſt, ſeeing you will have it ſo, But above all things, let me not be entreated to
come any more among thoſe fine Dames I ſaw laſt night, it may be they are evil
ſpirits. I deſire not to have any thing to do with people of the other world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> having ſo ſaid, was ready to go with the reſt, but that he wanted his
hat. The Nymphs had not left it with his cloathes; after they had plaid with it a
good while, they had caſt it into the bryars, far from that place, where they were
ſure he would not look for it. Let's go however, ſaies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> I'll give you
another. Nay, it ſhall not be ſo, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I cannot endure to be affronted
out of any thing: ſhould you give me as many hats as would reach from earth to
heaven: I would not loſe my own. You need no more but ſummon the Lady-Nymphs
before the Magiſtrate of the place, ſaies <hi>Anſelme.</hi> Do ſo and fear not, ſaies <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond;</hi>
ſee there's a ſergeant goes on the road, let's ſpeak to him.</p>
            <p>That ſaid, they put forward, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> having overtaken the man, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was a Catchpole. My good friend, ſaies he to him, there are certain indiſcreet
Ladies have taken my hat from me, without any reaſon: Have I not a good action
againſt them? That you have without queſtion friend, replies the Catchpole:
give me their names and dwellings, I'll ſummon them. I muſt firſt acquaint my
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43725:96"/>
Maſter with it, ſaies <hi>Carmelin.</hi> She that muſt have committed the Felony, is called
<hi>Lucida,</hi> ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> as for her dwelling, it is in the ſource of a Fountain hard by;
but ſhe is hidden within it ſo, that thou wilt never finde her poor mortal Serjeant:
For this Arreſt there is requiſite a celeſtial Serjeant, ſuch as <hi>Mercury:</hi> As for her
companions who have been Acceſſaries in the Felony, they are faſt in the barks of
trees: where wouldſt thou finde all theſe? For thy part <hi>Carmelin,</hi> let fall thy ſuit;
thou'lt get nothing by quarrelling with ſtronger then thy ſelf. The Nymphs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
not Terreſtrial Judges; or if they ſubmit to them they corrupt them, as
they did the Son of <hi>Priamus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Catchpole went his way with this diſcourſe, thinking they either had been
ſome that would abuſe him; or that ſomewhat was amiſs in their mindes: In both
which caſes there was nothing to be gotten of them, ſince he underſtood not what
they ſaid. <hi>Carmelin</hi> being much troubled that he could have no ſatisfaction of thoſe
felons; began to cry out. Alack! poor hat, muſt I needs loſe thee in the flower of
thine age and beauty? 'Tis very true, thou didſt my Grandfather ſervice and credit
at his firſt wedding; but thou mightſt have a long time ſerv'd my poſterity. Ah!
how I grieve for thee, when I remember thou haſt been for ſo long a time the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
covering of thoſe cares and thoughts that were forg'd in my head, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
tabernacle of my Doctrine. Do not weep for't, ſaies <hi>Anſelme,</hi> its hour was come.
'Twere to no purpoſe to erect a Monument for it, as we ſhould have done for you,
when we gave you for loſt. Beſides, why will you not be comforted, ſince you are
promis'd a better? <hi>Carmelin</hi> having recollected himſelf a little, reſumes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
thus, But that hat, what ſhall it be made of, Maſter, <hi>Fine Wool?</hi> He had not
the ſeaſure to finiſh what he intended to have ſaid; nor had <hi>Anſelme</hi> the time to
anſwer him, for they all broke out into laughter; eſpecially <hi>Montenor,</hi> who knew
that <hi>Anſelme</hi> by the Fathers ſide came of a race of Merchants, and that <hi>Cloath</hi> and
<hi>Wool</hi> had been the foundation of his <hi>Nobility. Lyſis</hi> deſirous to end the laughter:
The error was, ſaies he, for want of a Comma or Parentheſis in the Period. Hear'ſt
thou <hi>Carmelin?</hi> obſerve it, that thy tranſpoſition be not deficient.</p>
            <p>The diſcourſe of the Maſter was thought as pleaſant as that of his man, becauſe
his words came out with a certain accent, that gave them great weight. <hi>Carmelin</hi>
himſelf was pleas'd with it: but when <hi>Clarimond</hi> was come home, he made him
a much more joyful man, by giving him the hat he had promis'd him, which was
better then his own, though not much. They told him, that if he eſteemed pieces
of Antiquity, that was a thing worthy as fair a Cabinet as any medal in the world.
He was almoſt out of himſelf for joy; for if he grieved for the other hat, 'twas
only becauſe he had no great hope of this. Notwithſtanding all this, he goes to
his Maſter, to deſire him to deſcribe unto him by name and cloathes all the <hi>Rural
Deities,</hi> that ſo he might know who had done him the moſt miſchief. It was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that it was the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> and <hi>Lucida,</hi> but as for <hi>Synopa,</hi> ſhe had not
given him one ſtroke, nay, ſtood at a diſtance, all the while he ſuffered the laſh.
O! what a great myſtery is there hidden under that, ſays <hi>Lyſis</hi> to him; thou haſt
ground to believe that <hi>Synopa</hi> is of a very amorous diſpoſition: ſhe hath diſcover'd
her paſſion for me, but perceiving that I always disdain'd her, ſhe will henceforward
adore no merit but thine. I did much inſpect it, and it is my opinion, ſhe never
look'd on thee as an indifferent perſon; ſo that now I will ſhew thee how I intend
to bring thee quite out of this trouble! Put the caſe it was ſhe committed the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony
on thy hat, thou muſt imagine it was for no other reaſon but to keep it inſtead
of a favour. I remember <hi>Charite</hi> took away one of my ſhoes upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
I know not what love you mean, replies <hi>Carmelin:</hi> why did ſhe not aſſiſt
me then? ſpeak no more of her; I do not like her humour. If I muſt have a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs;
be it that Shepherdeſs whom you ſpoke to me of heretofore. <hi>Charite</hi> hath a
companion called <hi>Jacquelina,</hi> ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> I meant her. Thou ſhouldſt love her, were
there no other reaſon but becauſe ſhe hath a fine name, and becauſe thou canſt make
a very quaint alluſion thereon; ſaying ſhe is called <hi>Jacquelina,</hi> becauſe ſhe is as
'twere a <hi>Javelin,</hi> wherewith love ſtrikes hearts through. Beſides, when thy Hiſtory
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43725:96"/>
ſhall be written, it will be a handſom title for it, <hi>The Loves of Carmelin and Jaque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina.</hi>
There is a ſympathie between the two names, as there is a conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
your two hearts; and when I have any leiſure, I promiſe thee to find out
ſome fortunate <hi>Anagram upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he ſaid this, he heard <hi>Anſelme</hi> propoſing to <hi>Clarimond</hi> a viſit in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
to <hi>Leonora.</hi> Take heart! all goes with us, ſays he to <hi>Carmelin:</hi> Here thou
haſt an occaſion to ſee thy new Miſtreſs; but thou muſt not go thither unprepared:
thou ſpeak'ſt a many good things, but they are not always to the purpoſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
thou doſt not pronounce well. I will teach thee the method of diſcourſe, and
the graces of geſture and pronunciation.</p>
            <p>This was ſpoken very ſoftly; and immediately after our two Shepherds went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a little chamber on one ſide of the hall, where <hi>Lyſis</hi> being ſeated in a chair, and
<hi>Carmelin</hi> ſtanding before him, he gave him his firſt leſſon. Seeing it is of much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
in Love to have a pleaſing way of acceſs, and that the countenance hath
ſometimes more charms then the words, thou muſt be very carefull and obſervant
of thine, when thou art before thy <hi>Shepherdeſs.</hi> If thou haſt a clean handkerchiff
about thee, 'tis my advice thou have it always in thy hand; thoſe that <hi>declaim</hi> ever
have one, nay the very <hi>Players</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> are not without one on the Stage. Now
theſe are they thou muſt imitate; for if they do not things as they are done, they
do them at leaſt as they ſhould be. Nor were it amiſs to have a little neat Beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruſh
to turn up the Muſchato now and then: But above all, a man never ought to
be without a Comb in his pocket, I mean theſe Horn-combs that your preſent Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
carry about them to comb out their hair. You deſire (it ſeems) I ſhould never
have my head without horns, ſays <hi>Carmelin.</hi> Take it not in that ſenſe, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
it may happen to thee: I have one of thoſe Combs at <hi>Montenor's;</hi> and I tell thoſe
that ſee me make uſe of it, that it is made of the <hi>horns</hi> of thoſe I have made <hi>cuckolds,</hi>
and thus the jeſt muſt be retorted back. This I grant you, ſays <hi>Carmelin:</hi> but to
what purpoſe muſt I ever have a handkerchiff in my hand? I may be taken for
ſome Snottypack; and the Bruſh in like manner would denote the foulneſs of my
Beard, ſince it required ſo frequent bruſhing. If thou wilt not obſerve theſe nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
be ſure thou haſt excellent diſcourſes, and uſe the moſt inſinuating forms of
ſpeaking, and the moſt approved by the Gallants. As for example, if thou wouldſt
ſay, that thou comeſt out of the company of men that were in a good humour, thou
muſt ſay, I have left the converſation of ſome <hi>faces of good humours.</hi> Men do not
ſpeak only to faces, ſays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> but to perfect men. It matters not, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
that's the manner of ſpeaking, if a man will go according to the mode: And 'tis
ſaid every foot, How long is't ſince you ſaw that <hi>face?</hi> That <hi>face</hi> would have quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel'd
with me: 'Tis a very proper, neat ſpeech. Moreover if ſome would carry thee
to a place whither thou wouldſt not go, thou muſt ſay, <hi>I am your humble ſervant
as to that houſe: I am an humble ſervant to that viſit,</hi> that is to ſay, I am not for it.
And if they ſhould tell thee it were to hear good muſick, thou muſt anſwer, <hi>I kiſs
your hands as to muſick</hi> this day. If it be ask'd whether thou play'ſt well on the Lute,
<hi>I break not my head with Crotchets, nor prick my ſelf to play on that Inſtrument.</hi>
I ſhould willingly ſpeak in that manner, ſays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> yet I apprehend not what it
ſignifies; For muſt a man <hi>prick</hi> himſelf in the breech with a pin or an awl, to ſtir
him up to play on the Lute? And as for your <hi>Kiſs your hands,</hi> and <hi>Your humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi>
may they be ſaid to a <hi>Houſe,</hi> or to <hi>Muſick,</hi> which have no hands, and care
not for our ſervices? All this is ſpoken, and is very elegant, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> you hear
nothing elſe in the <hi>Louure,</hi> and in all other Courtly places. If thou haſt overreach'd
any one, or put a handſom gull upon him, thou muſt ſay, <hi>I have plaid him an excellent
piece;</hi> for that's now all the phraſe. The <hi>pieces</hi> you will have me <hi>play,</hi> ſays <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
ſhall they be <hi>Tragicomedies</hi> or <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> or ſhall they be ſome <hi>Pieces</hi> to be plaid on
the Lute? That were not amiſs, if thou couldſt do it, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Yet I take not
theſe things in that ſenſe, I mean the playing of ſome <hi>fourbe</hi> or over-reaching trick
in a company; and there's as much ſubtilty required to do that, as to play a piece
on the Stage. But to return to our Phraſes, there are yet others as exquiſite and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43725:97"/>
curious as theſe; but I ſhall teach thee no more at preſent, then that thou muſt ſay
at every word, that thy Miſtreſs is a <hi>raviſhing</hi> treature. That's very proper to be
ſaid of <hi>Synopa,</hi> replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> ſhe takes whatever's in her way, ſhe hath raviſh'd
away my old Hat; ſhe is as raviſhing as a Bird of prey, or a Wolf. 'Tis not to be
taken in that <hi>bias,</hi> ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> When a <hi>Beauty</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>raviſhing,</hi> the meaning
is, that it is full of charms, allurements, and attractions; and if thou pleaſe, thou
mayſt ſay that thy Shepherdeſs hath a <hi>raviſhing</hi> countenance. Thou mayſt make
thy advantage of theſe <hi>French</hi> phraſes, according as occaſion ſhall require; and
thou art to repreſent to thy ſelf, that there is not in <hi>Paris</hi> any deſpicable Fellow that
pretends to the qualities of a Gentleman, no nor any contemptible Cockney-baſtard,
but hath them, when he is to put his beſt ſide outward. 'Tis not to be wondred at
that I ſhould know all this; for though I was ever very ſtudious, yet at certain
times I kept good company, and this was the manner of ſpeaking among the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantillo's;</hi> if thou wilt have the reputation of a Carpet-Knight, thou muſt imitate
thoſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin,</hi> without any further conteſtation, fell to ruminate on his inſtructions;
and <hi>Lyſis</hi> having gotten pen and ink, thought fit to give him ſome amorous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
in writing, beſides this language <hi>a-la-mode</hi> wherewith he entertain'd him, which
was only for familiar diſcourſes. He therefore dreſs'd him a fine Complement; and
having given it him, bid him learn it by heart. I ſhall have it preſently, replies he
after he had ſeen it, for I have read it in ſome book heretofore. It's never the worſe
for that, replies <hi>Lyſis: Novices</hi> in <hi>Love,</hi> as thou art, muſt follow the Books in all
things. Let's ſee if thou haſt a good memory. There are but three periods; tell me
the firſt, and imagine thou wert ſpeaking to thy Miſtreſs. Whereupon <hi>Carmelin</hi>
without any previous ceremony began thus. <hi>Fair Shepherdeſſe! ſince a fortunate
lot hath brought me hither, and that your eyes give me no wound but ſuch as are dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
to me, I muſt needs avow it to you, that I am ſurpris'd by thoſe attractions,
which, notwithſtanding all reſiſtance, I ſhall be ſure to ſuffer under.</hi> 'Tis very well, ſays
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> thou haſt not miſt a ſyllable; but yet I obſerved thou hadſt a corner of thy
eye in the paper; beſides there is ſomwhat in it more then ſpeaking, the action is all
in all: In the firſt place put off thy hat, then make a conge <hi>a-la-mode,</hi> carry thy
eyes languiſhingly; and moving thy right hand as it were in meaſure, put the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger
to the thumb, as the <hi>Orators</hi> do in their <hi>declamations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſo ſaying <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſhewed him all thoſe geſtures, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> imitated them the
beſt he could: But his maſter told him he muſt ſpeak at the ſame time; ſo that he
began anew thus. <hi>Fair Shepherdeſs! ſince an unfortunate</hi> Sot <hi>hath brought me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that your eyes give me no wounds but ſuch as are</hi> deteſtable <hi>to me, I muſt
vow to you that I am ſo ſurpriſed with your</hi> detractions, <hi>that in ſpight of all</hi> aſſiſtance
<hi>I ſhall ſuffer under them.</hi> I know not how <hi>Lyſis</hi> had the patience to hear out his
diſcourſe without beating him. At laſt he cries out, Great aſs! what an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
haſt thou ſpoken? thou haſt made more faults then thou haſt pronounced
words: 'Twould make good ſport to hear thee ſay ſo to thy Miſtreſs. What will you
have me do, Maſter? replies <hi>Carmelin:</hi> The fear of miſſing cauſes me to make ſo many
faults; and I ſo much ſtudy the grace of the geſture, that I forget the diſcourſe:
the likeneſs of the words makes me take one for another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> bid him ſtudy it longer, and he afterwards repeated it again: He was not
much out as to the words; but for countenance, he obſerv'd none at all; and was
all the time in ſuch an unhandſom poſture, that his Maſter chid him ſtill. There's the
misfortune, ſays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> when I think on the <hi>words,</hi> I forget the <hi>grace:</hi> But let's
begin again; I'll repeat it ſo often, that I will not miſs any thing. So he began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
but he was much out in the diſcourſe, and there was ſtill ſomwhat amiſs in
him: For when he ſtudied the action, he forgot the words; and when he ſtudied
the words, he forgot the action. So that <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſeeing his labour loſt, bid him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
him of a Complement to his Miſtreſs according to his own fancie, ſeeing it was
but time loſt to ſhew him any thing. <hi>Anſelme,</hi> who was in the hall, had overheard
part of the Dialogue at the chamber-door, which he thought very pleaſant, at
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43725:97"/>
length he enters the room, as <hi>Lyſis</hi> was ſaying to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that he wonder'd how
he could remember the diſcourſes he knew on ſeveral ſubjects, ſeeing it was ſuch a
task to him to overcome ſeven or eight common words. What I have hath coſt me
much pains, replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> and not to diſſemble with you, I tell you it hath been
beaten into my head as 'twere with mallets: I muſt have a moneth to learn a line;
but in recompence, when it is once in my head, 'tis as ſure as the ſcurf that's inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
from it. No, no, thou art an ignorant Fellow, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I have been much
deceiv'd in thee. Pardon him for this time, ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> he'll learn better another:
There are ſome dayes that our memories are aſleep, and that our mind executes not
its functions freely. I ſhall take it ſo for your ſake, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> perhaps the
vexations he hath gone through, have offuſcated his underſtanding. We muſt hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
conceive he will be another man then what he hath been; for to be in <hi>love,</hi>
is an advantagious means to become <hi>learned.</hi> I have read in a certain book, that
Love is <hi>Maſter</hi> of all <hi>Arts;</hi> and I know by experience that it purifies the mind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly.
'Tis very true, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> but if you deſire the reputation of <hi>learned,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bring an authority without quoting it. I am content, ſays <hi>Anſelme:</hi> who as he
had a very good memory, recited a diſcourſe to that purpoſe which he had taken
out of a late book, wherein there was ſo much naturalneſs, that all were infinitely
pleas'd with it.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe ended, <hi>Clarimond</hi> comes in and tels them that they muſt make haſte
to dine. There was brought from <hi>Montenor's</hi> abundance of Poultry and Fowl; ſo
that <hi>Carmelin,</hi> whom they diſpos'd at the Maſters table, thought he ſaw the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of thoſe delights which <hi>Lyſis</hi> had promis'd him. After dinner he was taken
into the coach with the reſt, whereat he was alſo infinitely pleaſed, for he had never
been ſo honourably waſted in his life. Being come to <hi>Orontes's,</hi> the Gentlemen
kiſs'd the Ladies, and <hi>Lyſis</hi> did the ſame, but he durſt not kiſs <hi>Charite,</hi> becauſe the
reſt had not kiſs'd her, and that in this caſe he would not go beyond their example.
It was not their cuſtom to kiſs Chambermrids, and the Shepherd much wonder'd at
it: But if they had done it, and that he had done the like, the favour he ſhould have
obtained would have been accompanied with a regret to ſee others receive the like.
While he was thus taken up, <hi>Hircan</hi> related his metamorphoſis, and how he had
reſtor'd him to his former ſhape. That gave <hi>Angelica</hi> occaſion to put a many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
to <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and among others, ſhe ask'd him whether the Trees led a pleaſant
life, or no. For my part, anſwers he, I aſſure you I was not weary of it; nor fear'd
I any thing but leſt <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſhould cut down ſome of my boughs to make Chairs
of, for he hath ſometimes been a Joyner: And accordingly I ſhould have given him
notice, that if there were an extreme neceſſity to take away ſome bough from
me, it might not be employed otherwiſe then to make my Miſtreſs a Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Lyſis</hi> had related in what manner he had entertained this <hi>Carmelin</hi>
into his ſervice, and how that he hoped to make him as honeſt a Shepherd as any in
<hi>France,</hi> he bid him draw neer; and <hi>Orontes</hi> having view'd him well, ſwore he knew
that face, that he had ſeen it ſomwhere, and that he thought it might be at <hi>Troyes.</hi>
It may be you take him for <hi>Paris</hi> who was the Judge of the three Goddeſſes, and
think he is a <hi>Trojan,</hi> ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> but he is not, he told me he was of <hi>Lyons,</hi> which
was ſome reaſon that I made him my companion; believing that <hi>Lyons</hi> being neer
<hi>Forreſts,</hi> there might come good Shepherds thence. I do not mean great <hi>Troy,</hi>
replies <hi>Orontes,</hi> I ſpeak of <hi>Troy</hi> in <hi>Champaigne:</hi> And ſeeing we are ſo far engag'd
in the diſcourſe, I'll tell you what I know of him. Being about a year ſince in that
City, I went to a Stationers to enquire for a certain book I wanted: While I was
ſpeaking with him in the ſhop, I heard a voyce from an upper-chamber, that ſaid,
Maſter, I am come to the moneth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> what ſhall I put down? <hi>Warm rains,</hi>
anſwers the Stationer. I thereupon look'd up, and through a little trap-door per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
ſomwhat of a man: I thought I ſhould have ſeen the Gods talking from their
ſeveral heavens; as if <hi>Mars</hi> ask'd the <hi>Sun</hi> what weather it ſhould be, and how he
ſhould direct his courſe. I went up to ſee who it was that had ſpoken, and it was
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43725:98"/>
this brave <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who help'd the Stationer to make an <hi>Almanack:</hi> I leave it to
be conſidered if it muſt not be well done, ſince it was their invention, and that the
predictions came out their brains. I do not deny that I have liv'd with that Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,
not knowing what to do, ſays <hi>Carmelin:</hi> but you are to take notice that he
hath rais'd him a good fortune by his Almanacks, and therefore he is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided.
When he married, he was ſo poor, that the Prieſt being come to beſtow a
benediction on his bed, found none in the chamber. Father! ſays the woman, caſt
ſome Holy-water in this corner, we ſhall have anon a bundle of ſtraw. But ſince
that time they have done very well; and had it not been my deſire to ſee the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that made me leave them, I might haply have advanc'd my ſelf as well as they.
'Tis true, I have heard ſay that now they are fallen into the ſame poſture again; yet
I am aſſured they make a ſhift to keep houſe together, but that they ſell away by
peeces what's left. It ſeems we ſhall find it at laſt the high-way to the Hoſpital, to
live with ſuch people, (ſays <hi>Florida,</hi> laughing at theſe pleaſant paſſages:) You have
now met with a better Maſter; and I believe, ſince he knows you to be expert in
making <hi>Almanacks,</hi> he will employ you to calculate his Nativity. Believe it not, fair
Lady! replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I am not born either under the Signs of <hi>Cancer</hi> or <hi>Capricorn;</hi>
I am born under that of <hi>Charite's</hi> Eyes, whoſe <hi>influences</hi> I know better then any
<hi>Aſtrologer:</hi> Thoſe two bright Stars which are poſited in the Heaven of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
are a new <hi>Gemini,</hi> better then that in the Zodiake, and was never yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by the Speculators of the Second cauſes. How can you be born under the
Sign of <hi>Charite's</hi> Eyes, replies <hi>Florida,</hi> ſince ſhe is younger then you? That's your
miſtake, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> As <hi>Charite</hi> is immortal, and ſhall never know end, ſo never
had ſhe beginning; and thought it be but nineteen or twenty years that ſhe hath
been on earth, yet ſhe was before in the heavens. I am very ſorry ſuch a fair Lady
as you are, ſhould be ignorant of any thing ſhe ſhould know.</p>
            <p>While he was taken up in this diſcourſe, <hi>Hircan</hi> had done relating to the reſt
what had happened between the <hi>Shepherd</hi> and the <hi>rural Deities,</hi> repeating the very
ſtories they had told him word for word. So that <hi>Lyſis</hi> turning towards him, ſays,
And who, prethee, hath told thee all theſe particulars? But 'tis true, thou art a
<hi>Magician,</hi> and there is nothing in the world hidden from thee. But 'tis to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
replies <hi>Angelica,</hi> we believe nothing of all he ſays: Who could believe there
were any Nymphs of the woods &amp; waters? I have often been in the fields, and have
ſometimes been in the water, but could never meet with either of them. What, will
you alſo declare your want of learning! ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Know then that the Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
not to mortals becauſe of their ſins; and that it is not now as it was in the firſt
Age, wherein Innocencie reign'd, and that they appeared openly, and in a manner
liv'd and converſed with us. But for the good of mankind, <hi>I</hi> have an incomparable
deſign for to recover the loſt felicity. Hearken therefore all you that are preſent,
and <hi>I</hi> would to god <hi>I</hi> might be heard to the four quarters of the earth what <hi>I</hi> am
going to tell you! And that is, that <hi>I</hi> have undertaken to reduce the <hi>Golden Age.</hi>
There are a many who would adviſe the King in ſome things that might be for the
peace of the people, but there is no advice neer mine: Seeing <hi>Charite</hi> is come to
live in <hi>Brie,</hi> there by my means ſhall the celeſtial benediction be firſt poured out:
All ſhall live after my example; and the Gods obſerving the purity of our ſouls,
ſhall baniſh hence all thoſe evils that <hi>Pandora</hi> hath ſown here: it ſhall be always
<hi>fair weather;</hi> we ſhall have the <hi>fruits</hi> of the Earth, without manuring it; all <hi>Rocks</hi>
ſhall be full of <hi>Pearls</hi> and <hi>precious ſtones;</hi> there ſhall be no place ſo <hi>deſart,</hi> where
there ſhall not be ſets of <hi>Thyme</hi> and <hi>Marjerom; Brooks</hi> of <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>milk</hi> ſhall run
through the meadows; our Rams ſhall have <hi>horns</hi> of <hi>Diamant,</hi> and our Sheep have
<hi>fleeces</hi> of fine <hi>Silk</hi> of all colours.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe of <hi>Lyſis</hi> was heard with great ſilence; only <hi>Clarimond</hi> at the end
broke out into a laughter. What do you laugh at? ſays the <hi>Shepherd</hi> to him. What
ſhould <hi>I</hi> laugh at, but your ſelf? replies <hi>Clarimond:</hi> You, and the reſt of your
profeſſion, the <hi>Poets,</hi> are all Fools with your <hi>Golden Age:</hi> Granting it were not a
Fable, you ſpeak ſuch things of it, as, if they were true, would not make it ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43725:98"/>
as that wherein we live. Is not the year more pleaſant having four ſeaſons, then
if it had but one, as the Spring or Autumn? And if there were none but precious
ſtones, would not that be a great inconvenience? As for your brooks of milk and
wine, they are ſufficiently ridiculous; for whence ſhould they take their Springs? muſt
we milk all the kine in the Country, and let out all the tuns of wine in one place, that
ſo we might have rivers? and would you have no water at all? Are there not many
things wherein it is uſeful? <hi>I</hi> ſee no reaſon but you may as well promiſe us <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
of <hi>freſh butter,</hi> and <hi>green cheeſe; Rocks</hi> of <hi>Sugar-candy:</hi> that we might catch
<hi>Larks</hi> ready <hi>roaſted;</hi> that there ſhould be places where it ſhould rain <hi>Sweet-meats</hi>
and <hi>Confects;</hi> and <hi>Trees,</hi> whereon ſhould grow <hi>cloathes ready made.</hi> Theſe accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
are fit for a Country, whoſe inhabitants love to have things done to their
hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> had loſt <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s favor by this diſcourſe, had he not in the beginning
call'd him a <hi>Poet,</hi> whereat he was ſo ſatisfied, that he thought not on the reſt. He
was ſo well pleas'd to be ranked among thoſe honorable perſons, that he bit his
lips again, and his skin grew almoſt too narrow to contain him. <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſpake to
<hi>Clarimond</hi> for him, and ſhew'd him his error in blaming the delicacies of an age
that all men regretted. Thereupon turning to the Shepherd, he askes him, by what
means he thought to accompliſh his noble deſigns? What have <hi>I</hi> elſe to do but to
perſwade all my friends to become <hi>Shepherds,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> am, replies <hi>Lyſis?</hi> 'Tis true, you
and <hi>Montenor</hi> have already denied me; and as for <hi>Clarimond,</hi> he ſeems not to be
much enclined to it. However, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not want companions, there are at preſent
a many good wits in <hi>France.</hi> I'll furniſh you with an excellent invention, ſaies <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond,</hi>
you muſt addreſs your ſelf to the <hi>Poets,</hi> and makers of <hi>Romances,</hi> who are
now in <hi>Paris:</hi> They are thoſe that ſpeak of <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and are oblig'd to be ſuch,
thereby to effectuate the rare things, wherewith they have filled their books, or elſe
we muſt take them for fools and madmen. That <hi>I</hi> was thinking on, ſays <hi>Lyſis, I</hi>
cannot finde any people fitter for my purpoſe. And the more eaſiely to draw them
in, <hi>I</hi> promiſe them all their firſt Shepherds cloathes.</p>
            <p>That's the way indeed to oblige them, ſays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> for they would not only
turn Shepherds, but Turks if need were for a ſuit of cloathes. They have ever been
a ſort of wretches; and to begin with their Prince <hi>Orpheus,</hi> he was ſo beggarly, that
the very day of his wedding he had not wherewithal to give his wife a pair of ſhoes;
ſo that as ſhe danc'd barefoot in a meadow, a Serpent ſtung her in the heel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſhe dyed. There was never any ſince that made verſes, but hath been poor, or
had a deſire to be ſo. I know means to inrich all thoſe that are of that noble quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I ſhall require nothing of them but their obedience. Now as ſoon
as they ſhall come to me, I ſhall preſently propoſe unto them the Inſtitutions of an
<hi>Amorous</hi> and <hi>Paſtoral Republique:</hi> I will found an <hi>Vniverſity,</hi> whereof they ſhall
be the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors.</hi> The moſt able man among them ſhall be the <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi>
and there ſhall be nothing read to the Students, but <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Romances.</hi>
They ſhall learn <hi>Ovids Epiſtles, Diana, Aſtrea,</hi> and they ſhall do <hi>exerciſes,</hi> and take
<hi>degrees</hi> in <hi>love,</hi> inſtead of doing it in the <hi>Law,</hi> as at <hi>Orleance.</hi> Yong men and maids
ſhall go pell mell to this School, and there ſhall thenceforth be baniſh'd from among
us all ignorance and incivility. Upon this, <hi>Carmelin</hi> comes and ſaies to him, Maſter,
give me leave to tell you, that for to get the more Scholars, it were not amiſs to
put up Bills all about <hi>Paris.</hi> He that hath taught me ſo much learning, us'd this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
&amp; was ſo afraid I ſhould paſs by ſome place when I poſted them, that he viſited
the ſtreets ends, to ſee if they were beſtow'd in eminent places. Sometimes he ſtood
by to watch them, and if there came a miſchievous Lacquay by, that had an itch to
tear them off, he would be ſure to get a good rap over the pate for his pains. One
time, without heeding much what I did, I paſted up one the clean contrary way, ſo
that a man that would have read it, muſt have gone and looked out at the Chamber
window that was above: That angred him ſo, that he never wiſhed me well ſince.
All men are equally deſirous to propagate their fame, ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and I aſſure thee,
that I have heard ſay, that one of our moſt <hi>Famous Authors,</hi> who is ſo rich that he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43725:99"/>
needs not go a foot, was in the ſame manner well pleas'd to ſee his name at every
corner, and rode on horſe-back up and down <hi>Paris</hi> to ſee it on the day he had a
Book to come out. Thou underſtandeſt this buſineſs very well, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and I
will follow thy advice, but not altogether as thou conceiveſt: for it is no mercenary
expectation makes me do any thing. Since the City of <hi>Paris</hi> is a place, where there
are a many people of quality and honeſty, and that <hi>I</hi> am not generally known of
all, <hi>I</hi> will ſend thither to have ſome Bills printed, and paſted up and down, which
ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat to this purpoſe:</p>
            <q>

                        <p>THis is to acquaint all whom it concerns, That in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Brie,</hi> there is a <hi>Shepherd</hi> called <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who

demanding any money or other recompence: And that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
of what condition ſoever they be, ſhall be entertained by
him at the foreſaid place; and to ſhew the perfection of his
Knowledge, he will teach them how to live without any <hi>care</hi>
or <hi>pains,</hi> reducing among them the <hi>Golden-age.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He lodges at <hi>Bertrands</hi> a Vine-dreſſerner <hi>Clarimonds</hi> Caſtle.</p>

            </q>
            <p>O how handſom will this appear under that of the Players, they being both to the
ſame purpoſe, ſays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> There cannot many eſcape the baits of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and you will have more Diſciples them ever <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had. But your muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
that the credulous and ſimple people take you not for a <hi>Mountebank,</hi> like
the <hi>Jew</hi> who was burnt a while ſince, that in his publike Bills promis'd his Schollers
Golden Mountains, but at his lodging entertain'd them with nothing but vain and
pernicious Lectures. Or I ſhould rather fear, that your Bills would be thought like
thoſe of the Fryers of <hi>Roſecroix,</hi> who ſpoke <hi>all</hi> Languages, and deliver'd men from
<hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> As for thoſe <hi>Doctors,</hi> 'tis well remembred, ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> being
informed that they never fail'd to come to thoſe who would ſpeak with them, I have
gone out purpoſely divers times for to meet with them, and have expected them
every where. If I heard ſome uncertain noiſe, I thought it was one of them; and
though I ſaw no body, yet <hi>I</hi> went on ſtill in my interrogations; becauſe it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that they became inviſible. You are not alone deceiv'd in this caſe, ſaies
<hi>Orontes,</hi> but <hi>I</hi>'ll tell you a thing, which <hi>I</hi> wiſh all <hi>France</hi> knew for its deliverance
from theſe falſe opinions. Being once engag'd in a debauch at <hi>Paris,</hi> with ſeven or
eight of my friends, one of them, to finde the world talk, went and writ the Placard
of the Fryers of the <hi>Roſecroix,</hi> who have made ſo much noiſe in the world, and
poſted it up at the corner of a ſtreet in the dark. Judge now whether this folly was
not a worthy employment for ſo many famous writers. A great piece of news in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but if it be granted that the Fraternity of our learned <hi>Inviſibles</hi>
be but an imaginary thing, <hi>I</hi> cannot chooſe but be ſorry for it; for what rare things
might a man do if he were of their ſect. A man might viſit his Miſtreſs in ſpight
of Friends and Rivals. Trouble not your ſelf for that, replies <hi>Clarimond:</hi> The
Poets whom you endeavour to imitate, promiſe as ſtrange things as thoſe unknown
Philoſophers. They ſpeak altogether by miracles and Metamorphoſes. You would
do me a favour to bring them hither, for <hi>I</hi> have ſome things of no ſmall conſequence
to tell them. Alas! what quarrel have you with them? ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> know you not,
replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that before a man enters into a ſect or profeſſion of Religion, he
confers with the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> or the <hi>Miniſters?</hi> in like manner, before <hi>I</hi> turn
<hi>Shepherd,</hi> I would ſpeak with thoſe Soveraign Maſters of this Art, that <hi>I</hi> might be
convinc'd as to certain ſcruples which trouble my minde. But perhaps you'll tell me
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43725:99"/>
you are as able as they to ſolve all arguments; but you are not, you are but their
diſciple, and I cannot be ſatisfied with what you might alledge. Tell me at leaſt in
few words, what you could object againſt thoſe excellent ingenuities, replies <hi>Lyſis.</hi>
I ſhall freely do't, ſays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> And to begin with the ancient Poets, I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
as I have done before, that all their Fables are full of moſt ridiculous abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
they have invented a thouſand fopperies, according to the cuſtoms of the Ages
they lived in. If their times had been like ours, and had had the advantages of ſo
many inventions as we have, and that their Works were now to be compos'd, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi>
in ſtead of playing on the <hi>Harp,</hi> ſhould play on the <hi>Lute;</hi> and in ſtead of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Serpent <hi>Python</hi> with <hi>arrows,</hi> he ſhould have done it with a <hi>musket. Cupid,</hi>
in ſtead of his equipage of a <hi>bow</hi> and <hi>quiver,</hi> ſhould be accommodated with a Caſe
of Piſtols. Were I to have my mind, in ſtead of a <hi>torch</hi> he ſhould have a <hi>Fools bable</hi>
in his hand, for all his <hi>heat</hi> is but a fooliſh imagination. As for the <hi>Sun,</hi> in ſtead of
riding in a <hi>chariot,</hi> he ſhould ride in a <hi>coach,</hi> or haply he ſhould be diſpos'd into a
<hi>wheelbarrow:</hi> But the imagination were yet more excellent, if it were ſuppoſed
that that Luminous globe which lights us, were one of the wheels of it. As for <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi>
who is very ſlow of motion, he ſhould be carried in a <hi>Sedan,</hi> like an old man
that were ſick of the Gout. In the ſame manner ſhould all the reſt of the Gods be
accoutred; and I am troubled with a little itch to reform all their fables, that ſo
they might be <hi>a la mode,</hi> and that people might underſtand ſomwhat out of them.</p>
            <p>Having ſhewed you the folly of the ancient Poets, I am now to ſpeak of that of
our modern ones. They conceit themſelves very learned, if they diſcover but a touch
or alluſion to ſome ancient fable; and in their <hi>Romances</hi> they think they appear
very able men, if they can but bring in the Ceremonies, Sacrifices, and Religion of
the falſe Gods. The relation of the terrors of barbarous Nations, is it not an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ornament to a Book, and have we not great neceſſity to burthen our minds with
the knowledge of them? Why may we not as well have <hi>Romances</hi> of all the falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
of the <hi>Indies?</hi> Yet want there not at this preſent a many able Wits, that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themſelves to be carried away with the torrent of this inconſideracie; and like
as ſheep caſt themſelves down where they have ſeen others to fall before, ſo they
think themſelves excuſed if they erre by <hi>imitation,</hi> never tasking themſelves with
any ſerious inquiſition into things; and cannot write three lines, but they talk as
confidently of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> as if we lived in the time of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> Beſides
theſe, there are other extravagances in <hi>Romances,</hi> which I ſhall more particularly
ſift out in a Cenſure I intend of them.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>ſneaking</hi> Poems which we are furniſh'd with by thoſe who have not
ſo much ſtrength of ſpirit as to undertake any thing that requires a longer breath,
and beſtow three moneths on a Sonnet, O God! can there be any thing in the world
more unprofitable, or more contemptible? Thoſe who make it their buſineſs, are
they not much in the right, to think that a flat dull diſcourſe becomes very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
if it can but be put in verſe? And can they imagine that <hi>Rhiming,</hi> which is not
only a vice in our Proſe, but alſo even in Latine Verſes, is ſo much to be eſteemed,
that they muſt preſently deſerve Crowns of Laurel for having been a little fortunate
therein? But indeed Rhiming is nought elſe but a barbarous ornament of corrupt
and imperfect Languages; and I durſt maintain, it is the greateſt argument in the
world of a low and cowardly mind, to ſpend a whole life in <hi>filing</hi> and <hi>licking</hi> of
<hi>Verſes.</hi> Beſides, the preſent Authors betray ſo little capacity, that if by a ſolemn
Edict it were forbidden them to uſe the words <hi>Fate, Chance, Charms, Smiles, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Love,</hi> and ſome others, which muſt not fail to ſerve any where, though there be
no need, unleſs it be to make up the meaſure and to rime, I would forfeit my life if
they could ever make Ode or Sonnet. And if ever they betray any ſharpneſs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
'tis but an <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> which had been uſed a hundred thouſand times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
as it may be ſomwhat about <hi>Roſes</hi> and <hi>Thorns, Fire</hi> and <hi>Ice, Night</hi> and <hi>Day,</hi> the
<hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Stars:</hi> Or elſe they are ſure to period with an <hi>Hyperbole.</hi> It comes not
once into their imagination, that <hi>Poetry</hi> ought to have other ornaments then theſe;
for they think it a matter of reputation never to have read any good book, which
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43725:100"/>
haply would have made them more capable: And if their invention be delivered of
any thing above common, it is ſome rugged imagination which the <hi>Clown</hi> in the Play
would have been aſham'd to have ſaid, nay, and would bluſh at it, were't not that his
face is powdered. And this is part of what I ſhould repreſent unto them; and when
they ſhall learn what remains, there will be a neceſſity they ſhould defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and convince me of ſome opinions, if they deſire I ſhould enter into their
<hi>Caballe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Clarimond</hi> had here ended his diſcourſe, <hi>Lyſis</hi> told him that thoſe
he challeng'd were able enough to anſwer him, and that they would do it when they
were come into <hi>Brie</hi> as he expected; but that which he moſt doubted was, that they
were ſo enchanted with the pleaſures of the Court, that they could by no means
leave it. Baniſh that belief out of your mind, replies <hi>Clarimond:</hi> 'Tis true indeed
they do haunt <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Courts,</hi> and have not any thing elſe to do but as ſo many
Spies to enquire who is newly in favour with the King, or if any one be upon mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
that they may make Verſes on thoſe occaſions. But when they have given their
diurnal attendance, and made their utmoſt advantages of theſe opportunities, and
written on all theſe fine occaſions, men contemn them as an unprofitable ſort of
people. Theſe brave Saleſmen of <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Fame,</hi> promiſe immortality, diſpoſe
Empires as they pleaſe; and as they preſent nothing but ſmoke, ſo are they paid in
the ſame coin. To be ſhort, you may be ſure that after they have haunted <hi>great</hi>
houſes, they muſt take up their lodging in the <hi>ſmall</hi> ones, I mean thoſe of the <hi>Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</hi>
Nor indeed is it long ſince, upon an occaſion of ſecuring all beggers, the Beadles
found in the ſtreet one of this famous tribe, and carried him thither: But there riſe
a great debate, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the ſilly Wretch ſhould be diſpoſed among the poor,
or among the mad, becauſe he ſeemed to be both: At laſt a Gentleman that chanced
to be preſent, deliver'd him, and made him his domeſtick Fool. Gentle Shepherd,
(ſays <hi>Anſelme</hi> to <hi>Lyſis)</hi> you kdow well where thoſe <hi>ſmall houſes</hi> are, which are
quoted to you: I remember your Couſin <hi>Adrian</hi> threatned to lodge you there
when you diſobey'd him: I would gladly know how you would look if you were
there; would you take for <hi>Shepherdeſſes</hi> all thoſe good old wives that are there?
would you entertain them with amorous complements? Go and ſeek who ſhould
anſwer thee, diſcourteous friend! ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> thy interrogatories are odious. I pray
excuſe the freedom I have taken, replies <hi>Anſelme,</hi> and go on in your diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Poets.</hi> I'll no more of that neither, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> whether they be ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
or no, the condition of <hi>Shepherdry</hi> is never the worſe: Good things muſt not
be eſteemed ill, for having been ill deſcribed.</p>
            <p>This entertainment being ended, every one entred into ſomwhat more particular,
even to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who had the means and opportunity to ſet upon <hi>Charite.</hi> He was ſo
much the more confident to ſpeak to her, becauſe ſhe ſometimes look'd on him
ſmilingly? Are you not then the ſame cruel one ſtill, who diſdain my ſervices? ſays
he to her: Are you no longer offended with me? My anger uſes not to continue
ſo long, anſwers ſhe. Then am I obliged to heaven, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> you have done
what prudence it ſelf ought to have done: If I have at other times offended you, I
will do it no more henceforward; and I will live with you as modeſtly as if I were
to converſe with a Nun, untill ſuch time as the ſweet tye of marriage ſhall open the
gate of my affections. And that is the reaſon that I now make my humble ſuit to
you, that you will be pleaſed to impoſe what laws you think good on me, and I ſhall
obſerve them. Conſider, my fair one! what commands do you lay on me? I am
ready to obey you. I have not ſo great a power over you, ſays <hi>Charite;</hi> I only
deſire you not to ſpeak to me but in private, becauſe my Ladies Brother in law
hath ever ſomwhat to ſay to me concerning your love. Your intreaties are to me
commands, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> Is there any thing elſe you would have me do? There is,
anſwers <hi>Charite;</hi> and that is, that you follow all the good counſel I ſhall give
you, leſt we both be laugh'd at. You might have ſpared that charge, replies
<hi>Lyſis;</hi> ſo far am I from wanting a faith for the oracles that proceed out of your
mouth.</p>
            <pb n="152" facs="tcp:43725:100"/>
            <p>While the Shepherd was thus employ'd, <hi>Anſelme</hi> had gotten neer <hi>Angelica,</hi> for
to diſcover his affection unto her. But he receiv'd not from her the leaſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
anſwer. So that bethinking him ſhe might be ſtill in the opinion that he lov'd
<hi>Geneura,</hi> as ſhe had been inform'd before, he cauſed <hi>Montenor</hi> to advance, who from
one diſcourſe to another came to ſpeak of this his firſt Miſtreſs, making it appear
how her Servant had left her, and that ſhe was ſince married to another. However
<hi>Angelica</hi> perſiſted in her diſdains; and when <hi>Anſelme</hi> ever fell upon any demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the greatneſs of his affection, ſhe told him, that the paſſion which he
ſeem'd ſo ſenſible of, was as <hi>extravagant</hi> as that of <hi>Lyſis.</hi> You are too cruel if you
ſay ſo, (ſays <hi>Anſelme</hi> to her) for I do not think you believe it: You know that your
perfections never could raiſe in my ſoul any thoughts or deſires which were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate;
and as for my actions, they differ much from thoſe of our <hi>Shepherd.</hi>
The effects of Love are indeed divers, replies <hi>Angelica,</hi> but the folly of it is ever
alike.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe was broke off by the approach of <hi>Florida.</hi> But <hi>Anſelme</hi> beſetting
himſelf ſeriouſly to conſider, was much troubled to find out the cauſe why his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
treated him more diſdainfully then ordinary. He was not of thoſe Fools who
marry Wenches before they know whether they entertain them with any affection,
and are ever after upon the threſhold of divorce. He was reſolved to ſay nothing
to <hi>Leonora,</hi> till he were aſſured of her Daughters good will; and it was ſhe that he
would firſt gain, as being the place of moſt importance. He therefore reſolved to
make proviſion of Conſtancie for to perſevere in a ſuit, whereof he doubted not his
ſatisfaction if he brought it about.</p>
            <p>The time to depart being come, he went home in the Coach with <hi>Montenor,</hi> and
<hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Lyſis</hi> were of the company. As for <hi>Hircan,</hi> he rode home to his
own caſtle: And for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he being oblig'd to look after the Flock, which he
had left to the care of <hi>Bertrand's</hi> ſon, took his way to the Cottage, whither he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd,
and was much diſpleas'd that he was fain to go afoot, and alone. When <hi>Lyſis</hi>
was come to <hi>Montenor's,</hi> he told the company, that the reaſon of his coming thither
was to conſult with them, and conſider of the way which he ſhould take for to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
all the <hi>French</hi> his Countrymen with the pleaſures he promis'd them. <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
anſwered, There was no more to do but to write down the <hi>Si quis</hi> or Bill he
had dictated to him, and ſend it to ſome Printer at <hi>Paris;</hi> and that beſides, it were
not amiſs to direct a Letter to the <hi>Wits</hi> of the times, who are the firſt wheels that
put the affections of the people in motion. This advice being approved, <hi>Lyſis</hi> writ
his <hi>Si quis;</hi> and when he had done, this Letter.</p>

            <p>All this was fair writ over after ſupper, with a letter directed to one of the moſt
famous Printers in <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein <hi>Lyſis</hi> deſired him to print his <hi>Si quis,</hi> and to have
it ſtuck up in the ſtreets, and to deliver the other Miſſive to the WITS of the
time. The next day the packet was given to the Carrier of <hi>Coulommiers,</hi> who paſt
by the houſe <hi>Lyſis</hi> believing that his affairs were in a ſuccesful poſture, went
cheerfully into the coach for to return with <hi>Clarimond.</hi> He forgot not to take
with him all his Accountrements; and above all, the ſheephook which <hi>Montenor</hi> had
given him, But he preſented it afterward to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> reſerving to himſelf his own
<hi>Green-Gilt,</hi> at the end whereof he nailed a plate of iron, having found the card quite
torn and worn away. <hi>Clarimond</hi> remembring what buſineſs he had to do, ſuffer'd
him to wander the fields for to take his former exerciſe; and then it was that being
alone with <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he asked him a many queſtions: Haſt thou not ſeen the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
<hi>Charite?</hi> ſaid he to him: Is ſhe not the faireſt piece that ever nature
drew? but 'tis well remembred, thou hadſt ſeen her once before, when thou carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt
my Letter to her. <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who had taken <hi>Synopa</hi> for <hi>Charite,</hi> was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd
when he ſaw his Maſters true Miſtreſs, and had almoſt acknowledged his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
ſo that ſaies he, Pardon me there, I never ſaw her you ſpeak to me of till this
laſt time. Thou wert a lyar then, when thou toldſt me thou hadſt delivered her my
Letter, and that thou hadſt well conſidered her. Not ſo neither (replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
willing to repair his fault) I have always told you the truth, I thought I had ſeen
her the firſt time, though it were but as ſhe paſs'd by; but having yeſterday view'd
her at my leiſure, I found in her ſo many excellencies, which I had not obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that I thought I had never ſeen her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> was appeas'd, and much taken with this ſubtil evaſion. He afterward
asked <hi>Carmelin,</hi> whether he had ſeen the Miſtreſs he had a deſire to beſtow on him.
I did indeed ſee a great Swine of a ſervant-maid, called <hi>Jacquelina,</hi> but as for a
wench worthy to be my Miſtreſs, I have not ſeen any. Thou art very humourous,
but I'll not oppoſe my ſelf againſt it. It's a ſign thou beginneſt to take courage:
however, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not any more embark my ſelf in thy affections. Endeavor to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for thy ſelf, though art old enough. <hi>I</hi> ſee well where thy ſhoe pinces. Thou
ſtill grieveſt for the preſence of <hi>Synopa,</hi> that fair Nymph of the waters. The
Devil make a Gallows of her, if <hi>I</hi> ſo much as think on her, replies <hi>Carmelin:</hi> you
are to know that when <hi>I</hi> was come home laſt night, I related to our Land-Lord your
adventures, and my own. He was almoſt out of himſelf, when <hi>I</hi> told him of thoſe
dances and banquets in the night with fair Ladies, and men with great beards, that
could not ſpeak. He told me, that without queſtion we had been at the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and
that thoſe we had ſeen were ſo many evil ſpirits: That as for the meat which was
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43725:101"/>
there eaten, it was nothing but wind; as indeed <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs it hath not much
burthened my ſtomach. When <hi>I</hi> conſider the miſchief they did me, and all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
poſtures of that curſed crew, <hi>I</hi> am oblig'd to believe they were no other then
the inhabitants of hell. Wherefore if you have any deſire to converſe with them any
further, <hi>I</hi> am advis'd not to ſerve you any longer. Alas! what blindeneſs is this?
cryes out <hi>Lyſis;</hi> whither will the inſolence of humane ſpirits reach, when it miſtakes
the moſt favourable Deities that may be, for evil ſpirits? This is far from ſacrificing
to them. Since thou art in an error <hi>Carmelin, I</hi> will endeavor to deliver thee out
of it. Let's go to the fountain <hi>Lucida,</hi> poſſibly the Nymph of it will be ſo courteous
as to appear to us. In ſaying ſo, <hi>Lyſis</hi> goes forward, and being come near the ſource,
he ſeveral times calls <hi>Lucida;</hi> but not ſeeing her appear, he ſaid that patience muſt
be had, and that it may be ſhe was gone a walking ſome way; or that ſhe would
not ſhew her ſelf ſo eaſily to men in the day time. After this he made a light meal
on bread and nuts; and when the Sun was ſet, he return'd along with <hi>Carmelin</hi> to
his Land-lords. The Good man, who according to what he had been told of him,
thought him a wizard, and was in ſome fear to ſup with him; yet had he the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to ask him, why he who had much money, and ſeem'd to come of good
friends, troubled himſelf with the keeping of ſheep; ſince they were only the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
lads in the Country that put themſelves into that imployment. Thy diſcourſe is
as ruſtical as thy perſon, honeſt friend, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> canſt thou wonder that I take
the ſheephook in hand, ſeeing ſo many Knights have forſaken the Lance upon the
ſame account; nay, ſince there have been Kings that have preferr'd it before their
Scepters, that ſo they might purſue their Loves with more Liberty? It's true, this
is not ſeen in this Countrey, but it is ſo in <hi>Forreſts</hi> and other places: but it will
not be long ere there will be even here a many as illuſtrious Sheperds as my ſelf.
However, there is not ſuch pleaſure in keeping of Sheep, reply'd the honeſt Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant;
I had rather be at <hi>Paris</hi> in your brave hang'd Chambers, telling of crowns.
Behold what all the Philoſophers have taught us, ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> that we are not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
commonly proceeds from our ſelves, but we have not the capacity to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it. Thou art in the midſt of the pleaſures of the Country, which I come from
far to ſearch out, and thou art not content, for want of knowing how to enjoy them.
Well, well, it ſhall not be long ere thou be pack'd hence, and other more noble
perſons ſhall come in thy place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bertrand</hi> durſt ſay no more after ſo rough a return: he reſolved not to make any
further enquiry into the affairs of his gueſts, ſo that he might ſtill get by them. So
the whole family went to bed: but there being but one bed for <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
the Maſter was not well pleas'd to be ſo diſpos'd with this ſervant. 'Twas not that
he diſdained him; but becauſe he was accuſtomed to lie alone, that he might be in
what poſture he pleas'd, and turn from one ſide to another in the midſt of his <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
The night before he had had a bed to himſelf at <hi>Clarimonds,</hi> and had need
of it, having watch'd three nights together. This alſo he was reſolved to ſleep with
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> who ſwore nevertheleſs the next day, that he never had ſuch an ill nights
reſt, his Maſter had been ſo unquiet. They led their flock abroad to graze, a good
diſtance that day; and being near a cloſe of <hi>Oronte's,</hi> they ſaw <hi>Charite</hi> coming out
of it all alone, ſo that they went forward to ſpeak to her.</p>
            <p>This Wench having diſcover'd by all the actions of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that he had indeed a
great paſſion towards her, could not any longer wiſh him ill; conſidering alſo that
the other maids of the houſe had put it into her head, that whatever folly he might
carry about him, ſhe muſt needs be very happy if ſhe married him, ſince he was
very rich. 'Tis true, <hi>Angelica</hi> knowing ſhe was in that opinion, had maliciouſly
endeavored to put it out of her minde: That ſhe might ſeem cruel to towards her
ſervant, ſhe had taught her certain things to ſay to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> when ever he ſhould ſpeak
to her, making her believe it were the way, to finde out whether he lov'd her or no.
<hi>Lyſis</hi> having ſaluted her, and told her that he was come again to ſubmit himſelf to
her, and to know what commands ſhe had to lay on him beſides what ſhe had told
him at the laſt waiting on her. She anſwered him ſomewhat harſly, <hi>I command you
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43725:102"/>
not to obey me any more,</hi> and preſently ſhe return'd the ſameway ſhe came, without
any further ceremony; for ſo her Miſtreſs had adviſed her to do, who had alſo taught
her the foreſaid diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> was as inſenſible as a Stock; ſo that <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſeeing him fixt upright, and
ſaying nothing, thought he ſlept ſtanding, and came and pull'd him by the skirts of
his coat, for to awake him. Let me alone, ſaies <hi>Lyſis</hi> to him, why doſt thou oblige
we to ſpeak. If I had been a quarter of an hour longer in my tranſportation, my
hiſtory would have been by ſo much the more noble, and more admirable. But let
us go hence, ſince thou wouldſt have it ſo. I ſhall finde my miſery as well in one
place as in another: Alas! my memory dogs me every where; it will ever repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to me the cruel words of <hi>Charite, I command you not to obey me any more,</hi> ſaid
ſhe. O God! what cruelty's this! After I had receiv'd ſo many teſtimonies of her
good will, in two days ſhe is chang'd, and will not have me obey her any more; which
is as much as to ſay in one word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhe deſires not to be any longer my Miſtreſs,
nor that I ſhould be her ſervant: Wherein have I offended her? Let her tell me
my offence, and if I am found guilty, I ſhall deſire no other to ordain my puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but a <hi>Buſiris</hi> or a <hi>Phalaris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The diſconſolate Shepherd utter'd many ſuch complaints as he walk'd along with
<hi>Carmelin;</hi> and when he came to a path that led to <hi>Montenor's,</hi> he would needs go
thither for to ſay ſomething to <hi>Anſelme.</hi> Having by good hap met with him, he
asked him whether he had ſtill in his Box the <hi>Eccho</hi> of St. <hi>Clou,</hi> becauſe he now
thought it time to make ſome uſe of it; and that he had found a cave very fit to be
its abode. <hi>Anſelme</hi> anſwered him, that he had been very careful to preſerve ſuch
a pretty little Nymphs, and that he thought it a fit time to preſent him with it.
Upon that he left him, and returning again preſently, he put into his hands a box,
wherein he aſſur'd him the <hi>Eccho</hi> was. <hi>Lyſis</hi> having given him many thanks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
with ſo much joy, as a little diverted the ſadneſs which he had conceiv'd at the
diſdain of <hi>Charite.</hi> But being withal very impatient, before he was come half way
to the place where the little Nymph was to be diſpos'd, he was ſo deſirous to ſee
her, that he opened the Box. As ſoon as the lid was off, the Sparrow which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme</hi>
had put into it fled away; ſo that he ſoon loſt the ſight of it. Whither flieſt
thou? O moſt precious member of the body of the faireſt Nymph that ever was,
ſays the deſolate Shepherd; my curioſity hath been as impertinent as that of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,
Aglaura</hi> and <hi>Pſyche.</hi> Why did I not ſtay till I were come into a leſs ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
place then this? O <hi>Eccho, Eccho,</hi> where art thou?</p>
            <p>This he uttered as loud as he could, and yet there was not any Eccho made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
At length, being towards the evening come near the place of her abode, he
cry'd out again, and heard an <hi>Eccho,</hi> for indeed there was one there. If this be
not the Eccho I have loſt ſaies he, it is another as good. It muſt be thought there
may be as excellent ones in <hi>Brie,</hi> as in the <hi>Iſle of France.</hi> Dear Nymph, continues
he, I have been ill treated by <hi>Charite</hi> this afternoon; will ſhe continue her cruelty.
The <hi>Eccho</hi> anſwered <hi>Cruelty:</hi> And having ask'd her afterwards ſomething elſe, ſhe
pronounc'd words, whence he could not dra any ſatisfaction; ſo that having
preſently met with <hi>Clarimond,</hi> he made his complaint to him. You are in a
very great error, ſaies <hi>Clarimond</hi> to him: you are to know, that if the Eccho an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
any thing to the purpoſe it is by chance; and of a hundred words, there may
not be two wherein there is any ſenſe. And whereas you finde in Books a long train
of anſwers that are very good, they have been purpoſely invented, and that with
much difficulty. Beſides, 'tis to no purpoſe to conſult that oracle, it is a vain and
ridiculous one. It knows little, ſince it ſaies nothing but what it hath heard us ſay,
and all it doth, is to repeat the laſt ſyllables of a period where we ſtop. You are
deceiv'd your ſelf, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> if I had the Eccho which I have now loſt, it woold
anſwer me to any thing I ſhould ask it. <hi>I</hi> have elſewhere had experience of its
skill. He thereupon related part of what the Eccho had ſaid to him at St. <hi>Clou.</hi> And
indeed if we remember, though it was <hi>Anſelme</hi> that made him immediate anſwers,
yet had the replies much ſenſe in them: And if it be wondred how that could be,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43725:102"/>
and it be objected to me, that <hi>Clarimond</hi> thought the good anſwers of an Eccho
could not be brought about without pains; I ſhall be excus'd if I ſay, that beſides
that there was much hazard in the buſineſs, <hi>Lyſis</hi> then ended his periods with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
words he had choſen long before, as the beſt he could find for to ſpeak in to an
Eccho.</p>
            <p>After he had related that brave adventure, he told him what <hi>Anſelme</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
him withall, and of his curioſity: which made <hi>Clarimond</hi> wonder at his folly
more then ever. the Shepherd, when he had done that ſtory, could not but tell him
how the loſs of his Eccho had follow'd that of the favour and affection of <hi>Charite,</hi>
as indeed misfortunes go ever in company. <hi>Clarimond</hi> having learn'd of him the
words which his Miſtreſs had ſaid to him, told him preſently; Shepherd, you have
no reaſon to be any ways troubled: If <hi>Charite</hi> hath commanded you not to obey
her any more, why will you obey her in this very command? What ſhe hath ſaid
to you, ſignifies as much as if ſhe had ſaid nothing at all: She will not have you to
obey her, and yet you ſee ſhe commands you; ſhe will not lay any further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
on you, and yet ſhe will have you to obey her: What may be concluded
thence, but that you muſt take no notice of this laſt command, which you muſt not
obey, and obſerve the former ones which oblige you to obedience? <hi>Lyſis</hi> had much
ado to comprehend the ſenſe of this diſcourſe: For <hi>Clarimond</hi> underſtood it not too
well himſelf, and would needs explain one piece of Gibriſh by another more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure.
However I muſt confeſs, ſays the Shepherd to him, dear friend! that thy
ſubtilty is great, and that thy ſolutions are admirable. Yet my mind is ſtill in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
and I have ſome particular opinions which ſeem to me as like to be true as
thine. Alas! I ſhall ever have a memory of thoſe cruel words of <hi>Charite: I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you not to obey me any more.</hi> They will cauſe no that grief that I ſhall die of.
<hi>Aſtraea</hi> never ſpake any thing ſo harſh to <hi>Celadon,</hi> and yet he ſtick'd not to caſt
himſelf into the River. All ſhe ſaid to him was, that he ſhould go his wayes, and
never appear before her till he was commanded. This was eaſie to be underſtood,
and could not put his mind into ſo much diſquiet. Well, ſince you will not believe me,
ſays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> the only remedy remains, is, to propoſe your difficulty to ſome <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians:</hi>
but for my part, I ſhall ever be of opinion, that we muſt do by this knot as
<hi>Alexander</hi> did with that of <hi>Gordian;</hi> and that you muſt cut it aſunder; if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
untie it. I can well yet have the patience, till I meet with a convenience for to
ask <hi>Charite</hi> herſelf about it, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Or in caſe that take not, I muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the buſineſs to the Doctors of <hi>Amorous</hi> Philoſophy, which I intend to
ſet up.</p>
            <p>Upon this reſolution <hi>Lyſis</hi> took leave of <hi>Clarimond,</hi> for to return to his lodging.
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> who was already come home, had put up his Flock, and was thinking of
the <hi>Kitchin,</hi> which was very empty and cold. After a ſober ſupper, every one went
to bed: But no ſleep could faſten on ſad <hi>Lyſis;</hi> he did nothing all night but repeat
the words of <hi>Charite:</hi> He would tell his man, that they caus'd him an affliction
worſe then death it ſelf. There is indeed a great matter to be troubled at, anſwers
<hi>Carmelin:</hi> Let us not obey her in this, ſince ſhe will not have us to do it. Alas!
replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that's the ſame reaſon as <hi>Clarimond's:</hi> But I will maintain againſt all
the world, that the meaning of <hi>Charite</hi> is, that ſhe deſir'd me not to obey her in
any thing ſhe hath heretofore commanded me. What commands were thoſe? ſays
<hi>Carmelin.</hi> 'Twas, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that I ſhould not ſpeak to her but in private. Nay,
then you have a very ſhrewd turn done you, continues <hi>Carmelin;</hi> you ſhall hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
ſpeak to her before all the world. Thou haſt a judgment good enough, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<hi>Lyſis:</hi> but there is ſomwhat more then that in it; ſhe alſo commanded me to
believe all the admonitions ſhe ſhould give me; and now that ſhe hath given me an
order not to obey her, there is no queſtion but I muſt reſolve not to obey her. All
this comes to what I ſaid before, ſays <hi>Carmelin:</hi> That's it which I tell you, that ſince
ſhe commands you not to obey her, you muſt not do it. Do not obey her in this,
Maſter: you take things in a contrary ſenſe, and you trouble your ſelf without
cauſe; you may obſerve that you contradict your ſelf in your diſcourſes, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43725:103"/>
yet in ſpight of your teeth you are ever within two fingers breadth of the
truth.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Shepherds paſs'd away the night in theſe and the like conteſtations,
wherein they ſo diſtill'd their ſpirits, that it was a fear they might loſe what little
remain'd. Though <hi>Carmelin</hi> had not ſtudied ſo much as his Maſter, yet might he
now be thought able to teach him what he ought to believe: For paſſion having
blinded <hi>Lyſis,</hi> made him take all things in the worſt ſenſe. When it was day, <hi>Lyſis</hi>
carried his Flock abroad, not willing to ſtarve it, for to make it participate of his
ſadneſs. He met in his way a man in black, riding on a lean Hackney, who in one
hand held the bridle, and in the other a bowl and a glaſs-bottle. You'll not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd,
Sir, if I ask you who you are, and whence you come, ſays the Shepherd to
him, who was ſomwhat amaz'd to ſee him in that poſture. I am an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> at
your ſervice, replies the other: I have been adminiſtring ſome phyſick at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s
to a ſervant-maid call'd <hi>Catherine.</hi> She that you ſpeak of is the Shepherdeſs <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi>
replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but that's no great matter, it's but a miſtake: Tell me what ſhe
is ſick of. 'Tis no great matter ſhe is troubled with, replies the Apochecary; ſhe
had a mind to be purg'd, for to be freed of ſome little pains ſhe felt in her members,
as being ſomwhat rheumatick. I have need to be purg'd too, and that without
delay, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I will go to bed preſently: Do me the favour to bring
me my phyſick as ſoon as may be; my lodging is at <hi>Bertand's,</hi> the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſer.</p>
            <p>He had no ſooner ſpoke the laſt word, but the Apothecary, who deſired nothing
but employment, promis'd to bring him very ſuddenly what he deſired. He began
to ſpur his Tit with the points of nails which he had faſtened to the heels of his ſhoes
in ſtead of ſpurs, and in a little time he came to <hi>Coulommiers</hi> where his ſhop was.
<hi>Lyſis</hi> ſeeing him departed, leaves the ſheep in the cuſtody of <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and went
very ſeriouſly into bed. The Apothecary being return'd, gave him the Phyſick he
had prepar'd for him, and receiv'd the ordinary rate for it. In the mean time <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
walking abroad met <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and enquired of him where his maſter was.
He anſwer'd him, he was ſick, and that he was to take a Purge. So that <hi>Clarimond</hi>
went to ſee him, and ask'd him what was his indiſpoſition. Methinks I feel in my
ſtomach ſome extraordinaay crudities, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> the reaſon whereof I conceive
can be no other, then that I have yet ſome reliques of the nature of the <hi>Tree:</hi> I
would fain be rid of all theſe encombrances, that my digeſtion may be more free:
It may be there is yet ſome part of me that is wood, and haply hath not yet fully
arrived to the tenderneſs of fleſh. Entertain no ſuch imagination, ſays <hi>Clarimond:
Hircan</hi>'s a perſon ſo able, that he hath perfectly put you into your former condition;
you are better in health then ever you were Before you had taken phyſic, you ſhould
have conſidered, that whereas it ſhould do you good if you were ſick, it will do you
ſo much the more hurt ſince you are well. I am to tell you a ſtory to this purpoſe:
I brought home with me on a time three of my friends to my own houſe, where we
debauch'd it four days together; the fifth day in the morning I repreſented unto
them the exceſs we had uſed before, and began to remonſtrate to them that our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
could not but be in ſome danger, if we did not purge, and ſo diſperſe the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
which we had gathered together. They all believ'd me; ſo I ſent for an
Apothecary, who brought every one his doſe. We lay all four in my chamber, two
in a bed. When every one was preſented with his glaſs, and that I obſerved my
Comrades began to make wry faces, Take courage, ſaid I to them, let's ſhut our
eyes, that we may not ſee any thing; he that ſhall have diſpatch'd firſt, ſhall pay
nothing. As ſoon as I had ſaid ſo, they made all the haſte poſſible to take off
their Phyſick: but while they took no notice of me, I caſt mine beſides the bed,
and preſently jump'd into the midſt of the room, and began to laugh at the reſt;
and that when they were the moſt ſick at heart, and in the midſt of their gripings
and wry-faces. Then did they diſcover my knavery, but were fain to take all in jeſt.
I made it appear to them, that I ſtood not ſo much in need of Phyſick as they did,
and that it came not amiſs to them; though out of indignation to ſee that I had taken
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43725:103"/>
none, they were in a manner ready to caſt it up. I did very well not to purge my
ſelf, when I had no other reaſon but a merry humor; and you have done as ill to
preſume on the ſame remedy without neceſſity, or the advice of any Phyſician. I
have no other Phyſician then Love, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> 'tis he hath written me a receit upon
his own headband. Aſſure your ſelf, there is in this a ſecret greater then you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;
and though I ſhould have found my ſelf in no indiſpoſition at all, yet ſhould
I not have abſtained from phyſick. I believe you have read in the Poets, that Lovers
are oblig'd to conform themſelves to the humors, qualities and actions of their
Miſtreſſes. They are ſad in their ſadneſſes, ſick in their diſeaſes, joyful in their joy,
and healthful in their health; they laugh, when they ſee them laugh; they weep,
to ſee them weep, ſharing with them both in their delights and their torments. Now
having been informed that <hi>Charite</hi> was ill, how could it poſſibly be I ſhould be
well? You will no longer wonder that I am a-bed, and have taken phyſik; for
having underſtood that ſhe had taken ſome, I would needs imitate her, that ſo I
might obſerve thoſe Laws which Love lays upon me. But O the wonderful fate of
my happineſs! I have made uſe of no other Apothecary, then what ſhe had; the
ſame hand preſented us both with the glaſs, and the glaſs I drank out of, was the
very ſame whence ſhe had already drunk; and there wanted nothing, but to know
which ſide ſhe had put her lips, that ſo I might have put mine in the ſame place. This
being paſt, we muſt believe, ſaies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that there remains now nothing, which
we might call excellent to be done in the world. You have accompliſh'd a thing,
which even the moſt faithful Lovers never imagin'd; and the miracles of your hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
will be more remarkable then thoſe of all the Fables. All this is as much as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> 'tis a long time ſince I have given my ſelf up to theſe amorous
conformities. I eat not any thing but what <hi>Charite</hi> loves and likes; I am only
pleas'd in that wherein ſhe is, If ſhe wipe her noſe, I wipe mine too; if ſhe ſpit
on the floor, I endeavour to do ſo too, though I ſhould thereby dry up my lungs,
and ſpet five hundred times before I hit the mark: if ſhe chance to walk before me,
I ſtrive to put my feet in the ſame place where ſhe had trod before; and I put my
ſelf into all the poſture which I ſee her in, as if I plaid with her that game, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a man muſt do all he ſees done. You adde miracle to miracle, ſaies <hi>Clarimond</hi> I
am infinitely glad to hear all this from your own mouth; for if I had had the relation
from another, <hi>I</hi> ſhould not ſo eaſily have believed it, though the Relaters ſhould
have bequeath'd themſelves to all the Catchpoles of <hi>Pluto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> having in diſmiſſion of this diſcourſe entertain'd <hi>Lyſis</hi> a while with
other, left him, for to go home to dinner; and there being ſerv'd to the table a
good ſort of Broth, he ſent ſome to the poor ſick perſon. The reſt of that day
his Hoſteſs took charge of him: and <hi>Carmelin</hi> being return'd in the evening out
of the fields, was very inquiſitive to know how he did: who told him, that his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was nothing, ſo that <hi>Charite</hi> were recovered; and that aſſoon as it were day he
muſt needs have ſome account of her. <hi>Carmelin</hi> its ſuppos'd, ſlept not much, he
riſe before it was quite day, and went to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s Caſtle. By that time he was
there, they were all ariſing; where having met with one of <hi>Leonora</hi>'s maids, he
asked her whether the Miſtreſs of the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis</hi> were ſtill ſick? and if there
were no means to ſpeak with her. She is ſicker then ſhe was yeſterday (anſwers
the maid, who knew well enough whom he ſpake of) ſhe muſt ſleep yet a while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſince yeſterday in the evening ſhe hath had a ſwelling over her cheek, and one eye,
ſo that ſhe hardly ſees any thing, and ſhe hath her face half ſwath'd about: ſhe
muſt be let blood anon, for to divert the humor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> having receiv'd this anſwer, return'd to his Maſter to tell it him. When
he knew it, he fell into an unſpeakable affliction, yet not willing to be defective
in the imitation of <hi>Charite,</hi> he ſaid he would be let blood as well as ſhe. <hi>Carmelin</hi>
knew not where there was any Chyrurgion; but his hoſt directed him to a village
cloſe by, where there was one. He was ready to be gone to fetch him, when <hi>Lyſis</hi>
cryes out, Stay, ſtay <hi>Carmelin, I</hi> will have no other Chyrurgion but my Miſtreſſes,
thou muſt know who that is. Go again to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, thou wilt finde him there
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43725:104"/>
yet: but before thou goeſt, finde me out ſome linnen or other, and binde up my
eye and my cheek. To what end, ſaies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> you all nothing there! Ah!
Stupidity! cryes out <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Can <hi>Charite</hi> ail any thing which <hi>I</hi> muſt not feel? Now
that ſhe hardly ſees anything; wouldſt thou have me have my perfect light? Now
that ſhe hath the uſe but of one eye, muſt <hi>I</hi> enjoy both? <hi>I</hi> will have but one eye
no more then ſhe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſeeing, notwithſtanding all this, that <hi>Carmelin</hi> did not much make it his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to get him ſome linnen, reach'd his breeches and took out his handkerchief,
which he gave him to binde up his face withal: But now there happens a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
in his minde, becauſe he knew not which cheek it was that <hi>Charite</hi> had
ſwollen. <hi>Carmelin</hi> told him he had not remembred to ask whether it were the right
or the left: So that his Maſter, for fear of miſtaking, thought it moſt ſecure to binde
up all his face. <hi>Carmelin</hi> anſwers, that that were not to any purpoſe, and that it
were beſt ſtay till the Chyrurgion were come, who ſhould reſolve him on which
cheek he ought to ail any thing: So having preſently given the flock in charge to
<hi>Bertrands</hi> ſon, he returned to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, to ſatisfie <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s humors, which were not
a little troubleſome to him. He came thither juſt in the nick; for he met with a
Chyrurgion of <hi>Coulommiers,</hi> who was coming out. He entreated him to come and
let his Maſter blood. The Chyrurgion had no horſe, ſo that he was fain to go along
with him a foot as far as <hi>Bertrands.</hi> When he ask'd <hi>Lyſis</hi> in which arm he would be
bled; the Shepherd told him, in the ſame arm as the fair Lady he had let blood at
<hi>Orontes</hi>'s. The Chyrurgion having told him it was the left, he took his, and took at
leaſt three Porringers of blood. <hi>I</hi> fear me it is on the left cheek that that fair one
ails ſomewhat, ſaies <hi>Lyſis.</hi> You are in the right Sir, replies the Chyrurgion. Binde
up mine too then, replies the Shepherd. You have no ſwelling there as ſhe hath,
ſaies the other; why ſhould <hi>I</hi> do ſo? You will not do it? replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> let <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin</hi>
do it then. Thereupon <hi>Carmelin</hi> willing to obey him, came and bound up
half his face: And the Chyrurgion being ready to be gone, <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſpoke to him to
this purpoſe; <hi>If you would have me eſteem you any thing, learn the art of Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
otherwiſe then you have. Obſerve, that amorous wounds are much more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
then thoſe you dreſs every day; and that experience teaches us, that a Miſtreſs
is never in any ſickneſs, wherein the ſervant ſympathizes not with her; and in a Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſeaſe,
inſtead of one ſick perſon there are ever two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Chyrurgion after this diſcourſe, receiv'd his gratuity, and went away much
amaz'd. <hi>Lyſis</hi> having put his arm in a ſcarf, bid <hi>Carmelin</hi> help him on with his
cloathes. As he walk'd up and down the houſe, comes in <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
careful to know in what poſture he was. Seeing him with all his ſwathings about
him, he ask'd him what hurt had hapned to him ſince. <hi>Lyſis</hi> told him, that he
would needs be let blood, and ſwath'd as <hi>Charite</hi> was, who had a ſwelling on her
cheek. The imitation is very noble, ſaies <hi>Clarimond</hi> to him; but it is not to the
full, for methinks you ſhould have your face ſwollen, as well as your Miſtreſs. That's
it <hi>I</hi> would have perſwaded him to, replies, <hi>Carmelin:</hi> and he ſhould either have
given himſelf, or got another to give him a many good blows, to make his eyes
ſwell. Thy knavery is not the leaſt in the world, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> hold thou thy peace,
there's no body ſpeaks to thee. As for your part <hi>Clarimond,</hi> you are to know,
that <hi>I</hi> was not only coment to have the left eye bound up, but that a while ſince,
<hi>I</hi> would needs have them both, not knowing which it was that ſhould be. <hi>Carmelin</hi>
being gone to fetch the Chyrurgion, before he had bound me them up, <hi>I</hi> have
always kept my hand on them, leſt <hi>I</hi> might ſee any thing: for is it not fit the eyes
of a Lover ſhould be obſcur'd, when one of their ſuns ſhine not? As for my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of blood, beſides that it is in imitation of <hi>Charite,</hi> it is otherwiſe very good
for me; but eſpecially for this reaſon, that <hi>I</hi> have been much pleas'd to ſee my
blood. Look on't <hi>Clarimond,</hi> you ſhall ſee therein the pourtraicture of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs:
for all my veins are filled with that fair figure, which takes up all my thoughts.
<hi>Clarimond</hi> beheld the blood, and to ſatisfie <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſaid, that he ſaw therein ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
reſembling a face. With that little ſight that is left me, ſaies <hi>Lyſis</hi> to him,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43725:104"/>
I can ſee <hi>Charite</hi> there in her whole proportion. For your part, ſhould you obſerve
nothing, 'twere not your fault, but it were Loves, who would not permit you to
ſee any thing therein,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> having ſome buſineſs elſwhere left <hi>Lyſis;</hi> being now aſſur'd, that he was
ſick of a diſeaſe, which no Phyſick or Phelbotomy could cure. He purpoſely ſent a
Lacquay to <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>Anſelm,</hi> to acquaint them with the late actions of the
Shepherd. Had they not been taken up in the entertainment of ſome that were
come to viſit them, they had given this poor patient a viſit.</p>
            <p>The night being come, <hi>Lyſis</hi> went to bed as he was wont, but much reſt he had
not, ſo much did the remembrance of his Miſtreſſes command diſturb his thoughts.
He was ever at <hi>Carmelin</hi> with his elbow, for to awake him, and to put him to ſome
new explications of it. I cannot endure to repeat the ſame thing ſo often, ſaies <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin</hi>
to him, or at leaſt, ſtay till it be day for to queſtion me. The night is onely
made to ſleep, would you have me leſs happy then the beaſts, which now are every
where aſleep. I'll lay you a wager there is not at this preſent one of our ſheep
awake. Wilt thou conform thy ſelf to the beaſts? replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> 'tis a bruital feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
that thou deſireſt. The night is not only ordain'd to ſleep in, but alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
about affairs: Know that the greateſt wits and ingenuities are they that reſiſt
the charms of ſleep, to entertain themſelves with their imaginations. The <hi>Lovers</hi> are
they alſo that have this cuſtom, and eſpecially among them the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis.</hi> All
the fault thou art guilty of in not imitating me, proceeds from this, that thou haſt yet
thy Liberty. O what a prodigy it is to ſee a <hi>Shepherd</hi> ſo <hi>free!</hi> Thou ought'ſt rather
be Soul-leſs, then Love-leſs. But it is true, that I foreſee thou wilt ſhortly be put
into the chain as well as the reſt. Love is importunate, till he wound thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
him; and none loves more paſſionately, then a cold diſpoſition, as thine is, when
it begins to be enflamed. Whether it be ſo or not, its no great matter, ſaies <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin;</hi>
but for the preſent I am ſo deſirous to reſt my ſelf, that though they ſhould
cry, Fire, I would not riſe, whether they ſhould mean the fire of Love, or that of
the Chimney.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe ended, the two Shepherds ſpake no more one to another. When
it was day, they put on their cloathes both together, and for company-ſake went
abroad with the flock: while they drave it ſtill before them, being near a farm of
<hi>Hircans,</hi> where they had not yet been, <hi>Lyſis</hi> made a ſign to <hi>Carmelin;</hi> and ſaid
to him, if I am not deceiv'd, I hear the ſound of a rural inſtrument, without queſtion
we are now in the Shepherds Countrey. <hi>Carmelin</hi> confeſt, that he alſo heard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
very harmonious: And deſcending into a little valley, they perceiv'd a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
playing on the Bag-pipes. <hi>Lyſis</hi> being come near him, <hi>Pan</hi> defend thee gentle
Shepherd, ſaies he to him, I am raviſh'd to ſee thee, it is a long time ſince I ſaw
any of our quality, thy entertainment here is very delightful. Thou inſpireſt the
holes of thy ſweet ſounding-pipe. Now am I certain thou art no idle perſon; had
I my Gittarrhe here, we ſhould make a conſort together.</p>
            <p>This Shepherd, who was a Countrey fellow, ſimple enough, was amaz'd to ſee
<hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> in the poſture they were in, that he view'd them one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from head to foot; inſomuch, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſeeing he ſaid nothing, continued his
diſcourſe. Doſt thou think, ſaies he to him, that the inſtrument thou playeſt on
is more proper for thoſe of our quality then the Gittarrhe? Were I ſure of it, I
would learn on the Bagpipes, to the end I might be <hi>Paſtoral</hi> in all things. Maſter, ſays
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> though <hi>I</hi> cannot play well on the Bag-pipes, yet I can do ſomewhat at
the Flute. Here's one ſaies <hi>Hircans</hi> Shepherd, lets ſee what you can do. <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
took the Flute out of his hands, and began to play <hi>Gueridon's</hi> tune, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Shepherd bore a part with the Bagpipe, whereat <hi>Lyſis</hi> was very well ſatisfied.
When they had diſmiſs'd their inſtruments: My Lads, ſaies <hi>Lyſis</hi> to them, your
muſick is ſweeter to the ear, then the noiſe of a brook that ſlides through the peebles
'Tis delightful to hear the plaints of a Heifer, when Love pricks her; <hi>ſweet</hi> is the
ſinging of a Swan, that's dying, <hi>ſweet</hi> is the warbling of the nightingale, <hi>ſweet</hi> is the
honey, which is prepar'd by the little bees; <hi>ſweet</hi> is the ſugar of <hi>Madera:</hi> but far
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43725:105"/>
more <hi>ſweet</hi> are you Paſtoral inſtruments. Some other time I will make you talk
of Eclogues, after the manner of <hi>Theocritus, Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ronſard;</hi> and I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
him that ſhall do beſt with a basket of flowers, a birds-cage; a cheeſe-basket, or
ſome fine garland. In good faith, I did not think <hi>Carmelin</hi> could have done ſo
much: O how much worthier do I now eſteem him to make a Shepherd, then I
did before. However, I will not learn to play on the Flute as he doth, nor yet on
the Bag-pipes: For I remember I have heard it ſaid, that <hi>Minerva</hi> beholding her
ſelf in a fountain, while ſhe plaid on the Flute, ſhe caſt it away immediately, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe ſeem'd too deformed in that action, wherein one muſt over-ſwell his
cheeks. I will not diſfigure my countenance. The <hi>Lute,</hi> the <hi>Guitarrhe,</hi> the <hi>Viol,</hi>
the <hi>Bandore,</hi> and the <hi>Timbrel</hi> are for us Shepherds of better quality; the <hi>Flute,</hi> the
<hi>Oaten-pipe,</hi> and the <hi>Bag-pipe,</hi> for Shepherds of a lower degree, as <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and
ſome others of this Countrey. Since you are my <hi>Maſter,</hi> ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> there is
no queſtion but <hi>I</hi> am below you: yet <hi>I</hi> ſhould wiſh <hi>I</hi> might not be called <hi>Servant,</hi>
as there are ſome that do call me ſo. <hi>I</hi> ſhould deſire to have a more honorable title:
All the reaſon in the world, <hi>Carmelin;</hi> ſays <hi>Lyſis: I</hi> declare thee my <hi>Commiſſary</hi>
in what ſhall concern <hi>Shepherdry,</hi> as <hi>Anſelme</hi> hath his <hi>Commiſſaries</hi> in the buſineſs
of the revenues: Thy principal charge ſhall be to have a care of my flocks, when
<hi>I</hi> am not in place. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was very well ſatisfied with this dignity, and his
Maſter having bidden farewel to <hi>Hircans</hi> Shepherd, as he alſo had done, they drave
their ſheep before them into another place: leaving the other ſo aſtoniſh'd to ſee
thoſe two Shepherds marching after ſo wretched a flock, that it was one of the
ſtrangeſt things he had ever ſeen.</p>
            <p>Having left him, they march'd on ſtill for a good while; and at length ſitting
down near a fountain, they are bread, and drank water. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was not the
beſt pleas'd at this entertainment, this was not the life his Maſter put him in hopes
of. He thought he ſhould have had none but Wedding-days, whereas they made
him temperate in ſpight of his teeth. Having been ſo ill treated as to chear, he
muſt diſpatch for <hi>Orontes's</hi> for an account of <hi>Charite's</hi> diſpoſition; which employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would have gone much to his heart, were there not ſome hope they might
have ſo much conſideration as to make him drink.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> being left alone, his flock and his dog rather led, then were guided by him;
he follow'd them ſtill, never conſidering whither they led him. The ſickneſs of his
Miſtreſs was all the buſineſs of his thoughts. While he was in this contemplation,
one of his ſheep clambred up a little hillock, whereon was a tree, and graſs all about
it; another preſently ſeconds it: but <hi>Lyſis</hi> having ſtruck at the former with his
ſheephook, it went round the tree, and came down; the ſecond did the like; As
alſo a third, that alſo was gotten up, and then a fourth and a fifth; and ſo did they
all, even to the laſt. The firſt ſheep ſeeing the reſt gotten up, got up again, and
came down, the reſt did the like after it, going ſtill about the tree, as being a ſort
of creatures, whoſe nature being to do what they ſee the reſt do, they would never
have gotten into their way, before they had all been where they had ſeen their
companions. They would have clambred up, and come down, and would have
gone about ſtill, had there not paſs'd by a man that put an end to the ſport; for
<hi>Muſedor,</hi> which was not train'd up to Shepherdry, and could do nothing but bark at
thoſe that paſs'd by, drew them not together; and as for <hi>Lyſis,</hi> he was ſo ſurpris'd
with the ſport, that he could have wiſh'd it might have laſted to the worlds end. He
who was come into the place, came and embrac'd him; and to take him out of his
Tranſportation, ſaid to him, Heaven bleſs thee! <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Shepherds</hi> of <hi>Brie,</hi> but
rather of all <hi>Europe,</hi> nay of all the earth: How fortunate am I to have met thee?
Fame having convey'd thy name and merit into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which is my Countrey,
I was preſently ſeiz'd with a deſire to come and learn of thee the art to become
happy. <hi>Lyſis</hi> having retreated three ſteps to view the man, who was clad like a
Shepherd as himſelf, he found he knew him not; and yet conceiving himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to him for the pains he had taken to finde him, he went and embrac'd him
again, and ſaid to him, Welcome, gentle Shepherd, ſince thou art the firſt that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43725:105"/>
caſts himſelf into the arms of my protection, I ſwear to thee thou ſhalt be the firſt
of whom I ſhall take care. I have no more to beg then thy name, that I may know
whom I am obliged to. My name is <hi>Philiris,</hi> replies the Shepherd. Ah! what an
excellent good name is that! ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> how eaſie it is to ſee that thou art a
Shepherd by birth! I make no queſtion but thy hiſtory muſt be the nobleſt in all the
world; wilt thou do me the favour to tell it me? I will tell thee even to thoſe
things, whereof there are yet none conſcious but the Rocks and the Woods, anſwers
<hi>Philiris:</hi> But let us find ſome place where coolneſs dwells; for this is ſo open and
ſo hot, that it ſeems to be no other then that wherein Nature was delivered of
the Sun.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the two Shepherds took their way to a Thicket that was hard by,
while there paſſes by a Coach wherein were <hi>Orontes, Florida, Leonora, Angelica,
Anſelme, Montenor, Clarimond,</hi> and <hi>Carmelin,</hi> whom the Ladies had newly taken
up, poor Rogue as he was, to make ſome ſport with. They all preſently lighted, and
<hi>Orontes</hi> told <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that taking the air in the fields, they had met his Journy-man
Shepherd, who had acquainted them that he was ſick of the ſame diſeaſe as his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.
<hi>Lyſis</hi> anſwered, that <hi>Carmelin</hi> had ſaid nothing but what was true; and ſo
was putting himſelf into a poſture to make long narrations; but he hears certain
cries that made him be ſilent. Putting his finger on his mouth, as a ſign to the reſt,
he drew neer the thicket whence the noiſe came, and all follow'd him very leiſurely,
till they came to certain trees, among which they ſaw two men cloath'd in white
<hi>Taffata,</hi> having very fine <hi>Scrips</hi> hanging in ſcarfs, <hi>Strawn-hats</hi> on their heads, and
painted <hi>Sheephooks</hi> in their hands.</p>
            <p>They made as if they heeded not thoſe that dogg'd them; and one of them being
lain down on the earth as it had been to ſleep, the other began this complaint.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Gentle Zephirs, who reign in theſe places! were there ever ſadder ſighs then
mine mingled with your breathings? Ye Trees who are now ſo green, have you
ever ſeen fires as mine, which are ſuch as would dry you up to the very roots?
And you Springs, were your waters warmed by any tears bigger then mine? O
then you Zephirs, Trees, and Springs, if ever my Shepherdeſs come hither, tell
her what you have ſeen me ſuffer. But alas! you are deaf as well as dumb, O
dear witneſſes of my martyrdom. There's none but <hi>Polidor</hi> that is able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
me. What doth that faithfull friend think on? hath he no compaſſion on
one in his own condition? How wilt thou have me aſſiſt thee, dear <hi>Meliantes!</hi>
anſwers that <hi>Polidor:</hi> Knoweſt thou not that I want comfort more then thy
ſelf? She that I adore will not believe my love; and not meeting with any ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
occaſions to make it appear I am ſo miſerable that I muſt wiſh her ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
that I may ſhew my affection in her relief. Having the other day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
my eyes from hers, which dazled me, I fix'd them on her neck, thinking
there they might be more ſafe: But O God! that Neck is Snow; 'twas her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to make me loſe an eye, as <hi>Hannibal</hi> did by fixing his too much on the ſnow
of the <hi>Alpes.</hi> Nor can I indeed do any thing, but I am tormented by ſome freſh
accident; and as <hi>Mithridates</hi> lived by poyſon, ſo do I on amorous thoughts. Ah
wretch that I am, what ſhall I do then, cries out <hi>Meliantes,</hi> ſince Heaven, Fate,
Nature, my Miſtreſs, and <hi>Polidor</hi> forſake me? I am now on the amorous ſea,
where a tempeſt whirls about my ſhip; but though it ſhould be ſunk, and I put
to fortune, yet if I can but embrace the neck of my Goddeſs, that fair pillar of
white marble planted above two living rocks, I ſhall eſcape ſhipwrack.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus far was <hi>Meliantes</hi> gone, when <hi>Lyſis</hi> not being able to refrain ſpeaking any
longer, cries out, God be prais'd! I have found what I look'd for. How learned
are theſe Shepherds! they ſpeak altogether by Alluſions and Metaphors. The
Shepherd <hi>Polidor</hi> upon that ſtarts up, and looking on him, <hi>Philiris,</hi> and <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
Which of you three, ſays he, is the ſervant of the fair <hi>Charite?</hi> That am I, and no
other, replies <hi>Lyſis.</hi> O happy day to us, continued <hi>Polidor:</hi> It is a long time ſince
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43725:106"/>
my Comrade and I have been to ſeek you: Seeing you all three of a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
I knew not which was <hi>Lyſis.</hi> You are then to know that Love plays the
cruel Tyrant over us; and we believe there is not any one in the world of whom
we might hope better advice and direction then from you, in our affairs. I am a
true Phyſitian of minds, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Tell me that of yours, and I will preſcribe
you excellent remedies. This made <hi>Polidor</hi> weep, and wiping his eyes with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiff,
You will oblige me to repeat and renew ſtrange torments, ſays he; I
ſhould not deſire ſo ſoon to thruſt the weapon again into my wounds: I ſhould cry
too loud, and importune the ears of theſe Knights and Nymphs that are in your
attendance; I am baſhfull before ſo many. Let <hi>Meliantes</hi> ſpeak then, replies <hi>Lyſis.</hi>
Who, I? anſwers the other: I have need of whole ages to prepare my ſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the hiſtory of my adventures: I have ſo many things to ſay, that when I ſhould
once begin, there cannot a word proceed from my mouth, no more then there do
drops of water out of a cup that is overfill'd. Ah! Love, who art the beſtower of
theſe torments, after thou haſt taken away my heart, wilt thou deprive me of the
liberty to complain? And if thou putſt me every day to the rack, is it to any other
end but to make me confeſs all my ſecrets? Tyrant, Executioner! cut out my
tongue, or ſuffer me to tell what I endure.</p>
            <p>In ſaying this, <hi>Meliantes</hi> beat the ground with his foot, and began to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into ſuch poſtures as none but a mad man could be guilty of. So that <hi>Lyſis</hi>
taking him by the arm, endeavoured to give him the beſt conſolations he could. In
the mean time, moſt that were preſent look'd one on another, and were ſilent out
of amazement: They imagin'd that <hi>Polidor</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi> were no wiſer then
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> and that the other Shepherd he had brought with him was not much behind
them. But it is not to be conceived that Nature could furniſh three men ſick of
the ſame diſeaſe as the <hi>Extravagant Shepherd,</hi> who muſt be individual in his kind.
However they knew not what to think, and they ſaw great demonſtrations of folly
in thoſe new Shepherds. <hi>Lyſis</hi> having appeared, <hi>Meliantes</hi> ſays to <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that
he was very glad of his preſence at the rencontre of the Shepherds, that in his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
he might ſet down the true relation: And that as for the meeting with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liris</hi>
and another Shepherd, he had ſeen that plaid on the Bagpipes, he would give
him the particulars. I tell thee this freely, continues he, becauſe I believe thou haſt
already begun the Book of my Loves. As for my part, that I am lodg'd neer thy
Caſtle, 'tis principally becauſe thou might'ſt be more particularly inform'd of my
adventures: And for the ſame reaſon thou didſt well to come and ſee me when I
was ſick, that thou might'ſt quote my ſeveral fits. Will you not alſo have me ſpeak
punctually of your Phyſick, replies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> ſhall I count your ſtools, and tell
with what paper you wip'd your breech, as for example, if it were with ſome Letter
the ſtile whereof was as ſmooth as cotton, or with ſome Verſes which were as ſharp
as awls, ſo that they bled you behind? You are very much in the right to give me
this direction; for 'tis now adays the mode with ſome to make Books of the relation
of their diſeaſes; and there are ſome will needs inſert the buſineſs of their Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary.
Do as thou ſhalt think fit, ſays <hi>Lyſis.</hi> Sir, ſays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> putting off his hat
to <hi>Clarimond,</hi> will you not alſo write my hiſtory? I beſeech you Sir; I ſhall think
my ſelf as much oblig'd to you as my Maſter. I will certainly do it, nay, I will
write the hiſtory of thy Dog. I thank you Sir, replies <hi>Carmelin:</hi> but I give you
notice of one thing, that is, that you call me not <hi>Lacquey</hi> nor <hi>Serving-man;</hi> I am
a <hi>Lieutenant</hi> or <hi>Commiſſary</hi> in the buſineſs of <hi>Shepherdry.</hi> How now, Impudence
and importunity together! (ſays <hi>Lyſis</hi> taking <hi>Carmelin</hi> by the arm) be it ſufficient
that thou art ſpoken of as appearing in ſome of my adventures, though it be to
carry a Letter, or do ſome meſſage. What, doſt thou expect a particular Hiſtory,
who never didſt accompliſh any thing which may not be written in <hi>impalpable</hi> paper
with <hi>inviſible</hi> ink, or on the ſurface of the waters with a feather taken out of the
wings of the wind? Is it not a ſhame to ſee thee as big as thy father or mother,
that yet haſt done nothing noble? Where didſt thou ever make any Verſes, or beſtow
a Serenade on a Miſtreſs, or haſt gone through ſome adventure worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to poſterity?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:43725:106"/>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> being ſomewhat caſt down at this rude reproof, retreated ſcratching
his head: but as he was going to make ſome excuſe, the three Shepherds came and
told <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that their loves were impatient, and that they would bring him to one
of their friends, whom they would gladly conſult with about their affairs. So they
carried him and <hi>Carmelin</hi> away, and amaz'd the company ſo much the more; for
if one ſaid, I'll ſtab my ſelf to be reveng'd of the cruelty of my Miſtreſs, another
ſwore he would caſt himſelf headlong down ſome rock: and they ſeem'd to be ſo
extravagant, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> appear'd as wiſe in compariſon of them, as <hi>Socrates</hi> the
Philoſopher. This bred in every one a deſire to be acquainted with them, yet they
follow'd them not, becauſe they thought they would not ſo ſuddenly leave the
Countrey, and that they might be ſeen at leiſure ſome other time. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Ladies got into the coach again, and made an end of their walk.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the five Shepherds having croſs'd certain thickets, came into a
little meadow, where two men and a woman were walking. One of them was
<hi>Hircan,</hi> whom <hi>Lyſis</hi> knew preſently; and the other was <hi>Fontenay,</hi> whom he had
not known, had he not been named, becauſe he was not clad in ſcarlet, as he was
wont, but had a ſuit of white <hi>Taffata.</hi> As for the fair Lady which was with them,
it was <hi>Synopa;</hi> yet the Shepherd having told <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that ſhe was a Shepherdeſs call'd
<hi>Parthenice,</hi> that they had brought with them, he believ'd it, becauſe ſhe had on
a white petticoat, which ſhe was not us'd to wear. O how like is this <hi>Parthenice</hi>
to a Nymph of the waters that I know, ſaies he then. You are much in the right,
ſaies <hi>Carmelin</hi> to him ſoftly: I believe ſhe is the very ſame, yet muſt I withal think
ſhe is none of the ſhe-devils of your <hi>Sabath,</hi> ſince ſhe is pleas'd to be ſeen in the
day. Would you be content I ſhould fall in love with her? Strike on <hi>Carmelin,</hi> it
will be very well done, ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> methinks I ſee Love having his Bow ready to
ſhoot at thee; open thy breaſt, and prepare thy ſelf to receive that wound. Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
do what I bid thee. <hi>Carmelin</hi> would not diſobey his Maſter, being ſo ſurpris'd
with joy, that he knew not what he did; for he had ever believed what his Maſter
ſaid, that there was no more to do but to chooſe a wench; and that he would
cauſe her to be given him in marriage, be ſhe never ſo rich, or never ſo handſom.
<hi>Hircan</hi> having by this time perceiv'd them, came on and ſaluted them. Are you
not now well-pleas'd in ſo good company? ſaies he to <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Thoſe Shepherds have
travell'd up and down long ere they could finde you. Any one will be a Shepherd
with you, and here's my Coſin hath put on the habit for to follow you. He is
much to be commended, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> out of that conſideration I pardon him the
affront he did me: It hath been heavy on my heart ever ſince: But you ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
him never to offer at me any more, really, or ſo much as in thought. I ſhould
abjure all kinred with him if he do: but think no more on it, replies <hi>Hircan:</hi> He
is now as gentle as a Lamb, we will henceforward lead a peaceable life, and it is my
deſire to become a Shepherd as well as the reſt. Do not ſo by any means, ſage <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
ſaies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> do you not know, that in every good <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> there is ever a
Magician, who is never habited as the other Shepherds; ſo alſo muſt the Prieſts keep
in their Sacerdotal Veſtments, and the <hi>Satyrs</hi> continue in their nakedneſs. <hi>Hircan</hi>
having granted him this, they with great admiration view'd the ſwathings about
his head; and the Shepherd <hi>Fontenay</hi> could not refrain asking him, What ails your
left eye, Shepherd, have you receiv'd ſome blow on it? Muſt we all have our faces
bound for our accommodation of being Shepherds? This is particular to me, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> this binding up of my face is in imitation of my Miſtreſs, who at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
is in this poſture; imitate thou thine in other things, as thou ſhalt think fit.
But obſerve my incomparable ſecret: <hi>Charite</hi> hath refus'd to honor me with any
of her commands; and for want of her commands, to comfort my ſelf, I do what
I ſee her do; ſo that by my own miraculous ſubtilty, I ſtill obey her in ſpight of
her teeth, But 'tis very well remembred (ſaies he, turning to <hi>Carmelin)</hi> haſt thou
any tydings how that fair one does? I could not go and ſee her, for theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſtaid me, and got me into the coach, replies <hi>Carmelin:</hi> yet thus much I have
learn'd, that her diſeaſe neither advances nor declines. Let heaven do its pleaſure,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43725:107"/>
replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> but as long as ſhe ſhall be bound up, I will be ſo too. This binding
makes you <hi>I</hi> know not how more graceful, ſaies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> and yet you are not as
yet but half <hi>Cupid;</hi> for you are but half blinde. <hi>By the borns of Pan</hi> thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious,
ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> thou wilt advance; Thy meeting is fortunate, and I dare tell
thee, that though I am not <hi>Cupid, I</hi> am at leaſt ſuch a one as could give him birth
in the world, were he not already.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſpoke this, <hi>Carmelin</hi> twiching him behinde, ask'd him ſoftly, What
ſhall <hi>I</hi> ſay to this fair one? Offer her thy ſervice, and go no farther for the firſt
time. <hi>Carmelin</hi> preſently thinking his deſigns could not but have a fair iſſue; went
and ſaid to <hi>Synopa,</hi> Madam, if you have any occaſion for a ſervant as faithful as
any in the world, behold the Shepherd <hi>Carmelin</hi> offers himſelf to you, 'Twere to
be known what wages you would have (anſwers <hi>Parthenice</hi> very coldly) but indeed
<hi>I</hi> am not at leiſure to think of that now. Having ſo ſpoken, ſhe whiſpered ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Fontenay:</hi> after which, they left <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and took their way by
an obſcure path, ſo that they were preſently out of ſight. <hi>Carmelin</hi> thought they
had ſomewhat to do together; but <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Fontenay</hi> being ſoon return'd, they
brought not <hi>Synopa</hi> with them; ſo that he took the boldneſs to ask them where ſhe
was. <hi>Hircan</hi> told him, he had left her on the brow of a <hi>hillock,</hi> entertaining her
ſelf with her own imaginations. He would have gone juſt then to ſeek her, but his
Maſter going along with <hi>Hircan</hi> and the Shepherds, hinder'd the deſign. They
were come very near the Caſtle of this Magician, when they ſaw a very handſom
woman iſſuing out of the grove: She was habited like the Shepherdeſs on a ſtage;
and for her countenance, it could not more reſemble that of <hi>Lucida</hi> then it did, for
indeed it was ſhe. Yet <hi>Hircan</hi> having ſaid it was a Shepherdeſs call'd <hi>Amaryllis,
Lyſis</hi> firmly believ'd it. This is the day of Miracles, ſaid the Shepherd; behold
here's a Shepherdeſs in my judgement is very like an aquatick Nymph, whoſe image
is graven in my minde, though <hi>I</hi> ſaw her only by Moon-light. There is the ſame
reſemblances of faces in all your <hi>Romances:</hi> Thoſe which hold them impoſſible, why
are they not here now to acknowledge their error?</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Amaryllis</hi> came and did reverence to the company; and <hi>Hircan</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was time to retire, ask'd <hi>Lyſis</hi> whether he would do him the honor to ſup with
him. He thank'd him very kindely for the civiltty; but for this time he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
it, as not thinking fit to keep feſtivals, while his Miſtreſs was ſick. So all the
Shepherds bid him adieu till the next day, that they were all to meet again in the
ſame place, for to relate their ſeveral fortunes. In the return <hi>Carmelin</hi> drew his
Maſter towards the place where it was ſaid <hi>Parthenice</hi> was. It was a piece of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
ground, where there grew nothing but weeds; and there was in the midſt, a
great ſtone, which was at leaſt two farthoms ſquare: but as for the Shepherdeſs, ſhe
appear'd not any where. Give over thy ſearch <hi>Carmelin</hi> (ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> with a ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
ſight, as if he had ſpoken like a Prophet) thy <hi>Parthenice</hi> hath clearly chang'd
her nature: Seeſt thou not, that the Gods willing to puniſh her cruelty, have meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphos'd
her into a <hi>Rock?</hi> That's not credible, Maſter, ſaies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> ſhe only
ſaid one poor word to me, whereat <hi>I</hi> took no offence What ſhe ſaid to thee, was
full of malicious deriſion, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> when ſhe ſpoke to thee of wages, after thou
hadſt profer'd her thy ſervice; ſhe would ſhew thee that thou wert much below her,
and that ſhe thought thee fit to be her ſerving-man, and not her ſervant in Love.
Thou hadſt not the apprehenſion to make anſwer to it: ſhouldſt not thou have ſaid
that thou deſervedſt no other wages then her favour? My minde was taken up in the
contemplation of her, ſaies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> and beſides, <hi>I</hi> aſſure you, <hi>I</hi> thought not that
that word touch'd me ſo much to the quick; and <hi>I</hi> am ſtil to avow, that not finding it
any thing conſiderable in compariſon of the rigors of others, which ſometimes laſt
ten years, <hi>I</hi> cannot believe ſhe hath been chang'd into a ſtone for ſo ſmall a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Then it ſeems thou haſt not read <hi>Ovid. Carmelin,</hi> replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
which that Author mentions as met<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>morphos'd, have ſuffer'd upon the firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
they gave the Gods to do it: as for Example, <hi>Apollo</hi> had no ſooner purſued his
<hi>Daphne,</hi> nor <hi>Pan</hi> his <hi>Syrix,</hi> but thoſe two wenches ſlighting the love of the Gods,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43725:107"/>
the one was chang'd into a <hi>Laurel,</hi> and the other into a <hi>Reed.</hi> You have read more
then I have, ſays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> I am very glad to receive your inſtructions, and in
amends I will tell you what comes into my mind. It's likely your Magician, of whom
I have heard wonders, hath promoted the Metamorphoſis: but when I ſhall believe
it, what have I to do? Weep and ſigh night and day, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that's the <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
befits a Lover that hath loſt his Miſtreſs: And then my company will not be
tedious to thee, becauſe if I complain of one ſide, thou wilt of the other. For my
part, I ſhall ever ſpeak of the <hi>Command without Command</hi> of <hi>Charite.</hi> And in the
mean time, ſays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I ſhall never ceaſe ſpeaking of the <hi>Metamorphoſis with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Metamorphoſis</hi> of <hi>Parthenice.</hi> Thou doſt imitate my language very unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly,
replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> 'Tis very true, <hi>Charite</hi> hath commanded me without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
me; but 'tis not the ſame thing to ſay, that the Gods have meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphos'd
thy Shepherdeſs without metamorphoſing her: She is really chang'd, and
ſee if that ſtone be not white as her complexion and cloaths. In a certain place at the
top, which ſhould be the head, ſeeſt thou not certain marks which approach to red,
and others which come neer black? They are the places where her eyes and mouth
were: There are lower certain peeces which ſeem not to be well joyn'd together;
they are the arms, which are not at all faſtened to the bulk of the body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> conſidered all this; and though he believed but the leaſt part of it,
yet his Maſter having told him, that before he leave the place he muſt do all honour
to that ſtone, he was forc'd to go and kiſs it: But becauſe <hi>Lyſis</hi> thought he went
not to it with affection enough, he with much fierceneſs ſtruck his noſe againſt it.</p>
            <p>In their return to <hi>Bertrand's,</hi> the faithfull Lover of <hi>Charite</hi> ceaſed not to think
of the laſt anſwer of that fair one, which becauſe of its obſcurity ſeem'd to him an
oracle. But obſerving that <hi>Carmelin</hi> conducting the Flock went along with much
indifferencie, What! ſays he to him, weepeſt thou not, poor Lover? haſt thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
forgotten that this day thou haſt as ſoon loſt as found one of the faireſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
in the world? What would you have me do? replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> my eyes are
not ſo ſoft. Why doſt thou not anſwer me, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that tears are the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
of light griefs, of great ones aſtoniſhment? I excuſe thee if thou canſt not
yet ſhew great teſtimonies of grief: To morrow it will be thy buſineſs, when thou
ſhalt begin to remember thy ſelf. Thou haſt ſeen the actions of thoſe amorous
Shepherds which we have met; thou muſt not be leſs deſperate then they, but
ſhouldſt imitate them in all things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> anſwered <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that he would ever think on things preſent, and that on
the morrow he ſhould ſee what he had to do. This diſcourſe was their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
till they came home, where they hous'd their poor ſheep, which were ſo tired
with driving up and down, that they were ready to fall on their noſes. <hi>Lyſis</hi> having
ſupp'd with <hi>Bertrand's</hi> people, went to bed with <hi>Carmelin,</hi> repeating ſtill in his
mind his ſeveral adventures; and the laſt thing he ſaid before he fell aſleep, was,
that he was ſure that <hi>Fame</hi> was ſo deſirous to render him ſtill more glorious, that
ſhe was already grown hoarſe with the common cries ſhe had made of him in all
parts of the world.</p>

of the light of the Sun, that paſſing through his
Chamber-window, ſhin'd upon him as he lay. How happy
art thou bright Star? ſays he; not becauſe thou guideſt

haſt eyes which throw abroad an infinity of beams, and by

<hi>Lyſis,</hi> mayeſt at the ſame time take a view of <hi>Charite.</hi>
Why have not I the ſame power, that I may never be diſtant from the centre of my

that <hi>Carmelin</hi> was ſtill aſleep; ſo that jogging of him twice or thrice, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked
him. Why doſt not thou begin the morning as well as I, with ſpeaking ſome
handſom thing? ſaies he to him. Why do you not let me alone? ſaies the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Do you not ſee that I attentively liſtened to you? Ah! fool, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> am
I not certain thou wert aſleep? have I not heard thee ſnore, and have I not ſeen
how thou hadſt thy mouth and noſtrils open? now you are in the right, replies
<hi>Carmelin;</hi> you are to imagine that I opened my mouth to give utterance to ſome
good ſaying, and in the mean time you have made me loſe it, and it's now fled ſo far
out of my minde, that I ſhall not recover it a good while. Such diſcourſes <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin,</hi>

But for thy part, who haſt all the reaſon in the world to be afflicted, I do
not think fit thou ſhouldſt jeſt it away, if it be not to ſhew thou haſt loſt thy wits
with thy hopes: Were it only to obſerve a decorum in thy love, thou ſhouldſt
ever ſpeak ſomewhat like a diſtracted man, and run thy head againſt the wall, or the
bed-poſts. It ſhall be againſt the pillow, if I do it at all; I believe one as good as
the other. That were indeed better then to do nothing at all, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> for there
the ceremony were ſtill preſerved; but trouble not thy head any farther about it,
put on thy cloathes rather, and return to the place where thy Miſtreſs was metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos'd.
Thou wilt be more moved by the object of that new <hi>rock,</hi> then by any
thing now in thy memory; and I hope that my remonſtrances will then have more
influence on thee then they have now. Beſides that, I have ſome extraordinary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs

               <hi>Lyſis</hi> in ſo ſaying, being gotten up, <hi>Carmelin</hi> was oblig'd to imitate him; ſo that
they were both in a manner ready together. They had deſign'd the performance of
ſo many things that day, that they thought not fit to carry the flock abroad with
them, but commended it to the charge of their Land-lords ſon. <hi>Lyſis</hi> being thus
freed of all care, would in the firſt place go and ſee <hi>Clarimond.</hi> He found him in
his ſtudy writing. Truly friend, ſaies he to him, I am glad to ſee thee ſo induſtrious;
for it cannot be but among ſo many ſeveral things of thy compoſition, thou muſt
needs remember to beſtow ſomewhat on my adventures. Do me the favour to read
to me what thou haſt already begun. <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who had not yet troubled his head
with writing any thing for him, deſired him to have a little patience, till what he
had done were ſomewhat more reſin'd, if he would ſee ſomewhat. <hi>Lyſis</hi> was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and having caus'd this Hiſtorian to lay down his pen, he told him he came to
deſire his company into the fields, that he might bear witneſs of the nobleſt actions
in the world.</p>
            <p>By that time they had gone a pretty way, they were come to the place where was
the rock of <hi>Parthenice. Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Phyliris</hi> were there already: and the firſt thing
they did was to embrace the Shepherd, ſwearing to him they had had no reſt in his
abſence; and that they were gotten up two hours before day to ſeek him. Having
thank'd them for their good will, he told them of a deſign he had to erect a rural
Temple to his Miſtreſs, and that without jeſting, that was the occaſion of his making
ſo much haſte thither. It would not be amiſs to build it in this place, ſaies <hi>Clarimond,</hi>
here's a great eaven ſtone that may well ſerve for the altar. <hi>Carmelin</hi> would haply
be againſt that, ſaie <hi>Lyſis:</hi> This ſtone hath ſometimes been his Miſtreſs, who yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
for her cruelty was metamorphos'd: <hi>I</hi> doubt whether it were fit to put upon
it the victimes <hi>I</hi> ſhould offer to <hi>Charite.</hi> If it be ſo, ſaies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> it muſt not
be touch'd, there's no reaſon one Divinity ſhould ſerve another. But is it poſſible,
that this ſtone hath ſometimes been a maid? <hi>I</hi> tell you no lye, replyed <hi>Lyſis;</hi> put
but your hand on it, and you will finde ſome reliques of heat. Whereupon <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
touch'd the ſtone, and <hi>Lyſis</hi> touching it alſo; nay more then that, ſaies he,
feel it towards the breaſt, and you will finde the heart beats ſtill. The Shepherd
imagin'd all this; and <hi>Clarimond</hi> having put his hand on the place he ſhew'd him,
feign'd a great aſtoniſhment, and acknowledg'd he ſpoke nought but what was true.
<hi>Fontenay</hi> putting in among them, would needs know who that Miſtreſs was, and how
it hapned ſhe was metamorphos'd. You are to know, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that you no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
appear'd yeſterday with <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Parthenice,</hi> but <hi>Carmelin</hi> was touch'd with
the beauty of that Shepherdeſs. His paſſion was ſo violent, that it was no ſooner
conceiv'd then diſcover'd: ſo that he proffer'd his ſervice to the fair one, but ſhe
diſdainfully refus'd it, and went along with you: you, as I believe, left her in this
place, but inſtead of finding her here, we found this ſtone, into which the Gods have
chang'd her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fontenay</hi> admir'd the imagination of <hi>Lyſis;</hi> for he knew well enough what was
become of that <hi>Parthenice,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Synopa.</hi> Now here <hi>I</hi> think fit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43725:109"/>
ſome things, which happly have held the Reader in ſuſpence. I have purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imitated thoſe <hi>Romances,</hi> which bring divers perſons on the ſtage, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
whence they come, nor what they did before, but by little and little, ſo to
cauſe the greater admiration. I have accordingly obſerv'd this order; and <hi>I</hi> have
brought you a <hi>Philiris,</hi> a <hi>Polidor,</hi> and a <hi>Meliantes,</hi> without telling you why they
ſeem'd to be <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and that with as much extravagance as ours: But for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ones ſatisfaction, <hi>I</hi> acquaint you, that they were three Gentlemen, intimate
friends of <hi>Hircans,</hi> who were brought to his houſe by <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who had been to
fetch them there, to paſs away certain days. They had been already acquainted
with the extravagancies of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> which had rais'd in them ſuch a deſire of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
converſation, that they had diſguis'd themſelves as Shepherds, the eaſier to ſet
on him. They conſidered with themſelves, that men do often change cloathes for
a Dance or Play, and that they might as well act natural Paſtorals, that ſhould far
exceed all the fictions in the world, yet ſhould be perform'd with little pains, and
leſs charge. <hi>Hircan,</hi> who began to fall more in love with <hi>Lucida</hi> then <hi>Synopa,</hi> whom
he was weary of, had had ſome quarrel with this former Miſtreſs, ſo that ſhe was
reſolved to leave him. Being come out along with her to meet <hi>Lyſis,</hi> there was a
Coach attended him at a little diſtance, whereinto ſhe was diſpos'd, to return to
her Aunt, who had been ſo ill a guardian of her Neece, that ſhe had ſuffer'd her
to be drawn away to naughtineſs. Her houſe was about five leagues thence, ſo that
'tis to be imagin'd ſhe could not get there before midnight. <hi>Hircan</hi> was very glad
to be rid of her; becauſe among other his friends, he that acted <hi>Polidor,</hi> being a
perſon of a ſevere vertue, was ever quarrelling with him for his looſe life, and ever
perſwaded him to marry. Were there any woman in the world could engage his
thoughts that way, it muſt be ſhe whom we ſhall name <hi>Lucida,</hi> though ſhe had
another name. He had ſtaid her in his Caſtle, under pretence of paſſing away the
time with <hi>Lyſis,</hi> but it was indeed for to finde the means to entertain her when he
pleas'd. She was of an humor ſo familiar and compliant, that ſhe freely remain'd
in thoſe Lodgings he had aſſign'd her; and if you will credit the ſtory, you may be
aſſur'd that ſhe carried her felf nothing indiſcreetly, though ſhe were in a houſe
where there were ſo many men. The free open natures, ſuch as hers was, ſtand
out the longeſt. Beſides which, the hope ſhe had of having the company of ſome
yong Gentlewomen thereabouts, and the Paſtorals wherein ſhe was to act ſome
part, and which could not have been done without her, were ſufficient to excuſe
all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philiris</hi> and <hi>Fontenay</hi> had therefore left her in the Caſtle, with others that were
up no earlier then ſhe, deſirous to make ſome ſport with the imaginary Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis
of <hi>Parthenice,</hi> whereof they had juſt then receiv'd an account of <hi>Lyſis.</hi> If
it be true, ſays <hi>Philiris</hi> to him, that there is any heat in this ſtone, and that you feel
the motion of the heart 'tis an evident ſign that <hi>Parthenice</hi> is alive within it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhould think it fit there were hammers ſent for to break it open, that ſo the
poor Shepherdeſs may get out. Take heed of that, anſwers <hi>Lyſis,</hi> thou underſtandeſt
not what a <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> is: Doſt thou think <hi>Parthenice</hi> is enclos'd in this ſtone, as if
ſhe were in a ſheath, or rather in a ſepulchre? No ſuch matter, that were no true
Transformation, and the Gods would but deceive us. Learn then, that each part
of her body hath put on the form and the quality of a ſtone: So that if a man
ſhould touch the leaſt corner of it, he ſhould hurt it, and haply the blood would
iſſue out of her veins, which are viſible enough in divers places.</p>
            <p>I muſt tell you, ſays <hi>Philiris,</hi> that this is not ſo eaſily apprehenſible, that there
ſhould be life and blood in a ſtone; and yet to ſpeak truth, and not to wrong you,
you are not the firſt that ever affirm'd ſuch a thing: but the Poets who have ſaid it,
have not ſhewn how it could be effected. Is it not ſufficient to ſay it is done by the
omnipotence of the Gods? replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Will not that ſatisfie thoſe who will needs
have natural reaſons of miracles? All this is right, ſays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> but it hinders
not but I may believe that <hi>Parthenice</hi> may by ſome means or other be reſtor'd to
her firſt form. And to prove what I ſay, I can alledge, that there were ſometimes
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43725:109"/>
as many ſtones that were chang'd into men, as there were men chang'd inro ſtones:
I take the word Man for both ſexes. To give you an inſtance, have you not read
that <hi>Pygmalion's</hi> Statue was chang'd into a Woman, and that he enjoy'd her after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?
I have, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but that ſtone which was chang'd into fleſh had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a humane ſhape, that advanc'd the matter very much. Will you think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
that <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſend to <hi>Paris</hi> for a Statuary for to bring this Stone to the
figure of <hi>Parthenice?</hi> That's but to return to the diſcourſe we had before; here
will be a many blows and knocks given, which will make as many wounds; for there
is a ſenſitive ſoul which is in this ſtone, which never was in that of <hi>Pygmalion's</hi> which
had never been a woman. I have not yet done with you, replies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> you
may remember that <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha</hi> being to reſtore the world, caſt ſtones of
all ſorts and ſizes over their ſhoulders, which preſently became humane creatures.
A brave conceit indeed, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> if we have a mind to imitate thoſe Reſtorers
of Nature, we muſt caſt this ſtone over our heads. Now to do that, there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
the ſtrength of <hi>Hercules,</hi> or at leaſt we muſt be as ſtrong as <hi>Turnus</hi> who
caſt as big a ſtone as this at <hi>Aenaeas: Carmelin</hi> hath not ſo much ſtrength as thoſe
ancient <hi>Hero's.</hi> If you do not believe that this ſtone may be transform'd, ſays
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> and that you will not conſent it ſhould ſuffer the leaſt knock of a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
it remains that <hi>Carmelin</hi> endeavour to ſoften it. There are thoſe that ſay,
that Blood mollifies the Adamant; poſſibly it hath the ſame effect on all ſorts of
ſtones: Let <hi>Carmelin</hi> give himſelf a ſtab, that he may bleed on the ſtone. You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
not that it is only Goats blood that ſoftens ſtones, ſays <hi>Philiris.</hi> Excuſe me,
I think on't, replies <hi>Clarimond:</hi> but I ſee no reaſon but an Aſs may have the ſame
vertue as the Goat; ſo that <hi>Carmelin,</hi> not miſſing of the or the other, may not
fail to do what he deſires. Let us not laugh at the miſerable, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
jeſting, that all we can well adviſe <hi>Carmelin</hi> to, is, that to leave a teſtimony of
a tranſcendent love, and to make his memory eternal, he would endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Gods, that they would diſpoſe of him by ſome noble Metamorphoſis.
Some, it may be, would counſel him to be chang'd into a <hi>Rock,</hi> ſo to participate
of the ſame nature with his Miſtteſs; but that were not convenient, for he hath
not been guilty of the like cruelty. Then to be chang'd into ſome <hi>Tree,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
planted hereabouts might give an eternal umbrage to his incomparable <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
is not that which were convenient for him; for you ſee this ground is ſo dry,
that it is not fit for Trees; beſides they are never well neer Rocks, which ever hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſpreading of their roots. But that which I ſhould think the moſt proper, is,
that he were chang'd into a <hi>Fountain;</hi> 'tis the ordinary transformation of forſaken
perſons, and 'tis often ſeen that water iſſnes out of a rock: He ſhall perpetually
waſh the root of this, as if he had a deſign to ſoften it; and running cloſe by it, will
become the honour and delight of the whole Country: I will conſecrate the ſource
to ſome Divinity; and whoever drinks of it ſhall fall in love, by a ſtrange miracle,
that ſhall cauſe flames to iſſue out of the water. <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſhould have been me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphos'd
ever ſince I mention'd it; and if he diſpoſe not himſelf thereto, I ſhall
ſay he hath neither courage nor affection. How were it poſſible for me to ſatisfie all
your ſeveral imaginations? (ſays <hi>Carmelin</hi> very angrily) I know not what belongs
to turning <hi>Fountain,</hi> nor am I of opinion there may be any great good done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
for I find no great advantage in the water, unleſs it be for to waſh before meat.
I will not forbid thee the uſe of wine, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I ſee well thy thoughts run upon
the juice of the Vine: but doſt thou not remember that the <hi>Aquatick Deities</hi> which
we ſaw one night, were richly furniſhed with the proviſions of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus?</hi>
Thou ſhalt lead ſuch another life; bethink thy ſelf if it be not pleaſant. Thy water
ſhall be as clean as thy ſoul; the <hi>Nymphs</hi> and the <hi>Shepherdeſſes</hi> will come and bath
themſelves in it, and it may be <hi>Charite</hi> ſhall be one of the firſt; ſo that thou ſhalt
take infinite pleaſure to ſee ſo many Beauties all naked, and in feeling them all over,
as thou muſt: I ſhall then be jealous of thee, and ſhall think thy condition better
then my own. But if thou art ſo high-minded, that thou wilt have none but humane
creatures to drink of thy waters, there ſhall be notice given to all <hi>Shepherds, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:43725:110"/>
and <hi>Goatherds,</hi> not to bring any of their Cattel thither to water. Theſe are
indeed very excellent propoſitions, ſays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> but I have told you already that
I care not for the company of thoſe people of the other world, I'll never come
among them again. Thou canſt not receive any more hurt, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> for thou
ſhalt be of the ſame condition with them; and being an <hi>aquatick Demy-god,</hi> thou
wilt be far otherwiſe reſpected then when thou wert a poor mortal: Poſſibly thou
mayſt have ſome authority over the reſt; and as to what concerns Men, they ſhall
addreſs their vows and ſacrifices to thee; and I, and all thoſe whom thou haſt ſeen
in this country, will adore thee. Theſe promiſes are great, ſays <hi>Carmelin:</hi> And
for to taſte them, though I know not what you ſpeak to me of, and that it cannot
enter into my imagination that a man of fleſh and bone as I am can become water,
I aſſure you that I would gladly be one, if you can make me become ſo: For I
ſwear to you that I am extreamly curious; and I ſhall not much ſtand upon the
changing of my condition often, ſo that in the end I attain happineſs: But I pray
tell me how I muſt carry my ſelf for to be what you deſire I ſhould, that I may
know whether the pains exceed not the pleaſure. Thy obedience is commendable,
ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> ſince I ſee thou art ſo modeſt, I tell thee there are divers wayes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>Fountain:</hi> 'Tis true, I find not in Antiquity any other way then that of
weeping abundantly; but it is to be conceiv'd that both the Gods &amp; men are become
more ſubtile and ingenious ſince that time; for among the modern <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi>
we find that <hi>Synopa</hi> who was all ice, was melted into water by the <hi>fire</hi> of <hi>Love;</hi> and
that <hi>Lucida</hi> who had the Dropſie, hath piſs'd ſo much, that it became a Source.
But all this is nothing proper for thee, <hi>Carmelin:</hi> For firſt thy diſpoſition ſuffers
thee not to weep, and beſides thou art not ice, nor yet haſt thou the dropſie. We
muſt therefore find out ſome other way. I have known ſome men who by violent
exerciſe ſweated ſo, that the water dropp'd down as if they had been Statues of
ſnow expoſed to the ſun. Go thy ways ſomewhither, and play at <hi>Tennis</hi> or at
<hi>Football</hi> a whole day together, that may be a good means to accompliſh thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>You come not neer the mark, ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> why do you not rather bid
<hi>Carmelin</hi> go and get him the diſeaſe which the <hi>French</hi> call the diſeaſe of <hi>Naples,</hi>
and the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> the <hi>French</hi> diſeaſe? He might then go to <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſweat at
his pleaſure, with ſome of thoſe that force their Empirick bills upon all that paſs by;
and then you ſhall ſee him better metamorphos'd into a Fountain then the fair <hi>Acis.</hi>
Let's not buſie our thoughts with miſchief, I pray thee: <hi>Carmelin</hi> may be meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphos'd
without making himſelf infamous by any ſuch filthineſs. If there be no
more requiſite then to ſweat extreamly, he need not make uſe of any ſordid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
but go to ſome honeſt Hot-houſes; but I will furniſh him with ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
that he ſhall have to chooſe. The <hi>Alchimiſts</hi> extract water out of herbs,
flowers, roots, and divers other things which are more dry, by putting them into
the Alimbeck; it will not be amiſs ſo to diſpoſe of our miſerably amorous Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
that he may be diſtill'd. No ſuch matter, I thank you, ſays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I do not
intend to be ſet afire behind, nor do I conceive any goodneſs can proceed from all
your ſubtilties. What is more, my mind is wholly perplex'd in this buſineſs; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
though all my body were melted into water, as you would deſire it, there
would not be as much as would fill an hogſhead: For, meaſure me by a Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
proportion, you will find that I am but three foot about, and five foot high, all
which would not ſuffice to fill a Fountain-head, and continually ſupply a brook that
ſhould meaſure the diameter of this ground, or by crooked windings ſhould find a
paſſage into <hi>Morin,</hi> and thence into <hi>Marne,</hi> and thence into the <hi>Seine,</hi> and ſo into
the <hi>Ocean.</hi> There thou haſt ſpoken very learnedly, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and beſides that thy
terms are excellent, thy reaſon is miraculous. I know thou doubteſt of ſomwhat,
it is a ſign of ingenuity; for I have often heard it ſaid, that Doubt is the mother of
Philoſophy; and that becauſe when one is doubtfull of any thing, he deſires to be
more aſſured of it, and never leaves ſearching for it till he have found out what was
moſt hidden and ſecret therein.</p>
            <pb n="172" facs="tcp:43725:110"/>
            <p>I believe, that with a ſerious meditation, thou wouldſt thy own ſelf comprehend
how thoſe things I told thee may be effected; but I will ſhorten to thee the path
of truth, ſo that thou ſhalt touch it with thy finger. Take notice then, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Metamorphoſes which the Gods bring about, the bodies are either
dilated or contracted: it is no more difficult to the ſupreme Powers to make a
thing greater, then to make it leſs; and if it be certain, that <hi>Arachne</hi> was chang'd
into a Spider, and the Inhabitants of <hi>Licia</hi> into <hi>Frogs,</hi> it is as well poſſible that
<hi>Piſmires</hi> have been chang'd into <hi>men, Atlas</hi> into a <hi>Mountain,</hi> and ſome others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Rivers. Ovid</hi> never omits to ſpeak of this contraction and dilation, nor ſhould
he: but I know one ſecret, which neither he nor any other ever thought on, which
yet if it be not known, a man cannot explain the Metamorphoſes; and this is it,
when there is a neceſſity a man ſhould be chang'd into ſomething greater then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
then the Gods cauſe certain winds to enter into him, which ſwell him up to the
proportion required; and when another is to be chang'd into ſome little creature,
they infuſe a certain drought into him, that conſumes whatever is ſuperfluous: ſo
though they do ſome miracles which appertain only to themſelves, and whereof
there cannot likely any natural reaſon be given; yet do they not hinder but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
cauſes may operate ſomewhat therein. I have been fain to ſearch the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
of <hi>Jupiter</hi> for to be aſſur'd of this miracle, and who ever underſtands it, may
take away the vail of his ignorance. By this thou art to underſtand, <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that
it is eaſie for the Gods to change thee into a fountain, and that thou mayeſt ſupply
water enough for that end, ſince ſome men who were of no greater corpulence, then
thou, have been chang'd into Rivers and Mountains. The Inhabitants of heaven pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for whatever is done here below; and though they could not make the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
of thy current, neither broad nor long, yet would they ſo diſpoſe of thee that
thy waters about fifty paces from the ſource, ſhould be receiv'd under ground, and
by ſome ſecret conduits ſhould return to the place whence they came, that ſo thou
mightſt never dry up. That were nothing extraordinary, there are in the world
great Rivers, which finde themſelves channells under ground, nay it is to be believ'd
that the ſea it ſelf is ſwallow'd in Abyſſes, that it may reſtore the water it receiv'd,
that ſo the earth might not be dryed up. Further, to take things at the worſt, though
the Gods ſhould not do thee the favour which they have done to many others, and
allowing thee only ſo much water as thou art big; and ſhould leave thee in ſome
ditch where thou mightſt be drunk up by beaſts, or haply chang'd to Vapour by
the attraction of the Sun beams, yet would I take a courſe thou ſhouldſt not loſe
any thing: For I would cauſe thee to be taken up with pails, and thou ſhouldſt be
put into a baſin in ſome rich cabinet. There would I have made an admirable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
whereof I will diſcover the invention for thy ſake. Thy water being in a
cyſtem, rais'd up on high, ſhould fall by a ſmall channel upon a little mill, which
it ſhould turn, and thence ſhould fall into a Baſin that were under. Now the
mill ſhould at one end have a wheel, which ſhould turn another, and that another,
and that a beam, about which there ſhould be a pipe made wave-like, or rather like
a chevron, whereof one end being plac'd in the water, ſhould be ſtill ſupply'd, and
cauſe it by little and little to aſcend, the upper part becoming the loweſt, and
then immediately aſcending: Thus the water ſhould be pour'd, as it were into a
trough, whence it ſhould return into its firſt receptacle, and be continually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
ſo that it ſhould never fail. Now I would take order, that no body ſhould
drink of it, no not ſo much as the flyes; and thy water never diminiſhing, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and returning, thou ſhouldſt be an artificial fountain, portative and eternal, a
thing was yet never ſeen, and there were no ſpeaking of thee without admiration,
all believing thee to be an enchantment. Beſides, I am to tell thee, that there were
no great quantity of water requir'd for this; for though thou ſhouldſt afford but a
pailful, I ſhould make it ſerve the turn, by making my engine the leſs: but I doubt
not but thou wilt yield a great deal of water; for before thou ſhouldſt be meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphos'd,
thou ſhouldſt put on half a dozen cloaks, and ſo many night gowns,
and all that will become liquid as well as thee. The cloathes are ever metamorphos'd
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43725:111"/>
with the body in <hi>Ovid</hi> (as I think I have told thee before) and as the tail of <hi>Ocy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioes</hi>
gown became a horſe tail; ſo the skirts and ſhreds of thy cloathes will melt
into ſtreams.</p>
            <p>This then is the recompence you promis'd me for my ſervices, ſays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> if
I ever ſtand to it, I will here ſwear once for all, that you ſhall ſeek another ſervant,
and I will finde another Maſter. You will load me with more cloaks, then if I
were ſome boy belonging to the guard. You will have me ſweat in Frying-pans;
you will encloſe me in Alimbecks; and at laſt you will diſpoſe me into Baſins, and
make me paſs through Conduit-pipes, Mills and Troughs. Where to the Devil
runs your wit? ſhall I not be burn'd up, and beaten to pieces after all this? Let
me know at leaſt, what I have done to deſerve to be put thus to the Rack, Gibbet
and Pillory? Have I maſſacred my Father? Have I betray'd a City? Have I coyn'd
bad money? Am I an unconſcionable Seller, or an Uſurer? Thou art nothing of
all this, I confeſs, <hi>Carmelin,</hi> ſaies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> nor are there any ſuch puniſhments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for thee, as thou conceiveſt. When thy body ſhall be all reduc'd to water,
thou art no more ſenſible of any hurt, poor fool: There will be much gotten by
preſſing thee, thy members cannot be cruſh'd, for thou canſt ſlide away through
the leaſt hole. That then in good earneſt is your meaning, replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> and
'tis worſe then before: Your will is I ſhould not be any thing but water; when I
am to eat, where will be my mouth? If any body come near me, where will be
my eyes for to ſee him? And if he ſpeak, where will be my ears to hear him? In
fine, where will be all my members to execute the ordinary offices for which God
hath ordain'd them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> having ſo ſaid, <hi>Lyſis</hi> was ready to give him ſome extravagant reaſon
for his complaints; and I believe he would have perſwaded him, that after he were
chang'd into a fountain, the Gods might eaſily form him a body of ſubtile vapors,
according to the doctrine which had been infus'd into him: for he remembred him
he had ſeen <hi>Lucida</hi> and <hi>Synopa,</hi> who yet had bodies, though they were chang'd
into water. But upon this <hi>Philiris</hi> comes and ſays, Diſpute not any more, Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
your difference is eaſily reconciled. 'Tis true, <hi>Carmelin</hi> hath reaſon to be
metamorphos'd into a Fountain, but he muſt ſtay till the Gods out of their full
power ordain it ſo: That we muſt expect from them, and not cauſe him to be melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into water by natural inventions; that were to tempt the Divinities, and draw
their indignation on us. <hi>Lyſis</hi> acknowledg'd this conſideration to be very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
and was angry with himſelf that he had not been the Author of it. So that
he promis'd <hi>Carmelin</hi> not to importune him any further as to his Metamorphoſis.
His thoughts now returned to the Temple he had a deſign to build; ſo that truning
towards <hi>Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who ſtood amaz'd at his ſubtil argumentations, he
ask'd them if they would aſſiſt him to begin his edifice. We are no Maſons, ſaies
<hi>Fontenay;</hi> beſides, a ſumptuous Temple cannot be built in a moment, without
materials or tools. But after what manner would you have it? Alas! that I am
not an <hi>Amphion,</hi> that I might with the ſound of my harp bring together all the
ſtones in this Countrey, ſaies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I would build an incomparable Temple: But
ſince that's wanting, I muſt this day ſeek out divers workmen for to be employ'd in
it. To ſpare all that coſt, ſaies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> 'twere better you would content
your ſelf to dedicate your heart as a Temple to your Divinity. There you may be
the victim and the Prieſt together. The fire of your love will there ſhine ever;
your ſighs will ſerve for incenſe, and your tears ſhall be the holy-water. That's
well imagined, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but it hinders not but I may be much taken with my
deſign. To anſwer therefore the Shepherd <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who deſires the particulars
of it; I declare, That my Temple being built of the faireſt marble can be found,
I will place upon the Altar, the picture of <hi>Charite,</hi> which was drawn by <hi>Anſelme,</hi>
with this written above it:
<q>
                  <hi>To THE</hi>
METAPHORICALL GODDESSE.</q>
This Propoſition is ſo much the more noble, becauſe it is not common; and that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43725:111"/>
it may be judg'd whether my Miſtreſſes picture do not well deſerve a Temple, let
the world ſee and judge.</p>
            <p>In ſaying ſo, he took out a Box out of his pocket, wherein was that picture en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed,
which he ever carried about him, though it were of a pretty bigneſs. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liris</hi>
and <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who had never ſeen it before, admir'd the invention; and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
who had ſeen it the firſt time he met <hi>Lyſis,</hi> viewing it alſo, found in it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
he had not obſerv'd before. Methinks, ſaies he to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that where before
the breaſt was repreſented by two <hi>balls of ſnow,</hi> there are now two <hi>Globes,</hi> where may
be ſeen the <hi>Aequator,</hi> with the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> and other circles. You are in the right,
replyes <hi>Lyſis, Anſelme</hi> hath reform'd it ſince you ſaw it, having ſent for colours
to <hi>Colommiers;</hi> but this laſt thing is of my own invention, and as time makes us
wiſer: I have left the ſnow for <hi>Charite</hi>'s neck, and ſome places adjacent; and as
for her breaſts, I thought fit they ſhould be repreſented as two worlds, for to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the picture more delightful by the variety. It is certain your Maſters the Poets
do ordinarily compare the <hi>breaſts</hi> of their Miſtreſſes to <hi>worlds,</hi> ſaies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> but
very impertinently. You are miſtaken, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and I aſſure you, that if I
poſſeſs'd <hi>Charite</hi>'s breaſt, I ſhould think my ſelf happier then any Emperor; for I
ſhould be maſter of two worlds, whereas the greateſt Emperor that ever was, could
never enjoy one. An excellent fancy indeed! ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> becauſe the breaſts
are round, therefore they are worlds, Apples and plums, and all things that are
round are wordls too. 'Tis a very ſlender reſemblance of a thing, to have nothing
of it but the ſimple figure; but yet in this caſe you cannot make good all you ſay,
The breaſt of a woman hath but two half bowls, they muſt be put together to
make one whole one; ſo that you are ſtill ſhort of your reck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning; for you can
finde but one world, which is divided into two, as the Coſmographers repreſent
it in their univerſal Maps: And I muſt tell you, that it was a far neater invention
of thoſe who ſay, That <hi>Venus</hi> having obtained of <hi>Paris</hi> the Apple, which was to be
given the faireſt of the Goddeſſes, ſhe was ſo taken with it, that having cut it in
two, ſhe plac'd it on her breaſt, and wore it for an eternal ſign of her victory, and
will'd all thoſe of her ſex ſhould do the like. However, if you deſire that <hi>Charite's</hi>
breaſt have two Globes, <hi>I</hi> grant it you; and <hi>I</hi> will in that ſenſe too teach you an
imagination which you never knew; and that is to ſay, that half of each Globe is
ſunk into the body, and that there is only what remains apparent; and as for the
<hi>nibbles,</hi> it muſt be believ'd they are the <hi>Poles.</hi> Moreover, to render the picture more
judicious and rational, it ſhould be my advice to feign that one is a <hi>Terreſtrial</hi>
Globe, and the other the <hi>Celeſtial;</hi> but though we ſhould grant all that, yet will
there be ſtill ſomewhat to be reprehended; for if they be worlds, they muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
have Suns to enlighten them, and it cannot be perceiv'd they have any, if we
do not ſuppoſe the eyes; but they are at too great a diſtance: But if you would
take them for two Suns, how can you imagine it, ſince you call <hi>Charite</hi> a Sun, that
carries them about? One great ſtar therefore carries two little ones, and that alſo
contains two worlds. Thus are all things confuſed among the Poets; and to hope
any ſatisfaction from their impertinent imaginations were the vaineſt thing in the
world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having heard all this diſcourſe, with an extream impatience; very angerly
anſwered thus, I ſhould never have believed <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that thou hadſt ſo little
judgement as thou makeſt appear. Thou canſt carp at the excellent deſcriptions of
Beauty us'd by Poets, and canſt not believe that one Planet may carry others, and
worlds beſides. It ſhews thou knoweſt little in <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> and haſt no great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the opinions of thoſe Philoſophers, who hold there are worlds in
the Moon and Stars. Beſides, doſt thou think it improper, that the eyes be the
ſuns of the breaſt? doſt thou think they are too remote, ſeeing they are faſtned in
the face as in their heaven, and that the two Globes which are under repreſent the
earth? Thou wilt haply tell me, there is no need of two Suns ſo near one the other.
But though there were but one world, yet were there no inconvenience; for I will
prove it to thee, that this great world wherein we all live, is not content with one;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43725:112"/>
and that this is true, look into all the <hi>Poets,</hi> both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> thou wilt finde
that when they ſpeak of a man, that hath travelled about the earth, they ſay that
he hath ſeen the one and the other ſun. And this is it hath made me conceive there
are two ſuns in the world. But the greateſt teſtimony in this caſe is, that it is held
for certain, that there are <hi>Antipodes;</hi> and if there be, they muſt have their Sun as
well as we ours. I remember, that being at St. <hi>Cloud, Anſelme</hi> laught at me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I ſaid the Sun was going to ſleep in the waters; if I had then known what I
have imagined ſince upon reading the verſes of a certain Poet, I had anſwer'd him
to the purpoſe. He asked me how it wos poſſible, that the Sun ſhould paſs away
the night in the ſea, in banquetting and taking his reſt, and yet be ſeen the next
morning in another end of the world, as if he had travell'd all the time. But now
I am aſſur'd that there are two Suns which enlighten us one after another, and while
one ſleeps, the other perfects his carreer. I will not trouble my ſelf here to make
you any demonſtrations; I muſt then have had the compaſs and rule. Finde your
ſelf out the reaſon of what I tell you, when you are beſt at leiſure. Then for the
ſeveral faces of the Moon, whereof I might be demanded an account; I profeſs to
you, that I underſtand nothing of theſe divers aſpects of the Moon, wherewith I
have been ſo often entertained, I therefore believe there are three or four Moons in
the world; for otherwiſe, how were it poſſible we ſhould ſee it ſometimes round,
and ſometimes cut in two. It is to be conceiv'd, that the full Moon and half Moon
are two ſeveral Stars.</p>
            <p>Such excellent conceptions as yours, are worthy to be admir'd, ſaies <hi>Clarimond;</hi>
I confeſs my ſelf overcome, and yet I cannot but ſay, that let things be taken which
way you will, the little worlds of <hi>Charit</hi>'s breaſts, have no need of Suns, ſince they
can have no other inhabitants then fleas. Thou ſpeakeſt injuriouſly, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi>
thoſe worlds are peopl'd with <hi>Cupids</hi> and <hi>Graces.</hi> I would gladly know what ſort of
creatures thoſe are which you name, replies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> for all your <hi>Poets</hi> and
Makers of <hi>Romances,</hi> ſpeaking of a <hi>Beauty,</hi> ſay, that the <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Cupids</hi> flye
about her face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have a hundred times view'd ſome of the faireſt, imagining I
ſhould ſee an infinite number of little wing'd boys go plant themſelves on her noſe,
as it were on a Bulwark; or hide themſelves within it, as in the Loop-hools, and
then go and ſuffer the Strapado in hee hair, but I never could ſee any thing of all
this. That is not ſeen but with the eyes of the minde, ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> art thou now
ſatisfied? And if thou doubteſt of the dignity of the two Suns of <hi>Charites</hi>'s face,
becauſe they remove not out the place, as thoſe which run through the <hi>Zodiak,</hi>
learn, that thoſe things which are moſt permanent, are the moſt to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed.</p>
            <p>All theſe fine reaſons could not withhold <hi>Clarimond</hi> from ever pleying on <hi>Lyſis;</hi>
ſo that the Shepherd not being able any longer to ſuffer his abuſes, put up his picture
in a fury. So, ſo, put up your <hi>Metaphorical Deity,</hi> ſaies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> ſome other
time we ſhall lay the foundation of her Temple: I ſhall at the preſent entertain
you with a more a neceſſary diſcourſe. Let us repoſe our ſelves a little I pray. As
ſoon as he had ſo ſaid, all that were preſent ſate them down on the graſs; and he
reſuming the diſcourſe, ask'd <hi>Lyſis,</hi> Whether he would give him leave to ſay what
he would: The Shepherd anſwered, yes: So <hi>Clarimond</hi> entered into this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentle Shepherd, I</hi> am very ſorry to ſee your minde poſſeſſed with ſuch an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of peſtilent opinions; and (which is worſt of all) like a contagion you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to communicate them to all that come near you. You talk of nothing but
<hi>Metamorphoſes;</hi> and you would make <hi>Carmelin</hi> and the other Shepherds of your
acquaintance, believe, that a man may be metamorphos'd into a Fountain, a Stone,
a Tree, a Bird, and divers other forms. <hi>I</hi> muſt purge your brains of theſe ſtrange
imaginations, and ſhew you, that although you have found them in a many books,
yet are they but pure fables. <hi>I</hi> will make it appear to you in what manner they
came into credit in the world, that you may perceive your error.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:43725:112"/>
In the firſt place, for what concerns the <hi>Aquatick Metamorphoſis:</hi> There was
ſometimes in <hi>Arcadia</hi> the ſon of a great Lord, who fell into a fountain and was
drown'd in't, his friends were extreamly diſcomforted at it: But there was a <hi>Poet,</hi>
who to comfort them, and get a little money from them, made ſome verſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he feign'd that the Gods had taken away that childe from amongſt men, for to
prefer him to a happier condition, and that they had metamorphos'd him into a
divine and ſacred <hi>Fountain.</hi> That was afterward by the ſuperſtitious people taken
for truth. A while after that, a certain man whom ſome theeves had kill'd, having
been buried in a field, there grew out by chance a <hi>flower</hi> out of the earth,
wherewith they had covered his body; ſo that it was believ'd, with much appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
that it was a <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> which the Gods had made of him. Another
having been ſhot through with arrows in the wars, was negligently cover'd with
earth, the ſhafts not taken out of his body, and being of a green and ſoon grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wood, they eaſily took root, and caſt out branches; ſo that it was given out,
that that body was chang'd into a <hi>Tree.</hi> There were a ſort of Countrey people,
who reported the ſame thing of another dead man, whom they had buried at the
foot of an Elm, inſtead of a dog, for to make it bud forth. A certain traveller
going along the fields, a piece of a mountain fell on him, and cover'd him ſo that
he was never ſeen after. Thoſe who knew which way he was gone, not meeting
with him, but finding inſtead a little mountain hard by the greatone, imagin'd the
Gods had beſtowed that form on him.</p>
            <p>As concerning thoſe whom men have thought to have been chang'd into ſavage
creatures, they were onely ſome people, who had cover'd themſelves with wolf
skins, for to be thought wolves; or had put on Lyons skins, or any other beaſt, for
to run about frightning little children, and exerciſing divers cruelties.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi> of men into <hi>Birds,</hi> though it cannot be ſaid it was
effected by a like diſguiſing, becauſe there is hardly any bird that hath not the body
leſs then a mans, yet it hinders not but the reaſon thereof may be found out; and
to that purpoſe I ſhall give you an example, as pleaſant as true: There was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
in the Province of <hi>Greece</hi> a ſubtle and miſchievous fellow, called in his language
<hi>Raven,</hi> who having committed a many Felonies and Adulteries, was furiouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
by the Magiſtrates of the place. The Conſtables having perceived him afar
off in a field, made as faſt as they could after him; but he was ſo well footed, that
he recovered a little thicket, and being got out of that, he was preſently by a rivers
ſide, into which he reſolv'd to caſt himſelf for his ſafety: he immediately put off
his cloathes, and got into the deepeſt of the water, where he might hold out long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
for he was one of the beſt Divers in the world. The Conſtables being come
to the Rivers ſide, found nothing but his cloathes, on which by chance a great black
<hi>Bird</hi> was rooſted: They came nearer by little and little, and imagin'd, that he whom
they came to take, as he was capable of doing all ſort of miſchief, ſo was he as well
a Magician as a Thief, and that by his charms he had chang'd his firſt body into that
of a Bird; for otherwiſe they could not conceive in what manner he ſhould come
to diſappear. But the bird having expected them ſome time, and looking on them
very fixtly, as if he had defy'd them, fled away when they were come within ten
paces of it; and 'twas then in vain to think to ſhoot at it, or by running hither and
thither, to get any tidings of it. They never could learn any thing of certain of it;
ſo that they were forc'd to return into their City, for to tell the Judges, how that
the Felon was metamorphos'd. Since that time, the Bird whereof he was thought
to have taken the form, was from his name called <hi>Raven;</hi> and if that Bird be ſeen
much about Gallow's, and places of Execution, to feed on carcaſes, people would
ſay, that the Gods, the juſt puniſhers of crimes, did ordain, that notwithſtanding
the change of his nature, yet would he ever be about the place where he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
to end his life, and that he could not live but he muſt feed on thoſe like him.
As for the Thief, after he had continued ſome time in the water, he thought that
thoſe who ſought after him were far enough, but coming to the ſhore, he found no
cloathes; for one of the Officers had taken them away, both becauſe there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43725:113"/>
elſe to be gotten, as alſo that he might ſhew them all the world for a miracle.
This wretch being ſtark naked, croſs'd the River; and when he was come to the
other ſide, he kept himſelf cloſe in a Wood, where for ſome time he lived like a
ſavage, and at length he betook himſelf to ſome Faggot-men that us'd there, and
paſs'd over the reſt of his dayes unknown, being very glad whenever he heard any
one ſay that he was not reckoned amongſt mankind.</p>
            <p>The metamorphoſis which was imagin'd to have happen'd to him, was, to ſay
truth, very excellent, and without any relation to the others; for there was no need
of his cloaths to bring it about, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> believ'd that he put them off for his
more eaſie transformation. On the contrary, <hi>Lyſis, Ovid,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Poets</hi>
will not have the cloaths exempted from the metamorphoſis: If they change a man
into any creature, whether his Breeches be of cloth or of ſatten, it muſt be deſign'd
for hair or feathers; and if they transform an <hi>Italian</hi> woman into a Bird, the great
ſleeves of her <hi>Looſe-gown</hi> would ſerve to make her wings; and as for a Southern
woman with her little <hi>Furr'd-cloak,</hi> ſhe ſhould become a Winter-Crow. Were I
ſo minded, I could thus find the original of many Metamorphoſes; but 'tis not to
be conceiv'd there is any neceſſity of it. <hi>Lyſis</hi> is more then half converted: He muſt
now ſhake hands with the error he hath been ſo long in, otherwiſe it is a great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
he may ſome time or other die of hunger or thirſt: for he imagining that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he ſaw on the earth had ſometimes been men, he would not preſume ſo much
as to drink water, left it might be blood; nor dare eat of any birds, or beaſts, or
fruit, out of a fear he might be at the buttocks of ſome of his kinred.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Clarimond</hi> ended his diſcourſe: but that it was not ſhorter, was not <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s
fault; for not being able to hear him talk after that manner, he was ready to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
him at every word, and had done it, had not the Shepherd <hi>Philiris</hi> impoſed
ſilence on him as ſoon as he would have open'd his mouth. However in the end he
anſwer'd as followeth. Stupid <hi>Clarimond!</hi> I am now at a loſs what eſteem I ſhould
have of thee, ſince thou ſtill continueſt thy abuſing of ſacred myſteries, and canſt
not credit things that are moſt true. Thou wilt not believe there can be any <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſes,</hi>
and yet 'tis not long ſince thou ſaweſt me chang'd into a Tree, and beſides
thou haſt heard the Hiſtories of the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> and <hi>Fountain-Nymphs</hi> of this
Country who came to ſee me. Wilt thou deny this, whereof I have ſo good wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes?
I tell you once more, that you were no more chang'd into a Tree then I
was, ſince you put me to it ſo far, replies <hi>Clarimond.</hi> Cannot <hi>Carmelin</hi> give thee the
lye? anſwers <hi>Lyſis.</hi> I beſeech you bring not me into your conteſtations, ſays <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin,</hi>
I am too peaceable a man. <hi>Fontenay,</hi> do you maintain to <hi>Clarimond,</hi> ſays
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> that I was chang'd into a Tree; and bear witneſs of it alſo to <hi>Philiris</hi> and
the reſt lately come hither, that they may not take me for an Impoſtor. I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that buſineſs but by the relation I had of it, replies <hi>Fontenay;</hi> I was not in
this Country when this adventure happened, I was gone to a little Town whence I
returned but yeſterday. But I muſt tell you by the way, that there are many that
hold the <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi> for <hi>fictions,</hi> and do not believe there are any <hi>Divinities</hi> in
the <hi>woods</hi> or <hi>waters.</hi> For my part, I have ſometime believed that there were, and
now I know not whether I ought to continue in the ſame opinion. But more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
I was not perſwaded of any thing ſo much, as that there were <hi>Nayads:</hi>
And if you pleaſe, I'll tell you for what reaſon I was poſſeſs'd with that imagination.
I ſhall hearken to you very willingly, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Poſſibly there may be ſomwhat
in this ſtory may touch the minds of theſe infidels. Nay then, ſays <hi>Fontenay,</hi> I will
double your ſatisfaction; for together with it you ſhall have the reſt of my life.
That's it <hi>I</hi> deſire, ſayes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> ſee every one prepares himſelf to
hear.</p>

                        <p>YOU are then to know, dear Company! ſays <hi>Fontenay,</hi> That the Sun had
not fourteen times meaſur'd the compaſs of the Zodiack after <hi>I</hi> was born,
when in the moſt intenſe heat of the Summer there ſeiz'd on me a deſire
to waſh my ſelf in the River <hi>Marne,</hi> which was within a league of my houſe.
<hi>I</hi> would needs one evening make experience of that pleaſure <hi>I</hi> had before never
taſted: but in ſtead of being refreſh'd and cool'd, <hi>I</hi> was the more enflam'd. <hi>I</hi>
was no ſooner gotten up to the reins in the water, but <hi>I</hi> perceiv'd a Maid who
was alſo waſhing herſelf; and being deſirous to embrace her, ſhe got away ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
into an iſle where ſhe hid herſelf, ſo that <hi>I</hi> could find her no more.
<hi>I</hi> had ſo much fear to be drowned, that <hi>I</hi> durſt not advance ſo far; ſo that this
loſs was a great affliction to me. <hi>I</hi> look'd all about to ſee for ſome Boat where
the fair one might haply have got in, but there was none; or if there were, it
muſt be the other ſide of the iſle. That made me believe that ſhe <hi>I</hi> had
ſeen was no mortal creature; and calling to mind the different <hi>Divinities</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>I</hi> heard my Preceptors talk, <hi>I</hi> imagin'd it was a <hi>Nayad,</hi> ſince ſhe ſeem'd to me
to ſwim as well as any Fiſh. Now though <hi>I</hi> had not obſeved the features of her
countenance, yet was <hi>I</hi> eaſily induc'd to conceive that ſhe was extreamly fair;
and that kindled in my heart a paſſion, which <hi>I</hi> thought ſhould never be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd.
When <hi>I</hi> had put on my cloaths again, all my comfort was to lie down
on the Rivers ſide, and to ſhed abundance of tears to encreaſe the waters of my
Nymph. The Stars were now ready to fall on the other Hemiſphere, and Night
by little and little drew her curtains wherewith ſhe had hidden the face of heaven,
when it came into my mind that there liv'd neer this place a <hi>Magician</hi> of whom
<hi>I</hi> might hope ſome aſſiſtance, if it were poſſible <hi>I</hi> could receive any. All the
Shepherds in our quarters or neer us, were charg'd to look to their ſheep when
they ſhould caſt their lambs, for to fley them and bring their skins to him to make
<hi>virgin-parchment:</hi> the Midwives alſo were in like manner very careful to preſerve
thoſe thin Cawls wherewith there are ſome children born: The Falconers, who
made in other Countries all Birds their game, durſt meddle with nothing but
Dormice and ſome other unlucky birds; and all this for to provide materials for
the enchantments of <hi>Zenocritus,</hi> that was the name of this Magician. <hi>I</hi> heard ſay
that he would pull the Gods out of their thrones, and that he broke open hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates,
and that he ſent back Rivers to the ſources, to the great aſtoniſhement of
their banks. Beſides it was reported, that all the riches he had in the world was
an Angel in gold; but that it was ſo enchanted, that when he had given it a
Tradeſman for ſome commodity, it ever came back again into his purſe, a place
it ſeems it affected better then any where elſe. 'Twas alſo believ'd for certain,
that if he took a gimlet and pierc'd one of the Poſts of a Table, he would make
wine come forth; and if they went afterwards into the Merchants Cellar, they
found the Pipe which had loſt it, for he by his magick would cauſe the wine to be
tranſported to his houſe. For what concerns the curing of diſeaſes, in that point
he defied all Phyſitians; and whenever he cured any of his friends, he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
the diſeaſes into his enemies, that ſo he might not entrench upon Fate,
whoſe ordinance it was there ſhould ever be ſomebody ſick. 'Tis true, <hi>I</hi> was not
deſirous to be fully cured of my diſeaſe; <hi>I</hi> took ſuch delight in it, that <hi>I</hi> was
content only to be a little eas'd. <hi>I</hi> went therefore and knock'd at this Magicians
door before day; and he, who was already at his ſtudy, came preſently to the
door. It was an old man whoſe beard was of ſuch a length, that beſides that part
he had left in the middle, he had twiſted what was on both ſides, and it ſerved
him for a girdle. That was a thing ſtrange enough to ſee: but <hi>I</hi> was much more
amaz'd when <hi>I</hi> obſerv'd that he had ſo many wrinkles on his face, whereof ſome
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43725:114"/>
were in direct lines, and others in oblique, that they ſeem'd as ſo many magical
characters that time had drawn there, to make him maſter of life and death.
Aſſoon as he had bidden me good morrow, I ſhook as a reed on the brink of a
lake, at the ſound of his whizzing voice, which ſeem'd to iſſue out of hell through
ſome abyſs. But at length he ſpoke more mildly to me, and reſtor'd me bidding
me not fear at all, becauſe I was ſo much in favour with heaven, that I ſhould find
the aſſiſtance I look'd for; and that he well ſaw that what I ailed was nothing
more then ordinary to Youth, that is to ſay, the diſeaſe of Love, forwhich he
was ſtor'd with all ſorts of remedies. How well have you already gheſs'd! an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
I: 'Tis true, I am in Love, but 'tis not with a mortal creature, but a
<hi>Nayad</hi> I ſaw yeſterday in the River, but cannot ſince recover the ſight of, though
I waited till now: Do me but the favour that I may ſee her once more before I
die, and I ſhall ſo recompence you, that you will reſt as well ſatisfied as I.
<hi>Zenocritus</hi> promis'd me to do what I deſired; and having brought me into a dark
chamber, he put off my cloaths, and put them on again, mumbling over certain
barbarous words. Thence he led me into his Court; where when he had made a
circle, and lighted three candles about it, he caſt a vail over my head, and read a
while in his Conjuring-book. This done, he took me by the hand, and made me
go a great way vail'd as I was; then having made me kneel, he took the vail off
my head, and told me I was where I deſired to be, and that it was in my power to
remain two hours before my Miſtreſs. Upon that he left me, as being unwilling
to be a witneſs of my amorous thefts: But the enchantments paſs'd had made
me ſo ſtupid, that it was a good while ere I remembred me that I was on the
<hi>Marne</hi> ſide. As I caſt my ſight on the waters, which were very clear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
I ſaw in them a Nymph, the faireſt could be imagin'd: ſhe had on her
head a dreſſing of cloth of ſilver, with ſmall purl-work, and a blew gown. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
conceiv'd it was my <hi>Nayad,</hi> and that I ſhould make uſe of the opportunity
to gain her favours, ſince the charms of <hi>Zenocritus</hi> had come to ſo good effect.
Fair <hi>Nayad!</hi> ſaid I to her in an extreme tranſportation: <hi>I</hi> confeſs modeſty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
you to appear ſo clad to the eys of men; yet <hi>I</hi> muſt tell you, <hi>I</hi> would rather
have ſeen you naked, as <hi>I</hi> did laſt night; for it being now broad day, <hi>I</hi> ſhould
have been incredibly ſatisfied in conſidering you all over: Since the honour of
beauty conſiſts in nothing ſo much as to be ſeen, why are you ſo carefull to hide
your ſelf? Thus did <hi>I</hi> entertain her, thinking ſhe would ſpeak to me: but ſhe
anſwer'd me not at all, and was only content to look on me with languiſhing
eyes. <hi>I</hi> perceiv'd her lips move, but her voice reach'd not my ears, ſo that <hi>I</hi>
thought it might be the water hinder'd it. That made me ſay to her, Come out
of the water, my fair Sun! behold the great Sun of the world comes out too:
Come and enlighten our earth, where all men ſhall adore you: Come give me
your hand, that <hi>I</hi> may help you to get out. In ſo ſaying <hi>I</hi> kiſs'd my right hand
and preſented it to her: At the ſame time ſhe kiſs'd her left hand and preſented
it to me, as if ſhe had been deſirous to come to me; but though my fingers
ſeem'd to be very neer hers, yet could I not touch them: which making me half
deſperate, I fell to beating my breaſt. The Nymph did the like for to ſympathize
with my grief; whereat I was ſo troubled, that it ſet me a weeping, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
ſhe wept too. You ſuffer too much, ſaid I then; 'tis neceſſary I come
to you, my fair one, ſince you cannot come to me. And in ſaying ſo I caſt my
ſelf into the water, which being ſhallow, I was not ſo high as my middle: but
there being nothing but ſand and gravel whereever I laid my hands, I came out
again preſently; looking afterward into the water, which was all muddy, I could
ſee my <hi>Nayad</hi> no more: whoſe loſs I ſo much regretted, that I laid me along on
the ground as if I had been ready to die. At length my grief being ſomewhat
abated, and my mind not being taken up with viewing the waters, I look'd ore
my ſelf. O Gods! ſhall I tell all! I perceiv'd that I had womans cloaths on, and
having put my hand on my head, found I had a dreſſing on like that of the <hi>Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads.</hi>
By that I diſcover'd the cheat of <hi>Zenocritus</hi>'s enchantments, and I had
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43725:114"/>
reaſon to doubt that the face I had ſo much admir'd was my own, which being
diſguis'd I had miſtaken. Thereupon I return'd to the river, leſs ſad then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and there perceiving the ſame figure, I ſpoke thus, There's none but will
confeſs that this face is handſome; and for my own part, I ſhould think my ſelf
happy, could I finde a Wench that had one ſo fair. I would to God it were ſo!
But why do I deſire it, is there any thing more pleaſant then to be Miſtreſs and
Servant together? I ſhall when I pleaſe, ſee the beauty which hath ſurpriſed me.
If I ſigh, it will ſigh too; if I laugh, it will laugh alſo; if I deſire any favour,
it will be as ſoon obtain'd as deſired; if I give my Nymph any thing, there will
be nothing at all loſt, for I ſhall give all to my ſelf; if I beſtow my endeavors
to preſerve her, I ſhall preſerve my ſelf with her. I ſhall not fear ſhe will betray
me, for ſhe will never be guilty of any thoughts which I ſhall not know, and
jealouſie, which poſſeſſes ſo many Lovers, will exerciſe no tyranny over me. I
ſee many others much troubled that they have Rivals; but for me to have any.
I ſhall account it a huge pleaſure: ſo nothing being able to bring me any diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in my love, I ſhall ever live fully ſatisfied. And if it be objected, that I
trangreſs the ordinary Laws of men, I will ſay, that the faireſt bird of natures
making, which is the Phoenix, is content to love himſelf, and ſeeks no further
object for his affection. After this diſcourſe, I paus'd a good while, and as I
was buſied in viewing my own fair countenance, <hi>Zenocritus</hi> comes and askes me,
Whether I had not ſufficiently ſeen my Miſtreſs? and if I would not return to his
houſe? I am fully ſatisfied as to her ſight, ſaid I to him; but I would alſo have
been glad to have heard her ſpeak, I have not yet been able to make her break
her ſilence. Ask her ſomewhat, ſaies he, no doubt but ſhe'll anſwer you. I
had the curioſity to try his skill; ſo turning towards the water, Fair Nymph,
ſaid I, may I be aſſur'd that you will have a memory for the moſt perfect Lover
that lives? Then I heard a feeble voice, which ſeem'd to come from a league
off me; which ſaid to me, Aſſure thy ſelf, that the ſame arrow as hath wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thy heart, hath wounded mine alſo. I was ſo aſtoniſh'd at this, that I became
as inſenſible as a ſtock. <hi>Zenocritus</hi> put the vail again over my head, and aſſuring
me that his charm was at an end, he led me back to his houſe, I not ſaying any
thing in the world to him. I could not come certainly to know, whether it were
a Nymph I had ſeen, or my own repreſentation only; the cloathes I had on
made me ſuſpect the cheat, but withal, the voyce I had heard made me believe
there might be ſomewhat more in it. Being in the dark chamber of <hi>Zenocritus,</hi>
he took off my maids cloathes, and put on mans; but though I perceiv'd all this,
yet had I not the courage to accuſe him of impoſture. My comfort was, that
however, he had given me ſome ſatisfaction, by teaching me the invention of
loving my ſelf; ſo that as I parted from his houſe, to return to my own, I gave
him a Diamond for his recompence. The very ſame day, <hi>I</hi> ſpoke of him to a
Gentleman, a friend of mine, who aſſur'd me he was the greateſt cheat in the
world; and among other ſubtil tricks, he had that of making a voyce proceed from
the bottom of his ſtomack, having his mouth ſhut, as if it had been another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
at ſome diſtance from him had ſpoken, and that by this means he had abus'd
many, anſwering them to what they deſir'd, as if he had been a ſpirit, or ſome
departed ſoul. <hi>I</hi> remembred, <hi>I</hi> had heard ſay, that in ancient time there were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſes,
that ſpoke through the belly, ſo that I eaſily believ'd <hi>Zenocritus,</hi> had
the ſame power. Yet thinking ever on the pleaſure he had done me, <hi>I</hi> would
not wiſh him any hurt; and forgetting the imaginary beauty of the <hi>Nayad,</hi> which
<hi>I</hi> had not clearly ſeen, <hi>I</hi> admir'd none but my own. <hi>I</hi> had at this time neither
father nor mother, but liv'd at my own liberty. <hi>I</hi> caus'd womens cloathes to be
made me, which <hi>I</hi> ordinarily wore, and being lockt up into my chamber, where
there was a looking-glaſs four foot high, and three broad, <hi>I</hi> view'd my ſelf from
head to foot: <hi>I</hi> was quite raviſh'd in that contemplation, though all my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
conſiſted in the ſuperficies of a glaſs; and <hi>I</hi> wiſh'd my eyes had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
into ſome other part then my face, that <hi>I</hi> might have view'd that in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43725:115"/>
Yet my faithful ice repreſenting it to the life to me, <hi>I</hi> caus'd the Idea of
thoſe beauties to paſs into my heart where it was preſerv'd. And thus was <hi>I</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd
by an extraordinary love; and if you have obſerv'd the adventure that
gave it its beginning, you will conclude, that he that firſt preſum'd to ſay there
were <hi>Nayads,</hi> had ſeen ſome that were ſuppris'd as <hi>I</hi> was.</p>
                     </div>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
            </q>
            <p>That may very well be, ſaies <hi>Philiris,</hi> ſome Poet had had a glimpſe of a maid
in a River, or elſe ſome Ideot ſeeing himſelf in the water, had believed his own
image was another Nymph. As for your part, <hi>I</hi> believe your deſign was to renew
the fable of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> but yet you have done nothing ſo ſimply as he: if you knew
not your ſelf, when you firſt beheld your ſelf; and if you took the figure you ſaw
for a Nymph, 'twas becauſe you had chang'd your cloathes; but <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> who
had no other then his ordinary cloathes, took his own repreſentation for ſome fair
Goddeſs. If that were true, <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſay that the yong man were turned fool; but
that being falſe, <hi>I</hi> muſt ſay that the Poet who invented it had no judgement: For
put the caſe that Looking-glaſſes were not in uſe in the Country of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> and
that in his mothers houſe there were not neither skillets nor baſins, in the bottoms
whereof he might have ſeen him ſelf; could he that was a Huntſ-man, and had much
acquaintance with the fields, be without ever beholding himſelf in a Fountain? Had
he lived to the age of ſixteen, and never met any? And if he had met with any (as
it muſt be neceſſarily conceived) why ſhould he behold his own face as a new thing,
and imagine there were a Nymph under the water? why had he not rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
this ſimplicity at eight years of age? then it might have been excuſed. By
this it is eaſie to ſee, that for to make the adventure probable, it ſhould have been
accommodated like that of the Shepherd <hi>Fontenay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> do not grant you that, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> for in the firſt place, <hi>I</hi> will not have any
thing reformed as to what hath been anciently believed concerning <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it may have hapned, that he loved himſelf after one manner, and <hi>Fontenay</hi>
after another. The lives of all men are different, and conſequently their Hiſtories
are ſo much the more delightful. As concerning the <hi>Nayads,</hi> though <hi>Zenocritus</hi>
have deceived this gentle Shepherd, and hath made him ſee his own image in the
water inſtead of a Nymph, it does not thence follow that there are none. The fair
one he had ſeen the night before was one indeed, and <hi>I</hi> make no queſtion but he
knew her well enough ſince: Wherefore let him continue his Hiſtory, and we ſhall
ſee what were the end of his loves.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> have acquainted you erewhiles, replies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> that it was in my infancy,
that <hi>I</hi> believed there were <hi>Nayads;</hi> however for the future <hi>I</hi> ſhall be of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
were it but for complyance-ſake with you: And to go on with my ſtory, <hi>I</hi>
am to tell you, that having accuſtomed my ſelf ſo long to dreſs my ſelf like a
maid, <hi>I</hi> never wore mans cloathes, but when <hi>I</hi> was forced to appear publikely; and
then alſo were they heavy on my back. As <hi>I</hi> was one time at my window, there
paſt by a Nobleman of the Country, called <hi>Alcidamas,</hi> who having perceived me,
thought me the greateſt Beauty he had ever ſeen; ſo that he fell furiouſly in love
with me, and came to my houſe with ſome fifty Bilbo-blades, for to carry me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
My people, who were accuſtomed to ſee me diſguiſed, told him he was
much deceived if he thought to finde a maid there, and that there was not one in
all the houſe. He notwithſtanding came up into my Chamber, where <hi>I</hi> was then
ſo buſie at my glaſs, that he had embraced me before <hi>I</hi> perceived him. You
have ſufficently conſulted your glaſs, my fair one, ſaid he, you have already ſo
many temptations, that you cannot adde any. Trouble not your ſelf to provide
arms to make new wounds, but heal thoſe you have already given.</p>
               <p>Upon this, four of his Lacquays took me away in ſpight of my teeth, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me along with him into a coach. All the way I did nothing but weep; and
I remembred I complain'd in theſe terms: Muſt I be taken away, and the deareſt
friend I have, not brought with me? O faithfull witneſs of my Loves! muſt I

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43725:115"/>
be ever abſent from you? muſt I bid an eternal adieu to that fair Miſtreſs which
you made me always contemplate? 'Twas in you that I ſaw her, 'twas in you
that I alſo ſaw my ſelf. Methought I was wholly chang'd into you, and I alſo
thought that I comprehended you wholly in my ſelf; ſo were my thoughts fill'd
with you as their full object. I often repeated theſe words, ſpeaking of my glaſs:
but <hi>Alcidamas,</hi> to whom <hi>I</hi> did not explain them, could take them for nothing
but riddles. He ask'd me ſometimes what cauſe <hi>I</hi> had to complain, ſince <hi>I</hi> might
aſſure my ſelf <hi>I</hi> ſhould receive no hurt with him: yet <hi>I</hi> gave him no reaſon, but
cry'd out thus; Alas! <hi>I</hi> have loſt my Miſtreſs and my Servant together: My
face was ſeen in that of my Servant's, and in mine was alſo ſeen that of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs;
but one moment hath ruined our reciprocal loves. <hi>Alcidamas</hi> hearing
this, thought that the indignation <hi>I</hi> took to be ſo raviſh'd away had made me
talk idly: And when he was come into his caſtle, he brought me to a Gentleman
whom he call'd his Brother, and prayd him to endeavour to bring me to my ſelf
again. <hi>I</hi> had ſo little conſideration, that heing removed from my glaſs, <hi>I</hi> believ'd
<hi>I</hi> was removed from my ſelf, though <hi>I</hi> carried myſelf well enough in all the places
where <hi>I</hi> went: But having caſt my eyes on <hi>Iphis</hi> his glaſs, <hi>Alcidamas</hi>'s brother,
<hi>I</hi> perceiv'd that indeed my face, which by reflection was an object to it ſelf, was
not abſent from that beauty which it ador'd. <hi>I</hi> was upon this ſo comforted, that
<hi>I</hi> ſmil'd, and with my eyes careſs'd my ordinary Miſtreſs, not thinking of <hi>Iphis</hi>
who very ſeriouſly ey'd me. This young Lad ſeemed to be as jovial and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
as his Brother; and it quite amaz'd me to ſee him caſt himſelf ſo amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
about my neck, ſaying to me, You diſeſteem me too much, Fair one! to
prefer that Glaſs before me: Am not I as worthy your looks as it? If you
would ſee your ſelf, you may do it in my eyes. Though <hi>Iphis</hi> were very fair,
yet he ſeem'd not to me to come neer my Nymph, ſo that I ſtill thruſt him from
me, that he might not hinder me to look into his glaſs. When it was night, I
would needs behold myſelf in it by candlelight: but he caus'd me to go to bed, and
when I thought him gone out of the chamber, he came and lay down by me, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to me as if he had known my thoughts, My fair one! though it were true
that you loved none but your ſelf, yet can you not hate me, becauſe it is you
that I love. I thought <hi>Iphis</hi> had reaſon; and having felt his breaſt, I found he
was a maid. Then without being mov'd at all, I received his kiſſes, as coming
from my Miſtreſſes friend. I did not think there was any hurt in that, as if I had
received the ſame careſſes from his brother, becauſe I thought my ſelf a maid as
well as he, and yet <hi>I</hi> made it ſoon appear to her that <hi>I</hi> was a man, or at leaſt an
Hermaphrodite. <hi>I</hi> ſhall not tell you whether ſhe was aſham'd of it or no, for
the darkneſs hindered me to ſee if ſhe bluſh'd, but <hi>I</hi> dare tell you ſhe betrayed a
certain amazement by a mild complaint; yet ſhe turn'd all into gladneſs, and
had the confidence to tell me, that indeed ſuch a Lad as ſhe was required ſuch a
Maid as <hi>I</hi> was: She alſo confeſs'd to me, that though her Brother were a very
powerfull man, yet was there a certain Prince who had deſign'd the ſame violence
to her that <hi>Alcidamas</hi> exerciſed towards others; ſo that for fear to be ſtollen
away ſome time or other, either when ſhe were alone in the caſtle, or walking in
the fields, ſhe had thought it her beſt courſe to diſguiſe herſelf like a man. This
diſcourſe ended, ſhe conjur'd me to tell her the reaſon why I was clad like a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
but I made her believe that I would not reveal that ſecret. In the morning
we put on our falſe habits; and having beheld my ſelf a while in the glaſs, I was
in ſuch a good humour, that <hi>I</hi> went and walk'd into the Garden with <hi>Iphis:
I</hi> found a little door which opened into a field where a many cattel were feeding;
among the reſt <hi>I</hi> ſpy'd a Mare, on which as it had been in jeſt <hi>I</hi> got up; but hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the mane in ſtead of a bridle, and cloſing to her ſides, <hi>I</hi> made her make
ſuch ſpeed away, that <hi>Iphis</hi> ſoon loſt ſight of me. She went to the people at
home, to ſend them to overtake me; but they were not quick enough for me.
<hi>I</hi> know not whether ſhe were much troubled at the loſs of me, or if her Brother
his return were the more: But this <hi>I</hi> know, that <hi>I</hi> was never importun'd any
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43725:116"/>
further by them at my houſe, whither having retired as into a ſanctuary, <hi>I</hi> forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
my ſelf better then <hi>I</hi> was before. The affections <hi>I</hi> had for my ſelf <hi>I</hi> increaſed,
and <hi>I</hi> practis'd all the inventions in the world to raiſe the greateſt pleaſure out of
my ſolitude. <hi>I</hi> had ſome ſeven or eight Gowns of ſeveral faſhions, which for
my pleaſure <hi>I</hi> ever chang'd; ſince <hi>I</hi> had ſuffered my hair to grow very long,
I paſs'd away whole dayes in curling and frizling it, as having no need of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruques.
Sometimes being laid down on a green couch before my glaſs, I playd
on the Lute, and ſung certain airs which I had compoſed in my own praiſe; and
<hi>I</hi> was ſo paſſionate, that <hi>I</hi> imagined that the harmony proceeded from the fair
Chantreſs <hi>I</hi> had ſeen, and not from me. <hi>I</hi> put on no other cloaths but womans;
and my ſervants who would not contradict my delightfull humours, call'd me
rather Madam then my Lord. The neighbours who heard no more talk of <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenay,</hi>
thought him dead, or gone to travel; and as for the fair Lady which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in his houſe, ſhe was thought to be his Siſter. When I look'd out at the
window, there would ever be ſome Gentleman paſſing by, whoſe buſineſs was to
ſee me, ſo great was the fame of my beauty; nay there were ſome who would
needs demand me in marriage. Now once above all there came to my houſe a
young Lady, who told my people that ſhe muſt needs ſee me. <hi>I</hi> did not at that
time appear much at the window; ſo that ſhe could not ſee me but in my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
a thing <hi>I</hi> ſhould hardly permit; for <hi>I</hi> was afraid it might be ſome man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed
who came to raviſh me; or elſe ſome woman, who knowing <hi>I</hi> were a man
came to enſnare me into Love. She was a good while at the door deſiring me to
open; but <hi>I</hi> would not do it before ſhe had declared to me her deſign. Know
then, fair and ſolitary Nymph! ſays ſhe to me, that <hi>I</hi> am called <hi>Theodora;</hi> and
that all the world having acknowledged that my beauty was incomparable, <hi>I</hi> have
been ſo vain as to have believ'd it till now: Yet the common report having
taught me that thou hadſt an admirable beauty, <hi>I</hi> ſhall never be at reſt till <hi>I</hi> have
ſeen whether thou art fairer then a many other whom <hi>I</hi> have excelled. <hi>I</hi> who
conceived my face the handſomeſt in the world, and believ'd it concerned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of my Miſtreſs not to ſuffer the preſumption of <hi>Theodora</hi> who thought
herſelf incomparable, <hi>I</hi> promiſed her entrance on condition ſhe ſwore not to ſtay
with me above a quarter of an houre. When ſhe had taken her oath, <hi>I</hi> opened
the door: But O ye Gods! what miracles did <hi>I</hi> find in her? ſhe had ſo many
attractions, that <hi>I</hi> was even dazled with them, and began to tremble out of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
acknowledging <hi>I</hi> had nothing worth the comparing with her. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
finding in my heart a little obſtinacie, <hi>I</hi> thought it was becauſe <hi>I</hi> remembred
not my own beauty; and ſo preſently <hi>I</hi> addreſs'd my ſelf to my glaſs: But alas!
what inequality did <hi>I</hi> find? For beſides that <hi>Theodora's</hi> face was fairer then mine,
her breaſt was uncovered, where the two Bowls, whiter then Alabaſter, were
without any thing elſe able to make me periſh, conſidering <hi>I</hi> was not furniſhed
with any ſuch beauty. That gave me ſuch an aſſault, that <hi>I</hi> kneel'd down before
<hi>Theodora,</hi> and ſaid to her, Fair Goddeſs! aſſure your ſelf that this day you have
overcome the proudeſt creature in the world. She preſently lifted me up; and
believing ſhe were indeed ſomwhat above, ſhe began very inſolently to relate
how many other triumphs ſhe had already made. Then ſhe made me look on an
ancient woman ſhe had brought with her, who was to teſtifie to all the world
that <hi>I</hi> was not ſo fair as her Miſtreſs. After this ſhe left me, though <hi>I</hi> entreated
her to ſtay with me that day; for ſhe ſaid ſhe would not break her oath. So was
I ſoon deprived of her amiable ſight through my own fault: but her Idaea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
ſo engraven in my mind, that I would never any more behold my own
face in the glaſs. I forgot my ſelf for her ſake; and being weary to be the Lover
and the thing loved both together, I reſolved to be paſſionate for ſomething
that were more ſenſible then a ſhadow. Thereupon curſing the Glaſs which had
enchanted me ſo long, I took a ſtick and brake it into more peeces then times
I had look'd in it; I burn'd all my womans cloaths, repreſenting to my ſelf, that
to be loved by <hi>Theodora, I</hi> muſt appear as a man. And to ſay true, this change of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43725:116"/>
humour fell out very ſeaſonably; for I could not long diſſemble my ſexe, ſince
my cheeks began to be hairy, and that it was no ſmall trouble every morning to
get it off. It was ſo long ſince I had gone like a man, that I had much ado to
bring my ſelf to it again: yet I quitted my ſolitude, and ſhewed my ſelf to all the
world; ſo that then all the talk was of <hi>Fontenay,</hi> and that it was not known what
was become of his Siſter. My firſt viſits were to <hi>Theodora,</hi> with whom my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was <hi>Love:</hi> but I found her ſo cruel, that I imagin'd ſhe were not to be
wrought to compliance by any natural remedies. I went therefore to <hi>Zenocritus,</hi>
whoſe reputation was much encreas'd; and having diſcovered my paſſion to him,
he promis'd me more effectual aſſiſtance then when I loved the <hi>Nayad,</hi> by how
much it was eaſier to gain a humane creature then a divine. His cajolling and
fair tales enchanted me more then his charms; and ſuch a confidence did I place
in him, that I never dreamt any thing which I did not relate to him, for to have
the interpretation of it: I ſaw no birds in the air, but I gave him the number of
them; and made him a regiſter of all my thoughts and actions, that he might
thence make his preſages. If <hi>I</hi> were to return to <hi>Theodora's,</hi> he lookd ore certain
books, and caſt certain lots to ſee if the day were fortunate for me. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all this, there was no great appearance that my affairs were any thing
advanced, and <hi>I</hi> fed my ſelf with nothing but hope. So that calling to mind that
<hi>I</hi> had a Couſin in theſe quarters who was thought a very able man in Magick, <hi>I</hi>
reſolved to come and ſee him, and renew that kinred and acquaintance with him
which my father had neglected. <hi>I</hi> viſited <hi>Hircan,</hi> to whom <hi>I</hi> have related all
my fortunes. He adviſed me henceforward to beware the impoſtures of <hi>Zenocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi>
and he, who is acquainted with the true and ſound doctrine, gave me an
herb that made <hi>Theodora</hi> love me, if whenever <hi>I</hi> was to ſpeak to her <hi>I</hi> put it into
my mouth. To be withall reveng'd of my falſe Magician, and pay him in his own
coin, by the advice of my dear Kinſman <hi>I</hi> preſented him with a pleaſant little
Book which treated of the means to find <hi>Treaſures.</hi> He was content with that
recompence; and leſt <hi>I</hi> might pretend to part of his riches, he is gone out of
this Province to practiſe his vain ſecrets, which he conceived were above my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
<hi>I</hi> have ſince married <hi>Theodora,</hi> to the ſatisfaction of all that knew
us, who rejoyc'd to ſee the Fair married to the Fair; and we have hitherto liv'd a
very comfortable life together: And that <hi>I</hi> have now left this dear Spouſe, it hath
been for ſome buſineſs of very great conſequence which <hi>I</hi> have with my learned
Couſin. As to what concerns <hi>Charite,</hi> of whom <hi>I</hi> boaſted <hi>I</hi> was belov'd in the
preſence of her faithfull Lover, he hath no reaſon to be any way jealous; for
what <hi>I</hi> ſpoke then, was out of error and vanity: <hi>I</hi> believe <hi>Lyſis</hi> perceiv'd it ſo,
and took it no otherwiſe; and now that we were made friends yeſterday, he will
not bear me any ill will henceforward.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Here <hi>Fontenay</hi> made an end of his ſtory, which he had related with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
many times recalling what he had ſaid, as if he had taken a great deal of pains
to lye. <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who laught ever and anon, There's an end it ſeems of your Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend,
ſays he to him, in good time: <hi>I</hi> never heard any thing more impertinent;
and you have only made it appear to us, that you were ſometimes this greateſt Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondriack,
and the moſt melancholick Fool that ever trod the earth.</p>
            <p>Abuſive <hi>Clarimond,</hi> replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> wilt thou never give over affronting honeſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
Art thou not to blame to cenſure this Shepherd for loving himſelf, ſince it is
well known, that in his youth he was of an excellent beauty: and that <hi>I</hi> my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
clad like a maid at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, was enamour'd of my ſelf I could not but ſhed
tears at the relation of his adventure, ſo was I mov'd with it. There is but one
thing troubles me: whereas he lay with <hi>Iphis</hi> who was diſguis'd like a man, <hi>I</hi> ſhould
have wiſhed with all my heart, that to make his hiſtory the more perfect, his
<hi>Theodora</hi> had been ſo diſguis'd, and that their friends ſeeing them equal in Beauty
and Riches had deſired to match them together. <hi>Fontenay</hi> taking <hi>Theodora</hi> for a
man, would have abhorr'd ſuch a marriage, and <hi>Theodora</hi> taking <hi>Fontenay</hi> for a maid,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43725:117"/>
would not have been joyned to her, fearing ſhe might never receive any ſatisfaction
thereby. Their plaints would have been reciprocal, and yet being diſpos'd into the
nuptial bed they would have found that they had wherewith to pleaſe one another,
and there was no more to be done the next morning to put all things in order, then
for them to exchange cloathes. <hi>Theodora</hi> taking thoſe of <hi>Fontenay;</hi> and <hi>Fontenay</hi>
thoſe of <hi>Theodora.</hi> That had gone beyond the Metamorphoſis of <hi>Iphis,</hi> the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of <hi>Jantha.</hi> This conſideration is excellent, ſaies <hi>Fontenay;</hi> but lets not think
any more on it, ſince what is done cannot be undone. As to the inſolence of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond,</hi>
let us bear with it, as proceeding from a ſpirit of contradiction, which can
hear nothing and be pleas'd with it. <hi>I</hi> ſhould be very glad if <hi>Philiris</hi> would alſo
take the pains to give us his hiſtory, to ſee if haply there will not be ſo much to
carp at. Let him then vouchſafe us that diverſion, ſaies <hi>Lyſis; I</hi> conjure him to
do it by the eyes of his Miſtreſs. <hi>I</hi> am very tender, as to the refuſing of any thing
whereto <hi>I</hi> am preſs'd with ſo much civility, replies <hi>Philiris;</hi> prepare therefore your
ears, and you ſhall hear what yeſterday it was my deſire to acquaint you with. While
<hi>Philiris</hi> ſaid this, <hi>Lyſis</hi> riſes out of his place, and ſeated himſelf on the other ſide. What
would you do, ſaies <hi>Fontenay</hi> to him, do you finde the ground too hard in your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
place? or do you think it any ſofter here? There is in this a ſecret, and that
no ſmall one, replies the <hi>Shepherd, I</hi> ſhould much wonder if you could but conceive
what it might be before <hi>I</hi> ſhould tell you: my thoughts are not ſo common, yet <hi>I</hi>
will diſcover it, to let you know that ſuch a <hi>Lover</hi> as <hi>I</hi> cannot conceive any thing,
but what is rare and excellent. You are then to know, that in the place where <hi>I</hi>
ſate before, my back was towards <hi>Orontes</hi> his Caſtle, where is the reſidence of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite;</hi>
and that was a thing quite contrary to the rules of all civility: And that is the
reaſon why <hi>I</hi> have planted my ſelf here, where I think my ſelf ſo well ſcituated, that
<hi>I</hi> ſixtly behold the aboad of my felicity, Had <hi>I</hi> all the mathematical inſtruments
in the world, <hi>I</hi> could not place my ſelf better. And that <hi>I</hi> perceive already; for <hi>I</hi>
finde the air more delicate here then there; and methinks the <hi>Zephir</hi> brings with
it ſometimes a perfum'd ſent, which it took up from the breath of my Miſtreſs. <hi>I</hi>
will henceforth turn towards her with as much pertinacy as the Load-ſtone does
to the North: Whether <hi>I</hi> be a bed, or at table, or be in a ſhip, or in a Coach, <hi>I</hi>
will ever obſerve that. The deſign is noble, ſaies <hi>Philiris;</hi> but there is one thing <hi>I</hi>
ſtumble at, and that is when you are far from your <hi>Charite,</hi> ſhe may go from one
place to another, and turn her back towards you; ſo that you will be deceiv'd, and
you will look towards a place where ſhe is not, and you never know it. However,
<hi>I</hi> believe your good intention will be much conſidered. There's more then ſo in
it, ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> do you not ſee that <hi>I</hi> cannot poſſibly be miſtaken, ſince <hi>I</hi> ſhall know
by the wind in what quarter my Miſtreſs is. That indeed is a reaſon that ſalves all,
replies <hi>Philiris;</hi> its time to diſmiſs this diſcourſe, if you deſire the relation of my
amorous adventures. Let the brave Shepherd begin when he will, ſaies <hi>Lyſis, I</hi>
ſhall not be he will interrupt him. Thereupon <hi>Philiris</hi> related his ſtory in this
manner.</p>

                        <head>The HISTORY of PHILIRIS.</head>
                        <p>A Little Village in Burgundy was the place of my birth (ſaies this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd)
there my Father and Mother live yet, being perſons more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for their vertues then their wealth: Yet did they beſtow the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of what little means they had, to bring me up with children of greater
houſes, and it was not their fault, if the good endowments I had acquir'd, did
not commend me to the attendance of great ones: But while I was at <hi>Paris,</hi> though
I wanted buſineſs to look about, yet did I make it my greateſt employment to go
wooing up and down. I was the moſt unconſtant thing that ever was known; for
when ever I went to give one Laſs a viſit, whom I had choſen for my Miſtreſs,
I ſtill went through ſome ſtreet, where I ſhould ſee another by the way, leſt I
might have loſt my labour. If I had made verſes for the firſt, I endeavored to
ſtart out the ſame occaſion for to preſent them to the ſecond; and as I once had
made a ſong in commendation of a brown Laſs, if I had chanc'd afterward to be
acquainted with any more of the ſame complexion, I preſented them with it as
if it had been particularly made for any of them: So that there were a many
finely mump'd, when being in a mask, they confidently gave one another that
ſong. I loved the white and the brown, the fat and the ſlender, the great and
the little; and when I ſaw one <hi>I</hi> never thought of any of the reſt, and for that
time I thought that ſhe were the moſt deſirable: But when I was far from them
all, my affection I left as a booty among them, and ſhe that came firſt into my
thoughts, had the beſt ſhare of the pillage. The dreſſings and faſhions of cloathes
made me ſet a higher eſteem on the beauties; and if I had loved a little wench,
while ſhe wore a coif, I was ſometimes more taken with her when ſhe was in her
hood. There were ſome Ladies could raiſe no paſſions in me but when they were
mask'd; and others, for whom I never ſighed, but when I had a full view of
them: of ſome, I affected nothing but the breaſt; of others, only their eyes;
of ſome their ſtature and their necks; ſo that to ſatisfie me fully, I muſt have
had all thoſe parts taken and compos'd into a Beauty, <hi>à la mode.</hi> The faſhion
and the colour of the cloathes of my Miſtreſſes had a certain grace and inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which another, then my ſelf was not capable to diſcover. The light flaxen
hair with a black velvet dreſs, and carnation fancies on the confines of an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
white complexion, had ſuch a luſtre, that I am ſtill ſo charm'd with the very
remembrance of it, that I can only tell you that I cannot deſcribe it; yet was I
in love with all theſe, as if they had been eſſential dependances of the body.
When your little girls quitted their cawls and colour'd gowns, for dreſſings and
black gowns, my imagination ran on thoſe flowers which grow up by little and
little, and when of tender buds they come to be full-blown in their pride, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
change their former colours. But all theſe ſeveral imaginations not onely
decreas'd, but vaniſhed when I returned into my Country, where I found a beauty
ſo rare, that it ſoon made me change all my inconſtancy into fidelity. Yet had <hi>I</hi>
never any thoughts for the raiſing of my fortune; for I was more taken with a
<hi>Shepherds innocency,</hi> then any <hi>Court ambitition;</hi> and I thought my ſelf happy to
live in ſuch a Country as my own, where <hi>Juſtice,</hi> when ſhe left the earth, had
left her laſt footſteps: ſo that the profeſſors of vertue come thither daily to find
out her treadings, that they might follow her. This happened, while I walk'd in a
Town that was near our Village, where I eſpied at the door a yong <hi>Shepherdeſs,</hi>
whoſe attractions were ſuch as raviſh'd away my heart, and robb'd me of my
Liberty. My greateſt misfortune was, that I knew not a thing which was ſo well
known to me; that is to ſay, I kenw not who that fair one was, though I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſaw her both preſent and abſent; but at length, after much enquiry, a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43725:118"/>
Shepherd, a friend of mine, called <hi>Valerius;</hi> acquainted me who her friends were;
and that as for her, ſhe was called <hi>Baſilia,</hi> a name that ſhall eternally remain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
in my minde. O Heaven! how joyfull am I to know it, and to be ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
as to name the cauſe of my love, that I may accuſe it before the throne of God,
for all the miſchief it hath done me. What explications did I not invent for this
name? and what Anagrams did I not endeavor to finde out on it? is there any
Criticiſm in language which I have not appropriated to it? When I try'd a pen,
<hi>I</hi> thought <hi>I</hi> committed a crime, if <hi>I</hi> writ any thing but the word <hi>Baſilia:</hi> ſo that
all my papers are fill'd with it. And if ſometimes <hi>I</hi> writ and heeded not my hand,
it would never make any other Letters then thoſe that make up that ſweet name,
ſo was I accuſtom'd to it. It is not to be asked, if <hi>I</hi> put it into all the verſes <hi>I</hi>
made, and that <hi>I</hi> thought it added harmony to their cadences; though <hi>I</hi> may
ſafely ſay, that they were otherwiſe charming enough, to move any barbarous
heart; and that Love had taught me more in fifteen days, then the moſt learned
Profeſſors in the world had done in eight or nine years. <hi>Valerius</hi> alſo thought
my verſes ſo good, that he learn'd them by heart: and yet he endeavored to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
me from my love by this diſcourſe; Can it be poſſible, that you who are
rank'd among the greateſt wits in <hi>France</hi> (ſaies he to me) ſhould ſtoop before a
little Shepherdeſs, that hath yet ſcarce forgotten her Play-games? when you
have preſented her with your verſes, do you think ſhe can diſtinguiſh them from
the Ballad-Ribaldry, which your Ploughmen ſing when they go to work? ſhe'll
ſhew them to all her companions, and will tell them without any diſcretion, it
was you made them. <hi>I</hi> pray God ſhe may not give them the firſt that deſires
them, as if it were a thing as well made for others as her. Ah! <hi>Valerius,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I, how malicious are you, to ſpeak in this manner? Do you not conſider, that
<hi>Baſilia</hi> will ſhortly be of age, and arrive to prudence and judgement? and have
you not told me divers times, that ſhe had already no ordinary underſtanding?
Now know, that though her words and actions had nothing in them but infancy,
<hi>I</hi> ſhould not give over to ſerve her. You cannot believe what pleaſure <hi>I</hi> ſhall think
it to talk with her of love innocently, and to have the honor to be the firſt ſhall
teach her what it is to have fires in the ſoul, and wounds in the heart. <hi>Valerius</hi>
confeſt then, that he had commended <hi>Baſilia</hi> to me, and that ſhe deſerved it;
but that he wiſhed ſhe were not ſo exquiſite, that <hi>I</hi> might not ſeem enchanted
with a Love, which in his opinion promiſed me nothing but affliction. <hi>I</hi> prayed
the Gods they would make him a falſe Prophet, and diſcours'd on with him on
the ſame ſubject, not indeed being able to take any other. He told me, that five
or ſix days before <hi>I</hi> had ſeen <hi>Baſilia</hi> firſt, ſhe was in mourning for her mother,
and that ſhe was very handſome in a black gown. <hi>I</hi> cannot tell you the grief that
<hi>I</hi> have ever ſince felt, that <hi>I</hi> ſaw her not in that mourning. O ye mighty Gods!
why have you not ſuffer'd me to know her ſooner? Had <hi>I</hi> ſeen her in her
infancy, <hi>I</hi> ſhould have lov'd her ſo well as <hi>I</hi> do now, and by that means having
the opportunity to ſerve her more then <hi>I</hi> have, ſhe would have been the more
oblig'd to me. What a diverſity of thoughts came into my minde, whenever I
ſaw a picture of hers, that was drawn when ſhe was about ſix or ſeven years old.
O heaven! ſaid <hi>I,</hi> one time, why did I not know this pretty Minikin, when <hi>I</hi>
my ſelf was but eleven or twelve? even then ſhould <hi>I</hi> have ſighed for her, and have
left the company of all other children for hers. How glad ſhould <hi>I</hi> have been to
play with her! <hi>I</hi> would have help'd her to dreſs her babies; and would have ſold my
books, but <hi>I</hi> would have every day brought her ſome plums or ſweet-meats. <hi>I</hi> have
had a world of other infantine and ſimple thoughts; which witneſs my paſſion
and becauſe there was at my fathers houſe my own picture, taken when <hi>I</hi> was little,
<hi>I</hi> have often wiſh'd to ſee them hang'd cloſe to one another, as if they were marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together. Methinks two ſuch Children had made a fine couple; but <hi>I</hi> muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
to you, that I wiſh rather the originals were joyn'd then the pictures, if all may
not be done together. But now <hi>I</hi> think on't, <hi>I</hi> vow to you, 'twere one of my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
pleaſures to have <hi>Baſilia</hi> pictur'd in all ages; for her beauty at ſix years old; is
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43725:118"/>
not the ſame at twelve; and that at twelve, not the fame at ſixteen. When
ſhe was little, her hair was flaxen, now 'tis brown: yet hath ſhe always been
look'd on as the wonder of the age; and though her perfections have been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
different, yet her attractions and allurements have been ever the ſame I
very well remember the firſt time I ſaw her, her breaſts appear'd not in their full
beauty, and that thoſe vermilion buds which grow there, have been ſince rais'd
to their pomp, as being to be rais'd on two mountains, which they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
But however it be, I cannot but ſtill be of opinion, that ſhe could not
appear fairer then on that fortunate day ſhe made me her captive. Yet can
I not be rid of a fanſtatical curioſity, to have her painted in all the dreſſes
and faſhions that ever ſhe wore, and I think it would much pleaſe me, had
I but her countenance drawn when ſhe minded to be ſerious, or elſe when ſhe
laught, the time I firſt knew her. But though I might obtain all this, I
doubt not but I ſhould finde the occaſions of other wiſhes, ſo hard is it to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the humors of an amorous perſon. But for want of all this, I was content
and glad to have a picture of <hi>Baſilia,</hi> ſuch as could be had; and out of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on my own imagination I went to a Painter that knew her not, I bid him
draw me the picture of a maid, that had the face ſomewhat long, her eyes and
hair brown, her cheeks not over-colour'd; ſo I gave him inſtructions for all the
parts, and yet he made above twenty draughts, and hit not right in any one. The
next day therefore I went into a place whence I might ſee <hi>Baſilia</hi> at eaſe; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had well conſidered all the Lineaments of her face, I took a large note there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for to give it the Painter, who yet ſatisfied me not, though he went accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my directions. At length he began to be angry, and told me, he knew
not why I ſhould put him to ſo much trouble; and it were better I would carry
him into ſome place whence he might ſee my Miſtreſs, and that it was in vain for
me to keep him from knowing her, ſince that if he once drew her well, he might
eaſily call to minde the face ſhould be like that which he had taken. Beſides, he
repreſented to me, how that I ought not doubt of his fidelity; and if I freely nam'd
her to him, he would keep it more ſecret then if I conceal'd it, and he come to
know it afterwards; becauſe thoſe that are too diſtruſtful, ſeem to grant others
liberty to deceive them. Theſe reaſons I thought very pertinent, and baniſhing
all fear, I ingenuouſly told my Painter, that I could not bring him to my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
houſe, becauſe to ſpeak truth, I had no entrance thither my ſelf; but
that there was one expedient, which was to go to the Church, where ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſtaid very long: So I brought him preſently thither, to ſhew him her place.
He ſaw <hi>Baſilia</hi> that very day, and brought me a rough draught of her, which
indeed had ſomewhat of her air. I met him the next day, coming from Church
running, but he made a ſign to me with his hand, that I ſhould not advance, not
ſo much as looking on me, becauſe he had juſt then ſeen my Miſtreſs, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to loſe her perfect Idea, before he had taken a draught of it. I had lent
him ſome Love ſtories, to put him into a good humour, and to make him go
through his work more chearfully. I alſo went often to diſcourſe with him, but
I put him to a deal of trouble; for I never thought the picture fair enough.
At laſt he came ſo near it, that I was forc'd to cry out, There's <hi>Baſilia,</hi> ſhould
I deny it! methinks this picture ſhould ſpeak to convince me! After that time,
I comforted my ſelf with that picture; and when I was weary of viewing it, I
muſt needs go to ſee <hi>Baſilia</hi> in the Church. When I went in, I directed my ſight
to that part where ſhe was; and when I came out, I could not refrain turning my
head for to ſee her. <hi>Baſilia</hi> fear'd not the aſſault of an amorous look, as do ſome
maids, who caſt down their eyes when they perceive they are look'd on. She di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
her ſight the more fix'dly towards me; and moſt commonly, being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd,
I ſeem'd to be the more baſhful, and drew aſide my eyes from her, till
ſhe look'd off me: Ah fair eyes! what know I whether you did this through
confidence or innocency? but what I pray could my ſoul think to find you ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
to commit murthers in ſuch tender age? yet was there a neceſſity to take
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43725:119"/>
all patiently; and it was a far greater cruelty, when <hi>Baſilia</hi> turn'd her back to me,
or kneel'd down to read. I often ſaid to her within my ſelf, that her prayers
were too long, that ſhe ſhould allow ſome of her time to hear thoſe I made to
her; and that the Gods would not hear her if ſhe did not hear others. My go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo often to the ſame Church, and placing my ſelf ever in the ſame part, caus'd
my friends when they wanted me, to come and look for me there. Thoſe that
paſs'd by, whether of my acquaintance or theirs, made a ſtay there; ſo that there
was no want of good diſcourſe, becauſe they were all very knowing perſons.
<hi>Baſilia</hi> was the cauſe of all our pleaſant conferences; and yet there was none but
my ſelf that knew it. At length heaven willing to be more favorable to me, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
it ſo, that <hi>Valerius</hi> made acquaintance with <hi>Baſilia</hi> at a Couſins of hers,
whither ſhe was wont to go, called <hi>Amelita.</hi> I prayed him to queſtion <hi>Amelita</hi>
about many things: and ſee now the fancies of Lovers, I was ſo afraid he might
forget ſomewhat, that I gave him a note of all he was to do and to ſay. I wiſh'd
him among other things, to enquire whether <hi>Baſilia</hi> ever took notice of me; and
whether ſhe had found any verſes, which I had a while before caſt on her win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
I had a very good account of that, and of divers other particulars: ſo
that I was more and more inflam'd in my purſuit; and I conjur'd <hi>Valerius</hi> to
acquaint me what day <hi>Baſilia</hi> went to ſee her Couſin, that ſo we might go
thither together, and that I might there ſpeak to her. At leaſt, ſaid I, if I
may not be ſuffered to ſpeak to her, let me have the liberty to ſalute her, as
often as I ſhall meet her: For it is inſupportable to me, to ſee my ſelf oblig'd
to paſs before her I moſt honor in the world, and not give her any teſtimony
of my ſubmiſſions, which I muſt only do her in my thoughts.</p>
                        <p>Let all thoſe Lovers that cannot have acceſs to thoſe they love, conſider this,
and they will confeſs themſelves to be in the ſame affliction as my ſelf, and
that whoever knew the divers imaginations I had in my Love, will know all that
that Paſſion makes us do. 'Twere ſufficient matter of aſtoniſhment, to know
the ſtrange Commiſſions <hi>Valerius</hi> had from me, and in what manner I gave
them him.</p>
                        <p>And ſeeing <hi>Amelita, Baſilia's</hi> Couſin was ſomewhat a light Houſewife, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
found at home, I bid him endeavor to meet with her in the fields or in
the Town; but he could not do it in fifteen days; and yet when he went from
me in the morning, <hi>I</hi> charg'd him to tell her this or that, as if he were infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
to meet her; and in the evening <hi>I</hi> ever went to him to know what he
had advanc'd in my buſineſs; ſo that <hi>I</hi> even perſecuted him (if <hi>I</hi> may ſo ſay)
by my importunities. One time he brought me very good news; for he told
me that <hi>Amelita</hi> had acquainted him that <hi>Baſilia</hi> would be at her houſe the
next day. We fail'd not at the time appointed; and <hi>I</hi> aſſure you, <hi>I</hi> was then
forc'd to put on ſtronger chains then thoſe of my firſt ſlavery, <hi>Baſilia</hi> charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me as well by her ingenuity as her beauty. <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Amelita</hi> deſirous
to favour me with all the opportunity might be, left us together, and gave
me occaſion to declare my ſufferings to her, who was the cauſe of them. A
Captain that were to joyn battel with a moſt potent Enemy, would not have
been guilty of ſo many diſtractions as <hi>I</hi> was then; and not knowing at what end
to begin, <hi>I</hi> ever and anon chang'd my deſign.</p>
                        <p>At length ſpeaking to <hi>Baſilia</hi> of all the Verſes ſhe had found, I acquainted
her they were only deſign'd for her; and if I had ſought the means to ſee her in
divers places, it was that ſhe might ſee ſome experiences of my affection. She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
me, That I had not begun that Gallantry, and that I did not purſue it for
any other reaſon then to make my ſelf ſport, as other young Shepherds did. To
that I replied all that I could poſſibly invent, to perſwade her that I lov'd her;
and yet ſhe would never confeſs that ſhe believed ought I ſaid. And 'tis indeed
to be acknowledg'd, that though my cauſe were good, yet had I not many ſtrong
reaſons to maintain it: My mind was not free enough for to bethink it of fine
words, and <hi>I</hi> had much a do to keep my ſelf from vaniſhing away, ſo violently did
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43725:119"/>
my heart beat. <hi>I</hi> was ſo ſurpris'd, and withall ſo fearfull, that my whole body
trembled, and <hi>I</hi> believe <hi>I</hi> had fallen down if <hi>I</hi> had not been ſeated. Methought
alſo, without flattering my ſelf, that <hi>Baſilia</hi> had no greater confidence of herſelf,
for ſhe bluſh'd and fix'd her eyes on the ground, not ſo much as looking on me.
<hi>I</hi> alſo believ'd there had not any Shepherd ſpoke to her of Love before; but
for me who was not an Apprentice in that trade, to be ſo much troubled, was
very ſtrange. Whenever <hi>I</hi> remembred what action we were in, <hi>I</hi> had very ſtrange
emotions; and <hi>I</hi> believe we were rather an object of pitty then matter of delight
to thoſe that ſaw us. <hi>I</hi> do not relate to you our diſcourſe word for word, for my
aſtoniſhment hindred me to obſerve it: Let it ſuffice you to know, that <hi>I</hi> advanc'd
nothing that time; and having met <hi>Baſilia</hi> eight dayes after in the ſame place,
<hi>I</hi> was only ſo happy as to know that ſhe ſomwhat favour'd me. Nay, finding a
Pack of Cards on the Chimney-piece, ſhe was in ſo good a humour as to ask me
whether <hi>I</hi> would play a game with her at <hi>Picquet.</hi> When <hi>I</hi> loſt any thing, ſhe
made ſome little offers to jeer at me, and among other things told me <hi>I</hi> was eaſie
to be overcome. There's no greater glory then to be overcome by you, reply'd I;
and yet <hi>I</hi> ſhould think it better you were not ſo inſolent in your victories as to be
abuſive; if <hi>I</hi> ever come to revenge my ſelf, <hi>I</hi> ſhall have no pitty on you. Upon
that having put on a little confidence, <hi>I</hi> endeavour'd to kiſs her in my play: but ſhe
call'd <hi>Amelita,</hi> &amp; ſaid to her, Make <hi>Philiris</hi> be quiet, <hi>I</hi> pray; ſee you how he treats
me without any reſpect! What are you angry at? ſaid <hi>I</hi> to her: how do you
expect <hi>I</hi> ſhould be wiſe, ſince <hi>I</hi> have loſt my <hi>diſcretion?</hi> This touch was ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
that the Shepherds laught a good while at it, and in the mean time <hi>I</hi> found
the occaſion to take the kiſs had been refus'd me. The next day I brought a pair
of Spaniſh gloves to <hi>Amelita,</hi> to preſent to <hi>Baſilia,</hi> having thruſt a little Note
into one of the fingers, wherein theſe words were written:
<q>Fair hands, who have ſtollen away my heart, receive
the Preſent I make you of theſe Gloves, which I do to be
out of your debt. Let your fingers confidently enter into
them, and there keep them cloſe; there is nothing more
convenient for them, ſince 'tis ordinary for Thieves to
hide themſelves.</q>
I underſtood ſince from a good hand, that my Preſent was acceptable to <hi>Baſilia,</hi>
and that ſhe ſent me thanks with much complement: Yet my amorous remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances
ever met with ſmall refuſals; and the poor Shepherdeſs had not ſo much
boldneſs as to confeſs my ſervices deſerved any recompence. Beſides ſhe ſo little
ſtudied any compliance, that ſhe ſaid all came to her tongues end; whereby <hi>I</hi>
might obſerve, that though her mind was of a ſweet compoſure, yet could ſhe
not on any occaſions but betray ſomwhat of want of age, and diſcover ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
of infancie. Yet one thing <hi>I</hi> could not but take notice of, that while <hi>I</hi> ſigh'd
when <hi>I</hi> look'd on her, ſhe would go and play with her little Dog, or a Lamb,
calling it her Minion and her Servant. <hi>I</hi> think <hi>Amelita</hi> pittied me, and that ſhe
could not but pray her Couſin to treat me otherwiſe; for within a little while <hi>I</hi>
perceiv'd that <hi>Baſilia</hi> took ſome pleaſure in my addreſſes, and came to love me
even to jealouſie. So that having deſired her to let me take her Picture, becauſe
that which <hi>I</hi> had caus'd to be taken was not (as I thought) much like her, ſhe
very handſomly refus'd it, telling me that ſhe feared I might be more in love with
that then with her own true face; and that <hi>I</hi> ſhould after a while content my ſelf
to ſee that, and ſpeak to it at my own houſe, in ſtead of coming to entertain her
herſelf. Now if Painting made her ſo ſuſpitious, you may well think ſhe was more
ſuſpectfull of living perſons. She would not have me viſit any Maid; nay, out of a
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43725:120"/>
a fear her Couſin might tempt me to her, ſhe would not have me make any more
viſits at her houſe. Since that time, I very difficulty could find the occaſions to
entertain her: But the firſt time I ſaw her, I told her what I thought. Deareſt
<hi>Baſilia!</hi> ſaid I to her, You need no more diſtruſt me then your own heart: I
had rather only think of you, then ſee the faireſt Shepherdeſs in the world; I
would rather ſee you, then kiſs another; I would value one of your kiſſes more
then the perfect enjoyment of another; and if ever I have the happineſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
you, I ſhall not believe any fortune equal to mine. The applications you have
ſometimes made to <hi>Amelita,</hi> replies <hi>Baſilia,</hi> your little reciprocal ſmilings, and
ſo much whiſpering in the ear, have made me think it not impoſſible you might
build a new affection upon the ruines of the former. Ah <hi>Baſilia!</hi> cry'd I out,
will you ever perſecute me thus? Put me upon ſome dangerous adventures, find
out the moſt ſubtle inventions in the world for to try whether I love you: And
to the end I may chain my up ſelf the further in the fair priſon wherein I am, I wil
give you a ſtrange advice: Seek out that which is ſtrongeſt in all Magick for to
bind the affections, and make uſe of it in my caſe; let me take a <hi>Philter</hi> as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
as you would give an enemy whoſe courage you would abate. <hi>Baſilia</hi> took
her advantage of this advice; and taking me at my word, ſhe went to an old Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſs
who promiſed her a Love-potion: But the old was not ſecret, but
went and diſcover'd the deſign to her Father; who not deſiring there ſhould be
any love between me and his daughter, becauſe I was not rich enough for her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
him how to deceive her. He gave a ſum of money to the Sorcereſs, to
make two Drinks, one for love, the other for hatred: That of hatred was given
to <hi>Baſilia,</hi> and that for love he took with him. He being gone out of the houſe,
I had the time to ſee his daughter, for I ever watch'd when he went abroad: but
he preſently was back, and brought along with him a Shepherd called <hi>Lycaſtus,</hi>
whom he intended ſhould marry <hi>Baſilia,</hi> becauſe of his great wealth. Though
this were the firſt time he found me at his houſe, yet did he not look uncheerfully
on me, but deſired me to drink with him as well as <hi>Lycaſtus,</hi> which familiarity I
was much pleas'd with. We drank of an excellent wine; and the ſecond time he
was to preſent <hi>Lycaſtus,</hi> he found the means to put in the Philter. <hi>Baſilia</hi> on
the other ſide loſt not her time, and taking my glaſs, put in ſome of the Hate-potion.
So we took off what was much miſ-directed to us. For my part, I was
above three hours before I felt any change in my body or mind: But as to <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtus,</hi>
being return'd home preſently after, he fell ſo ſick, that they knew not
what remedy to apply. He ſoon diſcover'd to his father and mother, that the
cauſe of this accident was that he had drunk at <hi>Nerian, Baſilia's</hi> father's: So
that he was call'd to queſtion as a poiſoner. <hi>Baſilia</hi> imagining all the fault might
proceed from her, went and declared it was ſhe had put whatever there was in the
wine; and deſirous to acquit her father, ſhe proteſted he was not guilty. For my
part, having underſtood the trouble they were in, I would needs deliver them out
of it, And though I felt in my ſelf a new ſlackneſs towards <hi>Baſilia,</hi> yet could <hi>I</hi>
have deſired to die for her: For that diminution of Love came to me only by
fits; and Reaſon, which ſtill ſway'd my mind, was a ſufficient admonitor to me
that <hi>I</hi> ought to be faithfull. <hi>Nerian</hi> was accus'd for poiſoning <hi>Lycaſtus:</hi> but
<hi>Baſilia</hi> ſwore he had given it him innocently, and that it was ſhe had made the
compoſure: And <hi>I</hi> came and declared to the Judges, that it was upon my inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
ſhe had prepar'd the drink, and that <hi>I</hi> ought to ſuffer for it, and not any
other. The buſineſs was ſo confounded, that it was not known whether we were
guilty or innocent: but <hi>Lycaſtus</hi> being ſoon recover'd, we were ſent away ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted,
not ſo much as oblig'd to tell for what reaſon we had dreſs'd ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a drink. <hi>Lycaſtus</hi> having recovered to his perfect health again, the skill of
our Sorcereſs ſo wrought in him, that he fell paſſionately in love with <hi>Baſilia,</hi>
and demanded her in marriage of her father, whom a while before he had queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd.
<hi>Nerian</hi> ſeeing his deſign effected, very gladly treated with him about the
buſineſs, to the great regret of <hi>Baſilia,</hi> who ſaw her Magick had not much ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated:

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43725:120"/>
for though I ceas'd not to love her, yet did I not think on her ſo often as
before, nor did look after the occaſions to ſee her, but very indifferently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
at laſt my natural inclination overcame the charm, and two or three of my
Letters aſſur'd her that I would live and dye in her ſervice. On the other ſide,
the drink which <hi>Lycaſtus</hi> had taken being to work but fifteen dayes, he returned
to his former humor, which was far from the marriage he had talk'd of; ſo that
the next time he ſaw <hi>Nerian,</hi> he but very indifferently mention'd it to him. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
ſwore there ſhould never be any ſuch thing; ſo was he vex'd to ſee himſelf
ſlieghted; and the ſame day by divine permiſſion, it happened that our Sorcereſs
was caſt into priſon. Among other miſchiefs ſhe had done, ſhe declared to the
Judges how ſhe had ſold potions to <hi>Baſilia</hi> and her fathr. <hi>Nerian</hi> ſeeing a
ſcandal hanging over his houſe, would thus repair it; having found me out, he
ſpoke to me of beſtowing <hi>Baſilia</hi> on me for my wife: I willingly accepted the
proffer, and my friends were very glad to ſee me preferr'd ſo highly. As for
<hi>Baſilia,</hi> ſhe, as having ever moſt paſſionately lov'd me, was extreamly ſatisfied,
and repented her of the crime ſhe had committed, by truſting to the potions of
an inchantreſs, who robb'd ſome of their lives, and others of their wits. She
hath ſince believed that there needed no other charms then thoſe of her Beauty
and her Vertue for to make me love her, though thoſe of her mutual affection
did nothing contribute; ſo that our marriage was thought the moſt fortunate
that ever happened in our Country. Yet having once the curioſity to ask a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-teller,
if there were any thing I might be further happy in? he anſwered
me there was; and that I ſhould never be abſolutely happy, till I had ſeen the
amiable Shepherd, who feeds his flocks ſometimes on the banks of the <hi>Seine,</hi> and
ſometimes on thoſe of <hi>Morin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A while after this there came a Carrier out of this Countrey, who told me
that that Shepherd was called <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and that I ſhould profit much by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.
I was of opinion I could not reſt while I ſtood in hoſtility againſt the
celeſtial admonitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that having diſcovered my deſigns to <hi>Baſilia,</hi> I ſoon took
leave of her, that I might the ſooner ſee her again. She ſhed ſo many tears at
my departure, as ſome fantaſtical Poets would have thought enough to bring me
hither in a boat. Yet I came a foot, and reſted not, till <hi>I</hi> found the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Shepherd of whom my felicity depends. 'Tis you <hi>Lyſis</hi> whom my Fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teller
told me of; and the ſweetneſs of your converſation, baniſhes the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which the abſence of my dear wife cauſes me. Now that <hi>I</hi> am with you,
<hi>I</hi> believe <hi>I</hi> have found the ſoveraign good, which ſo many others are a ſeeking;
and <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> ſhall carry into my Country a ſolid knowledge, which <hi>I</hi> ſhall be
fill'd with, when <hi>I</hi> ſhall have heard your Lectures.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Philiris</hi> having thus clos'd his ſtory, <hi>Lyſis</hi> began to ſpeak; and ſaid to him, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Shepherd, the Gods grant thou maiſt finde with me the ſatisfaction thou hopeſt.
There's only one thing troubles me, that being married as thou art, and it being in
thy power to bring thy wife whither thou pleaſeſt, thou haſt been ſo much to blame
as not to have brought her hither. I have the ſame complaint to make againſt
<hi>Fontenay,</hi> this ſecond ſtory makes me think on't: You ſhould both of you have
brought your dear Halves with you; ſo you ſhould not have wept for their
abſence, your contentments had been never the ſhorter, you ſhould have been in
ſolitude and viduity as you are; you ſhould have had Shepherdeſſes to entertain
and court as well as others; whereas now you may not preſume to make any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
with civility to any of this Country: Beſides, you would have done us a great
obligation, to let us ſee <hi>Theodora</hi> and <hi>Baſilia,</hi> whoſe perfections would have rendred
our company more illuſtrious.</p>
            <p>As for my dear <hi>Theodora,</hi> replies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> you may aſſure your ſelf I would
have brought her along, had ſhe not been ſomewhat indiſpos'd when I came away.
And for my <hi>Baſilia,</hi> ſayes <hi>Philiris, I</hi> have left her at home to bear her Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
who is an ancient man; beſides that, I thought that having for a while ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43725:121"/>
the rigors of abſence, I ſhould at my return receive more infinite pleaſure.
However, I am not void of comfort here, for the image of my fair Shepherdeſs
is ever before my eyes. <hi>I</hi> never ſee <hi>Lillies</hi> nor <hi>Carnations,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> am put in
minde of her <hi>complexion.</hi> I never ſee the ſtars, but <hi>I</hi> think on her <hi>eyes,</hi> which are
my two <hi>Planets;</hi> and if <hi>I</hi> ſee the <hi>Moon</hi> ſhine, <hi>I</hi> am extreamly chear'd up, becauſe
at our parling, <hi>Baſilia</hi> and <hi>I</hi> mutually promiſs'd to behold that Planet at the ſame
hour; ſo that when <hi>I</hi> contemplate it, it joys me to know that my Shepherdeſs
doth the ſame, and that we do both the ſame action. Nay, <hi>I</hi> believe, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the fair <hi>Diana</hi> wiſhes me ſo well, that ſhe carries news to <hi>Baſilia</hi> in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<hi>I</hi> am, and that ſhe can alſo give me an account how <hi>Baſilia</hi> does, as if her
viſage were a <hi>Looking-glaſs,</hi> wherein by ſome ſecret ſcience things might be ſeen
at diſtance. Theſe are indeed moſt excellent entertainments for a Lover, ſays <hi>Lyſis;
I</hi> proteſt to you, that the hiſtory of <hi>Philiris</hi> hath given me ſo much content, as
poſſibly could be receiv'd from it; there's nothing in't but what is ſweet and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.
Nay, <hi>I</hi> do not think the Critick <hi>Clarimond</hi> hath found any thing in it to carp
at. In my opinion <hi>Philiris</hi> is no more in the right then <hi>Fontenay,</hi> replies <hi>Clarimond;</hi>
there are alſo a world of abſurdities in his ſtory. Theſe ſhittle-headed Lovers are
pure extravagances; and when <hi>I</hi> think on the many deſires he had about her picture,
<hi>I</hi> believe his fidelity hath not yet reſtor'd him to his wits. Above all, <hi>I</hi> could not
but laugh at his concluſion, when he ſpeaks of the abundance of <hi>Baſilia</hi>'s tears;
for after the ſweetneſs of her ſtudied diſcourſes, he makes her fall into the loweſt
degree of folly. And though he hath made over his intereſt to that conceipt of the
<hi>tears</hi> and the <hi>river</hi> to fantaſtick <hi>Poets,</hi> yet <hi>I</hi> doubt not but he will be glad to keep
it for himſelf, and will own it whenever it ſhall be father'd on him. Beſides, both
he and <hi>Fontenay</hi> are both as jealous as ever was <hi>Baſilia.</hi> That they have not brought
their wives hither, was for fear they might not be only for them, having heard ſay,
that there are thoſe who marry for them and their friends too. Thou art deceiv'd,
ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> they know well enough that every one here hath his Shepherdeſs, and
that it is in this Country that <hi>Fidelity</hi> hath eſtabliſh'd her Kingdom; we are all
ſcandaliz'd at the raſhneſs of thy language. If there be any point of their diſcourſe
that can offend us, 'tis more then <hi>I</hi> have yet obſerv'd, but the fault is not theirs
but Fates. You all know, that in <hi>Romances</hi> the Love-ſtories you meet with never
come to any end; they are never fully accompliſh'd till the end of the book: ſee in
the mean time <hi>Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> are married already, and conſequently have no
famous adventures to run through, whereas their marriage ſhould have been at the
ſame time as mine, according to the ordinary method. There muſt be diverſity in
the world, elſe it were not delightful, ſays <hi>Philiris,</hi> if you have heard the ſtories
of two married men, you will happly hear anon thoſe of two Batchelours. That's
my comfort, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> there's enough ſpoken to that ſubject. There is now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
troubles me, but that <hi>I</hi> conſider that <hi>Fontenay</hi> hath not quitted his name,
which is the name of a <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> more proper to a <hi>Souldier</hi> then a <hi>Shepherd.</hi> Yet
ſince the word is derived from <hi>Fountain,</hi> which is a thing ruſtical and <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> it
ſhall not be chang'd. As concerning <hi>Philiris, I</hi> have only one doubt as to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
He mentions his father, his Father in Law, and himſelf as Shepherds; 'twas
a thing <hi>I</hi> knew not before, that there were any famous Shepherds in <hi>Burgundy.</hi> You
may be aſſur'd there are a many, replies <hi>Philiris;</hi> and they are not ruſtical perſons,
but perſons of quality, that have renounc'd the pomp of the Court. I am very
glad of it, ſaies <hi>Lyſis; I</hi> hope one day to ſee a wonderful advancement of the <hi>Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
life: Should <hi>I</hi> not accommodate my ſelf here, <hi>I</hi> would go into your Country,
which <hi>I</hi> had not yet ſo much as thought on.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſpoke thus to <hi>Philiris,</hi> there came one of <hi>Hircans</hi> Lacqueys, who ſaid
his Maſter expected the company to dine with him. Upon which they all riſe up,
and took their way towards his Caſtle. <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who had ſome ſecret talk with
<hi>Fontenay,</hi> learned of him who the new Shepherds were, whom he had ſeen the day
before. When they were come to <hi>Hircans, Polidor, Meliantes</hi> and <hi>Lucida</hi> (who
was now called <hi>Amaryllis)</hi> came and receiv'd the company: and the Magician ask'd
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43725:121"/>
them what they had been doing all the while. We fel from one diſcourſe into another
concerning a Temple which <hi>Lyſis</hi> would build to the honor of <hi>Charite,</hi> replies <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>
I now acquaint the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis,</hi> faies <hi>Hircan,</hi> that beſides the Temple which
he hath erected to his Miſtris in his own ſoul, if there be need of a material one, ſhe
hath one already, and that the moſt magnificent that can be imagin'd. All the earth
is her altar, the water is to waſh her victims, the ayr is fill'd with nothing but the
prayers and ſighs of her adorers, the elementary fire ſerves for her ſacrifices, the
heaven is the roof of the building, and the Planets are the lamps that hang in it. I
will not contradict thee in ſo noble an imagination, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I will think no
further of building little Temples to <hi>Charite;</hi> But thou art withal to know, that
we have had other diſcourſe erewhile: we have had a great conteſtation about <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphos'd</hi>
perſons, and <hi>rural Divinities,</hi> which there are divers that cannot believe
are at all. I will cure them of that error, ſays <hi>Hircan;</hi> put me in minde of it. This
diſcourſe ended, <hi>Fontenry</hi> made a brief relation to his Couſin of the <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi>
of <hi>Pathenice;</hi> and after that they were all ſate at table, not forgetting the Shepherd
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> whom they made ſpeak in ſpight of his teeth, that he might pay his
reckoning in good diſcourſe; but <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who could ſ of nothing but <hi>Charite,</hi>
engag'd the company on that ſubject; and ask'd <hi>Philiris,</hi> if he had ever ſeen that
Shepherdeſs. The queſtion was impertinent enough, becauſe <hi>Philiris</hi> was but newly
arrived into <hi>Brie;</hi> and yet to ſee what <hi>Lyſis</hi> would ſay, he anſwered, That he had
ſeen that fair one, as he paſt by, ſtanding at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s door. I am glad of that, ſays
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> for that is a ſign ſhe is not ſick. If ſhe had continued ſick ſtill, I ſhould not
ſo eaſily have been gotten abroad, I ſhould have kept my chamber as well as ſhe
out of conformy. That I have come abroad while ſhe was ſick, I have committed
a fault, of which I repent me. But without jeſting, Shepherd <hi>Philiris,</hi> is it then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that thou haſt ſeen her, and doſt not relate the ſtrange aſtoniſhment thou wert
then in? did ſhe not make thy eyes twinkle, leſt her great luſtre might dazzle thee?
did ſhe not make thee forget, at leaſt for one quarter of an hour, the beauty of
thy <hi>Baſilia?</hi> But without diſſembling tell me, hadſt thou waſh'd thy eyes that
morning, for to purifie them, and take away the pollution which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from prophane objects, ſo to make them worthy to contemplate that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
countenance? Though <hi>Clarimond</hi> quarrel with my tears, ſaies <hi>Philiris,</hi> yet
ſhall I not forbear ſpeaking of them; and aſſure you, that it is with them that I
ever purifie my eyes, when I am abſent from <hi>Baſilia.</hi> Doubt not but I have ſeen
your <hi>Charite,</hi> and that ſhe hath put me into that admiration, which is forc'd on us
by all things incomparable. Let me ſee thy eyes, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> looking on him; thou
lyeſt not, beloved Shepherd, thou haſt indeed ſeen that Shepherdeſs. I obſerve in
the apples of thy eyes certain little fires, which proceed from hers, and ſhe hath
alſo left there certain touches of her image. There would have been much more,
had not her face been bound up, which muſt have hindred thee to have a full ſight
of her. <hi>Philiris</hi> ſaid nothing to that, for he knew not what to anſwer to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
<hi>Lyſis</hi> thought by that, he granted <hi>Charite</hi> to be ſtill bound up; ſo that he
was well content to be ſo too; for he had not yet taken of his handkercher from
off his left eye, and he was of opinion, it was rather an ornament to him then an
inconvenience.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the <hi>Magitian</hi> and his gueſts had din'd, they went their
way into a little Thicket hard by the Caſtle, where they
found <hi>Orontes, Florida, Leonora, Angelica, Anſelme</hi> and
<hi>Montenor,</hi> who had had notice that the aſſembly of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
was to be there. <hi>Angelica</hi> preſently acquainted <hi>Lyſis</hi>
that his Miſtreſs was well: whereat he was ſo joyfull, that
he knew not how well to give her thanks to his mind for
bringing him ſo good news. But to oblige him the more, ſhe
ſent for <hi>Charite,</hi> who by her preſence put him almoſt out
of himſelf. When he perceiv'd her face was not bound up, he immediately pluck'd
the handkerchief off his, which was ty'd over one eye; and cry'd out, <hi>I</hi> am no
longer ſick, ſince <hi>Charite</hi> is in health! <hi>I</hi> muſt ever be conformable to her: <hi>I</hi> knew
well my eye ailed nothing, as ſoon as ever ſhe appear'd. Now you are to know,
dear company, that there is ſuch a ſympathy between her and me, that <hi>I</hi> am not
well but when ſhe is ſo: <hi>I</hi> would to God the reſemblance were yet greater, and
that <hi>I</hi> could be chang'd into her! 'Tis a thing <hi>I</hi> paſſionately wiſh, and endeavour
to attain to: 'Tis the ſupreme degree of Love, to be changed into the thing lov'd,
according to the opinion of the Philioſophers. Now that this thought is come into
my mind, <hi>I</hi> value not my former metamorphoſis: Oh how much better is it to be
chang'd into <hi>Charite,</hi> then into a <hi>Tree!</hi> But alas, <hi>I</hi> cannot be changed into my
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43725:122"/>
Shepherdeſs, if ſhe alſo be not changed into me: I muſt firſt ſoften her rigor, and
ſuffer incredible afflictions. Do but imagine, ſays <hi>Anſelme,</hi> that your wiſh is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
effected; and that though you ſeem to be a Shepherd, that you are indeed
the Shepherdeſs <hi>Charite</hi> chang'd into <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and that this Shepherdeſs here, is the
Shepherd <hi>Lyſis</hi> chang'd into <hi>Charite.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> know well enough <hi>I</hi> am not <hi>Charite,</hi>
replies the Shepherd; for <hi>I</hi> reaſon in my ſelf as <hi>Lyſis</hi> was wont to do, and I find in
my ſelf my former mind. There's your miſtake, fair <hi>Charite</hi> (ſays <hi>Anſelme</hi> to <hi>Lyſis)</hi>
you are indeed fully and perfectly chang'd into that Shepherd, ſo that you want
nothing which he had: <hi>Lyſis</hi> hath undergone a reciprocal change, now he ſeems
to us to be <hi>Charite.</hi> This ſubtilty pleaſes me, though I ſuſpect it to be falſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the <hi>Shepherd;</hi> for though this change were real, yet is it certain I ought to be
nothing elſe then what I am.</p>
            <p>Had this diſcourſe been any while continued, it would have gravell'd the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
wit. But theſe ſtarts being over, <hi>Hircan</hi> had a mind to ſome other diverſion;
and when he had made them all ſit down on the graſs, he ſpoke thus: Knights and
Ladies, and you Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes! Since we are ſo fortunately met
here, let us make good uſe of our time: I think it convenient that thoſe who have
run through any remarkable adventures in their life, relate the ſtory of them to the
reſt; there will be as much profit as pleaſure in it. Every one thought his advice
very ſeaſonable: And though <hi>Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> had in the morning related
their ſtories, yet they ſtood not to begin the relation again to thoſe who had not
heard them. They ſaid nothing which was not pleaſant, whether it were truth or
falſhood. <hi>Fontenay</hi> ſet out his diſcourſe with a many freſh thoughts; as when he
came to ſpeak of the viſit of <hi>Theodora,</hi> he very naturally repreſented the tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
he was in: He ſaid he plac'd himſelf between his Looking-glaſs and her, and
that he endeavour'd to ſee <hi>Theodora</hi> with one eye, and his own Figure with the
other, not knowing which of them he ought to love. At the end of his ſtory, <hi>Lyſis</hi>
propos'd again how that they ought to regret, in that <hi>Theodora</hi> was not clad like a
man, to make their adventures more remarkable. But inſomuch as the more there
are in a place together, the more different opinions will there be, ſo there were a
many that contradicted him. <hi>Anſelme</hi> came neereſt the mark: For ſays he to him,
ſince you are troubled that <hi>Theodora</hi> was not diſguis'd, ſhe ſhould not have been in
the ſame manner as <hi>Iphis,</hi> who had only put on mans cloaths for fear to be raviſh'd;
ſhe ſhould have been diſguis'd out of the love ſhe bore herſelf, that ſo her hiſtory
might have been more perfect, and more relative to that of <hi>Fontenay,</hi> there being
a conformity of Adventures, as is ſeen in <hi>Romances:</hi> But it is to be known whether
a woman that lov'd herſelf, would be forc'd by her paſſion to go clad like a man,
and renounce her ſex? It's to he thought ſhe would never do it; for Beauty hath
its principal ſeat in womens faces, and they will much the rather admire it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
then in mens countenances: That's contrary to <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who was forc'd to
ſeek that in a diſguiſe which naturally he had not. <hi>Lyſis</hi> would have replied to this,
but the Ladies cauſed the diſcourſe to be given over, as relating to a matter that
were too ſubtile and too amorous. Upon that <hi>Philiris</hi> began to ſpeak, raviſhing all
by the naturalneſs of his conceptions. <hi>Polidor</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi> were deſir'd to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the company with the like diverſion; and <hi>Hircan</hi> ſaid to them, I know well
that your afflictions are ſo great, that you will not of your ſelves be couragious
enough to relate your own ſtories: But here will I make appear the power of my
Art, and ſet your tongues at liberty to declare your paſt ſufferings: Speak without
fear one after another. As ſoon as <hi>Hircan</hi> had ſaid ſo to them, they put off their
extravagant faces, and put on milder looks, as if really ſome charm had had its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
on them. And <hi>Polidor,</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Meliantes</hi> give him the honour to ſpeak
firſt, began his ſtory thus.</p>

                        <p>THe faireſt City in the Kingdom of <hi>Perſia</hi> was the place of my birth: Nor
is it to be much admir'd if I ſpeak <hi>French</hi> ſo well; for my father, whoſe
name was <hi>Cleon,</hi> was of this Country, and had been taken with a Couſin
of his call'd <hi>Luthydemus,</hi> by ſome Pirats, who had ſold them to their King, in
whoſe attendance they were brought up and advanc'd. Having learn'd of my
father the language and cuſtoms of <hi>France,</hi> and divers other perfections, I was in
hopes one day to become a great man with our Maſter. But O unhappineſs! I
fell in love with <hi>Rhodogina,</hi> who is ſo cruel that ſhe deſerves to be the Queen of
Hell. 'Tis true, there are ſo many lillies and roſes in her complexion, that they
have not elſwhere to go for to adorn the portals of all the Temples; it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that her body is made up of pearls, diamonds, and threads of gold, ſo that
there falls nothing from her which is not enough to enrich the moſt inſatiable
Miſer in the world: but who is permitted to enjoy theſe treaſures? Her priſons
are ſtronger then thoſe of our King; her attractions are ſo powerfull, that ſhe
draws all to her, and by their graſpings, if a coach ſtuck faſt in the mire, would
draw it out at one pluck. Her eyes have in them ſo ſtrong a fire, that one day
looking through her window, all the lead melted, and the glaſs fell down to the
ground. Thence ſhe caſt her beams on a gutter that was over againſt her, and the
lead thereof being alſo melted, fell upon a Gentleman that paſs'd by, and enter'd
his head; wherein if ſhe did him any courteſie, 'twas, that whereas his brains before
were light, now they were heavy enough. And theſe are the ſtrange qualities of
<hi>Rhodogina,</hi> which indeed ſhe might employ well, but perpetually does the worſt
that may be: And whenever I went to ſee her, I muſt have ſtood in a poſture to
run away, leſt I ſhould have been impriſon'd; and annointed my ſelf before
with whites of eggs and Mallows-water, for fear I ſhould be burnt up by her.
When I had declared to her the love ſhe had rais'd in my heart, ſhe nothing but
laught at it, and aſſured me ſhe would never have any compaſſion on me but on
certain conditions ſhe would make with me. In the firſt place, having heard that
a certain Courtier call'd <hi>Oſthanes</hi> had a certain Ring that made him inviſible,
ſhe told me I muſt bring her it. That I thought a hard task; for what means is
there to take away a thing from a man one ſees not? 'Twas reported that <hi>Oſtha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
had the pleaſure to go into the womens Stoves, there to contemplate the fair
Ladies ſtark naked, and ſometimes to enjoy them, without being perceived by any
body: He would be in the Kings Cabinet, when the moſt important affairs of
State were in debate: He filch'd up and down whatever was neceſſary for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
yet was not puniſhed for his felonies, becauſe he could not be taken
in the fact; and if they would have carried him to priſon, he would have vaniſh'd
away like a ſpirit. Yet I bethought me to cloath my ſelf like an outlandiſh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
and take a little ſhop neer his houſe, being ſomwhat in hope to get away
from him what I deſired. I had a Cheſt wherein I had put ſome Knives with han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
made of <hi>Remora's</hi> teeth, a Fan of Phenix feathers, and ſome other trifles:
But all about it I had ſo diſpos'd certain ſmall wyres, wherein the hand that did
but touch it was preſently caught and ſecured. Now my hope was, that <hi>Oſthanes</hi>
would be caught there; and that if he were, he ſhould give me his Ring to be let
looſe. Having therefore given him notice that I had ſome rare merchandiſes to
ſell, he told me he was ſick, and that till two dayes were over he could not come
and ſee them. But this was only that I might not ſuſpect him of the intended
knavery. I much doubted his intentions; ſo that I was ſo fearfull he might come
into my ſhop, that I kept always abroad, though I had been aſſured he could make
himſelf inviſible when he pleas'd. He came that very day to ſee my Cheſt; and
ſince it was not only neceſſary to have his Ring on his finger, but that, to blind
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43725:123"/>
the eyes of the world, he muſt alſo put the Stone to his mouth, he thought at firſt
to put but one hand on my ware; yet ſeeing himſelf alone, his avarice counſell'd
him to put them both: That with the Ring, to his ſorrow, was put out firſt, for
it was preſently caught in the gin. <hi>Oſthanes</hi> not able to diſengage his hand, drew
the Cheſt to him for to carry it away, but that was well chain'd to the wall. He
bethought himſelf, that if he were taken in that poſture, he ſhould ſuffer ſome
ſhamefull death; ſo that he was ſo deſperate as to lay hold of a knife that hung
at his girdle with the hand that was looſe, and to cut off that which was faſt at the
wriſt. I ſaw him afterwards run away, but I look'd not after him, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that his hand and Ring was in my cheſt. I therefore pack'd up my baggage,
and went to preſent <hi>Rhadogina</hi> with the Ring ſhe deſired. She told me I had not
yet ſufficiently demonſtrated my ſervices, and that I muſt find her whereever ſhe
hid herſelf. Having therefore put the Ring to her mouth, ſhe became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible;
and I began to cry out to her, How now, perfidious one! will you now
fruſtrate me of the recompence you promis'd me? I have brought you what you
deſired, and you give me not what <hi>I</hi> deſire: I have therefore gotten nothing but
my own ruine. I ſhall fall into deſpair, if you ſhew not your ſelf: I will break to
pieces all your houſholdſtuff, I will ſlay all creatures both man and beaſt, nay
I will not ſpare the very infects. While I ſaid this, I heard <hi>Rhodigina</hi> laugh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
here, ſometimes there; and I went about in vain with my arms ſtretch'd out
to be ready to embrace her if I met with her; if <hi>I</hi> ſaw a little ſmoak any where,
<hi>I</hi> ran thither thinking to have her, becauſe <hi>I</hi> imagin'd it was her breath; but my
arms would cloſe again at my own breaſt without graſping any thing. This put
me into ſuch a fury, that <hi>I</hi> rudely took hold of a little Girl whom <hi>Rhodogina</hi> call'd
her Neece, though ſhe was thought to be the mother of it, and made as if <hi>I</hi> would
caſt it into a Well. This made <hi>Rhodogina</hi> come preſently to me; and her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
telling her that both hands were not too much to recover the Child, ſhe took
out of her mouth the hand that had the Ring, and took from me the poor little
one, that cry'd moſt pittifully. <hi>I</hi> then embrac'd my Miſtreſs, and forc'd her to
confeſs ſhe was overcome. But beſides that, this trick confirm'd me that the Girl
was her own daughter, which ſhe had had by a more fortunate Lover then <hi>I:</hi> For
the pains ſhe took to ſave the Child ſo ſuddenly, ſpoke a motherly tenderneſs.
Yet <hi>I</hi> took no notice of it, only was content to entreat her not to be any longer
cruel towards me: But all <hi>I</hi> could obtain was, that in conſideration <hi>I</hi> had brought
her <hi>Oſthanes</hi> his Ring, ſhe would not make uſe of it againſt me, and would never
be inviſible to me. But ſhe provided me another torment in amends of this; and
having brought me to the entrance of a Deſart, told me <hi>I</hi> muſt paſs through it to
fetch her of a water, which caus'd ſuch a good memory to thoſe that had but once
drunk of it, that they remembred all they ever ſaw in their lives, even to the leaſt
particulars. My miſtreſs gave me a veſſel to bring that liquor in, and ſome arms
for to defend my ſelf if any one aſſaulted me, and beſides nine loaves for my <hi>via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum.</hi>
You will find, ſayes ſhe, a many little Fountains in your way, before you
come to the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Memory,</hi> which by its beauty is eaſily diſtinguiſh'd; and
that's the reaſon <hi>I</hi> give you no water. But as for bread, you muſt take ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with you, for you are to paſs through places where you will not meet with
any. If you are couragious, your journey will be over in nine dayes, and one loaf
a day will be enough: but if you are a coward, it will require a great deal more
time, and you will dye for hunger ere you return. For my part, <hi>I</hi> will get nine
torches, and will light one every night; and if you be not return'd by that time
they are all burnt, <hi>I</hi> ſhall think no more of you, but think you loſt. <hi>Rhodogina</hi>
having ſaid this, <hi>I</hi> took leave of her; and after <hi>I</hi> had ſuffered many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
by the way, <hi>I</hi> came in four dayes to a certaine River, which I had heard
ſay, was to be paſſed, to goe to the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Memory. I</hi> found very
opportunely on the Rivers ſide a Tree cut down, on which <hi>I</hi> got, and by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my hands and feet <hi>I</hi> croſsd to the other ſide. <hi>I</hi> was no ſooner there, but
<hi>I</hi> perceived the Fountain, which fell into a Baſon of white marble: but with the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43725:124"/>
ſame ſight there appears a furious Dragon, which opening a throat like an abyſs,
made towards me for to devour me. I had a club, which I ſent down ſo far into
his throat, that it was not poſſible for him to bring his jaws together to do me
any hurt. So that I confidently went to the Fountain, where I fill'd my veſſel,
and expected the Monſter with ſword in hand. He ruſh'd upon me ſo violently,
that had I not given way, he had caſt me to the ground: But that he might not
do me any hurt, I caſt my ſelf on his back, where I ſate as if I had been on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back.
He to rid himſelf of me, caſt himſelf into the water: but I gave him ſo many
blows on the tail, that he thinking to eſcape from him that ſtruck him behind,
ſwam over the river and ſet me aſhore very fortunately, for the current had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away my Tree. I then got off him and took my way, leaving him half dead.
I was ſo afraid I ſhould not be return'd to <hi>Rhodogina</hi> time enough, that I travell'd
day and night; and one evening was ſo dry, meeting with no fountain, that I
was forc'd to drink half the water I was to bring her; and thence it came, that I
now have an incomparable memory. The next day I bethought me to fill up my
veſſel with ordinary water; but I was afraid <hi>Rhodogina</hi> might diſcover the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture,
ſo I brought it her but half full. Yet ſhe was content, and commended
my diligence, for I was back in a little more then eight dayes; and I had one of
my loayes left, and ſhe one of her torches. I then thought I could not hope any
thing from her which I ſhould not obtain: But when ſhe ſaw I was ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
ſhe laugh'd at me, and told me I ſhould not hope ever to enjoy her, if I
brought her not a piece of ſome member of a <hi>Shepherd</hi> that had ſometime been a
<hi>Tree.</hi> Having not met with any ſuch Shepherds in <hi>Perſia,</hi> I took ſhipping and
landed in this Country, where I met with <hi>Hircan,</hi> who hath related to me the
Hiſtory of the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis.</hi> I have put on the habit I now wear, that I might
the more freely converſe with this noble company; and having yeſterday met
with <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I was extreamly glad, hoping he would give me what I ſought for.</p>

having caus'd ſilence to be made, began thus:</p>

                        <p>YOu are to know, dear Troop! that this <hi>Euthydemus</hi> whom <hi>Polidor</hi> ſpoke
of, is my own father. He brought me up after the <hi>French</hi> mode, in the
midſt of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court; and taught me ſo many exerciſes, that I
thought the faireſt Ladies of the world would be too happy to have me their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
Yet was I forc'd to make my addreſſes to the fair <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> inſtead of
receiving any from her, though my ſubmiſſions could not obtain me her favour,
ſo high was her diſdain. My only comfort was to ſee, that greater perſons then
my ſelf were no better treated: For the King himſelf who was call'd <hi>Siramnes</hi>
was of the number of her miſerable captives, becauſe the deformity of his face
rendred him very diſacceptable. He would no more be anſwered with delayes
as he was wont, and his deſign was to make her be brought into his chamber, and
there to force her. <hi>Pamphilia</hi> having had the news of it, was much amaz'd; and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43725:124"/>
after ſhe had made her remonſtrances of it in particular to ſome of her Lovers,
ſhe went and ſecur'd herſelf with <hi>Chryſotemis</hi> her mother in the Caſtle of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſia,</hi>
which her father had built by the ſea-ſide. 'Twas not long ere <hi>Alicantes</hi>
her brother came thither; and <hi>Arimaſpus, Nicanor, Hippodamus,</hi> and I, who
were Servants to that Beauty, went alſo to the ſame place to defend her againſt
all enemies. We were preſently declar'd Traitors, and <hi>Syramnes</hi> ſent two thouſand
men to beſiege our Caſtle, in caſe we ſhould not in time ſubmit. <hi>Pamphilia</hi> was
now forc'd to make uſe of her Servants, though againſt her will: For her Brother
having ſlighted the Summons had been ſent him, there was nothing now to be
look'd for but fighting and ruine. We were ſo ill muntion'd, that in the very
firſt aſſault <hi>Nicanor</hi> having ſpent all his bullets, drew out three or four of his teeth
and charg'd his muſquet. <hi>Barzanes,</hi> Lieutenant to the Kings troops, had brought
no Canon; but not having the patience to ſtay the coming of any, he would
needs one day ſcale the caſtle. His people came off very ſadly; for we had unpaved
all our Court, and having beaten the ſtones to pieces, we had made them fiery
hot for to caſt on our enemies as they came up the walls. That being ſmall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
got between their ſhirts and their skins, and did them a world of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
ſome of it falling into their eyes, immediately blinded them, ſo that they
were forced to retreat without doing any thing. That night we heard a little Bell
that rung at a good diſtance from us: We all thought there might be no deſign
in that, except <hi>Alicantes,</hi> who made all be ſilent, and told us he was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
if it were not ſome ſignal that were given us. When there is no convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Letters (continued he) to perſons beſieged, their friends ſpeak to them
by other artifices: If they come to any eminent place, they ſhew them by
lighted torches, by the number whereof they ſignifie the Letters one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
or for want of that, they have a Bell, whereon they give ſo many tolls as
the diſcourſe they intend requires Letters, and ſo they may ſpeak at a leagues
diſtance: This ſecret I learn'd long ſince, and now it comes very ſeaſonably to
mind. <hi>Alicantes</hi> having ſo ſaid, hearkened to the ſeveral ſounds of the Bell;
which when he had done, he cries out, Let's be merry, friends! there will relief
come very ſuddenly: <hi>Cyniphus,</hi> who ſeems to be of the Kings party, promiſes
me to betray him: I am very much given to believe it, for he ever profeſs'd a
ſingular friendſhip to me. All admired to ſee that <hi>Alicantes</hi> ſo well underſtood
the language of Bells; and ſince that we had none, he took a Kettle, and having
gotten on a Turret he beat within it with a ſtick to anſwer <hi>Cyniphus.</hi> We had no
anſwer; for as I heard ſince, the Kings Sentinels diſcoverd the plot, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the Generall. He impriſoned <hi>Cyniphus,</hi> and having put him to the rack
he confeſs'd that he was in love with <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> and that his deſign was to have
reliev'd her, that he might have enjoyed her afterwards at his pleaſure. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reported to <hi>Siramnes,</hi> he would ſeem to appear gracious; and conſidering
that <hi>Cyniphus</hi> only had a deſign to betray him, and enjoy her he had deſign'd for
himſelf, but had effected nothing, he thought it enough to puniſh him in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.
They told him, that the King did him the favour to give him the choice
of his death. He would have his veins opened; and when they went to blind him,
that (as they told him) he might not be troubled with the ſight of his own blood,
he deſired to be at liberty, that dying he might behold a picture of <hi>Pamphilia.</hi>
The Executioner anſwered him, that it was the Kings pleaſure he ſhould not any
longer behold his Miſtreſs, and that he was commanded to blind him. Being in
this extremity, he ſaid it could not but be permitted him to ſweeten the pangs of
death ſome other way. He cauſed to be plac'd neer his noſtrils the Perfume he
moſt was taken with; he had in his mouth the Sweet-meats he beſt loved: He
cauſed to be read a moſt pleaſant Love-diſcourſe, and at the ſame time had a
Mufitian to ſing an aire, which raviſh'd him above the reſt: And all this, that
he might dye voluptuouſly. He knew not which of all theſe pleaſures he ſhould
moſt intend, when having his eyes blinded, they pinch'd ſomwhat hard the veins
of his arm and foot only with their nails, and ordered water to fall abundantly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43725:125"/>
into Baſons neer him. He believ'd his very veins were opened, and that it was his
blood that ran down; ſo that his imagination was ſo ſtrong, that weakening by
little and little, he died within half an hour. <hi>Siramnes</hi> was ſorry for it, becauſe
this man had been all his Councel in love-affairs, and there was not any of us
which he could not have wiſh'd in his room. Some ſmall Field-pieces being come
to the beſiegers, they would batter down our walls: but we, to ſtrengthen the
leſs fortified places, laid over them our Straw-beds and Feather-beds, and a many
baskets of rags, that ſo the violence of the ſhot might be ſmothered, and we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
as to the artillery and arrows. Yet all could not hinder the making a breach;
which done, the ditch being fill'd, the enemy came up to us. Whereupon we four
that were the ſervants of <hi>Pamphilia</hi> took a generous reſolution: We ſwore that
<hi>Barzanes</hi> ſhould never enter <hi>Nomaſia,</hi> if he paſs'd not through our bellies; That
ſince the ſtones could not any longer ſecure <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> the pikes and the ſwords
muſt do it, and men muſt ſerve for walls. We therefore plac'd our ſelves in a
rank on the breach, being faſtened one to another at the waſte with chains, having
alſo faſtened to the two ſides of the broken wall thoſe which were at the two
ends. Thus were we oblig'd to fight, though there were no advantage to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
and we took away all means of flight, for to make good the breach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the enemy. They who made towards us felt our valour to their ſorrow,
and were forced to retreat. The worſt on't was, that we could not purſue them;
but <hi>Alicantes</hi> who was looſe, made bold with half a ſcore ſouldiers to ſee them
back again. He went ſo far from the Caſtle, that he found <hi>Barzanes</hi>'s company
ſo heavy on him, that he was forc'd to lean againſt a Cypreſs-tree; upon that
<hi>Barzanes</hi> run him through with a lance, and faſtened him to the tree. Our ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ſeeing their Captain ſo ill handled, made haſte into the Caſtle, and with us
made good the breach, and help'd to beat off the enemy; who ſeeing the night
approach, were minded to reſt, there being no need they ſhould be ſo haſty in a
thing which they muſt needs carry. In their return they ſaw <hi>Alicantes</hi> who was
nail'd to the Cypreſs; and as it happens that in the agony of death a man holds
a thing faſteſt, he had ſtill in his hand a javelin wherewith he ſeem'd to menace
them, expecting them in a quiet poſture. His countenance it ſeems had ſomwhat
of horror in it, that ſo frighted <hi>Barzanes</hi>'s ſouldiers, that they took him for a
Devil, and ran away; but their Captain convinc'd and reaſſur'd them. As the
Birds, when they have ſome time conſidered the Scarcrow that's plac'd in the
middle of a field and ſeems to threaten them, perceiving at length it is no man,
do not then think it enough to fly about it, but having reaſſum'd their confidence
come neer it, light on it, nay leave their ordure on it, and eat the grain it guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e:
So <hi>Barzanes</hi>'s ſouldiers having diſcovered that <hi>Alicantes</hi> was no more then
a poor maſs of earth, made him a But for their arrows, and ſhot at him ſo many
as would have kill'd him, had he not been dead before. After that they did him
a many indignities, whereof we ſaw ſome part; and yet we could not think him
unfortunate, ſince he had the honour to die ſtanding, as became a brave Captain.
Only <hi>Chryſotemis</hi> and <hi>Pamphilia</hi> bemoan'd him; yet were they fain to quit their
mourning, and provide for their own ſafety. We had not men enough to make
up the breaches which might be eaſily made any where in our walls; and if we
had had, they would have been a burthen to us, for we wanted all manner of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition.
We had already made away all our dogs and all our horſes, we were
ready to make pottage of the leather of our bucklers, and ſome parchment-books
we had found in a ſtudy; ſo that there was no further means to make good the
place; and if we intended to avoid the Kings fury, we muſt needs quit a place
ſo unfortunate to us. We therefore got out all in the night at a fally-port, and
having buried <hi>Alicantes,</hi> we embarqu'd our ſelves in a veſſel that was a Knights
a friend of <hi>Nicanors,</hi> who was very willing to put that obligation on him. We
had put fire to part of the Caſtle of <hi>Nomaſia,</hi> that it might be all burnt, and that
<hi>Barzanes</hi> might not be the better for the riches in it, which having ſharpened his
avarice had made him ſo reſolute to ruine us. When we were gotten into the ſea,

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43725:125"/>
we ſaw the flames, which encreaſed ſtill, and enlightned all the coaſt, whereat
we were ſomewhat ſatisfied, conſidering we left nothing for our enemies, whereof
they might triumph. They ſeeing the Caſtle afire, knew not whether it were
ſome of theirs had put it afire, or we our ſelves through negligence or deſpair;
and they were troubled moſt, to know whether we had ſtaid in it to be conſumed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I know not whether ever they came to know any thing. But I have been told
ſince, that having quench'd the fire, they beſtow'd a whole moneth, to look for
what gold and ſilver was melted.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time we ſail'd very proſperouſly, being bound for <hi>Greece,</hi> to avoid
the Tyranny of <hi>Syramnes:</hi> But when we thought we were not far from ſome har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,
there riſe a wind that quite croſs'd our deſign, and was withal ſo churliſh, that
it ſoon made away with ſail and tackling: One while our ſhip ſeem'd to be in the
clouds, another ſhe would be ſo low, as if ſhe had been ſwallow'd down into hell.
The Maſter called one way, the Marriners another; every one commanded,
and no body would obey. The Veſſel had gotten ſo many leaks, that there came
in more water then could be pump'd out; and at laſt having met with a rock, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one catch'd at what he could, that might aſſiſt him ought to ſwim. There
the men were ſeen floating with the pack of merchandize, and ſome had their
ſides gall'd wich meeting with boards full of nails. No body had any other friend
then himſelf, and every one preferr'd his own ſafety before that of another <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoternis,</hi>
and all my companions, were drown'd in my ſight; but as for <hi>Pamphilia,</hi>
I kept her faſt to a piece of the ſhip, that ſaved her from ſhipwrack; and the
tempeſt being over, I ſaw great fiſhes that thruſt forward our wretched Veſſel,
and kept it up, as if ſome God had put them on that employment. We at length
arriv'd at an Iſland, which ſeem'd to be a deſart; and we had not gone a league
in it, but we ſaw a Fortreſs, with a fine proſpect: Thither went we for ſuccour
in our affliction; but inſtead of that there iſſued out two Gyants, who taking
<hi>Pamphilia,</hi> carried her away more rudely then ſhe expected. I thought to have
gone in with her, but the gate was ſhut againſt me, and I went a little way off for
to diſcharge my ſelf by weeping, as being uncapable of any comfort, for having
been ſuch a daſtard as to ſuffer my Miſtreſs to be taken away from me. As ſoon
as I turn'd my back, the gate was open, upon which I put my hand to my ſword,
thinking to recover what I had loſt; but when I came near the Fortreſs, the
gate was faſtned again. So was I abuſed for a many times, till there came out an
aged man; who ſaid to me, Trouble not thy ſelf, <hi>Pamphila</hi> is in a place where
ſhe muſt remain ſome time, if thou deſireſt ſhe may not fall into the hands of
<hi>Siramnes.</hi> If thou wouldſt recover her again, get the aſſiſtance of the <hi>French
Shepherd,</hi> who is he alone that can one day reſtore her to thee. I asked the good
man, where I might finde that valiant Shepherd, who telling me he would effect
my deſire, gave me a drink, which made me ſleep along time. When I wak'd,
I was near <hi>Hircans</hi> Caſtle, where I met my Couſin <hi>Polidor,</hi> who told me what
Country I was in; and we came together, and made acquaintance with this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Magician, who hath caus'd us to be cloath'd as we are, and hath told us won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and aſſur'd us that it is only through his means
that our misfortune muſt come to any Period.</p>

               <hi>Meliantes</hi> having ſpoken thus, <hi>Orontes</hi> and ſome others of the more diſcreet of
the company, eaſily diſcovered by certain actions, that the extravagancies of theſe
new Shepherds were meerly perſonated and feign'd, and that they were conſiderate
perſons, who as well as <hi>Hircan,</hi> had a deſign to make ſport with <hi>Lyſis.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they diſſembled it, and referr'd it to another time, to be acquainted with

            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who was reſolv'd ever to contradict <hi>Lyſis,</hi> only to have ſomewhat
to diſpute on, and to make ſport with him, jeer'd at the Hiſtory of <hi>Polidor,</hi> and
that of <hi>Meliantes,</hi> though all the reſt ſeem'd to admire them. He ſaid they were
two ſummary examples out of the moſt impertinent <hi>Romances</hi> in the world; and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43725:126"/>
that the one was a fooliſh tale, ſuch as old wives tell children; and the other a Fable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
dreſs'd in the form of a true-relation, yet full of paſſages far from any probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
<hi>Polidor</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi> ſeem'd to be angry, and ſaid, that <hi>Clarimond</hi> was an
ignorant fellow, for to doubt of any thing they had related before <hi>Hircan,</hi> who
was ſo learned, that he knew the moſt ſecret things, and could convince them of
falſhood, if they were guilty of any ſuch thing. The Magcian thereupon confirm'd
what they had ſaid; and <hi>Lyſis,</hi> not able any longer to bear with the perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
of <hi>Clarimond,</hi> was implacably angry with him. Aſſure thy ſelf, ſaies he
to him, that if thou continue ſuch a life as thou haſt begun, I will chaſtiſe thee as
thou deſerveſt. Thou ſhalt not have the honor to write my hiſtory, thou ſhalt be
no longer the treaſurer of my imaginations. I have already caſt my eyes on <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liris,</hi>
whoſe humor is milde and complaiſant, and his diſcourſe moſt eloquent. He'll
be a better author then thou. Lets not do any thing haſtily, ſaies <hi>Hircan, Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
will be more diſcreet. He ſhall not henceforth miſemploy his engenuity.
Lets talk of ſome other things that preſent themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> at that held his peace, as ſeeming to put on more modeſty, and
<hi>Hircan</hi> continuing his diſcourſe, Gracious Shepherd, ſays he to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> we muſt
needs ſatisfie theſe two <hi>Perſian</hi> Knights, that have come ſo far to ſee us; and as
for <hi>Polidor,</hi> methinks ſince <hi>Rhodogina,</hi> hath requir'd of him but the wood of a
Shepherd that was chang'd into a Tree, or if you will, a bough of a tree that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
was a Shepherd. She will haply content her ſelf with that of a tree; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
a Shepherdeſs was ſometimes metamorphos'd, as there are enough in this
Countrey. You remember well that you have converſed with <hi>Hamadryads,</hi> ſome
one of them ſhall give us what we deſire, either by fair means or foul. It
comes into my minde, that a while ſince you complain'd to me of the incredulity
of ſome, who deny that a humane creature can be chang'd into a tree; I promis'd
you to bring them out of their error, and ſince there are ſome of them here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
I am content for their ſakes to do a miracle, and to ſhew you even in broad
day, a Divinity which never appears to the eyes of men, if my charms do not force
it. You will oblige us all infinitely, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> begin your enchantments when
you pleaſe, you never had a fairer occaſion to make uſe of them.</p>
            <p>Upon this <hi>Hircan</hi> riſes out of his place, and taking out of his pocket a High-Dutch
Book, he began to read a loud ten or twelve lines. The Ladies, who knew
he was no Magician, were yet ſomewhat afraid to hear him pronounce ſuch a ſort
of ſtrange words, which they all took for the names of Devils; and they were
ready to run away, had not <hi>Orontes</hi> reaſſur'd them, by whiſpering ſomewhat to
them. No body therefore ſtirr'd, except <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who for very fear began to take
his way. <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> ran after him, and brought him back to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
telling him he muſt ſtay and ſee if <hi>Hircan</hi> could make a <hi>Hamadryad</hi> appear,
ſince he was one of thoſe that did not believe there were any in the world. <hi>I</hi> will
not ſee any of thoſe creatures, reply'd he, <hi>I</hi> had rather grant my Maſter that there
are abundance in this very Country; and that <hi>I</hi> have ſeen but too many to my
ſorrow one night that <hi>I</hi> was in his company: But if you will force me to ſtay here
to ſee ſuch ſhe-devils, give me firſt leave to go ſomewhere and get ſome ſalt: for
<hi>I</hi> remember that my great Aunt talking to me one night by the fire ſide when <hi>I</hi>
was little, told me, how that a certain man, being gotten into an aſſembly of
Witches, where there was good chear enough, ask'd of thoſe that ſerved, for ſome
ſalt, ſeeing there was none, and that the feaſt ſeem'd to be imperfect without it;
beſides, you know well enough, that in ſome houſes, when the ſalt-ſeller is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among other neceſſary things at meal, they bid the men or maids take a ladder,
for to ſee what is wanting at the table. Now they brought to this man a ſalt-ſeller
full of the crum of bread; ſeeing which, he cry'd out, O my God! ſhall <hi>I</hi> have no
ſalt? which done, all that were preſent vaniſh'd. By this it is known, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
hate ſalt, and that they will not ſtay in the place where there is any, nor where
it is ſpoken of, becauſe they are ſpirits of diſcord, and that ſalt is an embleme of
concord, witneſs the proverb, which ſaies, that to know a man well, a man ſhould
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43725:126"/>
eat a buſhel of ſalt with him. Now there is no body can know ſo fraudulent a beaſt
as the Devil, for a man never eats any ſalt with him: Since I know 'tis a thing he
hates ſo much, I would have ſome to make him fly away; I preſently ſtart away
aſſoon as there is any mention of thoſe black Angels. <hi>Carmelin</hi> is ſo learned to day,
that a man cannot confute him, ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> he draws conſequences from every
thing; and yet I will not ſuffer him to go for any ſalt at preſent, nor ſeek for any
other ſubtilty that might make the <hi>Hamadryad</hi> vaniſh, ſince it is our deſire to ſee
her, and that there is no danger to ſtay. She'll come alone, and we are a great many
to reſiſt her, if ſhe were minded to do us any miſchief; and beſides, there's no ſuch
fear of Spirits in the day as in the night.</p>
            <p>I know not whether theſe reaſons prevail'd with <hi>Carmelin;</hi> but he was forc'd to
ſtay, for <hi>Philiris</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> held him faſt by the arms. <hi>Hircan</hi> in the mean time
reading his book, made ſome figures on the ground with a rod he had; and at
length he with a loud and cleer voice cries out, <hi>Fair Hamadryad! fair Cherry-tree
Nymph! I conjure thee by</hi> Horta <hi>Goddeſs of the Gardens, and by</hi> Pan <hi>God of the Fields,
immediately to appear here in a viſible and delightfull form, ſo that thou frighten
no body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every one then look'd about, not knowing what would happen; and <hi>Hircan</hi>
having iterated his conjuration three times, there iſſued a monſtrous ſhape of a
Woman out of the thickeſt part of the Thicket. She was coif'd with green moſs;
her face was nothing but flat bark, wherein there were holes, two for the eyes, and
one for the mouth, without any appearance of noſe. All her body was in the ſame
manner cover'd with barks of tree, which were diſpos'd like the ſcales on a fiſhes
back; ſo that this <hi>Hamadryad</hi> cauſing them by her frisking to knock and beat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
made no ſmall noiſe. By this ſtirring to and fro, a piece of bark broke off,
and <hi>Hircan</hi> very carefully taking it up, Be of good comfort, ſays he to <hi>Polidor;</hi>
ſee here the <hi>Hamadryad</hi> grants your deſire. This wood I eſteem very excellent;
for to obtain which I doubt not but your Miſtreſs hath made you undertake this
great journey: When ſhe hath it once, ſhe will make handles for knives with it,
or haply ſhe will ſtamp it for to make a drug of it for ſome ſecret receipt. Now you
that are preſent, conſider well the <hi>Hamadryad,</hi> and henceforth give credit to ſacred
myſteries.</p>
            <p>The noſeleſs <hi>Nymph</hi> danc'd all the while he ſaid this, and at laſt having taken a
turn about the company, ſhe went away the ſame way ſhe came, leaving all much
aſtoniſht at the ſubtilty of <hi>Hircan.</hi> It was a Servant-maid of the Nymph <hi>Lucida,</hi>
who was lately become the Shepherdeſs <hi>Amaryllis.</hi> The Magician had cauſed her
to be ſo diſguis'd, becauſe <hi>Lyſis</hi> had ſpoken to him of <hi>Clarimond's</hi> incredulity.
They had made her a Mask of Bark, and a Gown of a many pieces of the ſame ſtuffe
faſtened together; and <hi>Hircan</hi> having made ſign to ſome of his people to make
her be ready, ſhe came juſt in the nick.</p>
            <p>Here was <hi>Lyſis</hi> as prettily cheated as ever he was in his life; and the Nymph be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
retired, there was only one ſmall ſcruple that troubled his mind. I pray you tell
me one thing, ſays he to <hi>Hircan;</hi> why hath this <hi>Hamadryad</hi> appeared now with
ſuch a rough face and groſs body, whereas when I was a Tree I ſaw her every night
in a form fair and favourable enough. That fault is only to be imputed to your
eyes, replies <hi>Hircan;</hi> you were then a <hi>Demy-god</hi> of the Forreſts, but now you are
a man, and cannot ſee through the veils which cover the Deities. Now that none of
all that are here preſent may doubt of the greatneſs of my power, I will reſtore to
this Hamadryad her humane nature which ſhe ſometimes had; nor indeed is it the
will of Fate ſhe ſhould alwayes live within a tree. <hi>Hircan</hi> having ſaid this, read
ſomwhat in his book, and then call'd, <hi>O Hamadryad! I command thee to become a
Maid, and that immediately there appear</hi> Amaryllis<hi>'s Maid in her ordinary cloaths.</hi>
Behold her that ſometimes was an <hi>Hamadryad!</hi> cries out <hi>Lyſis;</hi> I know her well
enough again: Oh how great is the power of <hi>Hircan!</hi> You ſee, anſwers the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician,
that this <hi>Cherry-Nymph</hi> hath been very eaſie to transform; ſhe hath not
been ſo obſtinate as you, who put me to ſo much trouble, that I was forc'd to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:43725:127"/>
conjure the winds to come and bring you down. I was afraid to loſe any thing
of my felicity by change of form, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> you know it better then my
ſelf.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe was interrupted by the arrival of the Nymph, whom all called <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetta.</hi>
When ſhe was come neer <hi>Polidor,</hi> he fell on his knees before her and humbly
thank'd her for the wood ſhe had beſtowed on him. She knew not how to return
his complement, and was buſie to hearken to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who ask'd <hi>Hircan</hi> if there
were no means to reſtore their former ſhapes to the <hi>Cypreſs</hi> and the <hi>Apricock-Nymph.</hi>
He anſwer'd, that Fate had ordain'd it otherwiſe; but the reaſon was,
becauſe the Youth that plaid on the Violin was gone from him, and the other <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madryad</hi>
was gone with <hi>Synopa,</hi> whom the evening before ſhe waited for in the
coach, while that Nymph ſpoke to <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> under the name of <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
and when ſhe parted from them without bidding them farewell, to ſhew the
more indifferencie in the vexation ſhe was then in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> in this mean time was perpetually pulling his Maſter by the ſleeve,
which the other took no notice of; but at laſt being forc'd to turn his head, he
ask'd him what he would have. My maſter! ſays he to him, Methinks this <hi>Liſetta</hi>
is as good as another; tell me whether it will be convenient for me to fall in love
with her. Ha! <hi>inconſtant</hi> wretch, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I ſee thou wouldſt be perpetually
agitated among the divers ſighings of the Nymphs, like a leaf by the breathings of
the winds: Know that <hi>Fidelity</hi> honours men with eternal renown, and that
thou ought'ſt to love thy <hi>Parthenice</hi> to the death, if thou deſireſt to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> was much troubled at this anſwer, for he could not be content to have
a ſtone for his Miſtreſs, whoſe kiſſes were cold and rough. Yet had he not the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to reply, becauſe <hi>Philiris</hi> came and told him he muſt do what his maſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him. And in the mean time <hi>Lyſis</hi> viewing all the company one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
ſpoke to them to this purpoſe. As for <hi>Orontes, Florida,</hi> and <hi>Leonora,</hi> who
have already gone through the ardors of youth, they are not oblig'd to relate their
Loves; they are here only to judge of ours. As for <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Angelica,</hi> I know
ſomwhat of their affairs, <hi>Fontenay, Philiris, Polidor,</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi> have already
related their ſtories. I know well enough that of <hi>Liſetta,</hi> otherwiſe called the
<hi>Cherry-Nymph: Hircan's</hi> life is well known: <hi>Clarimond</hi> hath nothing worth the
telling us. Therefore there remains none but the Shepherdeſs <hi>Amaryllis</hi> that can
entertain the company: We muſt enrteat her to let us have her ſtory; I believe
there muſt be very brave things in it; for having the countenance like that of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cida,</hi>
divers beſides my ſelf both Gods and men might have taken her for that
Nymph. Now 'tis certain theſe miſtakes cauſe ſtrange adventures, as may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
if it be conſidered what misfortunes <hi>Lydamon</hi> ſuffer'd being taken for <hi>Lydias.</hi>
Fair <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> ſays <hi>Orontes,</hi> will you ſatisfie our deſires? I humbly beſeech you
and the reſt of this honorable company to excuſe me, reply'd ſhe; for I have made
a vow never to diſcover my Loves till they are more fortunate, and that I therein
effectuate my expectations. If my Shepherd ſhould turn his love from me, I ſhould
be too much troubled it ſhould be known I ever bore him any affection: There's
nothing more inſupportable then diſdain, and ſo much the more when it is publike.
We muſt not take away modeſty from women and maids, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> we ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
rob them of their honour. There are in all companies ſome diſcreet reſerv'd
perſons, who are willing to know the affairs of others, but will not diſcover their
own. That is practis'd in all good <hi>Romances,</hi> when the Authors endeavour pleaſure
by variety. I willingly excuſe <hi>Amaryllis</hi> for not relating her Loves to us; yet muſt
ſhe at the leaſt acquaint us with ſomwhat of her condition. In this I ſhall eaſily
ſtudy your ſatisfaction, ſays <hi>Amaryllis:</hi> I am a Gentlewoman of good birth, and
ally'd to <hi>Hircan;</hi> but this learned perſon being come to viſit me at my houſe which
is not far hence, hath perſwaded me to put on the habit of a Shepherdeſs to live
more contentedly. Your intentions are ſo good and ſo juſt, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

power for you. <hi>Amaryllis</hi> thank'd <hi>Lyſis</hi> for his courteſie, and was very glad to be
pardon'd the relating of her ſtory, for ſhe was not prepared for it; beſides, that
ſhe was ſomewhat high-conceited, and would not finde ſport for the other Ladies,
if they did not the like to her. She would very fain have had <hi>Angelica</hi> relate a
ſtory as well as ſhe; and in this renowned company, ſhe was much more reſerv'd,
then with <hi>Synopa,</hi> whom ſhe eſteemed not ſo much, when they perſonated the

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orontes</hi> perceiving ſhe had no minde to ſpeak any more: The beſt is yet to come,
ſays he; every one hath been commanded to relate his ſtory, and none hath ſpoken
to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who is a gallant perſon. He muſt not ſcape without telling us of his
noble adventures: You'll pardon me, ſaies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> for I ſee my Maſter will not
have me appear among honeſt people, no more then if <hi>I</hi> were ſome Renegado or
Rogue redeem'd from the Galleys. Thou wrongſt me to think ſo of me, ſaies
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> for in caſe thou maiſt be now aſhamed to ſpeak, I give thee free leave to do
it: But what will you have me tell you? replies <hi>Carmelin; I</hi> am not of theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
people that fall into Tranſes, who have already ſpoken: what Loves have
<hi>I</hi> to relate to you? 'Tis true, thou haſt not much to ſay, as to the love of <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> but take the ſtory higher, and relate to us thy whole life ſuch as
it is. And if thou haſt any knaviſh conceits, ſo much the better; for after ſo many
ſerious things as we have heard, it will not be amiſs to hear ſomewhat more face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and it will be as good as if we had a Mask after a <hi>Tragicomedy.</hi> Very well,
you take me then for ſome <hi>Hocus Pocus,</hi> ſaies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> do <hi>I</hi> look like one that
could make others laugh? Thou art already worthy to be laught at for ſaying ſo
(replies <hi>Lyſis)</hi> but in the worſt way; for thou art ignorant what a glory it is to play
the fool handſomely; and that if thou couldſt do it, thy jeſting were honorable:
Be not therefore angry, but acquaint us with thy life as thou pleaſeſt. If thou wilt
not fill it with Gallantry, let it be ſtor'd with Doctrine, and ſhew us that thou art
indeed ſo well qualifi'd, and of ſo good parts as thou art, and that thou oughtſt not
to be liſted among fools. <hi>Carmelin</hi> having upon that a little bethought himſelf of
what he ſhould ſay; thus began his ſtory, putting himſelf into a more chearful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
then before.</p>

and that my Auditors may the better comprehend all <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſay, <hi>I</hi> ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
ſuch order in my diſcourſes, that they ſhal be link'd together like pearls. That
<hi>I</hi> may ſpeak of my Father and Mother, before <hi>I</hi> ſpeak of their childe, <hi>I</hi> muſt tell
you, they were born and bred in <hi>Lyons;</hi> and that it was in the ſame fair City
they forg'd me; my Father was called Goodman <hi>Alleaume,</hi> and my Mother
Goodwife <hi>Paſquet,</hi> people without reproach, who ought neither God nor the
world any thing, and liv'd upon what they got by making of Canvas: They were
ſo well known in the City, that when they walk'd out on Sundays, a man could
hear nothing here and there, but Goodman <hi>Alleaume,</hi> and Goodwife <hi>Paſquet;</hi>
and they met not an Alehouſe where they took not their ſtage, though they drank
but a pinte. They received ſo many preſents from all parts, that when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
home, the belly was ever full, and the back loaden: Alas! they dyed
too ſoon for me, and <hi>I</hi> have only known their great proſperity but by hear-ſay.
At ſeven years of age was <hi>I</hi> an Orphan, and was forc'd to go and live with an
uncle of mine, who would have kept me with ayr, had it been poſſible. His
caitiff-life was ſuch a plague to me, that <hi>I</hi> ſoon had a deſire to put my ſelf to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
with ſome good Maſter that could afford me better chear. <hi>I</hi> was but eleven
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43725:128"/>
year old, and was not very tall, nor very ſtrong, and yet my uncle made a ſhift
to get me a ſervice: He plac'd me with a pretty little man, that liv'd upon his
rents; and one that would not keep a Lacquay any bigger then <hi>I,</hi> leſt he might
beat him. 'Twas a miracle how nature had been able to make a man out of ſo
little matter: nor indeed do <hi>I</hi> well know whether <hi>I</hi> may aſſure you it was one,
for he was not ſo tall as <hi>I</hi> was then.</p>
                        <p>It was reported in the Town, that his father, when his mother was half gone
with childe, was gone to travel; and that having not the wit to cauſe the work
to be finiſh'd by another, ſhe had brought forth an imperfect thing. For my
part, when I follow'd Mr. <hi>Taupin</hi> (that was his name) I was ſomtimes in much
fear leſt the wind might carry him away as a ſtraw; and if he were to croſs ſome
kennel, I had the ſame fear he might be drown'd, and that it were as hard a task
to look for him, as for pins. He had no great minde to go a foot, for the avoiding
of all theſe misfortunes; ſo that he caus'd a little coach to be made, drawn by
one little horſe, and driven by a Coachman proportionable, that all might be in
a conformity. When I was gotten up at the coach tail, our equipage was lookt
on with admiration; and there was a certain Citizen ſaid very pleaſantly, that
there was no need to go to Cabinets for Rarities, to ſee a ſhip cover'd with the
wing of a flye; or a box compleat in all its parts, that weigh'd not in all the
weight of a grain of Turky wheat; when that without any trouble <hi>Taupin</hi> was
to be ſeen, with his Coach, his Horſe, his Coach-man and his Lacquay, that
weigh'd but a Muſtard-ſeed. My maſter was not a little vex'd that he was ſo low,
and a man could never pleaſe him better, then to tell him that there were leſs then
he in the world: but thoſe that told him that lye, would have been ſomewhat
puzzled to tell him the place where they had ſeen any ſuch, if they meant not
your Puppets in Fairs; for as for your Princes Dwarfs, they were Gyants in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of him. Yet would he take ſome heart, when any body would tell him
that he was a man of a middle ſtature, and that all might ſo eſteem him: when
he walk'd the ſtreets, he would take it where it was higheſt; and if he were in a
Chamber, he ever got up on a ſtool.</p>
                        <p>To ſum up his miſery, the fates ordain'd he ſhould fall in Love with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and biggeſt woman in all <hi>Lyons,</hi> as if out of a hatred to littleneſs, he had
ſought for nothing but height, and would not marry one proportionate to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
leſt they might have gotten children too little. He had already been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to a woman of a middle ſtature, who had not carried her ſelf over honeſtly,
but he had taken order with her; for having known how that her private friend
came to her every night into an arbour, which was at the end of the garden, he
caus'd the floor of it, which was but of wood to be un-nail'd and looſen'd; ſo
that the firſt time they met there, they ſtirr'd ſo much about, that at laſt down
they fell, and were kill'd with their fall, cruſhing a poor Grey-hound, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to the houſe, and had follow'd the woman. He eaſily obtain'd his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and it was generally thought the whore and the knave were well ſerv'd, and
that all the hurt was done, was to the poor dog, who had not deſerv'd it. Though
the great woman, which <hi>Taupin</hi> was a ſuitor to, knew all this buſineſs, yet did
ſhe not fear the ſubtle deſigns of ſuch a husband, becauſe ſhe was a woman lived
as honeſtly as another. I know not whether it were againſt her will, but the
truth was, that in the memory of man it was not known ſhe was otherwiſe called
then Miſtreſs <hi>Radegonda:</hi> now this was her true name; and for thoſe baſe names,
which out of reſpect to the Ladies I ſhall not here mention, they had never
grated any skin off her ears. I know well enough, that there are ſome malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
people would perſwade us, that it was the worſt you could ſay to her to call
her by that name, being the moſt known name ſhe had, was that of an ill-liver;
ſo that another woman would have been angry to be called ſo, and that it were
not to be ſpoken, without reverence uſed before. However, let us not hearken
to calumny, and let us believe <hi>Radegonda</hi> had no hurt in her, but that ſhe was
ſuſpected.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="208" facs="tcp:43725:128"/>
As for <hi>Taupin,</hi> Love ſo blinded him, that he thought not of any thing but how
to get into his Miſtreſſes favour. He wore Galloches and a high-crown'd Hat,
that he might appear tall; but he muſt have had Stilts, had he been only to reach
the knees of his fair one. Nay, the day they were married, the Prieſt unwilling to
be at ſo much trouble as to caſt down his eyes towards him, and perceiving he
could not poſſibly reach the Brides hand unleſs he was rais'd higher, he was by his
order ſeated upon the Poor-mens Box. Every one ſaid, that <hi>Radegonda</hi> would
hide ſuch a Husband in her pocket; and that it was to be fear'd, leſt being
abed with her, ſhe might cruſh him between her nailes in ſtead of a
Flea.</p>
                        <p>For to find the Town more work to laugh at, it happened that the next day
after the wedding, <hi>Radegonda</hi> would bring all her houſhold ſtuff to her husbands
houſe; but her equipage was ſo much too big, as his was too little. There was a
great Couch, great Chairs, and a great Table; ſo that they were fain to enlarge
<hi>Taupin's</hi> doors for to bring them in: But that was not only requiſite as to that
end, but alſo to receive in <hi>Radegonda</hi> herſelf, who would have been forc'd to lie
in the ſtreet, had things continued as before. About this time a new deſign came
into <hi>Taupin's</hi> mind, which was, that he thought it ſufficient to be little only in
regard of his Body, without making himſelf ſo otherwiſe, as having but ſmall
houſholdſtuff: He therefore gave order to make every thing great, deſiring, as
he ſaid, to imitate <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who had been called the <hi>great,</hi>
though he were but little; and had us'd no other invention to make poſterity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he was of an high ſtature, but by leaving at the ends of his Conqueſts ſuch
Arms as ſhould ſerve a Gyant, as if they had been his own. <hi>Taupin</hi> accordingly
thenceforward made himſelf great Doublets, and great Breeches, and long Cloaks,
which he ſeldom wore, but laid them up in his Wardrobe for a Bravado, that
thoſe which ſaw them might think he was no ſmall perſon. He ſtudied nothing
ſo much as to ſeem rich, that ſo it might be ſaid he were ſome <hi>great</hi> man; and
out of a deſire not to be mentioned without ſome imagination of <hi>grandeur,</hi> he
thought it would not be amiſs to make his name up from two ſyllables to ſix or
ſeven, and to be call'd <hi>La Taupinicre</hi> inſtead of <hi>Taupin.</hi> For my part, I was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
pleas'd with this change, but in as much as I hoped there might alſo be
an increaſe in the houſe-keeping as well as in the other things; for a great Body,
ſuch as <hi>Radegonda's,</hi> doth neceſſarily require more meat to nouriſh it then a little
one, ſuch as her husbands; and thence did I propoſe to my ſelf that my belly might
fare better then it did before with my maſter, who when he fed alone caus'd but a
very ſmall matter to be provided, thinking his ſervants had been as ſmall feeders
as himſelf.</p>
                        <p>The advantage which beſides came to me by this marriage, was, that his wife
being a charitable woman, put me to learn to read and write, hoping to bring me
to ſome good. As for <hi>Taupin,</hi> I know not whether he had any deſire to put me
forward: But one thing I muſt ſay for him, he ever kept what he promis'd;
but let me explain my ſelf, I mean that if he promiſed you any thing, he kept it
ſo well that he would never give it you. And this is the reaſon I did not much
ſtick to anger him divers times together. One day above all, being in his Country-houſe,
and having ſent me to <hi>Lyons</hi> to buy ſome proviſions, he asked me at my
return, what they ſaid in the Town when I came out? They ſaid Evening-prayer,
Sir, ſaid I to him. He in ſtead of laughing at my ſimplicity, was moſt furiouſly
angry with me, ſaying I did nothing but abuſe him; and two dayes after he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd
me. I have underſtood ſince, that the greateſt reaſon he had to put me
away, was, that he ſaw I grew up daily, and that he grew not as well as I. I was
at that time couragious enough and ſtrong enough to deal with him, if he would
have beaten me. He thought it not beſt to keep ſuch naughty boys, 'twas enough
to have a naughty wife, who had now left off her good conditions, and did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſlight him. When he thought to cry, it ſeem'd to be a Chick that had
the pip; but <hi>Radegonda</hi> had a voice that fill'd his ears as if it had been the ſound
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43725:129"/>
of a bell. She by way of abuſe would ask him, Who's that below? or elſe ſhe
would ſay to him, How's this, that I hear you ſpeak, and cannot ſee you? I have
been told, that one day being in a fury, ſhe look'd for him all the houſe over for
to whip him: He ſometimes hid himſelf in a Rats neſt, and ſometimes in a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard;
but at laſt ſhifting from one place to another, he was found in a corner
of the Study which the Maid had forgotten to make clean, and there had he ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
himſelf in a great cobweb, that he was taken like a bird in the net. <hi>Rade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonda</hi>
came to him, and having under ſome pretence diſentangled him, ſhe brought
him to the beds-poſt, where one hair was enough to tie him; and when ſhe had
done, ſwept his buttocks. He would after that be ſeparated from her as to body
and goods, as I believe he is now, whether he be dead or alive.</p>
                        <p>When I parted from him, I went and liv'd with a Doctor of Phyſick, who
took me for to be his Groom, and to dreſs his Mule, and to follow him up and
down: But being one evening in the ſtable, methought the beaſt was not well.
I went and told my maſter that his mule had caught a cold, and had a cough; I
ask'd him what he thought fit I ſhould do to her. Put my night-cap on her head,
anſwer'd he. I preſently believ'd that the Doctor was ſo skilfull, that all that he
preſcribed muſt infallibly be done: beſides that, I thought it not amiſs to keep
the Beaſt warm. But her head being too big for the cap, I came and told my
maſter that his cap was too little, and that but one ear could get in. He was much
taken with the ſimplicity of my youth, which hath furniſhed him with ſtories to
divert his Patients; for he cured them as much by his merry Conceits, as by his
Receits. His Mule having afterwards been well dreſs'd by a Farrier, I wondred
to ſee that a Phyſitian could cure men, and not cure beaſts. The pleaſant humour
of him I ſerved, was indeed enough to make me love him. 'Twas he, who having
ſeen the urine of a ſick woman which was brought him by a Country-fellow, ask'd
him twice as much as he was wont to take. Why do you ask me ſo much, Mr.
Doctor? ſays the Country-man. Becauſe I have ſeen two urines, friend, anſwered
he; I have ſeen that of your wife, and that of your dog that hath juſt now piſs'd
againſt my carpet.</p>
                        <p>In as much as at that time I was of an humour jovial enough, I was much
pleas'd with theſe pleaſant rencontres, and I was ever very proud to learn ſome
good word. But all that did but ſatisfie the mind, and nor the body: I could eaſily
perceive a decay as to the good condition of the ſheath of my ſoul, and the mould
of my doublet grew leſs and leſs. The Doctor ſo peſter'd my head with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of Abſtinence, and he would needs have me content my ſelf with one meal a
day, ſo to rid my ſelf of my fatneſs, and be more nimble to run after him. Could
his Mule have ſpoken, ſhe would have complain'd of his niggardlineſs as well as I;
and as for her being ſick, it was purely for want of meat. The Doctor never went
into any houſe, but coming out he brought away ſome old piece of Mat for to
give his Mule, who ſometimes had not broke her faſt at five in the afternoon.
For my part, I ſo much pittied the languiſhing condition of the poor creature,
that I had not the heart to be her Governour any longer, ſince I had more will
then ability to do her any good. I thereupon left my Doctor; and having made
acquaintance with one of his Patients, I engag'd my ſelf in the honorable quality
of a <hi>Lacquay,</hi> as I was thought deſerving. This Patient was a Gentleman whoſe
name was <hi>Triſtan,</hi> one very eaſily ſerv'd: For being in a quartan Ague, which
had now ſtuck to him a year, he never went out of his chamber, and I had no
other work to do but to reach him the glaſs and the chamber-pot, and ſome other
neceſſaries. His converſation was very pleaſant: <hi>Melancholy</hi> and <hi>Solitude</hi> had
half made him an <hi>Ideot.</hi> He had gotten meaſures of Parchment, ſuch as Tailors
have, wherewith he meaſured himſelf every day all over his body, to ſee if the
ſwelling were nothing diminiſh'd. He had a meaſure for every toe, another for
each leg, another for each thigh, another for the waſte, another for the breaſt:
And when he found that any of thoſe parts grew leſs, he accordingly ſhortned his
meaſures. I was the faithfull guardian of thoſe meaſures, all which I lock'd up
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43725:129"/>
into a Drawer before him, taking an oath not to lengthen nor ſhorten them.</p>
                        <p>This humor found me a great deal of ſport; but I'll tell you of another, an
admirable one, which was of ſome advantage to me: <hi>Triſtan</hi> having no other
employment all day long, but to conſider what he found in his cloſe-ſtool, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to finde there ſometimes yellow matter, ſometimes green; ſometimes hard,
and ſometimes ſoft. He would needs know whether that proceeded from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
or no, and finding me as he thought ſufficiently in health, he reſolv'd
I ſhould eat of the ſame meat that he did, to ſee if I ſhould void the like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
To ſatisfie this humor, I had brought me in the morning a broath, which I
took at the ſame time he took his. We afterward together took a jelly made of
Knuckles and Marrow-bones, and then eat a boild Capon, and at night we had
ſome tame fowl roaſted; I never had made ſo good chear, the change of meat
put me into ſuch a looſeneſs the firſt day, that <hi>Triſtan</hi> was almoſt perſwaded that
his diet was not wholſome; but the ſecond day, having recovered my former
temper, and he on the contrary having done nothing but clear water, he deſpair'd
of imagining himſelf extreamly ſick. At laſt he bethought himſelf, that to make
better experience, I muſt be gotten into bed as well as be. There was preſently
made ready a pallet in his chamber for me, where I was to continue a long time;
and this <hi>I</hi> took no pleaſure in, but my felicity was now a burthen to me. I had
rather have been at liberty, then have made ſo good chear, I was ſo ſtrictly lookt
to, that though I ſhould have dyed for hunger or thirſt, yet would they not
give me any thing to eat or drink, but at my Maſters hours; and that if I were
to go to ſtool, it muſt be alſo near about the time that he went, and that in a
baſin that was at his beds feet, leſt in caſe I went aſide to do it, there might be
ſome falſification in the matter. He kept a memorial of the quantity and colour
of my ſtools and his own, and all he wanted, was to know the weight and the
taſte. But let that paſs: I ſhould not have car'd, if when he took gliſters, or any
phyſick, I had not alſo been oblig'd to take the ſame, to ſee the difference of
the operation; and to make a ſhort end of me, he had a deſign to have a diet
preſcrib'd, to ſee if the change of diet would change the diſpoſition. At certain
times I muſt have faſted as he did, to my great indignation: but at length, God
took compaſſion on us both, and my Maſter having recovered his health, gave
me leave to be well too, that I might wait on him on all occaſions: Yet there was
ſtill a relique of folly in his head, which did ſome injury to his feet. However, I
lived peaceably with him, and in all the precipitate journeys he put me upon. I
reſolutely attended him to <hi>Paris,</hi> where being adviſed by ſome wiſe and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
perſons, I begg'd of him that he would put me out to ſome Trade, whereby
I might get my living: in conſideration of my aſſiſtance when he was ſick, he
bound me Apprentice to a <hi>Joyner</hi> in that brave City, where I choſe rather to live,
then in my own. I was not now ſo fooliſh as when I was yong, when it being
propos'd to me to be bound to this or that, or the other Trade; I ſaid, I would
not be any of all thoſe, why do you not tell me of a great many others that
are better? It is better I were <hi>Apprentice</hi> to a <hi>Councellor</hi> or a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> I
thought that for to be a <hi>Judge</hi> or a <hi>Councellor,</hi> 'twas enough to be a <hi>Clerk</hi> or a
<hi>Serving-man;</hi> and to be a <hi>Lord</hi> or a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> there were no more then to be a
<hi>Lacquay:</hi> but <hi>I</hi> was now grown wiſer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Triſtan</hi> returning to <hi>Lyons,</hi> left me with the Maſter where he had placed me,
of whom I thought in a little time to have learned the Trade: and when he
ſometimes beat me, becauſe my work was not to his minde, <hi>I</hi> was ſo ingenious,
as to go and perſwade the Carriers of our Countrey, that if my Maſter was rough
to me, was becauſe it vexed him to ſee me already a better workman then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I</hi> will tell you one remarkable thing that hapned in his houſe: This Joyner was
a good big fellow, and none of the worſt faces, and had been choſen Corporal
of the Trained Bands in his quarter; and in that quality had appeared in ſeveral
muſters, and had with his company guarded one of the gates: This ſervice had
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43725:130"/>
made him ſo proud, that he imagined himſelf deſcended from one of the <hi>Nine
Worthies.</hi> When ever he had on the ſcarlet ſuit with gold lace, which he had made
him for his days of Triumph, I muſt have doubled the accuſtomed honors and
reſpects.</p>
                        <p>Having made acquaintance with a yong man, a Painter, he would needs be
drawn in that fine ſuit (which he was mightily taken with) with a Gorget, a
gray Hat on his head, with a great Feather, a Sword by his ſide, booted and
ſpurr'd, and having one hand on a little table, wherein there was to be a Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
and two Gantlets. The Painter having done this rare piece, brought it
to my Maſter, and received his money. There was no fault in it, but that the
colours had not luſtre enough. 'Tis true, the Painter told him, that when the
picture were dry, there were no more to do then to take a wet napkin and rub it,
and that would make it the faireſt thing in the world; but that he ſhould not put
himſelf to that trouble, unleſs he were to ſhew it to ſome people of good rank.
The Joyner believ'd it, and a while after, he invited ſeven or eight Citizens, kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk
and friends, to dine at his houſe, and as it was on purpoſe to ſhew them his
own fine picture. When they had quaff'd it to ſome purpoſe in the Parlour, where
they had ſtaid a while, becauſe of the coolneſs, he told the gueſts, that he would
ſhew them a picture he had caus'd to be drawn. He brought them up into his
chamber, where hung this Maſter-piece, which every one look'd very ſtrangely
on. They ſaw it was very poorly done, yet no body durſt ſay any thing, becauſe
of diſpleaſing him. But my Maſter thinking they eſteemed not that picture as they
ſhould, becauſe they ſaw not all the perfections of it, was reſolv'd to make uſe of
his ſecret to make it look fair. You ſhall preſently ſee what miracle there is in
this picture, ſaies he to the company; I'll make it look for otherwiſe. Boy, bring
hither a napkin, and a pail of water. I obeyed his command, and the Joyner
having wetted the cloath, rubb'd the picture all over: But O the ſtrange Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy!
Was not this one of the Metamorphoſis whereof the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis</hi> hath
ſo often ſpoken? inſtead of having a plume of feathers on the hat, there was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a huge pair of horns; inſtead of boots, a high pair of Countrey ſhoes; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a ſword, there was a compaſs; and upon the table a plank, and a ſmoothing
place, inſtead of the head-piece and gantlets. O the great ſcandal there was I
my Maſter having received ſuch an affront, before people that could not but laugh
at it, ſwore he would make the Painter repent it, and that without any more ado,
he would indict him, but he had left <hi>Paris,</hi> and was gone to travel. It was ſaid
he had in the firſt place drawn in oyl the picture of the horned Joyner, and that
afterwards he had made the Gentleman Joyner upon the other in diſtemper, ſo
that the water might eaſily wipe out this laſt draught. This Painter bore a ſpight
to my Maſter, becauſe that being once on the guard, he had ſuffer'd him to ſtand
ſentinel longer then his time; beſides, that he could not brook ſo great an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
as that a Joyner would be painted like a Gentleman. And this was the
reaſon of the cheat; but that which troubled my Maſter moſt, were the horns,
for to threaten him with thoſe, was to make him utterly deſpair, who had a yong
woman to his wife.</p>
                        <p>All the misfortune fell on my head, there being no other he could quarrel with:
he was angry that I had brought him the water ſo ſoon, and it was not enough to
excuſe me, to tell him I had done nothing but by his command. He never bore me
good will ſince; and yet when my time was out, I was a long while Jorneyman
with him, but I have nothiag to tell you as to that. I am only to acquaint you,
that at length a famous Doctor, in whoſe ſtudy I put up ſome ſhelves, taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of me, entertain'd me, for to make me a knowing and learned man. Since
that I ſerved a Stationer that made Almanacks, as you have already heard; and
now I am in ſervice with the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis,</hi> where if my condition be good, I
appeal to this honorable company. 'Tis well known, what I have done ſince I
came to this Countrey: ſo that I may here end my diſcourſe, and crave your
pardons if it have not pleas'd: As for example, if I have ſpoken of a buſineſs

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:43725:130"/>
too obſcene in the hiſtory of my Maſter <hi>Triſtan.</hi> I beſeech you not to to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for as the ſpeaking of oyl and greaſe doth not ſpot our cloathes, ſo I conceive
my words ſtink not.</p>
                     </div>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
            </q>
            <p>Aſſoon as <hi>Carmelin</hi> had given over ſpeaking, the whole company gave him a
thouſand commendations, ſwearing they never had heard a more pleaſant ſtory.
'Twas the opinion even of <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who preferred his eloquence before that of
<hi>Philiris</hi> and the other Shepherds, and told him there was nothing he could be tax'd
for, ſaving that he ly'd a little when he ſpoke of <hi>Taupin,</hi> whom he made ſo little
and weak, that he ſeem'd to relate a fable. Yet have I ſaid nothing of his ſtature
which divers of his acquaintance will not affirm, replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> if I have added
any thing, it hath been for the ornament of the diſcourſe: but if you had given me
time to prepare my ſelf, I had ſpoken more bravely, and would have diſplayed all
my ſcience, whereof I ſhould have ſcattered ſome hints up and down. 'Tis a ſad loſs
you have not done it, ſays <hi>Orontes,</hi> we have loſt much by the bargain, you muſt
make us amends ſome other time. He ſhall not fail, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> But there's none
of you all conſiders what he ſaid of the Joyners picture; He almoſt believes that
the change that hapned therein was a Metamorphoſis, like thoſe whereof I have
given ſo many examples. And to be ſerious, he were better be of that opinion, then
to go and imagine that the Painter put one colour on another. I do not believe
there can be any ſuch ſubtilty uſed. It will be a thing more noble, and withall more
probable, that all here preſent who are aſſured of the power of the Divinity, ſhould
imagine that the Picture of the Gentleman was metamorphos'd into that of a Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old,
by a celeſtial miracle, to puniſh a Knave that would appear what he was not.
To avoid quarrelling, I'll believe what you pleaſe, ſays <hi>Carmelin:</hi> Then, as for the
humour of this Corporal, was it not ſuch as it ſhould be, as I have already made
appear? He was not any thing liberall; and I forgot to tell you that he never
made any proviſion for his houſe, for he never bought neither bread nor wine, but
as much as would ſerve at the meal; becauſe (ſaid he) if he had a great Loaf, or a
Pipe of wine, and ſhould die and leave any thing behind, his heirs in their merry
humours would ſay, That there was a great Fool indeed, he hath taken the pains to
buy a deal of wine, and hath not drunk it up: We'll never do ſo. I ſee then, ſays
<hi>Orontes</hi> to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that you will ſtill remember ſome paſſages of your ſtory, which
you paſs'd by unmentioned. But where are our wits all this while, that we have
made you and the reſt ſpeak, and have forgotten the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis</hi> your Maſter,
as if he were not of this aſſembly? He, who is one of the moſt conſummate inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities
of the world, will entertain us with nothing but miracles; and we have no
need to importune the Shepherdeſs <hi>Charite</hi> to relate her ſtory, ſince there can be
but one between them both, and the adventures of the one depend on thoſe of
the other.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Orontes</hi> ſaid this, <hi>Charite</hi> thought that they were minded to abuſe her;
and being of a ſimple Cockney-humour, ſhe riſe out of her place, where ſhe was as
'twere on the rack, as being ſet neer her Miſtreſs, and ran home without any ſtop.
<hi>Lyſis</hi> would needs go after her; but <hi>Angelica</hi> told him, that for that time he muſt
let the diſdainfull Gentlewoman take her courſe, and that when ſhe came home
ſhe would chide her for it. Am I not the moſt miſerable of all the Lovers that the
Sun ever ſhone upon? replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> My Shepherheſs, becauſe ſhe ſees me going
to relate my ſtory, runs away: It is becauſe ſhe is afraid to underſtand my amorous
torments, and will not be oblig'd to ſuccour me by the prayers and perſwaſions of
this honourable company, as if there were not Gods that ſaw and knew all, and
would condemn her as guilty, though her crimes were hidden from men. But muſt
the abſence of <hi>Charite</hi> be a reaſon why we may not have your ſtory? ſays <hi>Leonora.</hi>
I have not the courage to tell you any thing, Madam, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but there is
a remedy for that. There's <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who hath every where taken Notes of my
actions paſt, and is reſolv'd to make a Book of my Loves; let him tell you what he
ſhall be able; I ſhall be very glad my ſelf to ſee in what manner he hath ſet himſelf
to work in it: Though I quarrell'd with him erewhile, he muſt forget what is paſt.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:43725:131"/>
I ſhall not relate much, ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> for I have not my papers here, which I
ſhould want very much, becauſe my memory is at this time very ſhort and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Yet I ſhall endeavour to come as neer as I can to what I have written.</p>
            <p>All being very attentive to what <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſhould ſay: He began
thus;</p>
            <p>UNder the happy Reign of the moſt invincible King of
the <hi>Flowerdeluces,</hi> there flouriſh'd at <hi>Paris</hi> the Son
of a Silkman, whoſe Vertue paralel'd the Antiquity of his race,
and whoſe Antiquity of race was far below his Riches.</p>
            <p>Let's have no more, I beſeech you, ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> if my Hiſtory be made in that
manner, it will not pleaſe me. When I hear that word of <hi>Flouriſhing,</hi> methinks
'tis the life of ſome <hi>Saint:</hi> That's the ſtyle of your <hi>Martyrologies;</hi> you do me a
greater honor then <hi>I</hi> deſerve. If you will have me make it better, replies <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
give me what directions I muſt obſerve. My hiſtory muſt begin in the middle,
(continued <hi>Lyſis)</hi> that's the way of all your famous <hi>Romances:</hi> A man muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by degrees into the body of the hiſtory, and not diſcover the deſign to the
Reader till the very laſt. It ſeems then you would have your ſtory compos'd like
that of <hi>Polixena,</hi> ſaies <hi>Clarimond.</hi> There are two or three have imitated that way,
and they have done very handſomly. I ſhould in the beginning have mention'd,
that when <hi>Charite</hi> had underſtood by <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s Letters, the extream affection he bore
to her, her minde was charg'd with ſundry maginations, or ſome ſuch thing. After
I had a while purſued the narration, I ſhould bring my Shepherd to <hi>Anſelme's,</hi>
to whom he ſhould relate his firſt adventures. That's your meaning, is it not?
but for my part, I am not of that opinion. 'Tis a pretty impertinence, to bring in
this man or that man, without telling the Reader who they were, or naming the
Countrey where the things related were done. Were not this to diſoblige an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
man, who through this means ſhould finde our relations ſo confuſed,
that he would make nothing of them. I know well enough, that he who firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
that method, made uſe of it in <hi>Chariclea;</hi> and having heard ſay, it was a
fine thing to begin a <hi>Romance</hi> in the middle, hath done what he could to begin his
his ſo; a way, which diſcovers leſs then any other the matter he was to treat; but
ſee how well he hath imitated the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Hiſtory, which ſo many others have
taken for their patern; that ſaies, <hi>That it began to dawn, when there met a ſort of
Robbers upon a mountain, near a certain mouth of the Nyle;</hi> and ſo of the reſt. Here
you have the <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>perſons,</hi> and the <hi>places</hi> ſet down; and <hi>Heliodorus</hi> would not
ſpeak to us like a mad man, relating things we ſhould not at all underſtand; as if
he ſhould ſay, <hi>Chariclea knew not as yet whether</hi> Theagenes <hi>were dead or alive, when
ſhe fell among a company of robbers.</hi> That would have been a fine put-off; would
it not have been thought, that this were the ſecond Book, and that there muſt
needs go ſomewhat before? But this Author is not ſo ſimple, and you ſee he
names not thoſe yong people whom the robbers met with, becauſe it would have
been an impertinency to have done it, if at the ſame time he had not alſo related a
good part of their life: ſo that to conclude, 'tis to be thought that there is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſome grace to begin a Romance in the middle, but it muſt be done with ſuch arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
that that middle may ſeem to be the true beginning. It muſt be confeſs'd that
thou explaineſt this buſineſs as handſomely as may be, ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and ſince I ſee
'tis thy principal deſign to beſtow all thy induſtry to adorn my hiſtory, I allow of
thy opinions, but thou muſt promiſe me to reform what thou haſt already done,
and to make <hi>Heliodorus</hi> thy preſident, ſince thou art of his opinion, as to what
concerns the order of the narration. For the preſent thou ſhalt ſay nothing of
me, nor needs it, ſince there are few here but know my ſeveral For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:43725:131"/>
All the preſence was troubled, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> had interrupted <hi>Clarimond,</hi> of whom
they expected a pleaſant relation; yet <hi>Hircan</hi> having ſent for ſome kinde of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
it was thought fit to make a little ceſſation of diſcourſe: but <hi>Lyſis</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to eat, there came into his minde the late flight of <hi>Charite,</hi> and the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
without <hi>command</hi> he had received from her a while before: That put him ſo
much out of humor, that he of a ſudden cry'd out, Muſt I enjoy my ſelf among
others, being ſo uncertain of the ſtate of my affairs? Alas! no, this is the ſeaſon
for me to weep, and to live in ſolitude. Farewell then, dear Company, I muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
my ſelf from you a little, that I may not diſturb your enjoyments.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid ſo, he went his way into the thicket, and would appear no more.
No body ran after him, and he that had leaſt maw to it was <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who was
grown very dry with telling his ſtory, and would gladly have drunk with the reſt.
Becauſe he was there, they ſaid no hurt of his Maſter, for they would give him no
occaſion to leave his ſervice, and there was only <hi>Clarimond</hi> preſum'd to tell him,
that his hiſtory was very remarkable, in that he ever had the happineſs to live with
<hi>Hypocondriakes,</hi> and that all his Maſters had <hi>Chambers to let</hi> in their heads; but
he was interrupted to make way for another diſcourſe, that there might be no ill
ſpoken of the abſent.</p>
            <p>The Sun being near ſetting, they all retir'd: Thoſe of <hi>Orontes's</hi> company went
with him, and the reſt with <hi>Hircan,</hi> who at his return found <hi>Lyſis</hi> in his Caſtle,
To live with <hi>Shepherds,</hi> ſuch as theſe are (ſaies <hi>Lyſis</hi> the firſt word) I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and will do it; but as for any enjoyments of my ſelf with <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Ladies,</hi>
its a thing <hi>I</hi> muſt diſclaim, while <hi>I</hi> continue unhappy as <hi>I</hi> am.</p>
            <p>A while after he ſupp'd with the reſt, without any appearance of mirth or ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and his minde was employ'd in making divers obſervations on the hiſtories he
had heard related. All being riſe from Table, <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who was a perſon of much
curioſity, goes into <hi>Hircans</hi> ſtudy, which by chance he found open; and being
come again in a maze. O the horrid cruelty (whiſper'd he to his Maſter) that <hi>I</hi>
have now ſeen! This Magician hath pluckt off the heads of ſome of his enemies, and
hath them in his ſtudy, to behold at his pleaſure: Come along with me, and ſay
nothing, I'll ſhew it you. <hi>Lyſis</hi> went ſoftly with him to the place, and <hi>Carmelin</hi>
having opened a Preſs, wherein the key had been left, ſhew'd his Maſter three or
four great blew periwigs, which had each a long beard. Mad fellow! ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
doſt thou not ſee here is not any head at all; and that there's nothing but hair,
where are the eyes, the noſe and the ears? I cry you mercy, replies <hi>Carmelin, I</hi> had
but a glance of it, and fear made me forget it preſently. But hear'ſt thou, ſayes
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> here is ſomewhat that's ſtrange; for methinks they are the ſame beards which
the <hi>Gods of the Waters</hi> had laſt time we ſaw them. That which methinks is an ell
and three quarters long, was the God <hi>Morin's.</hi> 'Tis the ſame and no other. <hi>I</hi> muſt
know the ſecret of this buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Having ſo ſaid, he and <hi>Carmelin</hi> went out of the ſtudy, and coming to <hi>Hircan;</hi>
Ha! ſaies he to him, what wonders have <hi>I</hi> ſeen, learned Magician. <hi>I</hi> have found
in thy ſtudy the periwigs of the <hi>Aquatick Divinities;</hi> how cameſt thou by them?
<hi>Hircan</hi> was here ſurſpris'd, for they were indeed the falſe periwigs which he and his
companions had on, when they perſonated the Gods of the waters. It troubled
him that he had been ſo careleſs as to leave his Preſs open; but he yet found a
means to cheat <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who himſelf gave him the occaſion. Thou muſt know, gentle
Shepherd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaies he to him, that having reſtor'd thee to the form thou now haſt, the
<hi>Aquatick Gods</hi> with whom thou didſt converſe when thou wert a tree, have ever
ſince bore me a grudge, for having depriv'd them of a converſation ſo pleaſant as
thine. ſo that by a treacherous plot they took me, and would have carried me into
a river and drown'd me: they had done it, had I not betaken me to my charms, by
the means whereof <hi>I</hi> made them as immoveable as rocks. Then thinking <hi>I</hi> could
not any way be better reveng'd of them, then by making them deformed, becauſe
'tis their greateſt deſire to be beloved of the Nymphs, <hi>I</hi> made them bald, as if
their hair had fallen away, and having rais'd up the skin a little above the ear, <hi>I</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:43725:132"/>
pull'd ſo long, that I brought away all their hair and beards. I afterward let them
go whither they pleas'd, to be the laughing-ſtock to all the rural Divinities. Ah!
Raſcals, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> how glad am I they are ſo ſerv'd! they'll never frighten
me no more with their blew horſe-hair beards. Peace thou, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> 'tis not
for us to ſpeak ill of the Gods, we are not ſo powerful as <hi>Hircan,</hi> for to reſiſt their
revenge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> after this, carried all the other Shepherds into his ſtudy, to ſee the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
beards; and they beheld them with a feign'd admiration and aſtoniſhment.
However, the Magician ſpake thus to the company:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have ſhewn you this, leſt it might have been too great grief to you, not to have ſeen
it as well as <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin,</hi> but had they not ſeen it by chance, never any
other eyes but my own had beheld it; for prophane perſons muſt not ſo much as enter
into this place: Wherefore I give you notice, that hence forward none preſume to ſet
foot into this place without my leave.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe ended, the Shepherds went out of the ſtudy; and <hi>Lyſis</hi> talking of
returning to his ordinary lodge, to look after his flock; they told him, his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
would have a care of them, and that he muſt accept the lodging that <hi>Hircan</hi>
proffer'd him. 'Tis true indeed, ſaies <hi>Philiris</hi> to him, that the ſheep you yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
kept, are troubled that they are depriv'd the conduct of ſo illuſtrious a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd;
and that as in the ancient Roman Republike, the earth brought forth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
when manur'd by a <hi>Triumphant</hi> Labourer; ſo that poor beaſts would extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thrive, had they the perpetual conduct of a Sheephook guided by the hand of ſo
rare a perſon as you are; but conſider with your ſelf, that you have another flock
to govern now. There is that of your amorous thoughts, which muſt be continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carried abroad to graze, nor muſt you carry them far from this place, which is
more proper for them, then the place whither you intend to go, becauſe you are
here near <hi>Charite.</hi> O God! how elegant art thou? ſaies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I wiſh it had coſt
me ſome money, ſo that I had had that conceipt. Why came it not into my minde
as well as into thine, ſince it wholly concerns me? I ſhall be troubled at it as long
as I live. To remedy my misfortune, Gentle <hi>Philiris, I</hi> pray thee beſtow on me
that rare and incomparable conceipt. It's a very common one, replies <hi>Philiris,</hi> yet
if you deſire it, it is at your ſervice, and all thoſe <hi>I</hi> ſhall have this moneth. <hi>I</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
thank thee for thy good will, ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but now <hi>I</hi> think on't, 'twere not
handſom at the preſent <hi>I</hi> ſhould pretend to that conceipt, for that were to be done
ſecretly. Here are ſo many that hear us, that when <hi>I</hi> ſhould make account <hi>I</hi> were
Maſter of ſome thing, and had made a fair purchaſe, <hi>I</hi> ſhould be amaz'd to finde
<hi>I</hi> had nothing at all; and that it would be reported, that all the ware in my ſhop
were thine. What do you mean by all this? ſaies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> are you of thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that <hi>Traffique</hi> in <hi>Conceipts?</hi> Have there been any to be ſold this year at St.
<hi>Germans Fair? I</hi> tell thee once more, that that is not publikely ſold, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi>
yet know, there is a trading in them all manner of ways: They are bought, they
are lent, and they are barter'd; and <hi>I</hi> may ſay, there is ſuch a one, who having
occaſion for ſome in a buſineſs of ſome haſte, as it may be for ſome Ball, that were
to be danc'd the next day, would be glad to take up, upon great intereſt, though
they were found on the Exchange. <hi>I</hi> know no reaſon, why the Scriveners cannot
give us directions where to finde any, it would be no mean gain to them. <hi>I</hi> am
of opinion, that ſometimes they may be alſo ſtollen, ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
author having had one taken away from him, as he paſs'd in the night over the
Newbridge with his bag of Conceipts under his arm; all his friends went one after
another to comfort him in his affliction. For my part, <hi>I</hi> muſt tell you, that when
any ſuch accident happens to me, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not need any of the <hi>Gapuchin</hi> fathers to
keep me from deſpair: <hi>I</hi> am ſo liberal of this merchandize of conceits, that <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:43725:132"/>
them on all the world: yet I modeſtly hit them in the teeth that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the theft. As for example, a certain Poet having ſtollen an Humour out of
my <hi>Banquet of the Gods,</hi> whereof a many Copies have been ſcattered abroad, I
could not, when I ſaw his Verſes, but ſay, that it was like ſomwhat in my Book.
'Twas anſwered, that however it were, the Poet ſays on his credit he hath ſtollen
nothing from you. He hath not indeed, ſaid I, he hath not ſtollen it; for take but
the pains to look into the <hi>Banquet of the Gods,</hi> and you will find it there yet.</p>
            <p>That's hugely good, that's hugely ſubtle, cries out <hi>Hircan;</hi> what a natural ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contre
it was! let me die if I ever heard the like, and if it be not beyond all <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus's
Apothegmes!</hi> The wittineſs of this reply proceeds from this, that commonly
things which are not ſtollen, are ſtill in their places: But contrary to the generall
maxim, if this conceit be in its right place, it's a ſign it was ſtollen. One might ſay
this were very ſtrange: But certainly a man that ſpeaks of the loſs of a conceit, by
another handſom conceit, is never to be pittied, for he invites the thieves to come
and ſteal from him again. I confeſs <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſpoke there unhappily enough, ſays
<hi>Lyſis;</hi> nor am I ſo unjuſt as not to believe he hath a good wit when he pleaſes,
and that 'tis his own fault if he quit not thoſe errors that poſſeſs him. All this
is good, ſays <hi>Philiris:</hi> but give me alſo leave to ſpeak to this point concerning the
Thieves of Conceits. I was a while ſince in a company, where one who pretended
to be an able Poet, told me that he endeavoured to be maſter of two things which
ſeldom met together, <hi>Youth</hi> and <hi>Continence.</hi> I thereupon calling to mind that I had
ſeen that conceit in a certain Author of the time, which I will call <hi>Saluſt,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him, Pardon me, Sir, thoſe two things are in <hi>Saluſt</hi> as well as you. You
ſee well, I would have rather ſaid that the ſame Conceit was in that other Author,
then either Continence or Youth. That was very covertly and ſubtilly ſpoken,
ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> I ſhould never be weary to hear ſuch excellent things. You muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſtay here, ſays <hi>Hircan,</hi> if you would enjoy the pleaſant converſation of thoſe
that are here. Are you now not fully perſwaded, Shepherd? ſays <hi>Philiris:</hi> there is
now no going hence, for it is too late: <hi>Night,</hi> who is now in her turn to come
into her <hi>Empire,</hi> hath brought with her an <hi>Army</hi> of thick <hi>Clouds,</hi> who have
<hi>defeated</hi> the <hi>Light:</hi> The great <hi>Winds</hi> which now blow, ſeem to be in the <hi>purſuit:</hi>
The God of <hi>Sleep</hi> with his Regiment of <hi>Dreams</hi> brings up the <hi>Rear;</hi> and though
it be arm'd with nothing but <hi>Poppies,</hi> yet doth it hope to overcome all the World.
What excellent imaginations are theſe! ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> I am charm'd with them, I
confeſs it; it ſhall be in this houſe that I will be overcome by ſleep. After he had
ſo ſaid, they aſſign'd him a bed by himſelf, and to <hi>Carmelin</hi> alſo, ſo that they
ſlept at their eaſe.</p>
            <p>They were no ſooner awake the next morning, but they were acquainted that
<hi>Orontes</hi> had ſent to invite them to dinner with the reſt of the Paſtoral aſſembly;
and there came into their chamber a Lacquay that did the meſſage. <hi>Lyſis</hi> knew not
whether he ſhould promiſe, or deny to go, becauſe he thought it not ſo convenient
to mind his enjoyments while <hi>Charite</hi> continued cruel towards him: But conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the other ſide, that to obtain her favour he muſt preſent himſelf to her,
he would not neglect the occaſion to go to the houſe where ſhe liv'd, as alſo that
he was loth to procure the ill will of his Fellow-ſhepherds in caſe he forſook their
company. He therefore promiſed the Lacquay that he would dine at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s;
and preſently after <hi>Hircan</hi> and the <hi>Shepherds</hi> came and fill'd up his chamber, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
with him about ſeveral things for to make themſelves ſport. There was
only <hi>Meliantes</hi> that ſeem'd to be ſad: He was gotten into a corner, where he
fetch'd ſuch deep ſighs, that they ſeemed to hear the bellows of a Forge. <hi>Carmelin</hi>
who was of a very pittifull nature, was the firſt took notice of it, and ſpoke thus
to him: Do not refuſe to tell me what thou aileſt, brave Shepherd! Is it ſome
ſtitch in the ſide, or the tooth-ach that makes thee groan; or is there ſome kinſman
or friend dead? If thou wilt tell me the cauſe of thy griefs, thou mayſt aſſure thy
ſelf thou haſt met with a man, who as to what concerns the ſuccouring of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
is as good as four. 'Tis very certain thou canſt aſſiſt me much, Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:43725:133"/>
and generous <hi>Carmelin!</hi> anſwers <hi>Meliantes:</hi> And therefore I muſt not
conceal from thee, that it is thy Maſter who is the cauſe of my grief. Alas!
Maſter, come hither, cries out <hi>Carmelin,</hi> will you ſuffer a poor miſerable man that
implores your aſſiſtance to languiſh? <hi>Lyſis</hi> hearing his voice, turn'd towards him;
and ſeeing that <hi>Meliantes</hi> did nothing but ſigh. Come hither, ſays he to him, what
ails thee Shepherd, that thou art not merry as well as the reſt? Alas! how will
you have a wretch as I am, of whom there is no regard had, to be merry? replies
<hi>Meliuntes.</hi> Others find aſſiſtance from you, but I cannot, though I need it ſo
much to bring my Miſtreſs out of captivity. I am forgotten, and there hath been
no ſpeech of aſſiſting me, ever ſince the relation of my Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>We are certainly to blame, ſays <hi>Hircan;</hi> and you <hi>Lyſis</hi> are not the leaſt guilty:
For having heard that the <hi>French Shepherd</hi> muſt deliver <hi>Pamphilia</hi> out of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
priſon, you ſhould have enquired whether it were not meant of you.
But I now aſſure you, that it is not to be thought of any Shepherd but your ſelf:
For by naming only the <hi>French Shepherd,</hi> as it were by way of excellence, 'tis not to
be queſtion'd but that it is meant of the moſt illuſtrious Shepherd in that Country.
But though that were not apparent as it is, yet by my deep knowledge I ſhould
certainly know it to be you, <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who by your incomparable force muſt reſtore
to <hi>Meliantes</hi> his <hi>Pamphilia.</hi> You will do that which the moſt invincible Knights
could not do, and your Arms ſhould bring down the pride of Monſters and
Devils.</p>
            <p>I have ever given you equal credit with the oracle of ſome God, ſacred Magician,
replied <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and yet at preſent I am to confeſs to you that I am in ſome doubt
whether you ſpeak the truth or no: For what appearance is there that I ſhould
do any great exploits in matter of Arms, and that I ſhould take in a Fortreſs gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon'd
with Monſters and Spirits? What likelihood is there, I ſay, that I ſhould
do theſe things, who know better what it is to conduct <hi>Sheep</hi> then <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and
who never intend to fight againſt any man, unleſs it be for to ſing the beſt and moſt
amorous Songs, or who ſhall give the ſweeteſt kiſſes?</p>
            <p>Let incredulity be convinc'd, <hi>(ſayes</hi> Hircan <hi>with the geſture of a man furious
and out of himſelf)</hi> there will come the day that the Dove ſhall be covered with the
feathers of an Eagle, and ſhall deſtroy the Falcons: The Country-mans Coat ſhall
be turn'd into a Corſlet; the ſtring whereby the Scrip hangs, into a Belt; and the
Sheephook into a Half-pike. Let thoſe that are wiſe credit things ſo true: And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
let <hi>Meliantes</hi> give over ſighing; for it will be for his ſake that theſe miracles
ſhall be done.</p>
            <p>Every one admired the prophecie of the Magician, and <hi>Lyſis</hi> among others was
much troubled to find out the true interpretation of it. He deſired it of <hi>Hircan;</hi>
but he told him, it was not yet time he ſhould know it, and that in the mean while
he might enjoy himſelf without thinking on it. All the Shepherds invited him,
thereupon, not to trouble his mind with any diſquiet imaginations; and he ſeeing
that <hi>Meliantes</hi> was no longer ſad, he thought he ſhould not be ſo neither, finding
withall in himſelf ſome great preſages of a future proſperity. <hi>Carmelin</hi> muſing on
what had paſt, imagined, that ſince his Maſter was deſign'd for to deliver out of
priſon <hi>Meliantes</hi>'s Miſtreſs, he muſt make great journies, and that haply he would
carry him with him, whereto he knew not whether he ſhould conſent or no: And
upon this incertainty of what was to come, he had many pretty imaginations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the life he ſhould lead in thoſe remote Countries; ſo that he could not
withhold ſaying to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> My maſter, do me one favour; Tell me, I pray, when
<hi>Meliantes</hi> is return'd into his Country, whether he will continue a Shepherd, and
whether you would do ſo too, in caſe you went thither with him. There's no
queſtion but we ſhould, replies <hi>Lyſis.</hi> But that is not all, replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> would
you alſo keep the Sheep of that Country? They have, it may be, other cuſtomes
then thoſe of <hi>France;</hi> and then I believe they bleat in a ſtrange language, which
you would not underſtand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:43725:133"/>
Every one laugh'd at <hi>Carmelins</hi> conceit: but his Maſter remonſtrated to him,
that the language of dumb Creatures was not more underſtood in one Country
then another; and that it was not given to any to underſtand it at all, except ſome
Magicians, whereof there was no great number. 'Twas a doubt whether <hi>Carmelin</hi>
had put this queſtion out of knavery, or ſimplicity: 'Twas a thing could not be
diſcovered, becauſe of the inequality of his Naturals, which ſometimes paſs'd from
ſubtilty to childiſhneſs. He had not continued much his diſcourſe, which was like
that before, but it being dinner-time, <hi>Hircan</hi> and his company went their way
cheerfully to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, taking along with them the Shepherdeſs <hi>Amaryllis</hi> and the
Maid <hi>Lyſetta.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Rontes</hi> deſirous to make a ſolemn feaſt for the moſt pleaſant
Shepherds that ever were in <hi>Brie,</hi> had prepar'd a long ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
upon one of the beds of his garden, that the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
might be the more <hi>Paſtoral.</hi> There was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
astoniſhment to ſee him and ſome of his houſe clad like
Shepherds: 'Twas ſuch a ſatisfaction to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that he went
and embrac'd them all with extream joy. But he was quite
tranſported, when he ſaw <hi>Florida, Leonora</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi>
appear in white, clad like Shepherdeſſes: He told them,
that he never fear'd to be miſerable, now that he had ſeen ſuch exquiſite perſons
chooſe that kinde of life which he had choſen himſelf: Yet could he not but break
off his Complement, for to ask where <hi>Charite</hi> was. We muſt not conceal the truth
from you, ſaies <hi>Angelica;</hi> your <hi>Charite</hi> was ſo proud, that ſhe would change nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
condition nor habit for all the entreaty we could make. Our perſwaſions ſhe
took no otherwiſe then importunities, till ſhe at laſt brought the buſineſs to a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel;
ſo that ſhe ſwore ſhe would not come with us one way nor other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> firmly believed this, though it were only an abuſe; for that <hi>Charite</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
not, 'twas that being but a ſervant, ſhe ſate not at table with her Miſtreſs.
Muſt this company then be imperfect? cry'd out the amorous Shepherd, will <hi>Charite</hi>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:43725:134"/>
never quit this ſevere humor which makes her ever keep at a diſtance from other
people?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Angelica</hi> perceiving that <hi>Lyſis</hi> began to be troubled, ſent for <hi>Charite,</hi> but ſhe
would by no means appear; and <hi>Liſetta,</hi> who was ſent for her, ſtaid with her. This
however hindred not, but that they were about ſitting down, when there comes
in two unknown Shepherds: They were two Gentlemen of <hi>Orontes</hi>'s acquaintance,
diſguis'd, who having ask'd for <hi>Lyſis,</hi> were ſhew'd him they look'd for. They very
courteouſly ſaluted him; and the more ancient of the two ſpoke thus to him:</p>
            <p>ILluſtrious Shspherd, We are ſent to you on the behalf of a many perſons of quality,
who having ſeen the Letter and Bill that you ſent to <hi>Paris,</hi> are extreamly deſirous
to come to you, for to learn that admirable art of being happy. There are above
two hundred, both yong men and maids upon reſolution to come hither, and put on Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
habit. As for our parts, we have already taken it, that we might not appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you in a habit disbecoming our Ambaſſage. The charge and Inſtructions laid on
us, is to preſent you with the ſervice of our Companions; and to aſſure you, that they
will wait on you aſſoon as they ſhall be aſſur'd of a reception from you, upon ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> terms
as they ſhall deſerve. They would have already been here themſelves, but that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
there was much abuſe in the world, it might haply be ſome Impoſtures had put
up the Bill, and not you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> being overjoy'd at this Legation; made this Anſwer to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors:</p>
            <p>GGentle Shepherds, I cannot diſapprove the intentions of our brave <hi>Pariſian</hi>
Shepherds, they have done well to ſend you hither, to ſee if it were true that
there was a Shepherd <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who had undertaken to reſtore the world to its former feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
You ſhall ſee what I know; and ſince you are come ſo ſeaſonably into this good
company, you ſhall taſte of our pleaſures, that you may give your Companions a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
account of what you finde.</p>
            <p>The Shepherd having ſaid this, every one fell a queſtioning the Ambaſſadors:
one ask'd them the names of the moſt famous Shepherds of <hi>Paris;</hi> another ask'd,
how they found out <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſince he had not lyen at <hi>Bertrands</hi> the night before. They
anſwered all the beſt they could; while in the mean time <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi>
came in. We only ſtaid for you, ſays <hi>Lyſis</hi> to them, but you come not ſo clad as
to pleaſe me: Will you be like that <hi>Clarimond?</hi> who is ſo obſtinate in what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,
that he would think it a diſhonor to be clad like a Shepherd? <hi>Anſelme</hi> and
<hi>Montenor</hi> perceiving that <hi>Orontes</hi> and divers others were cloath'd like Shepherds,
were ſorry they were not ſo too, that it might not be thought they ſhould have
made any diſparity in the Aſſembly: Yet they were more inquiſitive after the news
of the Ambaſſage which <hi>Lyſis</hi> had receiv'd, then how to excuſe themſelves; when
in the mean time one of theſe <hi>Pariſans,</hi> who would be called <hi>Silvian,</hi> hearing
<hi>Clarimond</hi> divers times named, ask'd him before all that were preſent; Are you
that <hi>Clarimond,</hi> whom I have heard ſo much ſpoken of in the <hi>City,</hi> and that hath
made a little book called the <hi>Banquet of the Gods,</hi> which is ſcattered up and down
in writing? I am without doubt the Author of that Book, replies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> I
will not diſown what I have done. Then I have a deal of news to tell you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<hi>Silvian:</hi> Know then, that <hi>The Banquet of the Gods,</hi> and ſome other pieces
of yours, which tax ſome Authors, hath rais'd you ſo many enemies, that I did
not think to finde you alive. One threatens to beat you, another to ſtab you; there
are ſome almoſt reſolv'd to ſell their beſt cloak, for money to give ſome Aſſaſſins;
and as for thoſe that have relation to the Court, they aſſure themſelves on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of their Maſters, and believe that by their means they ſhall abſolutely ruine
you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> neither knew <hi>Silvian,</hi> nor his companion <hi>Menelas,</hi> who ſwore, that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:43725:135"/>
all the other had ſaid was true. He knew not whether he ſhould believe them;
but whatever were in it, there being nothing in all this could move him; he made
this cold anſwer: You are come a great way to tell me things which I knew before:
I never queſtion'd, but what I had ſaid would procure me the hatred of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom I have ſpoken. A man need not be very cunning to gueſs at that; and
you are to know, that there's nothing hapned to me, which I deſired not. It's bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be hated of fools and impertinent people, then to be lov'd by them; for to
comply with them, a man muſt be like them, a thing I ſhall ſhun as much as I can
poſſible. And as for their menaces, they trouble me not, for I do not think my ſelf
leſs powerful then they; and ſuppoſe the worſt, though their hatred were mortal,
I know a way to appeaſe them; 'tis but to dine them once, or give them a glaſs of
good wine, and they are my intimate friends. Theſe are your mercenary Clerks, the
pillars of Taverns, Paraſites, and infamous Sycophants, who are for him that gives
them moſt. I would fain ſpeak with one of the Crew, before ſome ſuch brave people
as are here, you ſhould ſee how I would confound them. But tell me I pray, Have
they no deſire to turn Shepherds at the entreaty of <hi>Lyſis?</hi> They have read his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
very ſeriouſly, reply'd <hi>Silvian,</hi> but they ſaid it was your ſtyle; and laughing
at your invention, would not believe there were any Shepherd <hi>Lyſis</hi> in the world.
How am I ſlighted by thoſe that ſhould reſpect me? interrupts <hi>Lyſis;</hi> what do the
<hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Romanciſts,</hi> whoſe <hi>qualities</hi> I have ſtudied to advance, do they, I ſay neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
me? where could they have found a greater ſupport then I? with whom have
they obtained more credit? Ha! I renounce the protection of their perſons, though
I continue it towards their doctrines; and ſince <hi>Clarimond</hi> is reſolv'd to diſpute with
them, I freely permit him. I would they were already met, that we might have
the pleaſure of their controverſies. Be not angry, I pray, ſays <hi>Orontes</hi> to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſee
here my ſervants have brought in the meat, that will be cold, while you enter into
a heat.</p>
            <p>Having ſo ſaid, he made all waſh, and aſſigned every man his place, according
to the quality he pretended to, not forgetting the Seignior <hi>Carmelin. Lyſis</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to gain a good opinion with <hi>Silvian</hi> and <hi>Menelas,</hi> and to make them believe
the life he led was very pleaſant, had quitted much of what troubled him, and
thought by that means to win them, that ſo they might ſay nothing to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
that were diſadvantageous to him. He was not one of the laſt to ſet upon
<hi>Clarimond</hi> concerning the menaces of the Writers of the Time: and <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every one made it his buſineſs to bait him about it; made this reply, I muſt
needs confeſs I have not gotten much from our <hi>Poetlings,</hi> by telling them of their
Fopperies; for they are ſo obſtinate, that it is impoſſible for a man to make them
ſee the truth; and I have done nothing elſe but provoke a ſort of fools, with whom
there is no glory to conteſt. However, my labour is not loſt, ſince I have in their
tongues found that perpetual motion, which many Philoſophers have ſo much ſought
after, and have diſcovered, that in their brain might be found that emptineſs, which
was thought impoſſible in nature. Beſides, I have oblig'd a many honeſt people,
who are glad <hi>I</hi> have help'd them out of the errors whereinto theſe Idiots endeavor'd
to bring them. As for the fear they think to have put me in, by telling I have to do
with thoſe that have leſs to loſe then my ſelf, and affront all thoſe they hate; <hi>I</hi> anſwer
you, it is impoſſible for them to do me any hurt that way: for though they ſhould
catch me, <hi>I</hi> do not think it would be any more prejudice to my reputation, then if
one of the mad people that walk up and down in <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhould quarrel with me; and
as for their railing, I make as much account of it as the braying of an Aſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> would have ſpoken many other things to the contempt of his enemies;
but <hi>Orontes</hi> interrupted him, ſaying, There muſt be no more quarrelling, ſince it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the tranquility of their <hi>Paſtoral</hi> life.</p>
            <p>The company on that, began to give it ſelf over to mirth; and <hi>Lyſis</hi> being in a
deep conſideration of the variety of the meat, ſaid to <hi>Orontes, I</hi> think, O magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Shepherd, that thou deſireſt to ſatisfie our eyes, as well as our bellies: The
greateſt part of the fowl I ſee on the table, are methinks alive ſtill; <hi>I</hi> think they
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43725:135"/>
are readier to eat, then to be eaten. As for thoſe which are in ſawces, or in broths,
methinks they ſwim there, as they did in the ponds before; and as for the reſt,
which are otherwiſe diſpos'd, I finde them ſo lively, that its to be fear'd they'll fly
off the table. To hinder this from flying away, ſaies <hi>Orontes,</hi> cutting up one, there's
a wing, which I pluck off and preſent to you. <hi>Lyſis</hi> accepted it, but having obſerv'd
what pleas'd him better on another part of the Table, which he could not reach, I
am ſomewhat skill'd, ſaies he very confidently, in the flight of Birds; I have
learn'd the Profeſſion of the <hi>Roman Augurs.</hi> All theſe common ſowl that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, are unfortunate; but if thoſe I ſee there at ſome diſtance could paſs this
way, I ſhould make ſome good preſage for my affairs. The preſage will be worth
nothing if they are made to fly towards you, replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> for it muſt be chance,
and not of ſet purpoſe. It matters not for that, ſaies <hi>Orontes,</hi> let the Soothſayer do
as he pleaſe; and with theſe words he ſent <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſome of the choiſeſt, wondring at
the invention he had us'd to bring it about: but the amorous Shepherd ſhew'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo civil, that he refus'd it, ſaying he had ask'd in jeſt, and to try how they would
anſwer him; and beſides that, he was not ſo ill bred, as to ſhew himſelf a glutton
in ſo honorable an Aſſembly, he, whoſe principal nouriſhment were amorous ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</p>
            <p>After this, he freely fed on all, and in the mean time <hi>Orontes</hi> urg'd the Shepherds
to drink one to another: Shall we not drink to our Miſtreſſes? ſaies <hi>Philiris;</hi> ſhall
we not take ſo many glaſſes as there are letters in their names? I never fail drinking
to <hi>Charite's,</hi> though I ſay nothing, reply'd <hi>Lyſis;</hi> thy invention is not new to me. I
have already drunk thrice to the three firſt Letters of the faireſt word that can be
pronounc'd. No body hath ſeen it, replies <hi>Philiris;</hi> 'twas ſecretly done: Begin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the game again. Thou doſt not underſtand the ſubtilty of it, ſayes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> Knowing
that if I began again, I ſhould commit a great fault, becauſe the glaſſes I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
drunk, ſhould be counted, and being added to thoſe I ſhould drink with thee,
would amount to a greater number then the letters of the name of <hi>Charite:</hi> So
that <hi>I</hi> ſhould trangreſs the vow I long ſince made to do all things in the number of
ſeven.</p>
            <p>So the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis</hi> made it appear, that nothing could make him quit his
former deſigns; ſo that the reſt making a party by themſelves, ſuffer'd him to do
what he pleas'd. As for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> every one drank to him, and he was of ſo good
an humour, that he ſwore he would make all thoſe lyars, who ſaid he had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and that he would do it to all the world. He had ply'd it ſo well, that when
he was riſen from the table, he ſtagger'd at every ſtep; and <hi>I</hi> aſſure you there were
others that were not much behinde him, whether they were drunk indeed, or that
they feign'd it. <hi>Lyſis</hi> began to laugh, having a long time obſerv'd how they ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd,
and juſtled one another. Theſe are good youths, ſaies he, they are not content
to be poſſeſt with two furies, that is to ſay, that of <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> but having
read there was a third, which is that of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> they would needs be poſſeſſed of
that too. <hi>I</hi> ſhall not think it much amiſs, ſo that they commit not over great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolences.
<hi>Bacchus</hi> is an amiable, and a pleaſant God, and requires our devotions
at leaſt once a moneth, when a man hath his friends about him. <hi>I</hi> ſhall by no means
forbid any man to converſe with him, ſince <hi>I</hi> finde that the ancient Poetry is as ful of
good-fellowſhip as loves; and that <hi>I</hi> know by experience, that there are ſome Poets
who can never compoſe any thing, but when they are drunk. Gentle Shepherds,
weep now for having drunk too much, to morrow you will weep for your loves,
that your lives may be diverſifi'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſpoke this out of his ordinary judgement; for though he had taken his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
cups, he had not drunk much at a time, as being of thoſe that are not much
given to wine. <hi>Clarimond</hi> was not well pleas'd to ſee him ſo reſerv'd and temperate;
for he would gladly have known what extravagancy he would have committed, if
there had been a mixture of drunkenneſs with his Extravagance. As for <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
he had eaten and drunk ſo much, that he went a little aſide and return'd it; which
his Maſter perceiving: Ah! villain, ſaies he to him, muſt thou offend ſuch a preſence
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:43725:136"/>
with thy beaſtlineſs? I allow thee to be merry and to drink, but I would not have
thee forget the quality of a man and a Shepherd, and participate in brutality with
the beaſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orontes,</hi> who heard this diſcourſe, came and ſaid to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> You are to blame to
find fault with ſuch an honeſt man: Conſider, if that which he caſts out be a thing
ſo foul, that it is a loathing to you to ſee it, he hath reaſon to disburthen himſelf of
it, for how do you think he could ſuffer it on his ſtomack? What thou ſayſt ſalves
the matter well for the preſent, reply'd <hi>Lyſis:</hi> but why had he before ſo little
diſcretion as to ſwallow down what ſhould hurt him? I will allow him to be drunk
ſo far as to be frolick, but not to be ſtupid. I am not drunk, my ſweet maſter,
ſays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> 'twas only my drinking out of a great glaſs, that hath made me
ſo ſick at the heart, that I was fain to vomit as you ſee. This diſcourſe was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by three or four hickocks, which brought out with them wine and broth,
which a dog of <hi>Orontes</hi>'s did aſſoon lick up, lifting up his noſe every foot to ſee if
there were any more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> approv'd the ſpecious reaſons of his faithfull <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and ſo return'd to
the reſt of the company to know what they were reſolved to do. They had notice
of a Wedding hard by, ſo that they reſolved to go thither to paſs away the time.
At the end of <hi>Orontes</hi>'s houſe there was a Hamlet of five or ſix houſes, in one
whereof there was a Country-Laſs that married a Husband-man of the next village.
They had brought from <hi>Coulommiers</hi> the great Muſick-Company, which conſiſted
of a Baſe, a Tenor, and a Kit which ſerved inſtead of a Violin. The gueſts having
already din'd, had paid their Reckoning, and made their Preſents according to the
cuſtom: whereupon the Muſick began to cheer up the Company, and there was
not any ſo wretched Lobcock but took his Sweetheart into the dance. Our cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Shepherds being come thither, would not ſtand out; but ruſhing in among
the Country-people, they danc'd together, where every one ſhew'd what he could
do, though there were ſome whoſe paces were very circumflexe, and whoſe capers
were not above half an inch from the ground. The Peaſants ſeeing ſo many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of quality in ſuch ridiculous poſtures, and in ſuch extraordinary habits as they
had on, thought they did it out of ſome deſign to abuſe them, ſo that they were
not well pleas'd at it.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Orontes</hi> was weary of dancing, and the reſt too, he would needs have them
to ſome of your childiſh ſports. Shall we go to <hi>Blind Cupid?</hi> ſays <hi>Lyſis</hi> to the
company; it is a very <hi>Paſtoral</hi> ſport; it's uſed by <hi>Amaryllis</hi> and her companions in
the <hi>Faithfull Shepherd,</hi> and methinks 'tis much like that which all the Children
know, which they call <hi>Blind-man-buff.</hi> But to be more ingenious yet, I ſhould
deſire we might not fix on any ſport, but that which Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> makes the
Shepherds of <hi>Aacadia</hi> recreate themſelves with, in that long Proeme which is as I
take it in the firſt Tome of his incomparable Work; but it is ſo ſubtle, that nobody
can make any thing of it.</p>
            <p>Every one gave his voice for <hi>Blind Cupid;</hi> and being retired a little diſtance
from the place where the Wedding was, there was none but voted <hi>Carmelin</hi> to be
the <hi>Cupid.</hi> They blinded him with a foul napkin; and every one being gone out
of his way, <hi>Lyſis</hi> taught the reſt the words of the game. But inſtead of courteous
treating the poor <hi>Cupid,</hi> they pelted him with clods of earth, which fell on him
of all ſides ſo unmercifully, that he was forc'd to unblind himſelf and run away,
ſwearing that as long as he liv'd he would never meddle with ſuch a ſport. Having
taken ſanctuary among the Country-people, he thought better to be merry with
them; and having perceiv'd <hi>Liſetta,</hi> whoſe fair eye had deeply wounded him, he
would needs dance a Coranto with her. The Gentlemen-Shepherds return'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a while to make up their ſport with him: They ſaw that <hi>Carmelin</hi> was not any
thing ſick, and that he danc'd it ſo well, as would have bred a mortal jealouſie in
the moſt illuſtrious Dancers of all the villages thereabouts. <hi>Leonora's</hi> Kitchin-maid
chanced alſo to be in the place; and <hi>Lyſis</hi> having ſpoken to her, made account to
know of her a many particulars concerning his Miſtreſs. It came into his mind, that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:43725:136"/>
when he was let blood, it had ſeem'd to him and <hi>Clarimond</hi> too, that there might be
ſeen in his blood the Figure of <hi>Charite.</hi> He would have gladly known, if in like
manner there was not ſeen his Figure in hers, or whether there appeared the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of ſome other Lover. He thought that by that means he might diſcover
whether he were belov'd or no. He therefore put the queſtion to the Maid, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhe had been preſent when <hi>Charite</hi> was let blood three or four dayes before.
She told him he was an idle jeering Companion; that ſhe underſtood nothing of
his fine talk; and that for his full ſatisfaction, ſhe could only tell him, that no body
employ'd himſelf ſo vainly as to obſerve <hi>Charite's</hi> blood, and that it was caſt into
a ſink the very day it was let. Ah! what imprudence was that, and what impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
both together! cry'd out the Shepherd: Ought not ſo precious a thing to
be preſerved? What would you have had done with it, replies the maid, would
you have had puddings made of it? Do not ſcoff, fair one! replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> It trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
me that <hi>Carmelin</hi> did caſt away my blood, for it was as worthy to be preſerved,
ſince it bore the image of my Miſtreſs. You may tell us of this another time, ſayes
the Maid, but for what is done there is no remedy.</p>
            <p>While this diſcourſe paſſed between the Shepherd and the Maid, <hi>Carmelin</hi> was
not ſatisfied to have drawn <hi>Liſetta</hi> once into the dance, but he muſt have her twice
more: And there coming afterward a young Country-fellow to take her in, he
thruſt him back, and diſdainfully told him that ſhe was not meat for his birds. This
Clown perceiving himſelf wounded in his honour, gave <hi>Carmelin</hi> a good blow on
the breaſt, and was ready to ſecond it, when <hi>Lyſis</hi> coming between them cry'd out,
Hold, hold, my Lads! will you have this Wedding ſo full of butchery as that of
<hi>Andromedes,</hi> wherein <hi>Perſeus</hi> transform'd the raſh <hi>Phineas</hi> into a ſtone, after he had
kill'd all his companions? Would you renew the marriage of <hi>Hippodamia,</hi> where
the <hi>Centaures</hi> fought againſt the <hi>Lapithae?</hi> I here interpoſe my Authority; give
over theſe outrages, I pray.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe words, all the Clowns came about <hi>Carmelin,</hi> ready to
revenge their companion. But <hi>Lyſis</hi> raiſing his voice, continued thus: Vile rout!
infamous Clowns! dare you commit theſe impudences before me who am the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Shepherd in the world, and before <hi>Hircan</hi> who is the moſt knowing Magician
of this age? Do you not fear our diſpleaſure? The Country-people of <hi>Lycia,</hi>
for having offended <hi>Latona,</hi> were turn'd into <hi>Frogs.</hi> Learn to be modeſt by the
example of your Predeceſſors; for we could as eaſily metamorphoſe you into poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous
toads, or into hiſſing ſerpents.</p>
            <p>While he thus cry'd out, <hi>Orontes</hi> went and roughly thruſt back the Clowns, and
made them retire. Yet did they not give over their deſign to be reveng'd, when
they could, of <hi>Carmelin</hi> and his maſter, who had done them ſuch injury. The tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
being in appearance appeas'd, the Muſick, who were fled leſt in the charge
their Inſtruments might have been broken, came back and cheer'd up the company
with the merry <hi>Jigs</hi> of <hi>Poicton.</hi> See now the diſorder is over, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I am glad
of it, for it might have been of ill example, and a very unlucky preſage for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
couple. This muſick cheers me up; 'tis to be conceived they are ſent for to
weddings, to put us in mind that the husband and wife ought to live in perpetual
<hi>concord,</hi> and obſerve ſuch a harmony as that of muſical Inſtruments. They are alſo
to acquaint the gueſts that they ſhould live in good intelligence one with another,
at leaſt for that day, to the credit of thoſe that have invited them.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe ended, <hi>Lyſis</hi> will'd his company to leave the Clowns dance, and
not meddle with them any more. And having call'd <hi>Silvian</hi> and <hi>Menelas</hi> to him,
he thus ſpake to them. You are ſo diſcreet, <hi>my Lords,</hi> that I cannot believe you will
leave us with any diſſatisfaction: An ignorant man would doubt it, that ſhould
have ſeen the late tumult; nay there are thoſe that would think, that after a thing
ſo ſtrange and blameworthy, you would acquaint your Compatriots that I cauſe
not ſuch order to be obſerved in this Country as I boaſted I would. But I aſſure
my ſelf that you well conſider that our Government is not yet fully eſtabliſhed;
and that having not men enough under me, I am not able to drive away the ſeditious.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:43725:137"/>
Beſides you are to obſerve, that thoſe who are guilty of the diſorder, are not famous
Shepherds as you and I; they are infamous Churls, that underſtand nothing of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
or honour, and never read any book. To the end that no man be henceforth
deceiv'd in them, and that ſeeing them with ſheep might think they were of us, I
ordain they ſhall not be called by the ſame name as we, but they ſhall be call'd
<hi>Feeders,</hi> whereas we'll be call'd <hi>Shepherds</hi> or <hi>Paſtors: Carmelin</hi> himſelf ſhall be of
their degree, till he have made it appear by ſome ſignal action that he deſerves to
be of ours.</p>
            <p>You have taken very good order, replies <hi>Silvian;</hi> and yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without all this, I
aſſure you we ſhould ſtill believe we had not found any thing that might prejudice
your reputation. However you would much oblige us, if you would briefly tell us
what the principal things are which you would do to reſtore the Golden age. We
are not here in a Hall fit to give audience to Ambaſſadors, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> But yet
I ſhall make no ſcruple to give you ſatisfaction, becauſe it is a pleaſure to me to ſhew
how free I am, and how little I have of the pomp of Kings. You are then to know,
that though from the Golden age men paſs'd into the Silver one, thence to the
Brazen one, and ſo to that of Iron, yet I will bring you back to the former with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
theſe degrees; nay, you ſhall not be troubled with the Silver age to go into
the Golden one, that is to ſay, it ſhall coſt you nothing. As concerning Divine
Worſhip, which is the firſt conſiderable, you are to know that we will honour all
the Divinities which the Antients did adore: But beſides that, as I make it my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
to add to antient things in caſe they be not compleat, I will bring into repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ſome modern Divinities; as for example, my will is there ſhould be a <hi>God</hi>
of <hi>Romances,</hi> a thing never enter'd the imagination of any <hi>Poet,</hi> though they create
Gods at their pleaſure. This God ſhall have his Temple in ſome Grot, where in
honour of him ſhall be ſung every day choice hymns, and all the <hi>bad Romances</hi>
ſhall be burnt on his Altar in ſacrifice, whereas the <hi>good</hi> ones ſhall be preſerv'd in
the ſanctuary. This firſt year I will be the Prieſt of the place, and will alſo take
the title of <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>French Shepherds,</hi> as being honour'd and obey'd by all.
But that all may pretend to ſoveraignty, and that there may be a ſharing of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
to prevent a Monarchical government, all the other Shepherds ſhall be <hi>Prieſts</hi>
and <hi>Princes</hi> from year to year in their turns. That's an excellent propoſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
(ſays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who heard all this diſcourſe) but if you purſue it, I fear me
you will be declar'd a Rebel by the King, who will not ſuffer you to quit your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and eſtabliſh a Republike within his Kingdom. You had better do as <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard</hi>
did, who in a Poem of his dedicated to <hi>Muretus,</hi> invites him and a legion of
other Poets, whom he names, to leave <hi>France</hi> which was troubled with civil wars,
and to go for the <hi>Fortunate Iſlands,</hi> there merrily to ſpend the remainder of their
lives: 'Tis one of the beſt fancies he ever had. I grant it, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> but yet
I have no mind to plant Colonies in remote Countries, where I know not whether
I ſhould ſafely arrive, beſides that it is only for <hi>Theutons</hi> and <hi>Cimbrians</hi> to ſeek
out any other habitations then thoſe of their fathers. The King will not proſecute
us as Traitors, for we will deprive him of nothing of his rights, and our power
ſhall reach no further then our ſelves. Your meaning is, that your government will
be like that of a King at <hi>Twelf-tide,</hi> or among School-boys, ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> if it
be ſo, I believe you may be tolerated in <hi>France.</hi> Thou mightſt have uſed fitter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons,
ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> but ſince there were never any end, if a man ſhould teach thee
all thou art ignorant of, I return to my former diſcourſe to ſatisfie my Lords the
Ambaſſadors. They are further to know, that beſides the care I ſhall take of divers
ſacrifices, and of a many other things. I will eſtabliſh a <hi>Poetical</hi> and <hi>Amorous Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,</hi>
as I have already deſign'd. Upon certain ſolemn dayes there ſhall be <hi>Love-queſtions</hi>
propoſed, much like thoſe I ſometime ſaw at <hi>Paris.</hi> Some Schollers ſhall
maintain them, others ſhall diſpute againſt them, both for the exerciſe of their
parts, and that truth may iſſue out of theſe altercations, as a ſpark of fire from the
colliſion of two flints.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:43725:137"/>
As for example, there ſhall be thoſe that ſhall in the
firſt place maintain, that, <q>
                  <hi>Abſence bring more ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Lovers then preſence.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, That</hi> it is better to ſee a Wench that one loves
dead, if one be reciprocally loved by her, then to ſee her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to another, and not be loved by her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the affection is greater after enjoyment then
before it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the fourth place, That,</hi> it is better for one to enjoy his
Shepherdeſs twice a week, with all the torments and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets
in the world, then to enjoy her fifteen days together in
one year, with all freedom, and not under go any hardſhip to
have her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the fifth place, That</hi> the remembrance of any thing that
is good, is a greater pleaſure then the good ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the ſixth place, That</hi> it were better for one never to
enjoy his Mistreſs, then to do it on an infallible condition,
that another ſhould have the enjoyment of her alſo, though he
were your deareſt friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in the ſeventh place, That</hi> the jealouſie of a Lover,
who never knew any enjoyment, is ſtronger and more violent
then that of a husband who enjoys every day.</p>
            </q>
            <p>A man may advance a many other as ſubtil propoſitions, and by ſuch diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſhall every one be fully inſtructed. On the days when this diverſion is not to
be had, the time ſhall be ſpent in ſinging, making of verſes, dancing, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Paſtoral ſports. This indeed is a very pleaſant, and much deſirable way of
life, ſaies <hi>Menelas,</hi> but ſince we ſhall have no offices or profeſſions among us, it is
moſt certain we ſhall get nothing; and if ſo, I know not how the family ſhall be
maintain'd, and the taxes paid. Our condition is noble and free, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exempted from all impoſitions, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> trouble not your ſelf as to that;
As for matter of livelihood, we ſhall want nothing: There is no bird ſo inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but findes his dinner, though he have neither ſtore-houſe nor fee-farm rent;
heaven provides for all the creatures in the world. 'Tis very certain, you cannot
want your entertainment, ſince you can reſtore the golden age, ſays <hi>Clarimond.</hi> In
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:43725:138"/>
that firſt age of the world, all the rivers were not milk, and all the trees bore not
fruit of <hi>Lotos,</hi> as many fools have imagin'd. Nature brought forth nothing but what
it does now, and that not ſo abundantly then, becauſe nothing was advanc'd by
cultivation, but men were content with what they could finde; and to make a true
relation of the felicity of that time, it muſt be confeſs'd, that men fed on Acorns,
as well as the ſwine; and drank out of the river, as all other creatures did. They
had no coverture but their skin, or haply ſome garment of leaves: The earth
was their Table and their Bed, the graſs their Carpet, the buſhes their Curtains,
and the caves their retreats: And thus it is moſt certain the firſt men lived; ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
a thing it is to conceive they liv'd in a golden Age, ſince gold was not
yet diſcover'd. Let it be conſidered, whether their life was not rather brutiſh then
humane, and if they are not mad men which grieve for it, and that deſpiſe ours,
whereof the ornament and civility cannot be over commended. You have much
reaſon to believe you will eaſily finde your livelihood, if you regulate your ſelf to
that ancient manner of life; for indeed, <hi>Lyſis,</hi> you ſhall not be deny'd ſuch a nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as we allow beaſts; but what you do, is, as if the Law-makers were not yet
come into the world, to make men leave the forreſts and rocks, and to perſwade
them to live in community in Cities. I believe there will be very few ſhall envy you;
for my part, I ſhall only bemoan you, to ſee you become ſavage: for if you will
needs reſtore your golden age, you muſt go naked as an <hi>American,</hi> and at the beſt
be no better hous'd, then with a few turfs, as your beggars on the high-way, who
ſell wands to Travellers. I do not believe the ancients entertain'd themſelves as
thou ſayeſt, reply'd <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but though it were ſo, know, that I will imitate onely
what is good in their life. I intend alſo, to joyn to it the happineſs of this laſt age,
wherein all the curioſities in the world have been invented. It ſhall ſuffice me to
live in the innocency and freedom of the firſt age, and it may be thou wilt be of my
opinion, when thou ſhalt have taſted the pleaſures which I have imagin'd; we ſhall
not envy any, nor be envied by any. Of all the <hi>paſſions,</hi> there is only <hi>Love</hi> ſhall
poſſeſs us: And if ſometimes we ſhall be guilty of any hatred, we ſhall exerciſe
it only againſt the wolves, which are in hoſtility againſt our Shepherdry. What
pleaſure will it be to love Shepherdeſſes, whoſe affection will be mutual, and will
freely diſcover it ſelf, when reſpect ſhall not cauſe reſervedneſs, and breed in their
mindes what ſhall torment them! We ſhall finde, that thoſe fair ones will be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Cockneys</hi> nor <hi>Courtizans,</hi> and that the unfaithfulneſs of Lovers will not teach
them to carry two hearts in one breaſt. As concerning divine worſhip, and the
ſciences which we ſhall ſtudy, I have ſpoken to that point already; but as for our
ordinary recreations, I have fancied to my ſelf moſt excellent ones. Thoſe of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
quality among us ſhall act a Comedy every day: The ſubject ſhall be taken out
of ſome piece of ancient Poetry; and the parts being aſſign'd to thoſe who already
know the ſtory by heart, they ſhall only be told the caſt of the Scenes, and then they
muſt compoſe, as it were on a <hi>ſudden,</hi> what they have to ſay. Beſides, I have
found out an incomparable kinde of ſtage. I have ſeen your Players at <hi>Burgundy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi>
I have ſeen ſome plays in the Colleges, but all was but fiction: There was
a sky of Canvas, a rock of Parport, and in all things the painting cheated our eyes;
but I will have it far otherwiſe: our plays ſhall be acted in the open field, and our
ſtage ſhall be the great Theatre of nature; we'll have no heaven but the true hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
if a Shepherd be to iſſue out of a Thicket, he ſhall do it out of a true thicket;
if he muſt drink at a ſpring, he ſhall drink at one indeed: and ſo all things being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
repreſented, men will believe they ſee the true hiſtory; ſo that the actors
being thereby animated themſelves, will put on the paſſions of thoſe parts which
are aſſig'd them, and the ſpectators be as much pleas'd as aſtoniſh'd at it. And all
this I do not any thing doubt of; when I conſider, that when ever I was at any play
at <hi>Paris,</hi> though they were not ſo natural and lively as ours will be, yet have I
ever been ſo tranſported by them, that I have imagin'd it was no fiction. Nay, ſince
you make us ſuch excellent propoſitions, I am much in doubt whether I ſhould ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
credit you, ſays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> But as for your plays, I approve them beyond any
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:43725:138"/>
thing I ever heard. For to make them compleat, I will contribute ſomewhat of
my invention. You know there are ſome Actors who never put off the parts they
once take: As for example, one is the <hi>Doctor,</hi> another the <hi>Captain,</hi> and another
the <hi>Fool.</hi> All the deſign is carried on accordingly, their parts change not, there is
only a change in the ſtory. I do not intend we ſhould do ſo; it muſt neceſſarily be
expected that our qualities and habits change, if we will repreſent all ſorts of ancient
fables: but as for our manner of ſpeech, it ſhall not change at all. Every one ſhall
have a certain language, whereto he ſhall ſo accuſtome himſelf, that it will be eaſie
for him to find what he is to ſay; as for example, one ſhall ſpeak by <hi>Alluſions</hi> and
<hi>Equivocations,</hi> another by <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> a third by <hi>Metaphors,</hi> and a fourth by <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that heard <hi>Clarimond's</hi> propoſition found it very excellent, except <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
who at the firſt could not digeſt it. But <hi>Hircan</hi> forc'd him to do as the reſt did, ſo
that every one had the liberty to chooſe his ſpeech. <hi>Fontenay</hi> choſe the <hi>Alluſions</hi>
and <hi>Equivocations; Polydor,</hi> the <hi>Hyperboles; Meliantes,</hi> the <hi>Metaphors;</hi> and
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> the <hi>Galamathias,</hi> which is a ſtile compoſed of ſhifts and windings of
words, which render the ſenſe ſo obſcure, that it can hardly be known what to make
of it. As for <hi>Lyſis,</hi> he ſaid he would ſpeak a neat and poliſh'd phraſe, which he
call'd the <hi>amorous</hi> and <hi>paſſionate</hi> ſtile. There was propoſed alſo the <hi>Pedantick</hi> ſtile,
<hi>Paris</hi>-Expreſſions, <hi>Proverbs, Similitudes,</hi> and the <hi>Poetical</hi> ſtile, and ſome others
which they reſolv'd to make uſe of when there were need. The Shepherdeſſes came
not into the number of the Actors who appear'd on the Stage, becauſe <hi>Clarimond</hi>
had reſolved there ſhould nothing be done but what were <hi>groteſque,</hi> wherein it was
not fit the Ladies ſhould be engag'd. As for <hi>Lyſis,</hi> he thought it well they were
excluded, for he was glad to ſee men acting womens parts, as being a thing that
ſeemed to him more comical.</p>
            <p>All the queſtion now was, What piece ſhould be firſt acted for tryal. Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
that of the <hi>Raviſhing of Proſerpina,</hi> and that of <hi>Pſyche;</hi> and others the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
of Orpheus</hi> into <hi>hell,</hi> the <hi>Loves of Pyramus and Thisbe,</hi> the <hi>Conqueſt of the
Golden Fleece,</hi> and the <hi>Deflowring of Philomela.</hi> At laſt <hi>Hircan</hi> ſaid, that the next
day they would repreſent the <hi>raviſhing</hi> of <hi>Proſerpina</hi> by <hi>Pluto,</hi> which was an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
peece, and as being often ſeen acted would be very eaſie. It was reſolv'd <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
ſhould act <hi>Venus;</hi> that the fair <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who had been us'd to be clad like a
Maid, ſhould be the fair <hi>Proſerpina;</hi> that <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſhould be <hi>Cyana; Clarimond, Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſa;
Hircan</hi> ſhould act the part of <hi>Pluto, Meliantes</hi> that of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi>
that of <hi>Ceres.</hi> There wanted nothing but a <hi>Cupid:</hi> And <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſeeing <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin,</hi>
who had newly acted him, ſaid he was as pretty for to act him, as if he had
been painted for that purpoſe. <hi>Carmelin</hi> being very low in compariſon of <hi>Polidor,</hi>
who was to be his mother <hi>Venus,</hi> 'twas thought no part could be more convenient
for him; and <hi>Lyſis</hi> for his ſake imagined a new ſtile, which he call'd the <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
ſtile, wherein he thought he might be able enough becauſe of his ordinary ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicities.
It was only he that made ſome reſiſtance, calling to mind that the part
they gave him had not been very fortunate to him, and had been the cauſe he had
been well beaten that afternoon. They perſwaded him out of that fear, and aſſured
him that the part he was to have would be both pleaſant and honorable to him.
Upon this one of the men went to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s for an <hi>Ovids Metamorphoſes,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liris</hi>
having read aloud the ſubject of the future Comedy, ſhewed every one what
he had to do. The day being ſpent in theſe entertainments, they left the wedding;
and all thoſe of <hi>Orontes</hi>'s company going along with him, <hi>Hircan</hi> took away his to
his Caſtle. As they were ready to go in, I am exceſſively hot, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> I know
not whether it proceeds from the weather, or from the Love which poſſeſſes my
heart: I have a great deſire to go into the water to night; is there any body elſe
of the ſame mind?</p>
            <p>It happened that <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> had a mind to go into the water; ſo
that they left the reſt of the company to go into the river <hi>Morin.</hi> 'Twas about half
a league off, and yet they cheerfully overcame the way, diſcourſing of divers things
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:43725:139"/>
with <hi>Carmelin,</hi> whom they carried with them to look to their cloaths, though there
were no need of it. As they were putting off their cloaths, <hi>Lyſis</hi> not able any
longer to conceal the deſign he had, ſpoke thus to them. 'Tis very true, my friends,
that it is a pleaſure to me to go into the water, both for to refreſh my ſelf a little
in this hot ſeaſon, and to waſh my body: But beſides this, my intention is to go
and ſee the <hi>aquatick Divinities</hi> that lodge in this River. I have not mention'd it to
<hi>Hircan,</hi> becauſe I doubt he would have endeavoured to divert me, by making me
believe I am no <hi>Demy-god,</hi> as I have ſometimes been, and that I am not any longer
permitted to converſe with thoſe of that quality. I know no reaſon why he ſhould
ſay ſo; for in all Hiſtories we have a many examples of humane perſons that have
ſpoken to Divinities. Is it not becauſe he hates them, and will have me hate them
too? As for the aquatick Gods, ſince he hath pluck'd off their beards, 'tis certain
he loves them not much: And if I ſhould have ſpoken to him of going to ſee them,
he would not have come, for fear of receiving ſome affront. But I who am one
of their greateſt friends, as I have good teſtimony, I will confidently go and ſee
them, and if I can, I will have their Chryſtal palaces opened to you.</p>
            <p>With theſe words the <hi>Shepherd</hi> caſt himſelf headlong into the water. <hi>Clarimond</hi>
and <hi>Philiris</hi> fearing he might be drown'd, made haſte in after him, and recovered
him, when he had drunk ſo much that he was almoſt gone. Being a little ſenſible of
his fault, he told them there was no means to viſit the <hi>Aquatick Divinities</hi> that day,
and that they deſired not to be ſeen, ſince they had not divided the water to make
him a paſſage to their Courts. He afterward waſh'd himſelf quietly, and put on his
cloaths with the reſt, without any extravagancy at all. Only he ſaid it troubled him
that he had not ſpoken to the Gods of the waters, becauſe he would have invited
them to their ſports, to make them more compleat, if they were to repreſent ſome
Story wherein it were neceſſary ſome aquatick Deity appeared on the Stage. He
alſo ſaid they muſt needs find out ſome <hi>Hamadryads,</hi> or at leaſt ſome <hi>Satyres,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it was impoſſible to act a good <hi>Paſtoral.</hi> He would not have them coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
as the other Divinities; becauſe he had read in the <hi>Paſtorals</hi> of <hi>Julietta,</hi>
that thoſe Goats familiarly appeared to Shepherds, and that they raviſh'd the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes.
Beſides he imagined he had once ſeen one, and that he might again meet
with a true one.</p>
            <p>Poſſeſt with this imagination, he prayd <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> to return to <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi>
and to leave him neer a Thicket wher he hoped to meet with ſome rural Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinities.
They, who were ſomwhat hungry, went their way and left him with <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin,</hi>
who had rather have gone with them then ſtay with his maſter, whoſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
pleas'd him not. However they ſtaid together, and <hi>Lyſis</hi> began to ſpeak
thus: Fair <hi>Hamadryads!</hi> divine <hi>Fairies!</hi> who dance all night by the moon-ſhine;
and you laſcivious <hi>Fawns!</hi> can I by no means ſee one of you?</p>
            <p>He had ſcarce ſpoken this, but he perceives afar off ten or twelve torches, which
paſs'd from one place to another. Ah good god! they are falſe lights which will
lead us to drowning, cries out <hi>Carmelin:</hi> O maſter, do not follow them I let me
never be thought my mothers ſon, if they do not deſtroy you: If you will prevent
it, lie down on the ground. Ah daſtard! ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> do thou ſtretch thy ſelf as thou
wilt, this adventure is reſerve'd for me: I muſt follow thoſe torches, for I ſee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
now favours me. 'Tis <hi>Ceres Eleuſina,</hi> who having heard that to morrow we
were to repreſent her ſtory, will be preſent in perſon, and act her own part. Thoſe
are her torches that appear, they are her true badges. Now all my wiſhes are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd: All the Gods will come down on earth, to repreſent before us what
they ſometime did before; ſo that thoſe to whom we have aſſign'd their parts,
muſt modeſtly reſign them, confeſſing themſelves unworthy to act them, and content
themſelves to be ſpectators.</p>
            <p>In ſaying ſo, he runs up and down, thinking to catch one of the torches; but
they ſtaid not long in a place. At laſt they came all together; and <hi>Lyſis</hi> thinking
he ſhould then catch them, ran ſo much the faſter, and that ſo confidently, that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
between two trees where a cord was faſtened, he ſhewed a feat of activity, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:43725:139"/>
tumbled into a ditch full of ruſhes and reeds. Thoſe who carried the torches, were
the Countrey people of the wedding, who having taken notice of all his actions,
knew that he and <hi>Carmelin</hi> were gone into the water with <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Philiris.</hi>
Their deſign was to frighten them, and to make them fall into ſome ſnares, which
they had plac'd up and down to catch thoſe that had offended them. Some of them
having obſerv'd that <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> were gone into <hi>Hirtans,</hi> but <hi>Lyſis</hi> and
<hi>Carmelin</hi> not, they concluded they were fallen ſomewhere, and that they were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
reveng'd. They thought beſt to leave them where they were, as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they thought it would have been to no purpoſe to look for them in the dark,
were they minded to beat them. <hi>Carmelin</hi> not hearing any more the voyce of his
Maſter, lifted up his head a little; and not ſeeing the torches, which were put out,
he preſumed to get up on his feet, and to look for <hi>Lyſis.</hi> He call'd him on every
ſide, when at laſt a mournful voyce came to his ears: he thought it were <hi>Lyſiis</hi>
that ſpoke. Where am I? ſaid he; am I in the infernal fens? is <hi>Charons</hi> boat
any thing near me? Alas! my poor maſter, cryes out <hi>Carmelin,</hi> tell me where
you are, and I will come and help you. O Goddeſs <hi>Ceres!</hi> ſays <hi>Lyſis</hi> again to him,
if you will ſend me to hell, do me at leaſt the favor to tell me for what crime. Is it for
going to entertain your daughter <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> and to teach her the art of Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry?
<hi>Carmelin</hi> hearing this diſcourſe, ſo little to the purpoſe, cryed his heart al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
out, to let his maſter know it was his faithful <hi>Carmelin;</hi> and at length, having
ſoftly ſlidden into the ditch, he drew him out. <hi>Lyſis</hi> taking him then for no other
then he was, joyn'd with him to ſeek out the way to <hi>Hircans</hi> Caſtle, which after
many turns they met with. They made long complaints of the accident had
hapned to them; and <hi>Carmelia,</hi> to ſhew how infinitely he was afraid, ſwore there
were as many torches as ſtars in the sky. For to chear them up, there was a fire
ſet on, and ſupper brought them: and afterwards they were diſpos'd into good
beds, where they ſlept till the next day.</p>
            <p>All got up betimes in the morning to ſtudy their parts: There was none but
ſearcht in <hi>Hircans</hi> ſtudy for the books that were moſt neceſſary for to learn the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
he was to obſerve. The <hi>Gallimathiaſiſt</hi> turn'd over the <hi>loves</hi> of <hi>Des Eſcuteaux,</hi>
and other modern books. The <hi>Hyporboliſt</hi> pick'd out what was moſt for his purpoſe,
out of ſome other books, and ſo every one endeavor'd to make himſelf the moſt
perfect he could. Only <hi>Carmelin</hi> diſcover'd his ignorance; for not finding any means
to make uſe of the <hi>Common places</hi> he had by heart, there was nothing in his mind
that contributed any thing to his part. <hi>Polidor,</hi> who was to come into the ſcene with
him, lectur'd him a little, and aſſur'd him, that beſides what he taught him, the
neceſſity of ſpeaking would furniſh him with many conceptions, when it came to
the puſh. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was confident thereupon, and troubled not himſelf with any
further ſtudy.</p>
            <p>When they had all din'd, <hi>Pluto</hi> put on a black Caſſock, <hi>Jupiter</hi> a red, <hi>Venus</hi> was in
<hi>green, Ceres</hi> in <hi>yellow, Proſerpina</hi> in <hi>blew, Cyana</hi> and <hi>Arethuſa</hi> in <hi>white;</hi> and as for
<hi>Love,</hi> It was reſolv'd he ſhould be ſtark <hi>naked.</hi> He told them, he would never do
it; and that he was more modeſt then to ſhew himſelf uncovered, before ſo many
women. He therefore was permitted in his drawers, having Gooſe-wings on his
back. They hang'd about him a quiver, and gave him a bow in his hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the mean time,</hi> Clarimond <hi>having been to look out a place, the fitteſt could be
found for the ſtage, found out one near</hi> Hircans <hi>wood. Thither came the whole
company, and</hi> Orontes <hi>and all his train came to be ſpectators. There was a little
hillock, that ſerv'd to repreſent the mountain of</hi> Erix, <hi>whereon</hi> Venus <hi>appear'd firſt.
There were over againſt it two trees, whereon there was a croſs piece laid, with a
long rope in the middle, at the end whereof they had faſtened a ſhort ſtick. They
commanded</hi> Cupid <hi>to ſet himſelf aſtride thereon, and then they began to wag him
from one ſide to another, as if he had been in a ſwing, to make him imagine he fled.
He was ſo amaz'd to ſee himſelf in the air, that he began to cry out, that he would
caſt away his bow to have his hands free, and hold faſt by the rope, if they did not
give over frightning him. Upon that they caſt a cord to him for him to tie himſelf
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:43725:140"/>
withal, and having put it about him with a ſingle knot, a Lacquay, who was gotten
upon one of the trees, took the other end of it. After this,</hi> Venus <hi>looking on him,
ſpoke to him in this manner, in her</hi> Hyperbolical <hi>Language,</hi> Dear Son, who art ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my ſelf, wilt thou not that one dart of thine pierce the heaven and the earth, and be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
an axletree for this great fabrick, that it may be believ'd it is only thou that
doſt ſuſtain it? Thy fires have lighted the ſun and the ſtars; have they not already burnt
up Neptune and all his waters? That thou mayeſt conſummate thy victories, muſt they
not devour the fires of hell? Come and repoſe thy ſelf on this mountain, which is
a pillar that ſupports the heaven; may, advances its crown above that fair vault, for to
make a throne for our Divinity; come hither, my delight, thou haſt already ſhredded the ayr
with thy wings, more times then there are grains of ſand on the ſea ſhore. Come my
childe, and I will wipe of the ſweat off thy forehead, which makes an ocean big enough
for a fleet. Do not ſtay any longer my Minion, I will ſhew thee thy uncle, whom thou
muſt ſo grievouſly wound, that all his body ſhall be but one wound. Venus <hi>here held her
peace, and the preſence expected ſome fine anſwer from</hi> Cupid, <hi>when he began to
cry out as loud as he could,</hi> Oh my friends, help, help, I am choak'd! <hi>Some were
amaz'd, others laught at it, but all look'd towards</hi> Carmelin. <hi>The Lacquay that was
on the tree, drew the cord ſo hard, that it tickl'd his throat more then it ſhould:
ſo that they bid him hold his hand; and the poor</hi> Cupid <hi>calling to minde the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicities
which they had put into his head, ſpake thus, with a voyce as clear as the
ſound of a glaſs,</hi> What is your pleaſure? Mamma, if you will have me come and ſee
you, you muſt promiſe to buy me a hobby-horſe at the fair, that when I am weary
of flying, I may go gallantly by Land. You muſt alſo give me, and't pleaſe you, a new
whiſtle; for I have ſold mine to Mercury, for to make uſe of in his pimpages. What
would you with me? will you have me tell you what I have loſt at Cockcal to my Brother
<hi>Anteros</hi> and your Graces? I plaid too t'other daie at puſhpin, with <hi>Ganimed,</hi> but he
is a cheating companion. He would ever win, and under pretence that <hi>Jupiter</hi> loves
him, he thinks he may do any thing, and not fear the rod, nay, that he may one daie
have my quality, and diſpoſſeſs me of my torch; but when I ſhall finde him by himſelf,
I'll order him as he deſerves, and I'll tell his maſter of his ſeeking birds-neſts, inſtead
of going to ſchool; you know he gees to learn Latine of <hi>Mercury.</hi> There is yet a great
deal more news: I'll tell you all, but, Oh God, I dye, I dye, if I am not let down! But
quickly then, my friend, take me hence, I ſhall make ſawce in my ſhirt elſe; let me
down, let me down, in good faith I ſhall ſpoil all the ceremony elſe. Carmelin <hi>having ſo
ſaid, they knew not whether he ſpoke this as his part; but at length he cryed out
ſo loud to be let down, that they ſaw he ſpoke in good earneſt, and not as an actor.
They took him down out of his ſwing; and he aſſoon got him behinde the Mountain</hi>
Erix, <hi>where he diſcharg'd himſelf of a burthen which ſomwhat troubled him. 'Twas
ſuppos'd that that accident of not being able to command his belly, proceeded from
that agitation. Being therefore excuſed, he came chearfully into play again, &amp; having
crept up to the place where</hi> Venus <hi>was, he went to receive her embraces and careſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the mean time there iſſued out a great flame from between the trees, and there
was heard the noiſe of ſome crackers; and after that arriv'd</hi> Pluto <hi>in a chariot,
drawn by two black horſes, which he whipt as faſt as he could lay on.</hi> I who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the natural brother of the Father Altitonant <hi>(ſays he in his pedantick language which
he had choſen)</hi> I on whom Deſtiny hath beſtow'd the Acherontical Diadem, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
of the Avern muſt I ſuffer the Latonian Torch to ſend the beams of its golden
periwig, even to the midſt of my moſt opake ſhades, through the hiatus of the earth?
I muſt with all feſtination take a moſt ample courſe, with this atrocious tumultuoſity.</p>
            <p>Pluto <hi>having ſo ſaid, drove his Chariot up and down; and</hi> Cupid <hi>in the mean
time ſpoke to his Mother,</hi> I'll ſhoot at him; Are you willing? ſhall I do it? is it now
time Mother? <hi>She made a ſign to him that ſhe was willing; and he preſently ſhot
him in at the third button: whereat</hi> Pluto <hi>being ſtrangely ſurpris'd, ſpoke thus,</hi> What
new jaculation is this hath ſtruck me? Ah! Celeſtial Fate, where ſhall I finde my
Dittany? <hi>In ſaying ſo, he perceived</hi> Proſerpina <hi>making of Poſies at the entrance
of the wood:</hi> Alas! <hi>(cry'd he out)</hi> this is ſhe hath incarcerated my liberty, within
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:43725:140"/>
the priſon of her ineffable pulchritude: I will as ſoon be a raviſher, as a lover of her.
<hi>With that word he leap'd down, and took up</hi> Proſerpina, <hi>whom he carried to his
proud Chariot, caſting her into it like a Sack of Wheat.</hi> O cruel one! <hi>cry'd ſhe out,</hi>
let me take along with me my flowers, I do conjure thee by my ſhowers of tears: If thou
wilt but a little ſtay, I will caſt myſelf into thoſe ſnares which thou ſhalt for me lay.
What, wilt thou take me, never to forſake me? 'Tis not thy ſureſt way, to raviſh me
away. Art thou not mov'd by my prayers, nor by my tears? O thief! who hurt'ſt me
with they jeers. It ſeems thy ears mind not my complaints, which witneſs I do ſuffer ſo
great pains, or rather ſo many deaths again.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this fine complaint, and a many <hi>alluſions, Pluto</hi> drove his horſes
on, and made them go as quick as tempeſt, the ſooner to bring his Miſtreſs into his
infernal Kingdom. He paſs'd by a ditch, whence iſſued <hi>Cyana</hi> half naked, and with
long diſchevel'd hair as if ſhe were come out of the water: But the Chariot went
on ſo faſt, that ſhe could not give <hi>Pluto</hi> the check ſhe had thought on; yet would
ſhe not omit her part, ſo that ſhe ran up and down as it were to overtake the God
of Hell. Inſtead of going into the Wood whither he was enter'd, behind the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Eryx,</hi> ſhe went into the high-way, there ſhe found a Waggon covered with
cloth; there was in it a man and a woman, whom ſhe took for <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Proſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina.</hi>
She drove the horſes into the Scene, while the Waggoner was making water
a little behind. <hi>Thou ſhalt go no further,</hi> thou robber <hi>Pluto,</hi> (cry'd out the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> who acted the part of the Nymph <hi>Cyana.) Love delights more in mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
then violence: Thou ſhouldſt have won</hi> Proſerpina <hi>by thy ſubmiſſions and the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
of affection, and not have raviſh'd her. As long as I have arms, I will hinder
the violence of thy charriot; and I who am but a poor ſilly Maid, will reſiſt a
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Waggoner at length running after his waggon, imagin'd the woman had
led it away was ſome ſpirit; but finding himſelf engag'd among ſo many as was
there, he was in a greater perplexity then before, and thoſe in the waggon were not
leſs amaz'd, praying <hi>Cyana</hi> to let them go on their journey. At laſt the man that
was in the waggon made bold to come out to thruſt her away; and having narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerv'd her, and attentively heard her voice, he preſently cry'd out, Ah mad
fool! is it then thou whom we have now met! I thought thou hadſt been far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
hence, whereas thou comeſt now to preſent thy ſelf before me in a worſe
condition then at <hi>Paris</hi> or <hi>S. Cloud:</hi> Now thou art diſguis'd like a Witch. O God!
what affliction is this to our family! Muſt this miſerable Wretch diſcredit
us all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme,</hi> who was among the ſpectators, had no ſooner ſeen the man, but he
knew him to be Mr. <hi>Adrian, Lyſis</hi>'s Guardian. He preſently went out of his place
and ſaluted him, deſiring him not to be angry with his Ward, ſince what he ſaid
was not out of folly, but it was the Part aſſign'd him in the ſport they were then
about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the mean time</hi> Cyana <hi>went and caſt herſelf into her ditch, and began to cry
out thus:</hi> Alas! how am I now well puniſh'd for my raſhneſs? My blood is turned
into water, my bones ſoften; there's nothing of me which becomes not liquid: <hi>Pluto</hi>
hath metamorphos'd me into a Fountain, that ſhall ever weep for the raviſhing of the
fair <hi>Proſerpina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> hearing this, believ'd not what <hi>Anſelme</hi> had ſaid to him; he told him
he could not believe but <hi>Lyſis</hi> was madder then ever, and that he was made do all
thoſe abſurdities for to make others ſport. Do you not alſo ſee, replies <hi>Anſelme,</hi>
ſix or ſeven other perſons of quality diſguiſed as well as he? And upon that <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,
Philiris,</hi> and <hi>Meliantes,</hi> whom the ſtrangeneſs of the accident had forc'd to
come out of the places where they were retired, ſhewed themſelves unmask'd to
<hi>Adrian.</hi> He ſaw they were people well enough in their wits, and was ſomwhat
appeas'd, thinking his Ward could do nothing undecent amongſt them. <hi>Carmelin</hi>
came in with the reſt; and having underſtood that <hi>Adrian</hi> would not believe they
were acting a Comedy in that place, I was alſo of it, ſays he to him, I tell you ſo
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:43725:141"/>
much, that you may no longer doubt of it: See, here's my bow; look on it, is it
not of good wood?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>While they laugh'd at this ſimplicity,</hi> Philiris <hi>habited as a Goddeſs went to</hi> Lyſis.
<hi>He found his mind was ſo tranſported, that he could not conſider it was his Couſin
he had met.</hi> Gracious <hi>Ceres! (ſays the Nymph</hi> Cyana <hi>ſpeaking to</hi> Philiris) have
you already ſought every where your <hi>Proſerpina</hi> with your burning torches? Hath not
<hi>Arethuſa</hi> told you that <hi>Pluto</hi> detains her for his Spouſe in hell? Have you not yet
made your complaint of it to <hi>Jupiter</hi> King of the Gods? <hi>We are not there yet, ſays</hi>
Philiris; <hi>come away quickly, there's need of you.</hi> How's that? ſays <hi>Cyana,</hi> is
the order of our Play diſturb'd? Who is in fault that it goes not forward? who are the
perturbators of our enjoyments? Have not I plaid my part of the Fountain well? me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I am already melted into water, as ſugar in the mouth. <hi>I tell you there's one
of your friends come, replies</hi> Philiris, <hi>come quickly and ſalute him, He is much
troubled about you: I think I have heard him call'd</hi> Adrian; <hi>remember yourſelf
whether you know him or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This news bred a change in <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and though he were accuſtom'd to take all
fictions for truths, yet the name of <hi>Adrian</hi> ſo diſturb'd him, that he ſoon forgot the
raviſhing of <hi>Proſerpina</hi> was a doing. Yet he ſunk into his hole, not that he thought
himſelf a Fountain, but that he might not be ſeen. <hi>Anſelme</hi> deſirous to have him
appear, went to the ditch with <hi>Adrian,</hi> who ſaid to him, So, ſo! do not hide your
ſelf, Couſin, I know well enough 'tis you. Then was he forced to come out and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<hi>Adrian,</hi> and afterward went to the waggon where his Couſins good wife was,
whom he had taken for <hi>Proſerpina.</hi> While he was in his complements and excuſes
to her, <hi>Adrian</hi> told <hi>Anſelme,</hi> that he wondred to find them in <hi>Brie,</hi> whereas <hi>Lyſis</hi>
had aſſured him they were to go into <hi>Forreſts.</hi> 'Tis beſides our intention that we are
in this Country, replies <hi>Anſelme;</hi> and I believe it hath happened ſo, that we might
have the happineſs to ſee you here: But I pray what great deſigns have brought
you this way? I am on a pilgrimage to St. <hi>Fare</hi> with my wife, anſwers <hi>Adrian;</hi>
though I am not the beſt in the world, yet muſt a man endeavour to be ſo. Be
pleas'd to day to be merry with us, ſayes <hi>Anſelme;</hi> and to morrow you may go on
your way, and be in as good time at <hi>Faremonſtier,</hi> as if you lay there to night.
You'll excuſe me, replies <hi>Adrian,</hi> I muſt by your favour into the waggon again,
Not before you drink with us, ſays <hi>Orontes;</hi> you ſhall bait here.</p>
            <p>After this there was brought on the place a many good things to eat; and the
Play being interrupted, both the Actors and Spectators came to the Banquet. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi>
and his wife, and the Waggoner having ſatisfied themſelves, were reſolved to
continue their journey: So they got into the waggon, and asking where <hi>Lyſis</hi> liv'd,
He is ſo good Company, replies <hi>Anſelme,</hi> that all will have him by turns: He is
ſometimes at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, ſometimes at <hi>Montenor</hi>'s, ſometimes at <hi>Clarimond</hi>'s; but
at any time you will have tidings of us at <hi>Hircan</hi>'s Caſtle. When I have done my
devotions at <hi>Faremonſtier,</hi> ſays <hi>Adrian,</hi> I will endeavour to get in a little mony due
to me from a Gentleman of this Country, and then I ſhall be able to ſtay here two
or three dayes: But as I come back, I will take <hi>Lewis</hi> along with me to <hi>Paris,</hi> for
I believe he is too troubleſom to you. Farewell Gentlemen and Ladies! adieu Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin!
Drive on, Waggoner.</p>
            <p>The Waggoner ſet forward, and all the Company wiſh'd a good journey to the
Merchant and his wife. None was diſcontented but <hi>Lyſis:</hi> He was troubled at the
promiſe his Couſin made to fetch him away, and knew not how to remedy it. <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
comforted him the beſt he could; and <hi>Hircan</hi> deſirous to put ſomething
more pleaſant into his mind, told him, that ſince the raviſhing of <hi>Proſerpina</hi> had
been interrupted, and that there was no means to begin it again, they would the
next day act the <hi>Golden Fleece.</hi> That's an excellent deſign, ſaves <hi>Lyſis:</hi> but where
ſhall be the Sea? We'll go to a Lake that's a quarter of a league hence, replies
<hi>Hircan.</hi> It's better we went to the River <hi>Morin,</hi> ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> I know a place
where there is a little Iſle, that ſhall be the Iſle of <hi>Colchos.</hi> That will be excellent,
ſays <hi>Lyſis</hi> to him: Thou ſhalt be <hi>Jaſon; Meliantes</hi> ſhall be <hi>Medea; Hircan</hi> that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:43725:141"/>
playes on the Lute, ſhall be <hi>Orpheus</hi> that accompanied the <hi>Argonauts,</hi> and cheer'd
them up with his muſick. For my part, I'll be <hi>Zethes</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> ſhall be <hi>Calais,</hi>
two brothers twins, the children of <hi>Boreas</hi> and <hi>Orithia;</hi> and for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he ſhallbe
the King <hi>Phineus,</hi> a part very convenient for him in my opinion, for he is ever hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
enough. As for the other parts, as <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> and ſome other of the
<hi>Argonauts</hi> and the <hi>Harpies,</hi> they that ſhall act them ſhall be ſuch as need not ſpeak
unleſs they will.</p>
            <p>This order being approved, the Company parted with hope the next day to have
good ſport. All the Actors read the Fable of <hi>Jaſon,</hi> and every one conſidered the
fitteſt words for his part. As for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he told them he would now ſpeak learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
and not ſimply; and that he deſired to ſhew ſome caſts and daſhes of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<hi>Clarimond</hi> with his aſſiſtance compoſed what he had to ſay, and gave it him
in Notes, which he did nothing but read all night and the next morning, ſuch was his
deſire to do well: His ſtile was half Proverbs, and the reſt was Fancie.</p>
            <p>The time of the ſports come, all the Actors dreſs'd themſelves, and went to the
River of <hi>Morin,</hi> where the reſt of the company met neer about the ſame time. The
Actors were only of <hi>Hircans</hi> Train, becauſe they ſeemed to be of the better humor,
and as it were fit for nothing but to make ſport for others. <hi>Anſelme, Montenor,</hi>
and <hi>Orontes</hi> were there only as ſpectators with the Ladies and ſome other friends.
The ſpectators having ſeated themſelves on the River ſide, there was hard by them
a Table, and at that a Chair. <hi>Carmelin</hi> came and fate in it, having on a fair Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gown,
a falſe white Beard, and a Crown of yellow Paſsbord. He was very glad to ſee
himſelf a King once in his life; and obſerving three or four Waiters ſerving up
ſome meat before him, he was not a little proud to ſee himſelf ſo magnificently treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
He well remembred that <hi>Clarimond</hi> had told him he ſhould not eat, and that all
his meat would be taken away from him; but he thought he had jeſted with him,
and that there were no danger to eat a bit or two, if ſo be he could do it. His Carver
had no ſooner preſented him with a Pullets wing, but the two Harpies very odly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
came in; one with her claws took away the wing, while the other ſnatcht away
the whole carkaſs with an iron crook. King <hi>Phineus</hi> ſeeing they were gone, began
to ſpeak in this manner. <hi>Ah miſerable Prince that I am! to what purpoſe have I ſo
much mony, which I rake up with ſhovels, and meaſure by the buſhel? To what purpoſe
have I ſo many Country-houſes, where I may be fed of all ſorts of creatures, if I cannot
eat becauſe of theſe abominable monſters which take away all from me? 'Tis to much
purpoſe to kill for me ſo many tender Chickens, which die young, to make me live the
longer: Of all this I have nothing but the ſmoak. My Courtiers do ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
to me, that patience paſſes ſcience; but a ſtarv'd belly hath no eares. In the
poſture I am, I could eat through ſtone-walls, for there's no ſauce to hunger.</hi> King
<hi>Phineus</hi> having ſaid this, caſt his eye on his Notes which he had laid on the table for
to look in ſometimes, if his memory failed him. <hi>Clarimond</hi> had ſet down all he was
to do; ſo that he read aloud theſe words which he found there: Carmelin <hi>who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
King</hi> Phineus, <hi>muſt now call to drink. Give me ſome wine there, I command
you, ſince it is ſo in the writing,</hi> continued he.</p>
            <p>All began to laugh at this pleaſant ſimplicity. But he, who thought of nothing
but his profit, made ready to receive the glaſs out of the hands of his people, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
he ſhould drink, though he could not eat: But as he thought to carry the
glaſs to his mouth, comes a Harpy, and with her clawes breaks it all to peeces. That
made him angry in good earneſt; and in ſpight of all the precepts of <hi>Clarimond,</hi> he
reſolv'd to ſwallow ſomwhat. They had no ſooner brought him a ſhoulder of mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
but he preſently fell on, without ſtaying to be carv'd to. He fell a biting it ſo
revengefully, as if he would have devoured all at a bit; but the Harpies came in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
and tugg'd with him, and had almoſt broke his teeth. He ſeeing they were
too ſtrong for him, call'd for a rib of Beef, and taking a ſtaff from one of the waiters
he in good earneſt ſet on the fingers of thoſe Monſters when they came neer his
table, though he had not been taught to do that, and act his part well. Yet the
Harpies carried away the meat, and left him ſo diſconſolate, that he would not have
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:43725:142"/>
any thing more ſerv'd up. While he groaned in his chair, they ſaw afar off a boat,
wherein were the Argonauts, clad like brave Gentlemen. They had all branches
in their hands, except <hi>Orpheus,</hi> who plaid on the Lute; and ſung a ſea ſong, which
began thus:
<q>
                  <l>Gentles, command, I will not fail,</l>
                  <l>My ſhip is going to ſet ſail, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The reſt anſwered him in a <hi>Chorus,</hi> and made a very excellent muſick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The veſſel being arriv'd at a port near the table of</hi> Phineas, Zethes <hi>and</hi> Calais
<hi>were ſet a ſhore, for to finde out this</hi> King. O fair youths, <hi>ſayes he to them,</hi> what
good wind hath brought you into my territories? you are here both wello-ome, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receiv'd.
Can I not by your aſſiſtance be delivered from a ſort of filthy birds, who
ſnatch away all that is laid on my table, for the ſubſiſtance of my individual. Great
King, <hi>replied</hi> Zethes, Feathers are come out at our backs, at the ſame time as hair
on our chins: we fly as well as the wind Boreas our father. Cauſe to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you the meat which ſerves for a bait to theſe Monſters, and you ſhall ſee what
we are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phineas</hi> upon that, commanded his people to bring him ſomewhat; they ſet on
the table a fat Capon, and the Harpies were preſently there to take it away; but
<hi>Zethes</hi> and <hi>Calais</hi> laid hand on their ſwords, and frighted them ſo, as they fled:
They ran after them ſo faſt, as it might be thought they fled. In the mean time
<hi>Carmelin</hi> looking on his paper, ſaw a marginal note that pleas'd him very well, and
which he had not before at all taken notice of: he could not but plainly deliver it
juſt as he found it written: <hi>'Tis now,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>that King</hi> Phineus <hi>delivered from
the Harpies, may eat at libertie,</hi> He afterwards ſed very couragiouſly of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon;
and utter'd this diſcourſe, half by heart, and half reading out of his paper,
<hi>Oh! how delicious is this meat, after a long faſt, which had contracted and ſhrunk
up my bowels, like ſcorch'd parchment? What pleaſure ſhall I have henceforward, to
feed on thoſe meats, whereof I had forgotten the taſte? I ſhall no longer believe that
my ſervants are happier then my ſelf, as heretofore, when they ate their belly fulls,
I was always emptie.</hi> As he had done ſaying ſo, the children of <hi>Boreas</hi> return'd
victorious, ſo that he ſpoke theſe words to them, as he read them word for word
in his paper, <hi>Sacred young men, you have reſtor'd me my life, ſince you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd
me to eating. Aſſure your ſelves, that this good office ſhall not be anſwered
with ingratitude. I will have a Temple built you as high as the clouds, where I
will every daie adore you as moſt favourable Gods.</hi> At the end of this he cryed
out aloud, <hi>FINIS;</hi> becauſe <hi>Clarimond</hi> had written that word at the end of
his notes.</p>
            <p>After this, he retir'd to the Spectators, who applauded him, as if he had done
wonders, becauſe the faults he had committed were ſo pleaſant, that if he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
the precepts had been given him, he had done nothing near ſo well. As for
the children of <hi>Boreas,</hi> they got into their veſſel, which ſet ſail towards the Iſle of
<hi>Colchos,</hi> where was a fleece faſtned to a tree. The <hi>Argonauts</hi> being all landed, <hi>Jaſon,</hi>
who ſeem'd to be ſtouter then any of the reſt, began to ſpeak thus in his <hi>galima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias,
Behold the ground where are the greateſt riches in the world, and where is a
world of riches. I alreadie ſee the ſhining of that golden fleece, which with a ray fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
radiating, wounds the eies, and yet doth not hurt them, and makes us as much
live by hope, as we die for fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The other Argonauts anſwered to that in divers ſtyles; and they ſpoke ſo loud,
that thoſe on the other ſide could hear them. A while after appear'd</hi> Medea, <hi>with
thoſe temptations that ſtole away the liberty of</hi> Jaſon. <hi>He preſently courted her
in theſe words,</hi> Fair ſoul of my ſoul, deſire of my deſire, the reſidence of my concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
will you not believe that my libertie is ſacrific'd on the altar of your beauties?
ſince I know you I am miraculouſly fallen in love with an amorous miracle; and all I
deſire, is but to die for you a living death, which is better then a drying life. But if
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:43725:142"/>
your attracting ſweetneſs be changed into a cruelty ſo cruel, as moſt cruelly to deſpiſe
me; and that the ability whereby you are able to heal me, finde impoſſibility in its power,
doubt not but my amorous misfortune, and my unfortunate love will principitate me
headlong into ſome precipice.</p>
            <p>All the fine words, wherewith you harneſs your Language <hi>(replies</hi> Metaphorically
<hi>the Sorcereſs</hi> Medea) cannot pour into my minde the belief of your love. I will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
my ſelf to be lull'd aſleep on the ſoft pillows of your words. You come out of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
which is over glutted with fairer women then I am, and I ſhall never be bound up,
into ſo high a preſumption, as to perſwade my ſelf that you are inſnared in the lines of my
affection. And this makes me believe you have ſet up a ſhop of diſſimulation; but my
reaſon ſtands ſo well on her guard, within the fort of my ſoul, that you need not hope
to take it by aſſault. I know well, if you were once entered there, you would put all
to fire and ſword, and you would ſack even my firmeſt conſtancy. I muſt not follow
the flags of folly, nor the cheating allurements which would bring me into the hook: I
had rather cooſt along ſome happy river, where I might be ſheltered from all misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
in the Haure de Grace of Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jaſon</hi> and <hi>Medea,</hi> who were very able perſons, continued their diſcourſe a good
while, being of the ſame ſtuff as what we have heard. Were they all to be written
down, with the iſſue of the play, 'twere to put one book in another, and to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and importune the Reader with humors that are already ſtale, and which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
looſe much of the grace they had when firſt acted. It ſhall then ſuffice me
to tell you, that <hi>Medea</hi> beings as much taken with the merit of <hi>Jaſon,</hi> as <hi>Jaſon</hi> was
with her beauty, gave him certain drugs for to lay aſleep the waking dragon, that
watch'd the golden fleece. He came near the place where it was according to the
fable; but as he thought to take it, the dragon came and frighted him away. 'Twas
an engine made of Paſtboard, which a man plac'd within made to go. <hi>Jaſon</hi> caſt
on it a certain liquor, and preſently the beaſt lay along without any motion; ſo
that he eaſily took down the fair fleece which he deſired, and took <hi>Medea</hi> by the
arm, for to embarque her in his veſſel, and bring her into <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having obſerved all this, was not content with the words which he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to ſpeak, but he went and held <hi>Jaſon</hi> by the arm; Thou ſhalt not go ſo, ſays he
to him, thou haſt done but half thy work: Doeſt thou think the golden fleece
can be ſo eaſily obtain'd? Haſt thou not read that it is kept by Bulls with brazen
feet, and iron horns, as well as by the waking Dragon? Thou muſt alſo charm
theſe creatures, and make them ſubmit their necks to the yoke for to til this ground,
wherein thou muſt ſow Serpens teeth. This fatal ſeed ſhall grow up, being wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
with blood and venome, and ſhall produce armed men, againſt whom thou
muſt fight, until a mutiny happening amongſt them, they ruine themſelves. And
it is after theſe Labours that thou ſhalt deſerve to be recompenc'd. Stay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
here, or I ſwear there ſhall none of the <hi>Argonauts</hi> follow thee. Come away
then, let the Bulls be brought. We have not any here, ſays <hi>Hircan;</hi> do you think
that all things can be ſo punctually repreſented? There is never any Comedy,
wherein ſome things of the hiſtory are not paſſed over in ſilence; or it is made
believe, that what is moſt difficult, is done behinde the curtain, and is afterward
related on the ſtage. That way is worth nothing, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I would have all
things natural. I muſt have that done which I tell you, if you intend to act
parts with me. Now all our ſport is ſpoiled for want of foreſight. But ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time let thoſe that are charg'd with preparing things, forget nothing of what
is neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having thus ſpoken, got into the boat, with all thoſe that were in the Iſle,
for it could not be denyed but the Comedy was handſomely performed. This
diſorder that had hapned in it, was more pleaſant, then any thing of order; and
'twas good recreation to hear <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s complaints, who all that day left not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
with <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Hircan,</hi> for not having brought bulls into the Iſle. He
was at laſt appeas'd, with promiſes that all Comedies ſhould be acted very magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently,
or elſe that they would act none at all; and his propoſition was, That,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:43725:143"/>
when they had caus'd cloathes of all faſhions to be made, they might repreſent all
<hi>Ovids Metamorphoſes</hi> one after another; and then all <hi>Virgils Aeneads,</hi> beſides
ſome other Poetical fictions. 'Twas conceiv'd it might be excellent paſtime to ſee
ſo many Fables ſo conceitedly repreſented, and yet <hi>Lyſis</hi> met with extream delays,
becauſe the world is pleas'd with change, and that the Company were reſolved to
diſpoſe otherwiſe of themſelves; and beſides, it would have been a very difficult
matter to repreſent ſo many ſeveral actions as <hi>Lyſis</hi> did imagine; for when there
ſhould be occaſion that ſome Gods ſhould have come down from heaven, by what
invention could it have been done? That could not ſo eaſily have been repreſented,
as hell, which might have been ſignified by ſome Quarry, or ſome low brick
oven.</p>
            <p>But our Shepherd had yet a much ſtranger deſign; for the more natural acting
of a Comedy, he thought not ſufficient to make uſe of one ſcene; becauſe ſaid he,
ſometimes they had to repreſent things done in divers Countrys; he therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
that what was done in a village, ſhould be done in a village; and that which
had been done on a mountain, ſhould be done on a mountain; though haply the
Actors muſt have walk a League, before they could come to one; ſo that the
Spectators muſt have a great deal of trouble to follow them from place to place:
and go along with them ſometimes about a ſpring, ſometimes follow them into a
Temple to ſee them act their parts.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s way, and not to build upon the ſtage Caſtles of Paſtbord, and
to call the ſeene ſometimes <hi>Thrace,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Greece.</hi> You may eaſily perceive by
theſe extraordinary imaginations, that his deſire was to come as near as he could
to the truth: But ſo many difficulties could not but be very importune and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom:
Beſides, it was conſidered, that if they continued any while to act plays
ſo publikely, the Nobility for twenty leagues about would have come to ſee the
ſport, and haply would have laughted at ſuch conceits, which could not be to the
liking of all the world; for it happened to this true repreſentation, as it did to this
ſimple relation which I make of it, which haply will not pleaſe your vulgar
mindes, who underſtand not what true Satyre is. Some Country people and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
who paſt by the way, ſtaid to ſee the Comedy of our Shepherds, and had left
them not without aſtoniſhment, thinking they had all ſome worm of folly in their
heads.</p>
            <p>The diverſion of Comedies was therefore quite hiſs'd out, and <hi>Lyſis</hi> had now
nothing of greater concernment to think on, then to know whether his Miſtreſs had
ſeen nothing of all this, becauſe he was afraid ſhe had not vouchſafed to appear.
Though ſhe had not ſtirr'd out of the houſe, yet did they make him believe, that
ſhe had been to ſee the Conqueſt of the <hi>golden fleece,</hi> for a while, and that ſhe was
return'd with the firſt. I am certain ſhe takes no pleaſure in any thing of all that
I do, ſaies the <hi>Shepherd;</hi> but ſince in all my paſt actions ſhe hath not found ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
teſtimonies of my affection, I am reſolved my death ſhall convince her of it.
Moderate thy deſpair, incomparable Shepherd, ſaies <hi>Hircan;</hi> Thou muſt not end
thy life without the will of the Gods: Thou art obliged to preſerve thy ſelf for the
good of others, for thou art not only born for thy ſelf. I now tell thee in good
earneſt, that it is thou that art the <hi>Dove,</hi> that muſt be chang'd into an <hi>Eagle.</hi> The
time is now come that I muſt expound my propheſie to thee: thou muſt now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
that peaceable compoſition of minde, for a marſhal courage; and it is only
by thy means that <hi>Meliantes</hi>'s Miſtreſs muſt be belivered out of priſon. That thou
mayeſt underſtand how this may be accompliſhed, know, I will make thee as invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
as ever <hi>Achilles</hi> was. If thou canſt do that, learned Magician, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
there is no doubt but I will as confidently engage in all combats, as any <hi>Heroes</hi> that
ever was. I never boaſt of any thing I cannot accompliſh, replied <hi>Hircan:</hi> but
thou art to know, that thou canſt not bring the adventure about, without the
Shepherd <hi>Carmelin,</hi> though the Magician of the enchanted Caſtle did not mention
him: The Gods have revealed this to me; beſides, the courteous <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſhall be
equally incapable of being wounded, for I will not favour him leſs then his maſter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:43725:143"/>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> aſſuring themſelves on the word of <hi>Hircan,</hi> imagin'd what
a great pleaſure it would be to cut monſters in pieces, it being ſo provided that they
themſelves were not in any danger of blows. Having therefore taken leave of all
thoſe that went not along with the Magician, they follow'd him home to his Caſtle.
All ſupper time, there was nothing ſpoken of but valour; and the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis</hi>
believing he might eaſily become a valiant Champion, aſſur'd <hi>Hircan</hi> he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied
nothing but what was true, and that he was ready to change the <hi>Paſtoral</hi>
habit into a <hi>Military.</hi> He told him he was no longer in the error he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
been in, to believe that for to become happy, a man ſhould not bear arms,
now that he conſidered the illuſtrious actions of ſo many ancient Heroes, which
had never ſcal'd heaven but by that noble way.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>yſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> retired after ſupper into their chamber,
according to order from <hi>Hircan,</hi> who preſently went to
them, telling them the hour was now come that they ſhould
be made invulnerable. Muſt we ſtrip our ſelves ſtark naked?
ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> will you plunge us into the river <hi>Styx,</hi> as <hi>Thetis</hi>
did <hi>Achilles?</hi> You muſt not then be ſo heedleſs as that
Goddeſs; She made her Son invulnerable all over, but that
part where he was to be wounded: 'twas a great want of
judgment, may ſhe not be offended! She that by her divinity knew the decrees of
the Deſtinies, and foreſaw things to come, why did ſhe not make armour-proof
that dangerous part of <hi>Achilles</hi> his body? Knew ſhe not well enough, that when
his enemies once had notice there were a part of his body could not be hurt, they
would not make at that, and would diſpatch him as ſoon as another that had but a
common body? Beſides, I know not how ſhe ordered the buſineſs, that ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
his heel to be ſo ſenſible, as to be capable of a mortal wound. The wounds
which we may any way receive about the feet, are not dangerous; nay though it
were the <hi>Gangrene,</hi> there were no more then cutting off the foot, to hinder it from
gaining on the heart, and conſequently that the party die not. Had this <hi>Thetis</hi> been
minded to make <hi>Achilles</hi> abſolutely invulnerable, why did ſhe not put him quite
under water, and hold him by the hair of the head, and not hold him by a part
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:43725:144"/>
which muſt needs keep dry, and conſequently remain mortal; if his hair were not
yet come, why did ſhe not plunge his feet in after his head? You forget your ſelf,
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſays <hi>Hircan,</hi> you muſt not go ſo far in reforming the actions of the Divinities.
It muſt be believed, that whatever they have done hath been for the beſt. Were you
<hi>Clarimond</hi> who carps at all things, you could ſay no more. Yet I excuſe you for the
preſent ſince 'tis only the fear you are in leſt I ſhould not do my duty, makes you
ſpeak thus; and you would adviſe me, if I were to thruſt you over head and ears
in ſome water, to waſh your members one after another. But know there's no need
of all this: My charms are ſo powerfull, as to make you invulnerable with leſs
ceremony then was uſed by the Divinities. How do you properly explain that
word of <hi>Invulnerable?</hi> ſays <hi>Carmelin.</hi> That is to ſay, a thing that cannot be hurt
or wounded, replies <hi>Hircan.</hi> I beſeech you then let my Breeches have its part of
your charms, replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that it may never be hurt by uſe nor accident. If
there are wounds in thy cloaths, replies <hi>Hircan,</hi> make plaiſters for them of the
ſame ſtuffe; I do not employ my Art in things ſo low. But let's have no more
prating, be ſilent; I muſt charm you two with as much efficacie, as if you were in
the Palace of <hi>Circe</hi> the Suns daughter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> having ſaid this, did ſome extraordinary ceremonies, and repeated ſome
barbarous words: Then ſaid he to <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin,</hi> Aſſure your ſelves that
nothing can henceforth hurt you: You have no more to do then to get into my
Coach, which ſhall infallibly carry you to the enchanted Caſtle, where the fair
<hi>Pamphilia</hi> is. The two Shepherds went along with him out of the chamber into
the hall, where the company expected them. <hi>Hircan</hi> giving each of them a ſtick
in his hand, bid them ſtrike at an old earthen pot, which they preſently broke in
pieces. See you, ſays he to them, it will be as eaſie for you to break the head of a
monſter, as to break this veſſel. As for your parts, nothing can hurt you; and
that it is ſo, you ſhall now try. In ſaying ſo, <hi>Hircan</hi> took a Fire-pan; and making
as if he would give <hi>Lyſis</hi> a good blow, he moderated the violence of his arm when
he was neer his ſhoulders. 'Tis true, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> thou haſt but tickled me a little.
Let me alſo know what it is, ſays <hi>Carmelin. Hircan</hi> thereupon turn'd the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan
from the place where he ſeem'd to ſtrike, and diſcharg'd it on <hi>Carmelins</hi> but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks,
but ſo roughtly, that he made him ſcratch himſelf a good while after. This is
no jeſting, ſays he; methinks I ſhould have been arm'd there. All this is well,
replies <hi>Hircan:</hi> Thou ſhalt never ſuffer more hurt then thou haſt now felt; for
thoſe whom thou art to deal with are not ſo ſtrong as I am; and this is to aſſure
thee thou ſhalt never receive wound after what I have given thee. <hi>Carmelin</hi> being
a little comforted by this, wiſh'd for more pots and glaſſes for to try his forces
on; and <hi>Lyſis</hi> had the ſame deſire, if <hi>Hircan</hi> had kept them any longer at their
exerciſe. He therefore would diſmiſs them preſently; but <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſpoke to him in
this manner: Learned Magician! what doſt thou think on? Seeſt thou not we
have yet our garments of <hi>peace</hi> on? We ſhall be nothing terrible, if we have not
<hi>warlike</hi> habits on. For my part, I will be like a <hi>Heros,</hi> otherwiſe I will not hence.
Haſt thou not obſerved that repreſentation of <hi>Theſeus</hi> deſcent into hell, which
thou haſt in thy ſtudy? Since I am to fight with Monſters and Robbers, as that
brave Warriour did, I will be accoutred as he was.</p>
            <p>This put <hi>Hircan</hi> in mind of an old blew Guard-coat he had in the bottom of a
cheſt, which had ſometimes ſerv'd him in a mask: His man went and fetch'd it, and
<hi>Lyſis</hi> having viewed it, found it for his purpoſe. He took off his doublet for to put
it on; but becauſe it was half-ſleev'd, and was plated, and had little ſilver-nails, he
turn'd up his ſhirt above his elbow, and faſtened it there with pins, for to have his
arms bare, as your ancient Warriours are painted. He would alſo needs have his
thights bare, ſo that he went into the Wardrobe, where he put off his breeches and
his drawers, and ty'd up the fore and hind-part of his ſhirt. When he had done,
there were buskins brought him, which he had before ask'd for, he would put them
on his bare legs, and in this equipage he came back to the reſt. Somebody told him,
that he was very well accommodated according to the ancient mode, but nothing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:43725:145"/>
to the preſent, and that there was no Captain in the Kings Army that was ſo. Let
them follow their fancie, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and let me alone to follow mine. They ſhall
not make me believe that a ſort of raw younger brothers underſtand the <hi>Militia</hi>
as well as ſo many invincible <hi>Heroes</hi> that are placed in heaven. I ſhould not make
known my deſire to be of their number, if I did not imitate them as well in their
modes as in their manners. Beſides 'tis not to be thought I am the only man of this
age, that is clad as you ſee me: I can ſhew you how that the moſt able men that we
have, are cloathed as I am. 'Tis true they are <hi>Writers,</hi> but it it muſt be confeſs'd
they are <hi>Warriours</hi> too, ſince they have the confidence to be in the ſame garb as
<hi>Theſeus, Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Ajax.</hi> If it be replied again, They are not men of arms, I
will tell them that I have ſo much the more reaſon to be clad like a <hi>Hero,</hi> ſince per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of ſo mean quality preſume to do it.</p>
            <p>Upon that he call'd for the Works of ſeven or eight French <hi>Poets</hi> which <hi>Hircan</hi>
had in his Study, and he ſhewed them all, how at the beginning of every book
the Authors had cauſed themſelves to be drawn with <hi>Corſlets</hi> according to the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
mode. He concluded they went ſo clad, ſince they were ſo drawn; and that
they muſt needs grant him that, or freely confeſs that thoſe people were very fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick
and very extravagant, to be drawn in that poſture. That which was moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
was the picture of a <hi>Poet</hi> that was a <hi>Counſellor,</hi> who inſtead of his <hi>long robe</hi>
had as the reſt a <hi>Caſaque,</hi> after the ancient mode, like a <hi>Heros</hi> in a Medal, though
his countenance was the moſt pedantick thing in the world. Beſides, to avoid the
word <hi>Counſellor,</hi> which he thought not Court-like enough for a Love-book as his
was, he had put for his quality.</p>
            <p>All having ſufficiently laughted at theſe excellent imaginations, they told <hi>Lyſis</hi>
that he yet wanted ſomwhat for to be abſolutely accommodated to their imitation,
and that was, that he had no Crown of Laurel on his head. Nor have I yet gotten
any Victory, replies the new Warriour; I muſt wear only a Caſquet till that time.
But there is another thing wanting which you think not on: Do you not ſee that
theſe <hi>Heroes</hi> have I know not what about their necks? I cannot tell you what it is,
and yet I muſt have ſuch an ornament. Certainly 'tis a Napkin, ſayes <hi>Clarimond.</hi>
Thou art deceived, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that's unworthily ſpoken of <hi>Heroes,</hi> they are only
Tavern-boys that carry napkins on their ſhoulders. So do alſo the Sewers in Kings
houſes, replies <hi>Clarimond:</hi> But now I have better conſidered it, I'll tell you what
it is. 'Tis true, it is a Napkin; but about the necks of theſe people it is tied with a
knot upon their right ſhoulder, as if they were a trimming, and I believe the Painter
came to draw them when the Barber was ſetting up their muſtachoes, and that they
were repreſented in the poſture they were then in. Do not thou believe that, ſayes
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> it never was a Napkin, now I know the truth what it is; 'tis a Scarf which
theſe gallant men wear for a note of diſtinction between them and your common
Gentlemen, who wear theirs under their arm: I muſt needs have ſuch a one. I will
give you a blue one, if you will wear it, ſays <hi>Hircan.</hi> I thank thee for that proffer,
replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> But let us not go to work with ſo little conſideration. I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that theſe Scarfs which Heroes ſhould wear are <hi>blue,</hi> or <hi>red,</hi> or <hi>green,</hi> or <hi>yellow:</hi>
I am of opinion they are <hi>white,</hi> for to ſignifie the <hi>candor</hi> of their ſouls. That's very
hard to determine, ſayes <hi>Clarimond;</hi> for all ours are Copper-cuts, and here's no
limming to ſhew what colour the cloaths are of. <hi>Lyſis</hi> hath reaſon to believe that
his Scarf ſhould be white, ſays <hi>Hircan;</hi> the <hi>white</hi> is the colour of new-made Knights,
he muſt bear it, though I have heard ſay his Miſtreſſes colour is <hi>red.</hi> But this is the
miſery, that we have not ever a white ſcarf. There is only one remedy; I will give
him a Napkin as fine as any ſilk. In the time of the <hi>Ligue,</hi> the honeſt Citizens which
were Royaliſts had no other ſcarfs to ſhew which party they were of. I will not
contradict thee in any thing, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſo great is my deſire to be immediately
accommodated according to the ancient mode. Give me what ſcarf thou pleaſeſt,
whether it be ſilk, or whether it be thread; it will make me very brave, and very
proud, ſince it comes from thy hand.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Hircan</hi> went to fetch him a fair clean Napkin, which he put about his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:43725:145"/>
and faſtened it with a red riban upon his ſhoulder, that he might at leaſt by that
little knot have <hi>Charite</hi> in minde. They both in the mean time ſearch'd into their
books, to ſee if they did any thing which were not conformable to the pourtraictures
of the Poets.</p>
            <p>When the Shepherd was accommodated to his minde, <hi>Hircan</hi> put on his head
and old head-piece; but he told him, he yet wanted a ſword, and entreated <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
who had a good one to lend it him. <hi>Hircan</hi> anſwered him, he had another
fitter for him, becauſe it was an old faſhion'd one. He caus'd it and a belt to be
brought, and girt it about <hi>Lyſis. Carmelin</hi> obſerv'd all this myſtery without ſaying
any thing; and his maſter calling him to minde, acquainted <hi>Hircan,</hi> that he alſo
muſt be accommodated like an Heroes of Antiquity. <hi>Hircan</hi> anſwer'd, it was
enough for him to have arms according to the preſent mode, becauſe he was not ſo
deſerving as <hi>Lyſis;</hi> ſo that having ſent for old armor, that had been his great
Grandfathers, he was forc'd to put them on, much againſt his minde. Never was
man more amaz'd then <hi>Carmelin,</hi> when they had endors'd him with the Corſelet, and
faſtened on the arm pieces and the Taſles. He ſaid, they put him into an iron priſon,
but it was worſe when they put on the head piece: he told them, that they put his
head into a Kettle, and would never ſuffer the viſor to be let down. <hi>Hircan</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd
with his continual complaints, made him believe, that though his body
were as invulnerable as his Maſters, yet was he not ſo valiant as he, and that to
heighten his courage, 'twas not amiſs for him to be arm'd Cap-a-pea. What uſe
ſhall I have of theſe arms? replied he; they cumber me ſo, that I know not where
I am. I cannot carry my hand to my mouth, I cannot advance one foot before
another; and I am loaden, as if I carried a Tower.</p>
            <p>This burthen will ſeem light to thee after a while, ſaies <hi>Hircan;</hi> and thereupon
having put into his hand a Target of tann'd leather, he told <hi>Lyſis</hi> it was time to
be gone. <hi>Lyſis</hi> anſwered he was ready, if they would but give him a Javelin, or a
half-pike. But the Magician aſſur'd him he ſhould never need any; ſo that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to be gone; and having embrac'd all that were preſent, one after another,
he went down into the Court. He got into the coach with <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who was
very glad to ſit down and reſt him with his burthen. This is then the Chariot that
muſt carry us to the enchanted Caſtle, ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> I have look'd on the horſes,
but I cannot ſee any wings they have, though the Magician aſſur'd me divers times
they had. When you are once within, their wings will begin to appear, ſaies <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can;</hi>
and yet I muſt tell you, that for the preſent there will be no uſe for them, as
long as there is any ground for them to go on; they ſhall not take their flight, till
they come to the ſea: Then ſhall you go ſo faſt, that you ſhall think the coach
moves not at all: And there will be yet another miracle, and that is, that days ſhall
ſeem but minutes to you. When you come near the enchanted Caſtle, a Magician,
a friend of mine, will invite you to reſt your ſelves in a neighbouring Iſle which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to him: Do not you refuſe his proffers. We will obſerve thy directions,
ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but before I part, do me the favour as to let me ſee <hi>Meliantes,</hi> for
whom <hi>I</hi> am to do ſo many warlike exploits. This Gentleman had ever ſince ſupper
been buſie in writing of letters to <hi>Paris;</hi> they went to him, and bid him give over,
if he would ſee the departure of the valorous Champions. He with a fained joy
came to them, and aſſoon as he came into the Court, cryed out, O Generous War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors!
ſince you undertake to deliver my Miſtreſs out of captivity, I beſeech hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
proſper your arms: Farewell my dear friends, aſſure your ſelves you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
a man will ſerve you in life and death. Farewel friend, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> be confident
I'll do any thing I can for thy ſatisfaction: I deſire no other requital of thee, but
that to morrow morning thou go to the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Shepherds, and
bid them return to thoſe that ſent them, and give them an account how I live, and
how happy they may be with me. If they be here before my return, I deſire <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
to appoint a Harbinger to take up lodging for them, for they will be a great
number; but above all things, let there be a care had that no diſorder or falling
out happen about the paſtures. I hope in a ſhort time to be back to regulate all
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:43725:146"/>
things my ſelf. As for my Couſin <hi>Adrian,</hi> who returns by this way, I ſhall be glad
to miſs him, and that he get him to <hi>Paris</hi> without me. You may tell him what high
enterpriſes have taken me up. And as concerning my Miſtreſs, whom I reſerve to
the laſt, becauſe I cannot ſpeak of her without dying a thouſand times of grief:
Alas! I need ſend her no excuſes for my abſence, for I have well obſerv'd ſhe was
never much pleas'd at my preſence.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Lyſis</hi> ended theſe words, they made faſt the boots of the coach with chains,
and the Coachman drave on, taking his way towards a houſe of <hi>Hircans,</hi> which was
about a league off. This Gentleman bethought him of this extravagant invention to
make more ſport with the humors of <hi>Lyſis. Amarillis</hi> was return'd to her own houſe
before night; ſo that having no Miſtreſs to entertain, he went from his Caſtle with
the reſt, and follow'd the coach of the two Warriors. They follow'd a good way
off on horſe-back; and when they came to the Countrey-houſe, they found the
horſes taken out the coach, and that left under an arch of the houſe near the gate.
They alighted with as little noiſe as they could, and went to hearken what the brave
Champions ſaid. Seeſt thou <hi>Carmelin,</hi> ſayes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> how true is every thing that
<hi>Hircan</hi> ſaies? This Magician aſſur'd us, that when we came to the ſea, his horſes
ſhould take their flight, and would go ſo faſt, that we ſhould think we ſtirr'd not
from the place. That it is ſo, doſt not obſerve how that the coach ſtirs not all?
nay, we do not ſo much as hear the wheels, though its to be thought they turn
round as they paſs through the clouds. The reaſon of that is, becauſe extreamity
of motion ſeems to be immobility; and to this purpoſe, I will teach thee an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
piece of learning. A while ago I read <hi>Ovids Metamorphoſes,</hi> where I found
that the dog <hi>Laelaps,</hi> which had been preſented to <hi>Cephalus,</hi> purſued a beaſt ſo live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that one went no faſter then the other. The beaſt run as faſt as the dog; ſo
that they were ſtill at the ſame diſtance, and <hi>Laelaps</hi> gave many ſnatches in the
air in vain. At laſt the Hunter <hi>Cephalus</hi> having recourſe to his dart, was quite out
of himſelf, when thinking to caſt it at the beaſt, he found that the dog and it were
nothing but marble ſtatues, which were faſtned in the midſt of the field. Having ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
very much to finde a handſome explication of this, it came into my minde,
that the Poets ſaying that theſe two creatures were chang'd into ſtatues, was to
repreſent the extream ſwiftneſs of their courſe, and to teach men, what I now would,
that extream motion comes neareſt to reſt. This is a delicate expoſition it muſt be
confeſt, and I would not have it periſh, though my ordinary Tenent is, that Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſes
are rather truths then fictions; for I ſee not how this can anyway pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
my opinion: Let it be taken for an Allegory, rather then a Mythology. 'Tis
well known the learnedſt Doctors do allegorize on the greateſt verities in the world.
But to return to my diſcourſe, <hi>Carmelin,</hi> thou art to believe, that the extream ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our Chariot, hinders us to perceive its motion. Thou art not a man ſo freſh,
but thou haſt often ſeen experience of what I would perſwade thee too. If thou
turn a ſtick or a ſtring very faſt about, thou canſt not obſerve the divers turns of it.
And by this means would our ſenſes deceive us in every thing, if the underſtanding
which governs and directs them, did not aſſure us things were otherwiſe then they
are repreſented. As much Philoſophy as you will, replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> but tell me
not that our horſes flie. When you tell me we are now in the air; there's not a
vein about me that trembles not; and believe me, were it not that I am with you,
and that I think I cannot come to any ill fortune in your company, I ſhould cry
out murther. Thou wouldſt frighten the horſes, which haply would precipitate thee
into thee ſea, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> 'tis better be ſilent: it may be they'll flie ſo high, that
they'll carry us into heaven, where we ſhall ſee thoſe things whereof <hi>Aſtrologers</hi>
ſpeak only by conjecture: then ſhall we be able to make <hi>Almanacks,</hi> better then
any they ſell at <hi>Paris,</hi> and thoſe thou didſt ſometimes make. I will alſo calculate
Nativities; and that I may not fail in my ſpeculations, I will hold the ſtars in my
hands, and finde by looking on them, what fortunes they promiſe my friends: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be animate, or whether they can ſpeak, or whether they have every one
an intelligence that conducts them, and ſpeaks for them: I ſhall endeavor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:43725:146"/>
with them about their ſeveral influences, and queſtion them upon other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
We will thence go to the <hi>Colledge,</hi> where the <hi>Souls</hi> learn before they are
born what they muſt one day know. In that place there are good Spirits which
are <hi>Profeſſors</hi> among them, who put them to mighty diſcipline, if they profit not
under their inſtructions. <hi>Plato</hi> never thought of this, though he hath ſpoken ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
of <hi>Reminiſcence.</hi> We ſhall alſo meet with the two <hi>Tuns</hi> wherein <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
according to <hi>Homer's</hi> ſaying, puts in all the Good and Evil which he ſends among
men. I would have thee bring away with thee a Wallet-full of the Good thou ſhalt
find, that thou mayſt never more complain of being unhappy. I hope we ſhall alſo
be ſhewn the <hi>Ideas</hi> of all things in the world, and that we may come thither ſo
happily, as that we may be preſent at the ceremony of ſome <hi>Apotheoſis,</hi> that is to
ſay, we ſhall be there when ſome illuſtrious man is made a God. How ſhall we ſee
any thing, ſays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> ſince we are now as deep in the dark, as if we were in
our mothers bellies? Hope better and better, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> ſome good Angel will
come and deliver us out of this caſe wherein we are now lock'd up. Ah wretch that I
am, replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I may well ſay I am double-cas'd: beſides the caſe of our Coach,
I am lock'd up into my Arms as an Oyſter in the ſhell, or a knife in a ſheath.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen having heard theſe diſcourſes, whereat they were raviſh'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
every one into the lodging aſſign'd him; there they laugh'd it out, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to leave the valorous Champions in the coach till the morning. They had
word brought them, that they had given over diſcourſing; ſo that they inferr'd
they were aſleep; and becauſe it was ſomewhat late, they all laid them down
to reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> awoke at three in the morning, ſo paſſionate was he for the humours of
<hi>Lyſis;</hi> and ſoon after he made the reſt get up and make themſelves ready to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent
this valiant Shepherd. All things being ready, he went to the coach, and
having opened the boots, he with a counterfeit voyce call'd <hi>Lyſis.</hi> He, who was
not aſleep, ask'd him preſently what he would with him. Know that I am the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician
which muſt conduct thee to the enchanted Caſtle, ſayes <hi>Hircan;</hi> come out
and follow me: Let the good man that is with thee, come alſo. Upon that <hi>Lyſis</hi>
call'd <hi>Carmelin</hi> as loud as he could, but yet he awaked not; the encumbrance of
his arms, it ſeems, hindred not his reſt. His Maſter at length call'd him ſo often,
that he awoke; but he bidding him come out of the Coach, he told him 'twas a
thing impoſſible for him to do, and that he thought he was nail'd to it, ſo heavy
was the burden he had upon him. Upon that <hi>Lyſis</hi> and the Magician took him out
of his place by force: Hold by the tail of my gown, ſays the Magician to the two
Warriours, I will bring you under ground to the place where you deſire to go.
<hi>Lyſis</hi> took <hi>Hircan</hi> by the gown, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> took <hi>Lyſis</hi> by his ſhort coat; and
thus they paſs'd through obſcure ſtables, where the two Warriours were in as much
fear one as another. At laſt <hi>Hircan</hi> having brought them down certain ſtairs, told
them he muſt leave them, and that now they need but come forwards, and be ſure
to be on their guards. <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſorry to leave ſo good a guide, paſs'd along a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
at the end whereof was a great Cellar, where there was ſome light, by reaſon
of two candles ſtuck to the wall. Before he went in, he ask'd <hi>Carmelin</hi> whether he
had a good ſword, or no. I a ſword! ſays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I never durſt ſee one naked;
I could better handle a Hedg-bill: you never thought to give me one, and I never
thought to ask you for one. I have here a great Flake to defend my ſelf (for ſo he
call'd his Buckler) but I would to God, continued he, I had my Smoothing-plane
for to ſmooth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the noſes of the Monſters we ſhall meet with, or that I had my
Wimble to bore holes in their buttocks! Since thou art armed only for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive,
and not for the offenſive part, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I muſt fight for thee; and I
am not ſorry for it, for the greater will be my glory. Let us advance then, and ſee
in what kind of place we are.</p>
            <p>The two Warriours were no ſooner entred the Cellar, but they perceiv'd the
forms of two Gyants making towards them. Theſe two Monſters running towards
them, ſometimes became as little as men of ordinary ſtature; then preſently they
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:43725:147"/>
lifted up their heads to the roof, as if their necks were lengthened by ſcrues. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin</hi>
finding himſelf perſecuted by one of theſe Gyants, cry'd out as loud as if he
had been flaid alive. But his maſter obſerving that they had no arms, he was not ſo
much afraid, and imagined there were no more to do but to cut off that long neck
that made them ſeem terrible. He went to draw his ſword, but it was ſo ruſty that
it was impoſſible to get it out of the ſcabberd. 'Twas then he thought himſelf an
improvident Warriour, to come to a combat without ſeeing that his arms were fixt.
Yet in neceſſity to make uſe of what he had, he took the ſword out of the belt, and
with it as it was in the ſcabberd he beſtow'd good blows on the Gyants necks, but
he did them no hurt, for he ſtruck only againſt a ſtick covered about with courſe
cloaths, at the end whereof was a falſe head, which he that was under lifted up and
let down at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> acted this part, and 'twas no ſmall pleaſure to them to
terrifie the Warriours. But at laſt <hi>Lyſis</hi> perceiving he was never the neerer cutting
off their heads, directed his blows below, which made them run away as faſt as they
could, the ſame way that <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> were come thither. I need not deſpair
though I cannot draw my ſword, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Theſe are evil <hi>Spirits,</hi> which as ſoon
as they are touch'd with any weapon whatſoever, ſuffer a <hi>ſolution</hi> of <hi>continuity</hi> (to
ſpeak in Philoſophical terms:) Let them come in multitudes; the more they are,
the more will be my victories.</p>
            <p>While the valiant Shepherd ſaid this, there iſſued out at a little door three hulch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back'd
fellows, who had faces ſo ugly, as could not be look'd on without horror.
One of them, which was <hi>Philiris,</hi> began to ſound an alarm on a Barrels head with
two ſticks, as if he had beaten a Drum; and the other two, who were <hi>Meliantes</hi>
and <hi>Polidor,</hi> came and gave <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> a many blows with the breadth of
their ſwords. How now, Raſcals! (ſays one of them with a hollow hoarſe voice)
we'll ſend you back again to keep your ſheep: 'Tis a fine employment for ſuch
Ruſticks to go clad like Knights, and to imagine they can bring about the ſtrangeſt
adventure in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> in the mean time avoided the blowes the beſt he could: And as for <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin,</hi>
having not the wit to put them off with his buckler, he held it by one end
as if it had been a trencher, and at laſt caſt it at the head of one of the monſters.
He would afterwards have gladly run away; but he found his Arms ſo heavy, that
he thought them a greater hinderance then help to him. For to be therefore rid of
them, and to do ſome good with them by leaving them behind him, he ſtrove to
get them off. The thongs of his Head-piece were ſo worne, that they were eaſily
broken; ſo that he took it with both hands and threw it at his enemies: He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
took off the Arm-pieces, and ſent them the ſame way; and then he unlac'd
his Armour and hurl'd it at them, till he was quite diſarm'd. Some of his blowes
reach'd them ſo home, that they had a great deſire to return them. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
renewed their charge both on the maſter and man; though only <hi>Lyſis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
and gave them ſome blows on the bunch they had before, which ſerv'd them
for a breaſt-plate. At laſt theſe two Monſters got the two Warriours ſo neer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that with a thruſt they laid them on the ground. They fell down upon
them; and after they had well pinch'd their noſes, and pull'd them by the ears, they
ran away with him that beat the drum. <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> had much ado to
get up again, ſo weak were they grown; yet did they firmly perſwade themſelves
they were the Conquerours, ſince they were maſters of the field. Ah Cowards!
cries out <hi>Carmelin,</hi> you are run away to die in ſome hole; for the hurts we have
given you will not ſuffer you to live long: You were aſham'd to die before us; but
if you come in my way, I will give you good bangs after you are dead. 'Tis not
yet time to brag, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> 'tis want of conſideration, rather then true valour,
makes thee ſpeak ſo big. What wilt thou do, poor fellow, if there be yet more
enemies? thou art quite diſarm'd. My confidence is, that I can receive no more
hurt then your ſelf, ſays <hi>Carmelin.</hi> But alas! have we gone through our exploits?
do I not ſee a terrible Dragon appear?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:43725:147"/>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> thereupon look'd towards a corner of the Cellar, which he had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
before; he there perceives a great Bug-bear, that had the head of a Wolf, and
a body like that of a Crocodile, It was a good while ere he durſt come near it;
but ſeeing that the Monſter ſtirr'd not, he preſum'd to give it a blow, with his
ſword. <hi>Carmelin</hi> caſt at it a piece of his armor that he found, ſo that the Engine
began to ſhake, it being faſtned on one foot, and conſequently eaſily moved. The
motion of it put our two Warriors into ſuch a fear, that they thought it liv'd; and
yet <hi>Lyſis</hi> was ſo couragious that he laid on ſtill, till ſuch time as he had brought it
to the ground, and made it immoveable. His charges were ſo home, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Monſter, which was but of rotten Canvas, burſt in divers places, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
came out moſs, hay, foul paper and rags, which <hi>Lyſis</hi> was ſo amaz'd at; that he
cry'd out, See here, <hi>Carmelin,</hi> what lewd entrals come out of the body of this
hideous beaſt: methinks we are poiſoned with them. On my ſoul, they are nothing
but rags, ſays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> do you not ſee them? Thou art in the right, ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi>
but that is it makes me wonder the more, when I conſider that Spirits have
ſometimes animated this Engine ſtuffed with filth, for to deceive men. It may alſo
well be, that this was a true Dragon, but that all theſe tatters come out of its body,
as we ſee bewitched people vomit coals, pieces of glaſs, inkhorns, and ſuch trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.
Honeſt <hi>Lyſander</hi> aſſures us it is ſo, in his hiſtory, which the gentle <hi>D' Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guier</hi>
hath compoſed. There came ſuch things out of his body, when he was dres'd
by charms of ſome wounds he had receiv'd in a Combat.</p>
            <p>While the two Champions were viewing the hideous body of the Monſter, a ſad
voyce comes to their ears, ſhall I never be delivered out of the captivity wherein
I am? ſaies it; when will the moſt illuſtrious valour in the world be employ'd for
my relief? <hi>Lyſis</hi> preſently conceiv'd it was <hi>Pamphilia</hi> ſpoke; and pittying her
miſery, he with his foot made at a little door, which ſeemed to be that of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
It opened preſently, and in a little Cellar, he found a deſolate Maid, whom
he took for <hi>Meliantes</hi>'s Miſtreſs. 'Twas a youth diſguis'd for that purpoſe, who
could act his part very well. He caſt himſelf at <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s feet aſſoon as he ſaw him;
and embracing his knees, call'd him her deliverer. <hi>Lyſis</hi> made the fair Lady riſe,
and taking her by the hand, bid <hi>Carmelin</hi> take a candle to light them out of the
darkneſs of the Priſon. <hi>Pamphilia</hi> made as if ſhe trembled as ſhe went; ſo that
<hi>Lyſis</hi> for her greater confidence, told her, that he had kill'd all her Jaylors, and
that ſhe need not fear to fall into their hands any more. As they went through
low rooms, and ſtumbled againſt ſome houſhold-ſtuff that lay in their way. <hi>Hircan</hi>
diſguis'd as before, appear'd again, and with the ſame voyce ſaid to them, Follow
me incomparable Heroes, I will bring you hence ſafely. Having ſo ſaid, he led
them to the Coach, whereinto alſo enter'd the fair <hi>Pamphilia:</hi> he afterwards made
faſt the boots with chains; and being return'd to his companions, they all put on
their ordinary cloathes, got on horſeback, and returned with him to his Caſtle,
where they preſently went to bed to reſt themſelves a little. In the mean time <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
Coachman having kept the Adventurers three or four hours in the Coach,
put the horſes into it, and brought them to his Maſters; according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
he had receiv'd. When the coach mov'd not from the place, <hi>Lyſis</hi> thought
ſtill it went through the ayr; and when it began to make a noiſe, he then thought
it was on firm ground, and that it would not be long ere they came to <hi>Hircans</hi>
houſe. As indeed a little while after, the boot being unchain'd and opened, he found
himſelf in a Court he was well enough acquainted with. <hi>Carmelin</hi> being come out
of the coach with him, they helped out <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> and led her to <hi>Hircans</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
who was a bed with <hi>Meliantes.</hi> Welcome be the generous Heroes, who have
delivered <hi>Pamphilia</hi> out of priſon, cry'd out the Magician: Riſe <hi>Meliantes</hi> to give
them thanks. Upon that <hi>Meliantes</hi> put on a night gown, and went and embrac'd
them with a many complements. He afterwards turn'd to <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
with a many careſſes, and much Courtſhip. She was no longer cruel to
him, ſince his paſt ſervices, and the care he had had of her deliverance out of capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
had ſoftned her heart towards him. <hi>Hircan</hi> in the mean time having put on his
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:43725:148"/>
cloathes, caus'd to be brought him two crowns of Lawrel, whereof he put one on
<hi>Lyſis's</hi> head, having taken away the head-piece, and the other on <hi>Carmelins.</hi> Think
you I will be content with this hat? ſays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> it will keep off neither the cold
nor the rain, let me have my own, which I left off to take a rotten head-piece. Its
a long time ſince I have been bare-headed. Thy head is well enough covered for a
Conqueror, ſaies <hi>Hircan:</hi> ask thy Maſter, if the pictures of all Heroes, are not as
thine is now. Let my picture be drawn all naked, if you pleaſe, but for my own
true body, I ſhould have it cloath'd Cap-a-pea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Carmelin</hi> would not hear of accommodating himſelf in an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
manner as he was, permitted he might have his hat: which when he had, he
put the Lawrel-crown about it like a hat-band, which look'd very prettily. <hi>Philiris,
Polidor, Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> upon this came into the room, and made great
acclamations of joy for the happy return of the valorous Shepherds. <hi>Lyſis</hi> was
entreated to relate the divers fortunes he had run through; who ſeeing they were
all dreſt, and expected the ſtory, began in this manner.</p>

                        <head>The MAGICAL Adventures of
LYSIS.</head>
                        <p>YOu are then to know, courteous Preſence, that our coach being parted
hence, we were nothing aſtoniſh'd while it went on firm ground; but when
it went through the air, 'twas then that I had a hard task to aſſure <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin;</hi>
for we heard the winds blowing, the thunder whirling, and the ſea toſſing
up her waves, even to the clouds. But at laſt we were as quiet, as if we would have
repos'd our ſelves a little; when there comes a ſage old man, who opening the
boot, led us into a mountain to recreate our ſelves, where we ſtaid ſometime. I
am not certain whether we were in an Iſland, or whether this Magician was <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
friend, whom he had ſpoken to us of: But ſo it is, that he brought us into a
Grot, which ſhin'd all over, by the Diamonds and Carbuncles wherewith the
walls were all cover'd over; and having laid a white cloath on a black marble
table, there were ſerved up ten or twelve diſhes of meat, whereon we fed till we
were ſatisfied; and we drank of ſuch a delicate wine, that I think Nectar is not
more. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was ſo raviſhed at it, that he confeſt he never had been ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained.
I pray bate ſo much of your Bill, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> all you ſay is falſe,
under correction of the company: Do not ſay that I made ſuch a good meal
with you, I have not eaten a bit ſince I went hence. How ſhouldſt thou live then?
replies <hi>Lyſis</hi> very angrily: its at leaſt fifteen days ſince we went hence; haſt thou
lived all this while without eating? Well, impudence, were it not out of reſpect
to thoſe who are preſent, I would chaſtiſe thee as thou deſerveſt; but I muſt
not interrupt my diſcourſe for ſo ſmall a matter as thee.</p>
                        <p>This Company then is to know, that the old man having made us both eat,
without diſarming us, carried us into a garden, where the Gods ſeem'd to have
married together the Spring and Autumn; for there ſhin'd a clear Sun without
heat, and yet the fruits on the trees were ripe, and in the Level all ſorts of flowers.
As for Summer and Winter, I think they were eternally baniſhed thence, and that
the one was gone to burn up <hi>Mauritania,</hi> the other to freeze up <hi>Scythia.</hi> The
place was inhabited by great yellow and green <hi>Birds,</hi> which had the charge to
cultivate it: Some with their bills prun'd off their ſuperfluous branches, and
others lopp'd off and levell'd the hedg-rows; there were ſome that brought
water in little ſhells to water the Plants, and others made Poſies. But that which
was moſt to be admired, was, that they ſpoke like men, and told one another
what ought to be done with much ratiocination. I learned of them ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of their Republique, and they brought me to ſee their Shees and their
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:43725:148"/>
young ones: I alſo ſaw all their proviſions, and heard them ſing certain aires
which they uſed to make themſelves merry with on their dayes of recreation. So
that I ſwore to them, that I wiſh'd with all my heart I had been metamorphoſed
into a Bird, that I might have led ſuch a pleaſant life as theirs. They anſwered,
it was not ſo pleaſant as I thought it; for though they were in a very delightfull
place, yet had they not much joy in it, when they conſidered it was the place of
their captivity, and that they were only Tenants, and not the owners of it, and
that it belong'd to certain men, whom I might ſee if I would go a little
further.</p>
                        <p>I went ſo far, that I came to their walls, which were ſo high that they were
not able to flie over them; and my Conductor having opened a little door, I
paſs'd through with him and <hi>Carmelin.</hi> We ſaw a field that was very dry and
very ſandy, wherein were men ſtark naked, who had on their bodies neither fleſh
nor fat, and were only cover'd with a skin tranſparent as oyl'd paper: A man
could ſee through it their bones, their veins, their ſinews, their muſcles, and their
intrals; ſo that for to learn Anatomy, he needed but look on them. Their
Hearts were moſt cleery ſeen, as alſo what was imprinted in them: As for
example, in one you might ſee the countenance of ſome fair Lady, who was his
Miſtreſs; and in another, a great heap of ſilver which he ador'd as his God.
There was alſo to be ſeen an Hieroglyphical figure of the words they were to
ſpeak, from the ſtomach to the throat; and by reaſon they had no hair, 'twas
eaſily perceiv'd what ſtrange imaginations they had in their brains, which they
diſpoſed there under ſeveral repreſentations of divers colours. Though my guide
laught at them, yet I thought their converſation very pleaſant, and was ſorry
to leave them. They came very confidently near me; but they kept off from
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> becauſe he was armed, and that they feared leſt he might come and
embrace them, or ſo much as touch them as he paſſed by, leſt it ſhould grate off
their delicate skin. I ſhould have been very glad to have lived among men that
could not conceal what they thought, though they ſhould deſire it; but the old
man told me that ſhould I but ſee their wives, which ſex I loved better then the
maſculine, I ſhould ſoon hate that people, for they were not of the humor to
be willing that men ſhould be acquainted with their affairs; and having their
bodies Diaphanous as their husbands, they put gown upon gown for to hide it,
that their fantaſtical imaginations might not be ſeen. To ſatisfie my curioſity, he
brought me to a Furnace under ground, where thoſe people put their children
to make them tranſparent as themſelves, for they were not ſo from the mothers
womb. I put my finger into the fire, to ſee if it were hot; and <hi>Carmelin</hi> would
do the like: but it burn'd ſo, that we were fain to pull them out immediately.
If you will know the truth, look on mine and <hi>Carmelin's</hi> right hand.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Clarimond</hi> and ſome others look'd on their hands, whereon they found
certain redneſſes which were there by chance; ſo that every one ſaid that <hi>Lyſis</hi>
was to be believed in whatſoever he ſaid. Yet <hi>Carmelin</hi> did nothing but grumble,
as if he had a mind to contradict all his Maſter ſaid.</p>
                        <p>Walking on ſtill with the old man, continued <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I came to a River; which
though it was very cleer, yet was it not more tranſparent then the bodies I had
ſeen. My Guide having invited me to croſs it, I ask'd whether there were either
any boat or bridg. Come over this bridg, ſaid he to me ſmiling; and I preſently
ſaw him going through the air upon the water: I told him I could not do the
like, but he came and took me by the hand, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> alſo; and making us
go the ſame way as he did himſelf, we were amaz'd to find reſiſtance under our
feet, as if we had gone on firm ground, whereas we thought we had paſs'd through
the aire. My eyes at length being more clear'd up, I perceiv'd we were on a chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal
bridge, which was ſo clear, that a man could not diſcern it from the water.
<hi>Carmelin</hi> ſtill ignorant of what it was, came forwards extream fearfully.</p>
                        <p>At the end of this bridge, there ſtood a Tower, the walls whereof were of glaſs,
ſolid enough, and tranſparent enough; but as to the walks on them, they, as
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:43725:149"/>
as wel as the bridge were of cryſtal ſo tranſparent, that being out of curioſity got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
up on them, I durſt not walk thereon, imagining there were none at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
being on high, I could ſee the ground below toward the foundation. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
that that was one of the marches of the Country of the Diaphanous
people; and having walk'd yet another half hour with the old man, I came to
a very barren Champion. We have walkt a long time, ſaid he to me, I muſt now
have you to a collation in a magnificient palace, which I have here: I thought
he had jeered me; for I ſaw no building, and yet I took it patiently from him.
But he ſeeing I anſwered not, I think, ſaid he, you doubt of my power; you
ſhall ſee the effects of it. Turning my ſelf preſently about towards the eaſt, ſouth,
weſt and north, I ſaw that from each quarter there came a great ſide of wall:
Theſe four flying pieces of building meeting together, made up but one edifice,
which was a fair ſpacious Hall, in the midſt whereof we found our ſelves: imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after, there fell down upon that a roof, like that of a Banqueting houſe,
on the top whereof there was a glaſſen Turret to let in the light. While I lift up
my head to look on it, I perceived not the ſtarting up of a round table, and three
chairs at my feet: <hi>Carmelin</hi> took notice of it, as having his underſtanding fix'd
on thoſe things which concern the reparation of his ſubſtance. He preſently told
me of it: Here's a fair table, ſaid he, but it were better it did not appear ſo
fair. 'Twere a greater credit to the Maſter of it, if it were well cover'd. Let's
ſit about it however, ſaies the old man, my ſervants will bring us ſomewhat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.
I thought this Magician did ſtill nothing but abuſe us, and looking about
the hall, I could perceive no body; the walls only were hung with the richeſt ſort
of Tapiſtry, behinde which I knew not but his ſervants might be hidden. Hola!
my Lads there! crys out the Magician, you make us ſtay long: Is there no meat
in the houſe? I was then looking on the ſtory that was repreſented in the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which was the marriage of ſome Roman Emperor, and methought I ſaw all
the perſons ſtirring, and a many ſlaves who were ſerving up diſhes on their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
table, came out of the hangings, and walk'd up and down the hall, as if they
had been alive, and came and brought us what they had in their hands. To
make it appear it was no fained thing, that piece of the Tapiſtry whence they
came out was empty, and there remained only the Canvas; ſo that they were
men of ſilk and wool that ſerved us. I never had ſeen ſuch attendants; and when
the old man pray'd me to eat what was on the table: I told him I knew not how
to eat hangings. Its very excellent hangings, replyed pleaſantly <hi>Carmelin;</hi> I
have taſted the corner of a cake, which was ſo delicious, that I wiſh to God
all the reſt may be like it, there would be ſtriving who ſhould have moſt. He
perſwaded me ſo far, that I eat of a Tart made of herbs, and certain ſweet-meats,
which I found very excellent. Thirſt forc'd me alſo to ask for drink of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſlaves. They brought me a wine ſo delicious, that it made me forget the
taſte of that I had drunk with the old man in the Grot. As for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he
drank above ten times, and becauſe the ſlaves took the flagons of wine out of a
buffet in the Tapiſtry: Ha! would he ſay every foot; now it may be eaſily
ſeen that this is Tapiſtry-wine. It ſlides down the throat by threads ſmaller then
thoſe of gold and ſilk.</p>
                        <p>This good companion was ſo frolick, that he would ſay to me, Maſter, let us
even leave <hi>Meliantes</hi> and his fair enchanted Miſtreſs: Let's here accompliſh our
adventure; if you value my advice any thing you will ſtay here, ſervants will coſt
us nothing to maintain, and the meat will ſtand us in nothing, all will come out
of the Tapiſtry. Doſt thou think this good fortune can laſt long? replyed I: we
have already eat up all the proviſions that was brought hither, and I know not
whether thoſe grave Roman Senators, whom I ſee at table in the tapiſtry, will
not be angry with us. We have diverted their ſlaves from ſerving them, and we
have made good chear of what was provided for them. Its a long time they have
waited there, and the ſecond courſe is not yet come; I believe they grow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
out of patience, and will not vouchſafe to taſte of what's before them. They
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:43725:149"/>
ſhall not want what is neceſſary for them, ſaies the Magician to me; and they
will never be ſo uncivil as to be angry at us. That they are now ſo quiet and ſilent,
'tis becauſe they are conſulting about ſome great warlike expedition, which they
are to undertake, Beſides, ſhould you ſtay here a hundred years, you ſhould
not want any thing; but <hi>I</hi> am ſorry <hi>I</hi> can no longer enjoy ſuch gueſts. As he
ſaid this, the ſlaves took away our diſhes, glaſſes and bottles, and with all, that
equipage went again into the Tapiſtry, which ſeem'd ſo ſtrange to me, that I yet
feele an amazement of it in my ſelf. The roof of the hall rais'd it ſelf up, and
fled into heaven, and our table ſunk into the ground, and then our four walls
return'd to the four quarters of the world. Our coach we found in the Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and being gotten into it with <hi>Carmelin, I</hi> thank'd the old man for all his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities.
He made all faſt as it was before; and <hi>I</hi> believe the horſes preſently took
their flight: but we ſet our ſelves to ſleep till ſuch time as another old man came
and advertis'd us that we were in <hi>Pamphilia's</hi> priſon. We were by him led through
places ſo hideous and full of darkneſs, that <hi>Hercules</hi> himſelf would there have
loſt ſomewhat of his confidence.</p>

            </q>
            <p>This is indeed the place where you begin to tell the truth (ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who
could hold his tongue no longer) 'Tis true, that a grave old man brought us out
of the coach, to carry us into the priſon; but before this we had not ſeen any at
all, nor know I any thing of all the adventures wherein you engage me. You dreamt
them likely when you ſlept in the coach; and as mens dreams have no relation, though
they reſt in the ſame place, ſo my minde hath not been entertain'd with any ſuch
imaginations. I pray excuſe me, if I ſpeak freely; but of all you have related,
nothing troubles me more then what you ſay of my feaſting with ſo much gluttony,
I am at this preſent hungrier then a Huntſman; and I proteſt to you once more,
as I did before, that nothing enter'd my body, nor nothing hath gone through it
ſince we went from this place. And to take away all controverſie, I profer to eaſe
my ſelf in any place, and thoſe that are skill'd in ſuch matters, ſhall judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I have return'd what I ate when I laſt ſupp'd here, or ſome more exquiſite
ſtuff. After the eating of ſo much enchanted Tapiſtry, I muſt needs ſend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
fine skains of ſilk and yarn, or rather fair twiſts of gold: I would it were
ſo, 'twould be a great credit to me, 'twould be ſaid I disburthen'd my ſelf of gold,
and not any filthy excrement.</p>
            <p>Peace <hi>Carmelin,</hi> ſaies <hi>Hircan,</hi> thy diſcourſe and wit is obſcene; thou thinkſt thou
art now with thy ſick Hypocondriake Maſter, who knew the weight and meaſure of
all thy ſtools. Whatever thou canſt ſay, <hi>Lyſis</hi> is rather to be believed then thou;
and the company entreats thee not to interrupt his relation any farther. <hi>Carmelin</hi>
being ty'd up to ſilence, which the reſt keeping alſo, his Maſter continued his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
in this manner:</p>
            <q>
               <p>The old man having left us, we were in a Cellar, where there was light, but
only ſo much as to let us ſee the moſt horrible things in the world, and ſo to
terrifie us. There preſented themſelves unto us two Gyants, who were ſo big,
that I know not how they did not thruſt up the roof, when they lifted up their
heads. Sometimes, which was the thing moſt to be admir'd, they became as
little as we, to recollect their forces as may be conceived; and though they had
no arms, yet did they annoy us much, by running againſt us. However, I made
a ſhift to rout them; and afterwards I had no more work but to fight with two
knappy fellows, that fell on us with ſwords in their hands. At every blow they
had at my head-piece, I think it made more ſparkles then an iron red hot, which
the Smith beats on the Anvile: For my part, I could not get my ſword out of
the Scabbard, yet did it not hinder but I gave them terrible blows. Why had
I not a Club, with ſo many iron ſpikes in it, as that of <hi>Hercules?</hi> Or why had
I not a half Pike, as <hi>I</hi> deſired of <hi>Hircan</hi> at my departure? He ſwore to me I
ſhould have no need of it; but yet if I had had one, it would have done me
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:43725:150"/>
ſervice; my enemies ſhould not have ſtood it out ſo long. I remember that in
your propheſie <hi>Hircan,</hi> you ſaid, that, <hi>The Dove ſhould be covered with Eagles
feathers, and that it ſhould deſtroy the Faulcons;</hi> I believe that I am that <hi>Dove</hi>
without gall, who am become an <hi>Eagle;</hi> and queſtionleſs the <hi>Faulcons</hi> which <hi>I</hi>
have deſtroyed are my enemies. You alſo ſaid, that the <hi>Clowns jump ſhould be
chang'd into a Corſlet.</hi> This is fulfill'd in <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and in me alſo, for this <hi>Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat</hi>
is as good as a <hi>Corſlet.</hi> It follow'd, <hi>that the ſtring that hangs the Scrip, ſhould
be chang'd into a ſwords belt;</hi> that alſo is come to paſs in me: but when I find <hi>that
the Sheephook ſhould be changed into a half Pike,</hi> and that there is nothing accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
as to that point, methinks there is ſomewhat wanting in the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            </q>
            <p>You muſt not be ſo ſcrupulous, ſaies <hi>Hircan,</hi> Propheſies are not always taken
litterally. I ſaid all that by a figure, it ſuffices that of a Shepherd, you are become
a man of arms, and that according to my promiſe you have delivered <hi>Pamphilia</hi>
out of Priſon.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I will then go on with my relation, as being extreamly ſatisfied, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi>
Though I defended my ſelf the beſt I could againſt the hulch-back'd Souldiers, yet
was I ſo unfortunate, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> too, that we both fell down, having ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
againſt ſome ſtones that were under our feet. The hulch-back'd Knaps
preſently came upon us, and knowing we were invulnerable, they imagin'd there
was no other way to make us dye, but to choak us. They would drive the ſouls
out of our bodies by ſome new ſecret; for they pulled us by the noſes as hard
as ever they could, that it might drop out with wiping them, ſince it could not
go out at any wound. At laſt we gave them each of us ſuch a ſhock, that they
were forc'd to leave us. This done, we perceived a Dragon, which though it
was a terrible ſight, yet I made towards it, and notwithſtanding its hard ſcalineſs,
I gave him a great wound on the back, whereof he dyed. That done, I went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Dungeon, where <hi>Pamphilia</hi> was, whom I brought out of thoſe ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
places; and by doubtful ways led her to the coach, with the help of the
Magician, whom I met again.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Meliantes</hi> is to know, that I bring him his Miſtreſs as chaſte as I found
her, &amp; though ſhe hath been lockt up with two men, ſhe hath been no more toucht
then if ſhe had been among ſtatues: For my part, I did not ſo much as ſpeak to
her, leſt ſhe ſhould ſuſpect I would corrupt her; and the remembrance of <hi>Charite</hi>
fortified me againſt any looſe deſires that ſhould aſſault me. As for <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
becauſe he was an inconſtant perſon, I prevented him as much I could poſſible
from meddling any thing; and I think carried all things ſo well, that ſhe hath
no cauſe to complain. She will tell you how I diſpos'd her behinde, and <hi>Carmelin</hi>
before, and my ſelf in the boot, to be between them.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having thus ended his diſcourſe, there was none but confeſt in himſelf, that the
relation was excellent; and that though there were ſome that knew moſt accidents
in the adventure, yet was his deſcription of it ſo natural, that he grac'd the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
more then was imagin'd. As for his dream of enchantments, every one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
its variety. <hi>Meliantes</hi> renewed his thanks, but they were interrupted by
<hi>Carmelin;</hi> who comes and ſaies, And ſhall I have no thanks? or is it conceiv'd I
have ſuffered nothing? Can I ſuffer that my Maſter ſhould darken my reputation,
by laying incontinence to my charge? The ill opinion he hath of thee, ſaies <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond,</hi>
is but an illuſion. That is not all neither, continues <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I would not
that in the relation of his victory over the Monſters, he make you believe he hath
done all himſelf: Should he ſpeak on his honour and his oath, and if he were to lift
up his hand, he will not deny, but I have helped him much. I acknowledge thou
art the true companion of my travels, ſaith <hi>Lyſis;</hi> if I am <hi>Hercules,</hi> thou art my
<hi>Euriſteus;</hi> if <hi>I</hi> am <hi>Theſeus,</hi> thou art my <hi>Perithous.</hi> Excuſe me, if I have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thy aſſiſtance, it being in ſo extraordinary a manner; which was, thou haſt
ſhewn thy ſelf as valiant in caſting away thy arms, as others are in keeping
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:43725:150"/>
them. If I ſhall one day have draughts or ſtatues to repreſent my ſtory, aſſure
thy ſelf thou ſhalt not be forgotten there, but ſhalt be put in a very good poſture.
Yet now I think on't, when our enemies were vanquiſhed, there would have been
no danger to have taken up thy arms again, and brought them hither; for if ſome
cunning knave finde them, he will give it abroad, that it was thou wert defeated. It
alſo repents me we have not brought with us whatever we might have found of
booty from the Monſters we fought with, which might have been viſible teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of our valour to all the world. We ſhould have carried away the drummer
of the Crump-back'd Souldiers, and the entrails of the enchanted Dragon, of which
might have been rais'd a Trophy upon the top of a pike, before this Caſtle. Our
horſes would not have fled ſo chearfully, had they had ſuch a weight to draw, ſaies
<hi>Carmelin:</hi> Lets then content our ſelves with what is done, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but if
ever <hi>Meliantes</hi> paſs by the enchanted Iſland, <hi>I</hi> would deſire him to raiſe a <hi>Pyramid</hi>
to our ſempiternal glory.</p>
            <p>After ſome other diſcourſes, <hi>Hircan</hi> invited the company into the Hall to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
They all came except <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> who vaniſhed away, becauſe the Lad that
acted that part was in haſte to put on his former cloathes. <hi>Lyſis</hi> asked <hi>Meliantes</hi>
what he had done with his Miſtreſs. He anſwered, that he lock'd her up into a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
whither was brought her what ſhe wanted, until ſuch time as they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into their Country, becauſe ſhe was much given to a ſolitary life.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon <hi>Orontes, Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> came to <hi>Hircans: Lyſis</hi> had
ſtill on his Heroick habit, which ſeem'd to them the moſt pleaſant thing in the
world; but it was better ſport to them to hear him and <hi>Carmelin</hi> briefly relate
their ſeveral adventures. But ſuch diſcourſes ended, <hi>Lyſis</hi> remembred him to ask
whether the Pariſian Ambaſſadors were not yet return'd? and if that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Shepherds of whom they had brought intelligence were not yet come. The
Ambaſſadors are departed, replies <hi>Orontes;</hi> but we have heard nothing of them
ſince; and <hi>I</hi> know not what hindrance hath met with ſo many honorable Shepherds
as were to come hither. <hi>I</hi> wonder they are not here, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I have been hence
at leaſt fifteen days upon my adventure to the enchanted Caſtle; for the hours paſt
away as faſt as minutes in <hi>Hircans</hi> coach. Have they haply had notice of my abſence?
O God! how dangerous is it to be diſtant from a people a man is to govern: cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and change ſeizeth all things, now <hi>I</hi> perceive it well; for even <hi>Orontes</hi> is
grown looſe, and hath quitted the Shepherds habit, to put on that of a Gentleman.
You have done as much your ſelf, ſaies <hi>Orontes;</hi> are not you in a habit diſconform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to your quality? There was a neceſſity <hi>I</hi> ſhould take it, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and <hi>I</hi>
promiſe thee, though many think it becomes me well, to quit it to morrow, and
to put on the Paſtoral; for it ſuffices that I am ſeen one day in this Countrey clad
like a <hi>Heros,</hi> to ſhew that <hi>I</hi> am ſuch a one, and will be ſo as long as <hi>I</hi> pleaſe, and
that <hi>I</hi> do not turn Shepherd, but to enjoy my minde in greater ſerenity. You will
alſo give me leave, ſaies <hi>Orontes</hi> to keep on the cloathes <hi>I</hi> am in for this day, and
for ſome days to come; for <hi>I</hi> intend to go a hunting, and <hi>I</hi> conceive my ſelf well
enough clad like a Huntſman. Your reaſon's not amiſs, ſaies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> beſides, hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is an exerciſe which is not forbidden Shepherds; and for what concerns the <hi>Heroes</hi>
all books acquaint us they are generally given to it: The habit <hi>I</hi> have on ſuits me
well enough to go a hunting with you; all that are preſent, if they pleaſe, ſhall
be of the match.</p>
            <p>Every one ſubſcribed to <hi>Lyſis</hi> his Propoſition, and <hi>Hircan, Orontes, Anſelme
Montenor</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> chearfully got on horſeback; but as for <hi>Fontenay, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liris,
Meliantes</hi> and <hi>Polidor,</hi> who were in Shepherds habit, <hi>Lyſis</hi> would by no means
permit them to ride, if they had not riding Coats to hide their Paſtoral habit, which
in his opinion ſuited not well with a Cavaliers. As for his own part, ſince he was
clad like a Commander in chief of Antiquity, he made no ſcruple to get on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
as he had ſometimes before. He would have no other arms then a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pole, which was to ſerve him inſtead of a dart; and he would openly wiſh it
were the dart of <hi>Cephalus,</hi> that never miſs'd the prey. He was of opinion, that if
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:43725:151"/>
he had ſuch a one, he would more judiciouſly uſe it then that miſerable Huntſman
did, and that he would not kill his own dear half with it, becauſe he would not
have been ſo raſh as to caſt it, before he had firſt ſeen the beaſt he would diſpatch.
He was a long time conſidering whether he ſhould keep on his buskins, or put on
his boots and ſpurs. At length he concluded himſelf well enough accommodated;
and remembring he had ſeen a many ancient Knights painted without ſtirrupts, he
would have his taken off. 'Twas a great conſultation whether he ſhould have a hat
or no, or whether he ſhould only keep on his crown of Laurel. That was enough
to make him alight, and return to <hi>Hircans</hi> chamber, where there was a book of
Pictures, among which he ſaw divers Captains without hat or cap, or bonnet, and
only crown'd with Laurel. He came back again fully reſolv'd not to change his
dreſſing, though <hi>Philiris</hi> ſpoke to him to this purpoſe: 'Tis true, <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſays he,
that in Tapiſtry and Pictures you may ſee a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor in the midſt of his Army
without helmet or headpiece, having on his head a ſimple Crown of Laurel; but
that is not that they are truly ſo. What advantage were it to them, they would
not be as well arm'd as the common ſouldiers, and at the firſt blow they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
dangerous wounds in the head? But the reaſon of all is, that the Painters do
oftentimes go from the hiſtory, and take the liberty of their Art, and paint a man
bare-headed and crown'd with Laurel, that he as being Emperor may be known
from the reſt, though it is not to be ſuppoſed he always wears ſuch a Crown.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe hindred not <hi>Lyſis</hi> to remain in the ſame poſture he was in; ſo that
the hunters without any further conteſtation ſet out from <hi>Hircan's</hi> Caſtle, leaving
<hi>Carmelin</hi> behind, who would by no means ride and take ſo much pains for a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
beaſt. <hi>Lyſis</hi> ask'd for the Kennel of Hounds, the Nets and Snares, and whether
the preparation were not as great as that of King <hi>Diceus</hi> in <hi>Francias.</hi> They ſhew'd
him ſome Greyhounds, and told him their deſign was only to courſe a Hare. What
have you put me to the pains to get on horſ-back for ſo ſmall a matter? ſaid he;
think you that I'll trouble myſelf to purſue a fearful creature? That employment
muſt be for the delicate <hi>Venus,</hi> who dares not deal with any dangerous beaſt. I
remember the admonitions ſhe gave <hi>Adonis,</hi> and I know what misfortune happen'd
to him for not believing her: yet for all this will I not ſtick to hunt after the moſt
furious creatures. Am not I who have defeated Gyants, Monſters, and Dragons, a
ſtouter man then that little Wanton? Hunt your Hares as long as you will; for
my part, I'll go to the ſide of a mountain, and ſtay till a roaring Lyon come out, as
the young <hi>Aſcanius</hi> does in <hi>Virgil.</hi> You conſider not that you are not now in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frique,</hi>
ſays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> there are no Lyons here: But <hi>Virgil</hi> in another place does
as much as you do, for he makes <hi>Aenaeas</hi> hunt Stags as if he had been in <hi>Europe.</hi>
I do not think they are ſo eaſily found in that Country, eſpecially in ſuch numbers
as he mentions. But alas, honeſt <hi>Virgil</hi> was in <hi>Italy</hi> when he writ this, and thought
<hi>Aenaeas</hi> was there too. If <hi>I</hi> cannot find Lyons in this Country, replies <hi>Lyſis, I</hi>
ſhall at leaſt meet with ſome Bore, as furious as that of <hi>Erimanthus;</hi> it ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him that I'll try my force. You ſhould then have your <hi>Atalanta</hi> here, ſays
<hi>Clarimond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean of this diſcourſe, the dogs ſtarted a hare, which they purſued over
the fallow of a little valley. The hunters followed; and <hi>Lyſis</hi> not knowing what
to do with himſelf if he kept them not company, went after them, partly with his
will, partly againſt it; becauſe his horſe, which he could not guide as he pleaſed,
would carry him to the reſt, by a cuſtom he had. The courſe was ſo violent, that the
poor Hero could not keep his crown of Laurel from falling, and could not hinder
but that the wind blowing up the napkin he had about his ſhoulders inſtead of a
ſcarf, it cover'd all his head. His amazement encreaſed by the ſhocks he at the ſame
time receiv'd; ſo that he let fall his hunting-pole, and embrac'd his horſes neck,
for fear of falling. The huntſmen having taken their pleaſures a while to ſee him in
that poſture, bid a Lacquay ſtay his Courſer and ſet him aright. A while after the
Hare was caught, and <hi>Orontes</hi> had a mind to carry the company to his houſe which
was not far off. 'Twas an incomparable pleaſure to <hi>Florida, Leonora,</hi> and <hi>Angelica,</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:43725:151"/>
to ſee <hi>Lyſis</hi> as he then was: his thighs and legs were one half naked, and his arms
bare, but embroidered in ſome places with a certain ſcurf which might well paſs for
the itch; nor wanted there a little naſtineſs, that the variety might make the better
ſhew: As for his Guard-coat, it was ſuch a good one as your <hi>Paris</hi>-Brokers uſe to
hire out to Prentiſes when they revel it on Shrove-Tueſday.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> in few words told the Ladies what dangers the Shepherd had run through
ſince they had ſeen him; which made up the miracle. In the mean time <hi>Lyſis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very deſirous to ſhew himſelf to his Miſtreſs in his heroick habit, look'd for her
all over the houſe: Nay he went into the garden, and came to a little Grove, where
finding a very fair Elder-tree, he reſolved to write ſomwhat on the bark of it; but
having no knife about him, he went and borrowed the Gardeners. He firſt of all
cut his Miſtreſſes name, and then his own. <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> having ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
him in this employment, thought him engag'd in an excellent deſign; but he
told them he had more then that to do, and that he had long before compoſed a
diſcourſe purpoſely to grave upon a Tree, when he ſhould meet with the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
You muſt let us hear that diſcourſe, ſayes <hi>Philiris,</hi> we have not the patience
to ſtay till it be written; beſides that it will not be amiſs to tell it us before, it may
be our advice may do ſomwhat; for whoſoever puts any things abroad, is glad to
have the judgment of his friends in it. 'Tis rationally ſpoken, reply'd <hi>Lyſis:</hi> hear
then what I intend to put.</p>
            <p>Fair Tree! <hi>will</hi> I <hi>ſay;</hi> ſince thou art ordain'd to be the ordinary paper of the Lovers
of this country, do that courteſie now for the faithfulleſt Shepherd that ever carried
ſheephook: Receive into thy bark the divine characters which compoſe the name of my
faireſt Miſtreſs, and permit alſo that I therein minute my ſorrows, that thou mayſt
one day ſhew them to her who is the cauſe thereof, when ſhe comes to repoſe herſelf under
thy ſhade. Mayſt thou every year grow a fathom, and may the letters thou beareſt grow
with thee, ſo that our ancient Graſiers may diſcern them at half a league without
ſpectacles.</p>
            <p>That's very handſom as you ſpeak it, ſaies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> but I do not think you
can make this tree contain it all. Why not, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> I have read a certain book,
called <hi>Carithea,</hi> wherein there is mentioned a Shepherd that had written on a
poplar, a diſcourſe ſix times as long as mine. You are in the right replies <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond;
I</hi> have read that book as well as you. That diſcourſe is ſo long, that though
a man ſhould write from the top to the bottom, and not exempt the branches nor
the leaves, <hi>I</hi> do not think it would contain all; for you know, that for to make the
Letters legible and diſcernable, they muſt be made ſomewhat big. But what? theſe
are the greateſt ornaments of our Romances; and you ſhall commonly finde thoſe
that cut entire Odes upon trees, though there would be much ado to write a Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.
A man does not ſo ordinarily meet with barks ſo large and proper, and the
moſt can be done is to grave ſome Character, or little Embleme. <hi>I</hi> wonder ſo
many Authors are drawn into ſuch impoſſibilities, and that in thoſe things whereof
they were as eaſily convinc'd as deſire it. A man would think, they had never ſeen
Trees, or never ſtirr'd out of Priſon: but the reaſon of it, is their own ſtupidity,
which makes them not conſider thoſe things that continually preſent themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes; and becauſe they who went before them, ſaid that Lovers writ
long diſcourſes on the barks of Trees, they are eaſily carried away to put ſuch things
into their Hiſtories, for want of other invention. But that which is yet more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
is, that this muſt be grav'd in a moment, as if it were as eaſie as to write on
paper. They in the mean time conſider not, that fifteen days were not enough to
form ſo many Characters, and that ſo well that every one muſt read them as they
feign; for they ſay that ſometimes by the draught, it was known whoſe the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
was. There's yet another ſtrange thing they do; though all thoſe diſcourſes
be compoſ'd as well as might be, yet will they have it believ'd that their Lovers
made them on a ſudden. They will alſo introduce men anſwering one another in
verſe, without any previous ſtudying of what they ſhould ſay; and their Love-Letters,
they make them diſpatch preſently. This is a very wonderful thing; for
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:43725:152"/>
'tis known that they themſelves who ſhould be greater Clerks then thoſe whoſe
loves they deſcribe, and do eſteem themſelves far beyond them, would gladly turn
Hermits to be at leiſure to adorn one period; and that there's no Carrier ſo ſlow,
but would in the mean time go twice to <hi>Rome.</hi> There's reaſon for what you ſay,
interrupts <hi>Philiris;</hi> though theſe Authors make ſuch long things, be grav'd on
trees, yet are they read with pleaſure, taking them for fictions; and as for the
Letters and Verſes which a Lover makes on a ſudden, ſo that they be well done men
are ſatisfied, and no body is ſo ſcrupulous as you are; on the contrary, people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into greater admiration, ſeeing thoſe that are in love have ſuch ſmart and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fancies, and the hiſtory is thereby made more pleaſant. You ſhall have it, ſaies
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> you are then of thoſe who finding in a <hi>Romance</hi> ſomething irrational
and contrary to cuſtom, imagine it makes the adventure fuller of miracle. Hold
thy peace <hi>Clarimond,</hi> ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> thou art nothing but a ſpirit of contradiction; I
am more taken with <hi>Philiris:</hi> He hath ſpoken ſo well in the defence of Love-ſtories,
that I could have ſaid no more my ſelf. I thank you for this honor, ſays <hi>Philiris;</hi>
but yet I adviſe you not to trouble your ſelf with graving your diſcourſe on the tree,
leſt you might not ſucceed, and ſo give <hi>Clarimond</hi> occaſion to laugh at us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
there is one very conſiderable thing I am to tell you; 'Tis no good preſage
to write your paſſion on a bark, becauſe it might be thence inferr'd, that your
Love were only grav'd on the bark of your heart, and that you ſhould never grave
it any further on the heart of <hi>Charite.</hi> This hath a ſhew of reaſon, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi>
and yet there is in it ſomwhat hurts me. What manner of ſpeaking's this? ſays
<hi>Clarimond:</hi> Are you daſh'd againſt the edge of ſome Rock, or hath ſome Bull
ſhewn you the diſcourteſie of his horns? or hath your friend <hi>Philiris</hi> ſome ſo great,
that he puſhes at all the world? What a little is it which thou knoweſt, replies
<hi>Lyſis:</hi> Thou wert never acquainted with the ingenuities of <hi>France,</hi> ſince thou art
ignorant, that when we are not ſatisfied with a Fancie, we ſay it <hi>claſhes;</hi> not that
this is done viſibly, and that it <hi>hurts</hi> us in the body; for being purely ſpiritual, it
can only touch the mind. Now we are much better, ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> I would fain
know what you mean by the word <hi>Fancie.</hi> 'Tis true, that to accommodate my ſelf
to your humour, I have often ſpoken of theſe fine Fancies as well as you; but it
troubled me ſo much, that I could no longer ſtay the diſcovery of it to you. Tell
me now, were it not a crime among your Poets to ſay <hi>conception?</hi> Is that word
out of uſe with them, leſt it might be thought they ſpoke of the <hi>conception of a
woman?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not except againſt the word <hi>conception,</hi> replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> it ſeems to repreſent
the thing when it is <hi>conceiv'd;</hi> but the word <hi>Fancie</hi> is more general, for it ſignifies
all things which we can think of or imagine. Yet I confeſs I thought it ſtrange the
firſt time I ſaw it us'd, becauſe there's no ſuch language in the Univerſity, and I am
ſomwhat trouble to uſe myſelf to it. As for <hi>conceits,</hi> every one knows what they are;
that it is properly a ſlight winding up and down of words, or an alluſion, or ſome
ſuch thing, You are in the right there, ſays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> but as to a <hi>fancie,</hi> I take
it to be a thing which the Poet imagines for the ornament of his diſcourſe, as if you
ſhould ſay, <hi>My Miſtreſs 'roſe ſo betimes, that</hi> Aurora <hi>out of baſhfulneſs return'd,
thinking ſhe had lain abed longer then the Sun.</hi> 'Tis well known there's no ſuch
thing; and the Poet only <hi>fancies</hi> it, and therefore that ought to be call'd a <hi>Fancy,</hi>
and that's all can be conceiv'd of all other fantaſtical imaginations that may have
their birth in a hollow brain. And this is a definition of <hi>Fancy,</hi> which the Poets of
theſe times would think themſelves happy to know; for I have ſometimes put them
hard to it, when I ask'd them difference between a <hi>conception,</hi> a <hi>fancy,</hi> and a <hi>conceit.</hi>
Some told me there was not any, others gave me very poor and irrational differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and ſome would give me no anſwer at all.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Clarimond</hi> ended this diſcourſe, the reſt of the company came into the place:
So that he took occaſion to ſay, Wherein is it the pleaſure of theſe fair Ladies,
that we paſs away the day? What entertainment ſhall we fix upon? For my part,
my vote is for playing at <hi>Fancy-game,</hi> for it's a good while that <hi>Lyſis</hi> talks to me
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:43725:152"/>
of nothing elſe. I'll tell you what the game is: There ſhall be one to ask the reſt,
What do you think on? or what is your <hi>Fancy?</hi> And every one tells him his
thought. Then ſayes he, Such a one hath thought ſuch a thing, 'tis for ſuch and
ſuch reaſon; and ſo he is to give the moſt pleaſant reaſons he can find of all things,
to make the company ſport. There's no great ſubtilty in that, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I know
ſome more gentile ſports, not to mention that of <hi>Love blinded:</hi> There's one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
every one is obliged to give <hi>Epithetes</hi> on every Letter of his Miſtreſſes name; as
if I ſhould call <hi>Charite</hi> Chaſte, Honeſt, Amiable, Rich, Incomparable, Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
and Excellent. I have alſo ſeen excellent games in the <hi>Civil Converſation</hi>
of <hi>Stephen Guazzo,</hi> and in the <hi>Courtier</hi> of <hi>Count Baltazard;</hi> for your <hi>Italians</hi> are
ingenious in this above any other, and it may be ſaid they ſport it very ſeriouſly.
There's required much ingenuity to meddle with their paſtimes, and there's as
much employment for judgment and reaſon, as if a man were in a Parliament where
every man were to propoſe his advice. Let's have no more on't, <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſayes <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica:</hi>
When people would recreate themſelves, they muſt not make choice of
the moſt difficult paſtimes, the trouble would exceed the pleaſure; let's content
our ſelves with <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Commands.</hi> The propoſition is good, replies <hi>Philiris;</hi>
and to advance and ennoble this ſport equally with any other, the Commands ſhall
be of things of importance.</p>
            <p>Every one promoted this opinion, ſo that <hi>Lyſis</hi> was forced to ſubmit to the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of voices. The company retir'd into an Arbor in the Garden, where the
Game begun: Some were condemn'd to tell a ſtory, others to tell how many
Miſtreſſes they had had; and it being come to <hi>Lyſis</hi> his turn, they made him ſing a
Song. When it came to him to command, it happen'd <hi>Philiris</hi> was under his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
He commanded him to chooſe a Lady, and entertain her as if ſhe were
his Miſtreſs, and that he ſhould more particularly deſcribe her beauty with teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of an extreme paſſion. <hi>Philiris,</hi> who had a nimble wit, and knew all the pretty
Love-conceits, was content; and having choſen <hi>Angelica</hi> for his Miſtreſs, and
caſt himſelf on one knee before her, he made this diſcourſe to her, with his hat in
his hand.</p>
            <p>I am extremely glad, moſt incomparable Lady, that I have this preſent liberty to
tell you what my heart is full of. There needed not a command to make me do
that, which that I might be admitted to my prayers were ever ready. Though there
are here a many perſons, the diverſity of whoſe inclinations I know not, yet ſhall
it not hinder me from repreſenting unto you the ardencie of my affection, that ſo
many witneſſes may make you bluſh that you have been ſo long incredulous and
ingratefull towards me. I know not whether you are ignorant of the perfections
you are Miſtreſs of; and if for that reaſon you think it impoſſible I ſhould ſuffer
under ſo much paſſion, yet whatever I hazard, can I not but once more give my
ſelf the ſatisfaction to repreſent unto you thoſe excellent beauties wherewith you
have raviſh'd my ſoul. Thoſe <hi>twiſts</hi> of <hi>gold</hi> which adorn your <hi>head,</hi> how gracefull
do they appear to thoſe who deſire ſuch a noble captivity! they are able to chain
up thoſe things that never were ſo before; and if <hi>Jupiter</hi> were to uſe a golden
chain to draw the Earth to him, as he pretends to do in <hi>Homer,</hi> he muſt needs
make uſe of this. Under this I diſcover a <hi>Forehead</hi> ſo fair, that for to commend it
I muſt not imitate their imagination, that Love made his reſidence there; for 'tis ſo
ſmooth, that that fickle Child could not fix on it: 'tis on wrinckled foreheads that
he hath the opportunity to erect his throne, and it muſt be thought that the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
wrinckles are the ſteps whereby we aſcend to his chair of ſtate. But when he
ſet his foot there, he ſlid into your <hi>Eyes,</hi> where he found his moſt certain retreat:
but ſo it is, that whether with his will or againſt it, he muſt ſtay there, for he burnt
his wings as ſoon as ever he enter'd in. This is the reaſon that the wounds I receive
when you look on me are ſo dangerous, and it may be cleerly ſeen that a powerful
Divinity is become the intelligence of thoſe two bright ſtars which govern the
courſe of my life. But what miracles do I find on your <hi>Cheeks!</hi> the complexion
is white, but never pale, and the redneſs is never obſcure. There is the ſame bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:43725:153"/>
on the corral upon your fair <hi>lips,</hi> which are the portals of the Temple of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
What ſhall I ſay of that <hi>neck</hi> and <hi>breaſt!</hi> but that it is a moſt extravagant
imagination to compare them to Ivory and milk, ſince they have a quite different
luſtre. The Poets celebrate their Mount <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> whereon there are twins of
hills, and the tradition is, that he that hath ſlept thereon, becomes a conſummate
<hi>Poet;</hi> but its to be conceiv'd, that he that ſhould enjoy thoſe two little mounts
which are on that fair breaſt, would be far more divinely inſpir'd, either for Poeſie
or Eloquence. As for the reſt of the body, where though the beauties muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
conceal'd, yet do I not doubt their perfection: And it muſt needs be great
ſince it is honoured with the burthen of that fair head, wherein I finde ſo many
miracles: It hath more glory to ſupport that, then <hi>Atlas</hi> to ſuſtain heaven; for
here are far more divinities then in <hi>Jupiters</hi> Pallace. O how happy then muſt I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
thee, amiable <hi>body,</hi> to have ſo fair a <hi>face!</hi> and thou fair <hi>face,</hi> to be ſo happy
in ſuch bright <hi>eyes!</hi> and you bright <hi>eyes</hi> to be ſo full of <hi>Charms</hi> and <hi>Attraction!</hi>
But what's above all, how happy art thou fair body in the general, to be the
lodging of the faireſt ſoul in the world? Methinks I have ſtill ſomewhat to ſay
in thy praiſe, and that I have forgotten one part which <hi>I</hi> often ſee. I have not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
the <hi>ears,</hi> though near neighbors to the cheeks, and are umbrag'd by the hair
with ſo much beauty. But why ſhould I ſpeak of thoſe unmerciful things? 'tis from
them proceeds the chiefeſt cauſe of my torment: They wil not hear what I ſuffer, that
ſo they might give an account to that divine ſpirit, which governs all the other
ſenſes. As long as they ſhall continue in this ſeverity, I cannot but take them
for my enemies; but if it happen they abate their rigour, I promiſe them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
and redeem the time <hi>I</hi> have not honor'd them.</p>
            <p>I know not whether <hi>Philiris</hi> had ſomething further to ſay; but there he ſtuck,
as it had been to call to minde ſome other fine imagination to entertain <hi>Angelica:</hi>
They were all very attentive to his diſcourſe, which he delivered with a ſweet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and a delightful geſture. <hi>Angelica</hi> her ſelf was nothing troubled to hear
her ſelf ſo prais'd, though ſhe bluſhed a little; and as for the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis,</hi> he was
ſo raviſh'd, that he went and embrac'd the courteous Orator: ſpeaking to him in
theſe words; <hi>Dear Friend, what charms are there in thy diſcourſes! how ſweet and
amorous is thy ſtyle! I promiſe thee quite to diſengage</hi> Clarimond, <hi>and have no more
to do with him, thou art far the fitter to compoſe my hiſtory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philiris</hi> thank'd the Shepherd for the honor he did him, and promis'd him his
utmoſt ſervices. As for <hi>Clarimond,</hi> he ſeeing himſelf diſengag'd, made a vow ever
to contradict <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and that in open Hoſtility. The talk which riſe about this,
broke off the ſport, and thence they inſenſibly fell upon the ſtrange exploits of
<hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin.</hi> I have heard, ſaies <hi>Leonora,</hi> the Story of <hi>Meliantes,</hi> whereby
that Shepherd had ſhewn how his Miſtreſs was ſecur'd in a Fortreſs; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
ſhe remembred all the particulars of her deliverance, as it had been related
to her; but ſhe had not been told the true cauſe of her captivity, nor who was the
author of it. <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi> anſwered, that if ſhe would be ſatisfied in that,
ſhe muſt addreſs her ſelf to <hi>Hircan,</hi> who knows the moſt ſecret things. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
having entreated him to tell what he knew of that buſineſs: He began thus,
without any want of fabulous invention.</p>

                        <head>The Hiſtory of the Magician Anaximander.</head>
                        <p>YOu are to know, dear Company, that in the Iſle where <hi>Pamphilia</hi> was
a captive, there is a Magician call'd <hi>Anaximander,</hi> who hath liv'd there
theſe thirty years. Its no longer ſince he was born, as moſt believe, and
yet he boaſts himſelf to be the true Son of the Sorcereſs <hi>Circe:</hi> As for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he knew not his name, becauſe his mother was ſomewhat common. This
is not to make us believe that ſhe liv'd to this age; that he expounds otherwiſe.
He ſays, that when ſhe was alive, two thouſand years ſince, he having learned
of this good mother all magical ſecrets, deſired to live eternally on earth, and
not go with her to heaven, nor yet to the <hi>Elizian</hi> fields, becauſe he took great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
pleaſure to be here below. When he had examin'd all the receipts for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
of age, he found none eaſier then that of exchanging of Bodies: He
thought it not fit to deſire one of his friends to kill him, and to take his body all
to pieces, to form another ſtronger out of it; he was afraid ſomewhat ſhould
interrupt the operation, and that he might be left half made. A little Nephew
of his being knock'd in the head with a quoit, as he look'd on his Comrades
at play; he found a way to diſcharge his former body, and aſſume that of the
childe, which he afterwards animated to the great amazement of all the world,
who thought him dead. Fourſcore years after, another little childe playing
among others who carried him priſoner, and made as if they would put him to
death, it hapned his companions throtl'd him in good earneſt, <hi>Anaximander</hi>
made uſe again of that body: and ſo hath he done with divers others to this day,
having the power to diſengage his ſoul from this terreſtrial maſs, and faſten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
as firmly, that it is equally fitted for the execution of all its functions, as
any other. He drinks, he eats, he ſleeps, he gets children, and yet is never ſick.
His ſoul takes up bodies, as travellers do Inns, where they are as well accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
as at home. But one great advantage of his immortality is, that he hath
been of all conditions, which he hath freely paſs'd through, as they had been
only parts of a Play; and ſo muſt needs know a many things which others are
ignorant of. For the preſent, the government of the Iſle where he lives is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into his hands, and becauſe the place is very ſolitary, he delights much to
ſtudy Magick: But as his inclination is extreamly amorous, he looks much
into an enchanted glaſs, wherein he ſees the faireſt women in all parts of the
world. When any one pleaſes him, he tranſports himſelf into the Country where
ſhe remains, and then makes her be brought away by ſpirits to his Caſtle. There
he enjoys her at his pleaſure; but ſuch is his lewdneſs, that when he hath done
himſelf, he turns over to his ſlaves the beauties, which before he had choſen for
the Miſtreſſes of his ſoul. Yet I have it from a good hand, that his mother ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to him a while ſince, and adviſed him to give over his lewd life; becauſe if
he would marry a certain Lady that was deſtined for him, he ſhould have a ſon
by her that ſhould be more valiant then <hi>Cyrus</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ſhould bring
him the conqueſt of the world. He ask'd his good mother, by what means he
ſhould know that fatal woman; and of a ſudden <hi>Circe</hi> ſhews her ſelf to him, as
ſhe was at the age of fifteen, and bid him view her well, becauſe the woman he
ſhould have ſhould be like her.</p>
                        <p>He ſince confulted with his glaſs, and ſeeing <hi>Pamphilia</hi> in it, he imagin'd ſhe
was much like <hi>Circe;</hi> ſo that after he had ſav'd her from ſhipwrack, and for pitty
ſake her lover alſo, he ſent two Gyants to fetch her, as ſoon as ſhe came within
his Iſland. They are the ſame which <hi>Lyſis's</hi> incomparable valor hath defeated.
<hi>Meliantes</hi> thinking to relieve her, was divers times deceived; for the gate of
<hi>Anaximanders</hi> Caſtle had ſuch an enchantment, that though he left it open, yet
it ſhut of it ſelf when any enemy came near it. As for the old man who appear'd
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:43725:154"/>
to him, and told him his Miſtreſs was in a place whence he could not deliver her,
but by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>French Shepherd;</hi> I acquaint you, that it was the ſame
<hi>Hircan</hi> who now ſpeaks to you: I had found out by my art, that one of the
braveſt <hi>Knights</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> was in an extream affliction, and that if I did ſuccor
him, he would one day be my intimate friend; ſo that I chang'd ſhape, and
having found him, I put him into a ſleep, and ſo tranſported him into this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
He hath now obtain'd of <hi>Lyſis</hi> what he deſired. That invincible Heros hath
been in the enchanted Fortreſs, whence he delivered <hi>Pamphilia</hi> as you know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anaximander</hi> having had this Beauty in his power, had made his applications
to her, promiſing her great wonders, if ſhe would be his wife. He was in hope
ſhe ſhould bring forth that great Warrior, as <hi>Circe</hi> had promis'd; and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
after he had conquered all the world, to make him away, and to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his body, that ſo he might himſelf be King of all the world. But <hi>Pamphilia</hi>
calling to minde the merit and affection of <hi>Meliantes,</hi> could have none but him;
and inſultingly ſlighted him that had raviſh'd her away. This he was ſo angry at,
that he caus'd her to be put into a dungeon, where his two Gyants guarded her
with three or four hulch-back'd Souldiers, and a terreſtrial Dragon, a moſt hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
creature. <hi>Lyſis</hi> went through all theſe, when he was in the priſon; and that
<hi>Anaxiander</hi> did not appear to hinder him to force his guards, 'twas I had caſt him
into a deeper ſleep, then if he had been in the Palace of Sleep it ſelf; for I cannot
deny but it was I that brought <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> out of the coach, and led them
into the priſon, and brought them back to the coach together with <hi>Pamphilia.</hi>
I tranſport my ſelf in an inſtant to what place I pleaſe, and I put on what ſhape
<hi>I</hi> pleaſe. Now it was not for the worſt that <hi>Pamphilia</hi> remain'd ſome time with
<hi>Anaximander,</hi> for ſhe was in the moſt ſecret place in the world, which was not
amiſs for her, becauſe the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> had made ſuch diligent ſearch for her,
that had ſhe been any where elſe, ſhe had been certainly met with. Now there's
nothing to fear; <hi>I</hi> know for certain that <hi>Siramnes</hi> is killed by one of his Eunuchs:
ſo that all thoſe who were perſecuted by him, may ſafely return into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
A Nephew of his, who now bears the Scepter, hath pardon'd all Criminals,
and hath recall'd all baniſh'd perſons, on condition they ſerve ſix years in the
wars without pay. Now <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe you are all ſatisfied, as having a perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of whatever was of importance in the captivity of <hi>Pamphilia.</hi>

               <hi>Hircan</hi> having ſpoken thus, the Ladies admired in themſelves his vivacity of
ſpirit, and were amaz'd to conſider that he could invent ſuch a ſort of lyes ſo readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<hi>Lyſis</hi> was out of himſelf to hear ſuch great ſecrets, and <hi>Meliantes</hi> feign'd to be
no leſs. <hi>Florida</hi> ask'd him why he brought not his Miſtreſs with him, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
upon her ſolitary humor. <hi>Angelica</hi> alſo ask'd what was become of <hi>Carmelin;</hi>
and why he was not come to relate his acts of valour. <hi>Lyſis</hi> anſwer'd, that he would
not come a hunting with the reſt. <hi>Polidor</hi> ſaid at the ſame time, that his Couſin
<hi>Meliantes</hi> was more happy then he, and by the relief done him, he had receiv'd his
Miſtreſs, whereas he for his part was far enough from his, and knew not whether
he ſhould ever obtain her favor. My intentions are more noble and more juſt then
yours, replies <hi>Meliantes,</hi> and therefore heaven hath proſper'd them. <hi>I</hi> love a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
and an honorable Lady, in whoſe ſervice I think <hi>I</hi> do my duty to vertue it ſelf:
but you, you ſigh for a <hi>Rhodogina,</hi> whom <hi>I</hi> have heard accounted as common as
the high-way. Dye confidently for her, ſince ſhe cauſes you ſo much affliction;
you will receive as great glory by it as ever had <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> for caſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into the gulf at <hi>Rome,</hi> for you ſhall dye for what is publike.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polidor</hi> made as if he had been angry at theſe over-free words, but there paſs'd no
blows. <hi>Hircan</hi> appeas'd all; he told <hi>Meliantes</hi> he was deceiv'd in his licentious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion;
and as for <hi>Polidor,</hi> he promis'd him, that aſſoon as he were returned to
<hi>Perſia,</hi> he ſhould obtain the reward of his love, provided he brought <hi>Rhodogina</hi> the
bark of the <hi>Hamadryad.</hi> He ſwore to him that he had encloſed that precious piece
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:43725:154"/>
in a ſilver-box, and that he had been already gone, were it not for the inevitable
charms of <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s converſation. You do well to ſtay here till ſuch time as you are a
perfect maſter of the art of <hi>Shepherdry,</hi> ſays the <hi>Hero</hi>-Shepherd, for ſo you wilbe able
to read Lectures to your Countrymen. 'Tis my deſign to bring up a many Youths
in the ſame manner, that I may ſend them away afterwards, one into <hi>Turkey,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo others into other places, to teach all the Earth the way to
live happily. Now this Art of Shepherdry is not learned in a day, for it is the
Art of all Arts; I mean it is the Miſtreſs of all, and all other Arts and Sciences
depend of it. For to be a good <hi>Shepherd,</hi> a man muſt be a good <hi>Orator,</hi> a good <hi>Poet,</hi>
a good <hi>Muſitian,</hi> a good <hi>Painter,</hi> and a good <hi>Dancer;</hi> but above all things in the
world he muſt know well how to <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was ſo late when this diſcourſe ended, that <hi>Orontes</hi> was forc'd out of civility
to invite the company to ſupper; and indeed it was not ſo eaſie to break it up, and
quit ſuch pleaſant entertainments. After ſupper <hi>Lyſis</hi> would needs made a party
with <hi>Philiris,</hi> leaving ſome playing at Picquet, others diſcourſing. Dear friend,
ſays he to this Shepherd, I muſt profeſs to thee that ſince the firſt time I ſaw thee,
a certain fatality inſpir'd me that thou ſhouldſt write my Hiſtory: Therefore that
this inſpiration may be effectual, I deſire thee to ſet thy ſelf to it; and do not think
I expect any thing from <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who is but a troubleſom and a railing fellow.
If you think me able to ſerve you, I ſhall willingly undertake the employment,
ſays <hi>Philiris,</hi> but I fear me I ſhall not ſatisfie you; for a man ſhould be in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of your thoughts to conſider what you have there, and expreſs thoſe things
which no man could beſides him to whom they happened. Trouble not thy ſelf for
any thing, I will give thee ſufficient inſtructions, ſays <hi>Lyſis:</hi> This is not the firſt
time that a Lover hath turn'd over the deſcription of his Loves to another, wanting
the convenience to do it himſelf; his paſſion either denying him the patience, or
haply making another ſpeak, that might give him thoſe praiſes which he durſt not
give himſelf. 'Tis not long ſince that one of my acquaintance did the like. When
he gave the Author directions, Let this Gentleman and that Lady, ſays he, be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
one of another; let thoſe two fight with ſuch two, but let the more inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
perſon be kill'd, for I have occaſion for the other three in ſome following
adventures, as being perſons of more eminent quality. A while after you muſt have
a Letter written to one of our moſt paſſionate Lovers, and then ſhall he entertain
his Miſtreſs with a Serenade; and the Muſick ſhall firſt be loud, and then deſcend
to Baſes and other Inſtruments to awaken all that are near, and after this let the
Gentleman ſing to the Lute, whereto ſhall anſwer a full Conſort: let the Verſes be
ſweet and polite, and let there be no fancies that ſhall touch at any.</p>
            <p>And thus did this Lover direct his Hiſtoriographer, and I doubt not but that
great Clerk performed what was excellent: For it is he, that walking once with four
or five of his friends, beſpoke them thus: Let me have ten thouſand men well
armed, and let me be allow'd three moneths time, and I promiſe the King my
maſter and his Princes my good friends, that by true acts of valour and by lawfull
ſtratagems I will conquer a Country ſhall be ſix hundred leagues about, and ſhall
have a hundred Cities as ſtrong and as well peopled as <hi>Orleans,</hi> beſides all Towns
and Caſtles. When will you do it, ſayes ſomebody to him, ſhall we ever ſee it?
where ſhall it be? In a <hi>Romance,</hi> replies he very confidently. That was an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
fellow; he maintain'd that he who was able to make a <hi>Romance,</hi> was able
to do any thing: He's fit to be the <hi>Generall of an Army,</hi> a <hi>Chancellor,</hi> a <hi>Preſident,</hi>
a <hi>Lover,</hi> and a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> if you pleaſe; for ſince he can make every one of theſe
ſpeak according to his quality, and can make them govern with all requiſite obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of order, there's no queſtion but he himſelf would very well diſcharge all
thoſe places if they were beſtow'd on him. But you do not tell us, interrupted <hi>Philiris,</hi>
that he's as fit to be a Drummer as a Captain, and a Catchpole as well as a Judge:
your Romanciſts do as well repreſent the loweſt as the higheſt actions. Thou
haſt a mind to be merry, dear friend, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> yet know our Author was a
very able man, without any diſparagement to thee or any other. To return to my
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:43725:155"/>
diſcourſe, if thou wilt write my hiſtory, I will give thee the conduct of it. I ſuppoſe
thou mayſt have gathered ſomwhat here and there of me already, but I ſhall tell
thee much more; and now take it from the very beginning.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place thou ſhalt make me take the Shepherds habit at <hi>St. Cloud,</hi> for
there was the beginning of my noble adventures: And then thou muſt deſcribe
with what affection I contemplated thoſe inconſiderable things which I preſerv'd
in remembrance of <hi>Charite,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>peece of Leather,</hi> the <hi>Paper,</hi> and the
reſt. Now here thou muſt make uſe of <hi>amplification,</hi> ſaying, that I ſo loved my
Miſtreſs, that I would not only preſerve whatever came from her, but that I alſo
made a vow carefully to keep whatever were about me when I had the happineſs to
ſpeak to her, or receive any favour from her. As for example, if I chanc'd to go to
ſee her where ſhe lived, and that ſhe entertained me favourably, my deſigne
was ever after to preſerve, as a precious relique, my good and beloved Shoes
which had brought me into ſo ſacred a place. And this was in my thoughts ever
ſince that time, though I never ſpoke of it. In the next place thou ſhalt bring in
how I met <hi>Anſelme,</hi> and gave him the ſtory of my Youth, and acquainted him with
the original of my Loves, which muſt be ſoon paſt over: And then ſhalt thou men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that excellent <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Picture of my Miſtreſs, which he drew at his houſe.
'Tis there that is required a triumph of eloquence: My advice is, that thou make uſe
of divers Rhetorical figures, eſpecially if thou make my affections relate to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of the draught and all that concerns it, thou wilt make a ſpiritual thing of a
corporal. The <hi>Copper-piece,</hi> ſhalt thou ſay, is a <hi>rough metal, poliſh'd</hi> by the ſeverity
of <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s ſufferings; the <hi>Gold</hi> that ſhines in it is his <hi>fidelity;</hi> the <hi>white</hi> is his <hi>purity</hi>
and <hi>innocence:</hi> The <hi>fleſh-colour</hi> that's in it, is his <hi>amorous</hi> inclination; the <hi>Fermilion</hi>
his reſpectfull <hi>ſhamefac'dneſs;</hi> the <hi>black,</hi> his <hi>ſadneſs</hi> and <hi>affliction;</hi> the <hi>blue,</hi> the
<hi>divinity</hi> of his <hi>imaginations:</hi> The <hi>ſeparation</hi> and diviſion are <hi>baniſhments</hi> and <hi>opticks;</hi>
but as for <hi>ſhadow</hi> there's very little, becauſe <hi>jealouſie</hi> which is the cauſer of them,
can finde no place there. All theſe colours have been <hi>diſtemper'd</hi> with the <hi>oyl</hi> of
<hi>indulgence</hi> of a thouſand <hi>attractions</hi> of love-looks, and <hi>beaten</hi> on the marble of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</hi>
This done, there may be us'd a handſom <hi>revocation,</hi> and thou mayeſt ſpeak
thus, The affection which <hi>Lyſis</hi> bore <hi>Charite,</hi> made me believe a while that <hi>Lyſis</hi>
had himſelf furniſh'd what was neceſſary for this picture; but <hi>I</hi> have underſtood
ſince, that it was his deſire it might be done with nobler things, at leaſt as noble as
could be found. There are thoſe that ſay, there was no more left of the <hi>Brazen-Age</hi>
then that <hi>Copper-piece,</hi> and that <hi>Lyſis</hi> had purpoſely taken away that, being
to paſs out of the <hi>iron</hi> age into that of <hi>gold.</hi> As for the <hi>gold</hi> that gliſters in <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite's</hi>
eyes, and her chained treſſes, 'tis certain that it is ſome of that into which
<hi>Midas</hi>'s wine was turn'd when he was to drink, after he had the gift of changing
whatever he touch'd into <hi>gold;</hi> and it may be ſaid by parentheſis, that that gold
might eaſily be made potable. The <hi>white</hi> is the milk which <hi>Venus</hi> had in her
breaſts, when ſhe nurs'd <hi>Cupid;</hi> for her milk was far better then <hi>Juno's,</hi> who was
too cholerick to be a nurſe: As to the <hi>fleſh-colour,</hi> we know not what to ſay to it,
but at laſt we have imagin'd it made of <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s <hi>ſweat;</hi> for he being of a perfect
red, as may be ſeen, his ſweat is dy'd by it, nay, his very tears are colour'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
and if there be no likelihood of this, it muſt be conceiv'd that this fleſh-colour
is compos'd of ſome other.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Vermilion,</hi> 'tis the <hi>blood</hi> of the Goddeſs of <hi>Autumn,</hi> which is one of
the four Seaſons, who having a while ſince overheated herſelf, <hi>Eſculapius</hi> was
forc'd to let her blood; for in heaven he is both <hi>Doctor</hi> and Surgeon, and obſerves
whatever is preſcrib'd there. The <hi>black</hi> is <hi>Proſerpina's</hi> Paint: For as in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
there's much pains beſtowed to become white, ſo there ſhe takes as much to
make herſelf black, as being one of the moſt eſpecial parts of beauty. The <hi>blue</hi>
without queſtion comes from <hi>Neptunes</hi> hair, which he cut off ſome dayes ſince,
which by ſome rare ſecret hath been made liquid. As for the <hi>partitions,</hi> I believe
<hi>good fortune</hi> made them, becauſe nothing <hi>departs</hi> from us ſooner: And as for the
<hi>ſhadows.</hi> I believe the great Sun of the world, or thoſe of <hi>Charite's</hi> eyes are the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:43725:155"/>
cauſers of them; for though the Sun be the giver of light, yet he cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhades, but makes them aſſoon as ever any ſolid body oppoſes its beams. The
<hi>oyl</hi> wherewith all theſe colours have been <hi>diſtemper'd,</hi> is the very ſame wherewith
<hi>Hercules</hi> anointed himſelf, when he was to wreſtle at the <hi>Olimpick Games.</hi> As for
the <hi>marble</hi> whereon they were beaten, 'twas a piece of the firſt <hi>altar,</hi> which was
erected to the Gods after the deluge. We had erewhiles forgot the ſhells to put
theſe different colours in; but it muſt be thought <hi>Venus</hi>'s ſhell was made uſe of,
with the Eggſhel of <hi>Loeda,</hi> and for the <hi>Pencils,</hi> they are made of <hi>Loves feathers,</hi>
and his <hi>Mothers hair;</hi> this muſt be rather ſaid, then they made uſe of any feathers
of the wind <hi>Boreas:</hi> Lovers have not ſo much to do with him.</p>
            <p>When thou haſt thus ſpoken of <hi>Charites</hi> Picture, dear <hi>Philiris,</hi> thou muſt bring
in the Letter that I writ to her, which I will dictate to thee word for word. But here
I muſt have a conceit which all the world knows not yet. Moſt part of your <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manciſts,</hi>
when they introduce a man telling a Story, after they have made him ſay,
<hi>I writ a Letter to my faireſt, to this purpoſe,</hi> put down afterwards in Capital Letters,
<hi>PHILIRIS</hi>'S <hi>LETTER TO BASILIA, POLIDOR</hi>'S <hi>LETTER TO RHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOGINA;</hi>
and ſo of others, and then the whole Letter at length. That's no way
handſom, <hi>I</hi> like it not; as for example, if I ſhould relate to you my hiſtory from
one end to another, if <hi>I</hi> were to ſay I write a letter to <hi>Charite,</hi> which was to this
purpoſe, muſt <hi>I</hi> pronounce aloud theſe words, <hi>LYSIS</hi>'S <hi>LETTER TO CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITE?</hi>
that were ridiculous. As there's no neceſſity of reciting that title, ſo there's
none to write it, unleſs it haply be in the margent, as an Annotation or Remark
for the convenience of the Readers; but <hi>I</hi> have an incomparable invention to this
purpoſe, when the book comes to be printed; it ſhall be thus, <hi>Being highly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to diſcover my affection to that fair one, I writ her this:</hi> here the line diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues,
and a little lower there ſhall be <hi>LETTER</hi> in a great character, and then
the Letter follows. This ſhall ſerve for a title for the convenience of the Reader,
and this ſhall nothing interrupt the Syſtem of the narration. In like manner may
be ſaid, <hi>This Gentleman, that Prince, that Lover or Shepherd, willing to lighten his
paſſion by the charms of Poetry, on a ſudden broke into theſe</hi> (and a little under)
<hi>STANZA'S,</hi> and ſo the Verſes afterwards. <hi>That Knight not being able to ſuffer ſuch
an affront from his Rival, ſent him this</hi> (under it) <hi>CHALLENGE,</hi> with the diſcourſe
following. And this is an ingenious way to acquire reputation; nor is it a ſmall
fault to ſay, <hi>Polidor having obtained ſilence, began thus his Hiſtory;</hi> and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to make a great title of theſe words, <hi>THE HISTORY OF POLIDOR
AND RHODOGINA,</hi> or ſome ſuch thing; for <hi>Polidor</hi> being to tell his Story,
will not pronounce that title aloud: 'Tis a folly to put it, and by that means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
the diſcourſe. 'Twere enough to put it in the margent, or make uſe of ſome
invention like that beforemention'd. Yet there are good Authors fail in this point;
but <hi>I,</hi> who take from others but what is beſt, muſt freely reform what's amiſs.
When thou haſt handſomly brought in my Letter, thou muſt tell by what means it
came to <hi>Charite's</hi> hands; how <hi>I</hi> got up and laid it on her window, and faſtened
<hi>Garlands</hi> at the door; and then how <hi>I</hi> was carried away by <hi>Pirates,</hi> who yet kept
me not long a captive, becauſe they were <hi>Anſelms</hi> Friends.</p>
            <p>I forgot the meeting with the <hi>Satyr,</hi> and many other particulars, which I ſhall
give thee another time in order: As for what hath been done in this Country. I
believe thou art in good part inform'd. Thou muſt put down the adventures I ran
through when I was diſguis'd like a <hi>Maid,</hi> and then thou ſhalt affirm for certain
that I was Metamorphos'd into a <hi>Tree,</hi> though divers hold the contrary. But as
for thoſe who ſhall be concern'd in any of theſe accidents, my humble ſuit is they
may be honorably treated, they muſt be conſider'd according to the affection they
bore me, that they may be worthily recompenſed. Thou mayeſt adde what looſe
pieces thou pleaſe to my hiſtory; as for example, the Loves of thoſe of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
it will make the work the more recommendable. Now I acquaint thee,
that when thou art to ſay, I am in this place or that, when I am in any ſolitary
place, it will not be amiſs to ſay, I was making of <hi>Verſes;</hi> for indeed, when I am
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:43725:156"/>
alone, I do nothing but ruminate on them. Yet I permit thee to make ſome thy
ſelf to adorn the Narration, or to thruſt in ſome old papers of thine, that ſo they
may not be loſt; for there are a many have compos'd <hi>Romances,</hi> on purpoſe to
diſpoſe of their ancient Poetry. I ſhall furniſh thee with ſome of my own; and
as for what ſhall come from thee, it muſt be purely an imitation of my ſtyle. I
am in doubt whether we ſhould bring in more <hi>Stanza's</hi> or <hi>Elegies.</hi> I know not
whether is the better; They ſay that the making of <hi>Elegies,</hi> is like our ordinary
<hi>walking;</hi> and the making of <hi>Stanza's</hi> in divers cadencies and meaſures is as it were
<hi>dancing:</hi> ſo that the one is much harder then the other. There are others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<hi>Philiris,</hi> that ſay that the making of <hi>Stanza's</hi> is like the ſhifting of little
birds from bough to bough, as being yet not fully fledg'd; but that the making of
<hi>Elegies</hi> is the taking of a far flight, which is proper only for ſuch birds as know their
trade. Theſe ſimilitudes confound me, ſaid <hi>Lyſis;</hi> I know not whether I ſhould
believe, wherefore let there be of both as thou thinkſt fit. Theſe degreſſions have
kept us from ſpeaking of the principal things that concern us. Thou art to take
notice, that before thou ſet thy ſelf on work about my Loves, thou muſt for a
long time go a hunting after <hi>fancies,</hi> that thou mayſt be well provided on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and ſubjects. As for thy ſtyle, it muſt be ſmooth and not rough, as that of
ſome Writers of theſe times, in whoſe works a man cannot read three pages, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hazarding the skin of his throat, ſo far as would require above two ounces of
Lickeriſh to make it whole again. But to aim at perfection, I think it were not fit
to bring in twice in the ſame page, the word <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> nor divers others which I ſhall
call to minde. I would not yet have thee follow in all things the rules of our
new Reformers of language; becauſe (forſooth) they never read any thing, nor
can cite any thing; they would have nothing at all quoted, neither in Proſe nor
Verſe, ſo that a man muſt ſhake hands with Hiſtories and Fables, ſince a man durſt
not ſpeak of them: but we muſt contemn their ignorance, for I would gladly have
your ancient things brought into competition with the modern, were it for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſon, but that this cauſes the bringing in of a many proper names, which by
their great letters would extremely ſet out the ſtory. Next to this, comes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
that thy diſcourſes muſt not be tyed to one kinde of period, nor be always
of one dreſs like the fools coat in a Play. 'Tis an excellent ſecret <hi>I</hi> heard one boaſt
of at <hi>Paris; I</hi> think he had an Ell wherewith he meaſured all his periods, clipping
them if they chanc'd to fall out too long, or elſe he caſt them in a mold, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
them by the pottle, ſuch was his dexterity in that point; whereof he gave this
reaſon, becauſe he was a Poet, an Orator, and a Muſitian (which ſeldom happens)
and knew all the meaſures, cadences and harmonies of diſcourſe which others were
ignorant of. But we ſhall do well enough to imitate him, nay exceed him. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
when the book ſhall be finiſhed, thou muſt not dedicate it to <hi>Charite</hi> alone,
as I ſometime propos'd to <hi>Clarimond.</hi> Thou ſhalt dedicate it to me too, and ſhalt
make either of us an Epiſtle. But here's one thing troubles me extreamly, to know
when the book is bound up in read Spaniſh Leather, with our Characters upon it;
whether thou wilt come and preſent it with only a ſimple complement; as to ſay,
Incomparable Shepherd, <hi>I</hi> preſent you with this work in my dreſſing; or whether
it will be neceſſary that thou repeat to us by heart the Epiſtle that ſhall be in the
book, which thou ſhalt pronounce, as if it were an Oration. The Author <hi>I</hi> quoted
before, deſirous to dedicate his book to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was in the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity.
Now thou art to know, that he having ſufficiently dedicated his books in this
Kingdom, goes from Country to Country to ſeek new Gods to ſacrifice unto, and 'tis
thought that one of theſe days he wil go and preſent <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> with a <hi>Romance</hi>
of <hi>Knight-Errantry,</hi> to inſtruct him in the <hi>Militia;</hi> and the great <hi>Turk</hi> with a book
of <hi>Love-Letters,</hi> to teach him how to overcome the cruelty of his Miſtreſſes, which
muſt be <hi>Perſia, Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> whom he hath along time
been a ſuitor to. This Author, <hi>I</hi> ſay, being on his departure, thought it was but
civility to repeat his Epiſtle Dedicatory all through before him he ſhold preſent his
book to, though he had never done it-before. But to be more aſſured in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:43725:156"/>
he knew not whether he ſhould take the advice of a <hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> a <hi>Civilian,</hi> or a
<hi>ſworn Stationer.</hi> At laſt a certain Poet told him, that ſince men put Epiſtles before
their books 'twas a ſign the Authors never preſented them themſelves, but ſhould
ſend them, though they liv'd in the ſame houſe with their <hi>Mecenas,</hi> becauſe the
Epiſtles would ſpeak for them, there being no need of their preſence; I think he
took his advice, for he gave over his voyage into <hi>Spain.</hi> Thou muſt ſeriously conſider
what judgement thou ſhouldſt make on ſuch an occaſion: But ſince we are come
ſo far, <hi>I</hi> ſhall note to thee the opinion of the ſame Author upon a ſonnet in <hi>Paſquire</hi>
againſt thoſe who ſpeaking to the King, make uſe of the word <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> as if
they ſpoke of another perſon, and ſo make the Royalty <hi>feminine,</hi> which was, never
to call the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his <hi>Catholick Majeſty</hi> in his Epiſtle. He ſaid that when
he heard that word, he imagin'd it ſpoken of the Kings wife, and to give the King
a more convenient title, it muſt be a maſculine; as if one ſhould ſay, <hi>Sir, ſince it
hath pleaſed your Ray to ſhed its favours on me;</hi> or to ſpeak yet better, <hi>Sir, ſince
your Power hath vouchſafed to look on me with a favourable eye, I will dye in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of your power: I am your Powers moſt humble Vaſſal.</hi> Thus you ſee this writer
had handſom inventions: but 'tis true, for ſome we have no need of them, and for
the reſt, they are not much better then ſuch as we ſhould find out our ſelves. You
give me ſuch excellent inſtructions, ſays <hi>Philiris,</hi> that if I have but the ingenuity to
follow them, I ſhall be the beſt Author in the world, but muſt acknowledge an
obligation to you, both for my eloquence and reputation: I wiſh my ſelf already
retir'd, that I might take notes of all you have ſaid. I have not told thee all, ſayes
<hi>Lyſis:</hi> There will be one thing very remarkable in my Hiſtory, if thou write it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
before there happen any notable change in my affairs; and that is, that
all who ſhall read it will be finely decoy'd; they will imagine to find at laſt a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
between the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis</hi> and the Shephedreſs <hi>Charite</hi> according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
rules of all <hi>Romances,</hi> but there will be no ſuch thing. `Tis certain they will
be much deceiv'd there, replies <hi>Philiris</hi> ſmiling; but your marriage ſhall come in
in the continuation of your adventures, which I ſhall one day finiſh. But that ſhall
not be till ſuch time as we ſhall have no Readers but ſuch as will be abuſed. Yet I
muſt tell you, the circumvention will be ever thought remarkable. I have known
divers <hi>Romanciſts,</hi> who would come and make their brags to me, that they would
ſurpriſe and decoy all the world; for the firſt Romance they would make ſhould
begin at the end, and that there was no great art or ſubtilty to begin one but in the
midſt. As for yours, I ſhall begin it according to your order and inſtructions to <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond:</hi>
but though your adventures be already very eminent, and able to ſatisfie
the moſt diſdainfull and nauſeous intellects, yet I ſhould entreat you to add to and
heighten them if it may be poſſible, that ſo the work may be the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
            <p>While the two Shepherds were thus quietly taken up, <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi>
overheard all their diſcourſe, having gotten cloſe by them without making any
noiſe. They were mightily taken with the excellent and admirable directions of
<hi>Lyſis;</hi> yet <hi>Clarimond</hi> would needs go to his own houſe, bethinking him it was a
long time ſince he had ſeen his mother, who haply wanted him in ſomwhat or other.
He took leave of all the company, and ſaid to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> Though you are my enemy,
yet I am more your friend then you imagine. We ſhall ſee that hereafter, replies
<hi>Lyſis. Clarimond</hi> got immediately on horſ-back, leaving at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s thoſe who had
not ſo great occaſion to be gone as himſelf.</p>

crimes that are the cauſe of it, or my ill fortune onely? If I have committed any

no more, and that the horror of my ſins may add to my puniſhment. When you

I now find all is changed as to me; and when my ſervice merit moſt, they are the

am no longer in doubt of your loving <hi>Geneura,</hi> yet wants there not what obliges
me to look on you as an indifferent perſon, and that is, that in ſtead of that firſt
miſtreſs of yours, you have yet another three times worſe. I have been told of one
<hi>Claricia,</hi> who was ſo deep in your affections, that when you were at <hi>Paris</hi> you
ſtirred not from her houſe, and carried her often to Court. O God! who told

                        <p>I Suppoſe you are not to be acquainted that this <hi>Claricia</hi> is a lewd one, who is
at his ſervice that paies her beſt: It is ſix months ſince that taking notice of
me ſomewhere, ſhe would have me to be her ſervant: I do not ſpeak this out of
vanity, nor yet out of any eſteem I make of the endowments either of my mind
or body; for I am not ignorant how that ſhe never knew any other merit then
riches. She did what ſhe could to meet me in the Churches whether I went,
that I might at laſt haply be touched with ſome affection towards her; but I
had no more thought of her then if ſhe had never been; ſo that ſhe muſt needs
have practized ſome invention to have catched me. As I walked one evening
near the Arſenal, a Souldier came and accoſted me with theſe words, Sir, I
underſtand you are a perſon very ſtudious of curioſities and rarities, and that
hath made me ſo bold as to acquaint you that there is a friend of mine who hath
got ſome of the rareſt ſecrets in the world. I was ſo curious as to hearken to
what he ſaid; and though I knew there were a many Mountebanks in <hi>Paris,</hi>
yet would I try whether this were one. I askd the Souldier what was his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
ſtudy whom he ſpoke to me of; he told me by a certain ſecret knowledge
he had, he would ſhew me whom I ſhould marry: and after this he anſwered ſo
pertinently to divers queſtions, that I took him at leaſt for an honeſt fellow, and
ſuffered him to walk with me till I came to my own houſe. I told him at parting
that I much deſired to ſee his friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bid him come the next morning to
bring me to him. He failed not to come; ſo that I went along with him to a little
houſe near the Temple, where being entred, he told me his friend was not yet
come, and that I muſt wait a little in the Maſter of the houſe's chamber; which
was ſo low and ſo unhandſom that I had rather have ſtaid in the ſtreet. Swords
and Halbards were diſpo'sd over the chimney on the ſame rack with the Spits.
Againſt the chimney-ſtock were nailed up two or three wooden ſhooes, one ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for a ſaltſeller, another for blacking, another held matches and ſpice. All a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
were broken half-pecks turn'd up-ſide-down inſtead of ſtools, nor indeed
were there any other all about the chamber. At one end there was a piece of mat
made a partition, which ſerved both for Wardrobe and Buttery, and thence was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43725:158"/>
brought me out a lame joint-ſtool, which was made to ſtand even by the help
of a faggot-ſtick. I ſate thereon as a Preſident in his ſeat, while in the mean time
the Souldier practiſed the five poſtures he had learn'd a while before. He whom
we ſtay for wil be here now ſuddenly (would he ſometimes tel me) he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
me to be here at eleven. I might have brought him to your houſe, and ſo
have ſpared you the Pains to come hither; but the moſt part of things he makes
uſe of in his operations are not portable. I told him, 'twere better have a little
patience, ſince he would not ſtay long, and that I was loath to loſe my labour.
An houre being ſpent in theſe fine ſtories, the Souldier told me at laſt that he
thought it beſt to go look for his friend, and thereupon he left me. I was
ſometimes of opinion it was ſome ſwaggerer, and that he was now gone to fetch
his Comrades to rob me; yet would I not be gone, as being better reſolv'd,
though I had brought no Lacquay with me, becauſe I would not have any body
know whither I went. Nothing troubled me ſo much as hunger, which now
began to make its approaches, being as then faſting; otherwiſe I ſhould have
thought it no hard task to wait till night, ſo deſirous was I to ſee a Magician.
I asked the Maſter of the houſe whether he had din'd, who having anſwered me
that he had broke his faſt ſo well that he would eat nothing till night: I told
him plainly the caſe was not the ſame with me, and that I ſhould take it well if
ſomewhat were brought me. I had no other money about me but a piece of
gold, which I gave him to provide ſomewhat but he ſtaid ſo long that I thought
he had been run away with my money, and left me maſter of his houſhold-ſtuff;
for all that was in the houſe was not worth it. At laſt he returns with bread
only, and went out again to get ſomewhat elſe. Being not able to eat ſo much
bread without drinking, I gave a good deal of it to a dog that barked at me as if
I had been ſome thief. When I had appeaſed him there came a beggar to the
dore, who was ſo important for an alms, that I gave him all my proviſion to be
quiet. The dog it ſeems envied at that, and began to quarrel with me afreſh.
Seeing that his maſter came not, I had a mind to go to the dore to ſee if he
were not coming at the ſtreets end, but I was afraid ſome of my acquaintance
might paſs by, and would haply have been frighted to ſee me in ſuch a place.
About half an hour after mine hoſt returns with a bottle of wine, and a little
piece of beef half roaſted. When he had given me the reſt of my money, I
gave him to fetch more bread, and ſo I eat and drank. Upon this, he tels me
that he knew not what he thought on all the time that he kept me in a low room
ſo ill furniſhed, ſince he had the key of an upper Chamber which was ſomewhat
better. He preſently brought me up to that Chamber, which was hung with
ſtrip ſtuff, and had a pretty little bed; but it was ſome wonder to me not to
find any Books, nor Mathematical Inſtruments, nor any other thing neceſſary
to a knowing man. I preſume of your pardon faireſt <hi>Angelica,</hi> that I tell you
ſo many particulars: nor may you wonder that I relate to you things that are
pleaſant, when I have moſt cauſe to be ſad, becauſe I force my humour to it
out of opinion it pleaſes you. Know then that mine hoſt having left me all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in the Chamber; a little while after a young Gentlewoman comes up, and
askes me what I did there, and whether I had any thing to ſay to her. I was
much amazed to ſee her inſtead of the Magician I expected; and I ſaid to my
ſelf, Does he whom I would ſpeak with know my deſigne already? Hath he not
been told that I intended to ask him what kind of woman I ſhould have? and
to ſatisfie me with the ſight of her, hath he not ſent this, who haply is one of his
wenches, ſo to make me believe that it is ſhe I muſt fall in love with? Though
this came into my thought, yet I gave the Gentlewoman this anſwer, That I was
brought thither to ſpeak with one I had ſome buſineſs with, but that I had been
abus'd. She replyed that ſhe was very much beholding to that abuſe which
got her my acquaintance; and thereupon fell upon ſome very free talk, to
which I anſwered with that modeſty which men ought to obſerve. At length,
being weary of thoſe diſcourſes, and ſeeing the Souldier returned not, I took
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43725:158"/>
my leave of her. As ſhe brought me down, ſhe told me that if ever I ſhould
come and repoſe myſelf in her chamber, ſhe would take it as a ſignal favour.
Had it not been for theſe words, I ſhould haply have ſuſpected no ill, for ſhe
diſcovered that gravity which is not ſo common among lewd ones; but on the
other ſide, the place where ſhe lived, and her Maid and Lacquey ſo ill accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated,
made me think the worſe of her. I returned home very ſad at my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture;
and two days after, it hapned I met <hi>Alican</hi> in an Academy. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of acquaintance I told him of the Gentlewoman I had ſeen; and he, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
univerſally acquainted, told me it was <hi>Claricia,</hi> and that ſhe was well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended,
but that ſuits at Law had ſo impoveriſhed her, that it was generally
conceived, that to live in the hight and bravery ſhe did, ſhe ſold her favours to
any one; yet he believed it not, becauſe he could never obtain any thing of
her in that way. He very ſeaſonably ſell into this flouriſh of vanity. For I
afterwards took him into my Coach, and much againſt my mind, he brought me
to this <hi>Claricia</hi>'s, telling me he would ſo diſpoſe her, and put her upon ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
as ſhould pleaſe me. I cannot deny, but that having found <hi>Claricia,</hi> I
was more ſatisfied with her diſcourſe, then that of <hi>Alican,</hi> for it is the moſt
impertinent fellow in the world. He it was, deſired her company to a Race,
which obliged me to take her with us. And this is it he ſhould have told you.
Since that time I never had ought to do with <hi>Claricia.</hi> He made you believe
that I loved her, that you might hate me, that ſo nothing might hinder you to
affect him; for I doubt not but that was one of his principal deſignes. Had
he no other vices then Treachery and unfaithfullneſs, I ſhould believe he might
yet be wrought to ſome good; but ſince he carries about him ſo many ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
I dare ſpeak no more of him, leſt you might think I would commend my
ſelf by blaming him. There's <hi>Montenor,</hi> who can give you a better account
then I, of the actions of that moſt illuſtrious perſon of this age.</p>

                        <head>The HISTORY of ALICAN.</head>
                        <p>HE whom you mention, ſaid <hi>Montenor,</hi> is the ſon of a Gentleman who was
extreamly rich, but withall the moſt covetous that ever was. In the time
of his ſickneſs which was his laſt, he was adviſed to change the air; he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he would willingly go to his Country-houſe, but conditionally, that his two
beſt friends were carried along with him. They ſhall not fail to be there, ſaid
ſome about him; there were none but thought he being at the point of death,
otherwiſe then the two beſt friends he talked of, were his Phyſician and his
Confeſſor, which were they he had moſt need of: but when the time to depart
was come, he made it appear that by thoſe two good friends, he meant two
ſtrong Cheſts wherein he put all his money. When it was ſaid to him that he
was to blame to ſuffer his thoughts to be carried away to dotage on his wealth:
he anſwered that they were indeed his beſt friends, ſince they aſſiſted him at all
times, procuring him whatever he deſired, and that there were few in the world
that loved him but for their ſakes. Some of the kindred being unwilling that
ſo much money ſhould be carried from the houſe, becauſe of what ill accident
might happen. The ſick perſon continued ſtill in the City, and upon that a
very remarkable thing fell out: Though his ſickneſs was in the extremity, yet
would he himſelf keep an account of all was ſpent, leſt his ſon, and ſervants
might deceive him. So that he had in the bed with him a great bag of money
whereon he ſtill lean'd his arm as if it had been a pillow, and when there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43725:159"/>
any thing towards the houſe, he himſelf gave what to buy it withall. One
day it came into his mind to go to his ſtudy, to ſee if his two Cheſts were as they
ſhould be; and though he were very ſick, yet muſt he be carried to the place
where he deſired. Having with much adoe opened one of his Coffers, and
kneeling on a pillow for to contemplate his Treaſure, at his eaſe, he died ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
The dead ſhould not be cenſured, yet it may be ſaid he died in a moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
poſture, as if he were then adoring his money. God ſuffered him to
come to that unhappy end for an example to others; and 'tis an article of my
faith, that it is no ſin to divulge the ſins of ſuch, to induce people to live better.
<hi>Alican</hi> being left ſole heir, makes it ſufficiently appear that it is not the will of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Juſtice that ſo great riches ſhould remain in that Family, for he is as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
as his father was covetous, and he is his greateſt friend that can beſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
him with inventions of expence. Yet having once lent me a piece in a
Church to beſtow in ſome charitable way, which I could not then avoid, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meets me but he fantaſtically demands it, telling me that I ſhall not beſtow
alms at his charge. My anſwer to him ever is, That I not pay him till he
hath conſumed all, becauſe then a piece will be more to him then a thouſand
now, and he will thank me for having kept it ſo long. He taketh all this in jeſt,
but I ſpeak it in good earneſt; for I believe he will ſoon find the end of his
riches, according to the rate he lives at. If he loſes any money at play, he'll
caſt what he hath left out at the windows, and for that the lacqueys only are
obliged to him. He never bargains for any thing he buyes, becauſe he hath
that eſteem of himſelf, that he would think it a diſparagement unto him, if he
ſhould conteſt with the populacy. As for his follies, they are incomparable,
and ſo remarkable that all that meet him, though they know him not, yet think
him not free from extravagance. There's ever ſomewhat extraordinary in his
clothes, either for faſhion, or colours, not to mention his affectations of ſuch and
ſuch garments. Sometimes he will needs make people believe he hath been let
bloud, or hath been wounded in his arm, only to take occaſion to ſhew a fine
Scarf he got at the Fair. He wears Pendants at his ears of all faſhions: he hath
ſome little golden Croſs, or ſome other trinket at the end of his muſtachoe. He
hath ever ſome bracelet in ſight, and ſome Fancy in his hat, to make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he is in favour with ſome Lady. He hath alſo ſome Knots or other at the
welts of his ſhoes, when he is in ſilk ſtockins. To be ſhort, if he be conſidered
all about, it will be found there will not be one piece of him which hath not
ſomewhat different from what's in others. Beſides all this, if it happen ſome
morning that a Miſtriſs looks not graciouſly on him, he thinks his clothes are in
the fault, as wanting ſomewhat to charm her; and this makes him put on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuit in the afternoon to recover her favour. This makes him ſo infinitely
curious in his apparel, that when he is to enter into a faſhion, he ſends for four
Maſter-Tailors into conſultation, as if 'twere four able Councellers to have
their judgement in a Caſe, and he gives them money for their opinion, for his
ſummer faſhion or his winter faſhion, and to know which are the moſt ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Modes. Nor muſt the Lacqueys but ſmell ſomewhat of the extravagance
of him they ſerve, and make <hi>Alican</hi>'s folly apparent. Sometimes their skirts are
pointed, ſometimes like ſcales: If one year they weare Coats with ſleeves, the
next they are in Cloaks after the Spaniſh mode. Their Liveries ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of ſeveral pieces of divers colours, like Jackpuddings, or elſe croſs laced with
Galoom, into Characters and Love-knots, ſo that any one would ſay they wore
the Livery of Folly, rather then that of their Maſters Miſtriſs. I do not blame
this as being an enemy to handſomneſs, and faſhions, for I love to ſee Gentlemen
and their attendance well clad, ſo the ordinary decent mode be obſerved; but
<hi>Alican,</hi> as I tell you, is not content to clothe his ſervants fantaſtically, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
do, but he will be ſo himſelf, that the relation may be ſeen, and that it
might not be thought his ſervants are borrowed. But there are yet greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences.
One day he would needs have a glaſs in the Crown of his hat, to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43725:159"/>
ſee ever and anon if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e courted the Ladies handſomly. It can hardly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
what trouble he puts his Cloak and that to, by cocking and truſſing them
as he does, and I think he doth it only to ſhew he hath now nothing but what's
new; whereas in his fathers time, all he had came from the brokery, ſo that
all was ſo mellow that it could hardly be touched. Being one day at a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,
he would needs ſalute a Gentlewoman that was going in, though he
knew her not for his gallantry was already very remarkable) putting on his
hat in a fury, becauſe ſhe would not be ſaluted, he unawares pulled the brim ſo
hard, that he tore it, and drew it down over his noſe, as if it had been the viſor
of a headpiece. That hapned before a many people to his great diſgrace, and
all his revenge was to ſwear he would be the death of the Haberdaſher had ſold
it him. But now he redeems the time wherein he was ſo ill accoutred, and
I believe he wiſhed himſelf in this poſture long ere he came to it, and that he
would not have given any thing to ſave his fathers life. His chiefeſt diverſions
were to go into Churches and Walks to ſhew himſelf: Sometimes he takes a
great delight to drive a Coach about <hi>Paris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and thinks he hath done a great act,
though the humour be ſtale enough. If he keep home, he is ſo idle that he
knows not what reading or any ſuch thing means, and can find himſelf no other
imployment then to ſtand at the window and ſhoot peas through a Trunk at
thoſe that paſs by or ſome ſuch diverſion, for which he is beholding to his Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quays.
Yet I ſhould forgive him this did he but come off handſomly with his
ſimplicities; but when he hath abuſed ſome honeſt Tradeſmen who have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him as he deſerves, he hath no other name to call them by but Citizens.
As for his ordinary diſcourſ, 'tis as ſimple as can be imagined; he'll be ever telling
you how many pieces he loſt or got at play, and what rare deſignes he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Cloathes, whereof he will ſhew you draughts in paper, as if they were
ſome deſignes of Architecture. I think I have told you enough to know him
by, and you may eaſiy judge that there cannot be an action of this man that
ſpeaks not ſomewhat of his folly. I am weary to entertain you ſo long on ſo
deſpicable a ſubject.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Angelica</hi> hearkned very attentively to <hi>Montenors</hi> diſcourſe, and thought in
her ſelf that it had been well her mother had heard it, that ſhe might have known
what kind of perſon <hi>Alican</hi> was; for ſhe imagined that <hi>Leonora</hi> had a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of him, and would have been content he were her ſon in law. <hi>Anſelme</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
ſhe ſaid not a word, obliged her to ſpeak by this queſtion: Well what
ſay you now of this illuſtrious (ourtier? Will you hereafter believe a man that
diſguiſes himſelf every day as well in his words as in his cloathes? Truely, replies
<hi>Angelica,</hi> I can only tell you, that <hi>Claricia</hi> would be excellently well for his turn,
and that he ought to marry her. I am of your opinion, replies <hi>Anſelme,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, for my part, I ſhall give him no occaſion to be jealous.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe ended, and <hi>Montenor</hi> being returned to the Cards, <hi>Anſelme</hi> put
<hi>Angelica</hi> ſo hard to it, that ſhe openly confeſſed that ſhe thought him not ſo
poorly minded, as that he did ever affect <hi>Claricia;</hi> who though ſhe was very
handſome, yet had the reputation of ſome lightneſs: and as for <hi>Alican,</hi> ſhe ſoon
diſcovered how little ſhe eſteemed him. 'Twas then that <hi>Anſelme</hi> reaſſumed his
good hopes, and <hi>Angelica</hi> who truly loved him, could no longer uſe her ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diſſimulations. She favoured him ſo far, that when he deſired to wait her in
private to entertain her with his affection, ſhe aſſigned him the next day at night,
but told him, ſhe was not yet reſolv'd of the place; this promiſe ſatisfied him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly.
He thank'd her the beſt he could, but contracted his complements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he thought he was diſcovered by all, and that there came ſtill ſome one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them to hear what they ſaid. As for his part he was ſo cunning as to ſpeak
aloud then, and that of ſome indifferent matter, that it might be thought the
reſt of his diſcourſe was of the ſame.</p>
            <p>When the Gamſters had given over, he returned with <hi>Montenor,</hi> though <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontes</hi>
had entreated them both to lodge at his houſe. <hi>Hircan, Lyſis,</hi> and thoſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43725:160"/>
of that gang returned alſo to their home. <hi>Lyſis</hi> was almoſt out of himſelf not to
find <hi>Carmelin</hi> there, and which was worſe, no body could tell any news of him:
He had been ſeen to go out of the Caſtle, but it was thought only to walk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about;
and in the mean time he was not come to ſupper to <hi>Hircans. Lyſis</hi> was
extreamly afflicted at this loſs; he knew not what to do to find the faithfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of his travels. To go into the Gardens was to no purpoſe, there was no
likelyhood he ſhould be there; and as for going into the fields, what could have
been done in the dark? His recourſe therefore was to complain, which he did in
this manner. Alaſs! my faithfull <hi>Carmelin,</hi> ſhall I not know for what cauſe
thou haſt left me? I never threatned to beat thee, I have not dealt roughly with
thee, or if I have, it hath been only in jeſt. When thou deſiredſt to participate
in the glory of my Proweſſes, I have been content, and I have permitted thee to
be crowned with Lawrel as well as my ſelf. Wherein then have I offended thee,
thou who wert the ſecond perſon in my eſteem next my Miſtreſs? Hadſt thou
ſtaid with me, of a hireling as thou wert, I would have made of thee an <hi>Illuſtrious
Shepherd,</hi> for 'tis not a Warrier who hath gotten a victory ſhould be ranked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
ruſticks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having ended this complaint, was forced to go to bed as well as the reſt:
and while he is aſleep, I will tell you if you pleaſe to give me leave, what became
of <hi>Carmelin.</hi> His Maſter being gone with the reſt a hunting, his thoughts ran
on <hi>Liſetta,</hi> whom he could not forget, though his Maſter commanded him to
love no other then <hi>Parthenice.</hi> Having asked one of the ſervants where ſhe was,
he anſwered, that ſhe was gone with her Miſtreſs, who was the fair Lady he
might have ſeen awhile before in the Caſtle. He knew well enough that they
ſpoke of the Shepherdeſs <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> and becauſe he thought himſelf much in her
favour, he reſolved to give her a viſit, and by that means to ſee his love. The
ſame ſervant told him that ſhe lived about three miles from the Caſtle, and gave
him the beſt directions he could to find the houſe. <hi>Carmelin</hi> very joyfully left
the fellow, and being gone out from <hi>Hircans</hi> as nothing were, he walked ſoftly
awhile, but at laſt he began to run as faſt as if his Maſter had already been in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of him, till he was gotten out of ſight of his ordinary Lodging. He met by
the way with ſome Country people, who directed him ſo well that he ſoon came
to <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s as ſhe was in the Hall with five or ſix Gentlewomen of the ſame
Village. What good wind hath blown you hither? courteous <hi>Carmelin,</hi> ſaid
ſhe to him, I did not think this day to be ſo happy as to have ſeen you: what
good prayer have I ſaid this morning that hath brought this bleſſing on me?
If I could remember it, I would ſay it every day, that my felicity might ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.
Tell me I pray, how does the Prince of the Shepherds of <hi>France?</hi> What
hath he done ſince I have ſeen him? Do you come hither expreſly from him to
give me an account? I come hither from no man but my ſelf, replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
and conſequently you are the more obliged to me. As for the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
I left him very well, and I aſſure you that we have done ſuch rare things ſince your
departure, that they can hardly be related to the full. You muſt needs tell us
the whole ſtory, replyes <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> were it only to honour my good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
here, who queſtionleſs will be extreamly taken with the relation.</p>
            <p>She had already related a many of <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s adventures to the Gentlewomen,
who knowing immediately that this was the ſervant of that illuſtrious Shepherd,
they all ſet upon and about him, to conjure him to tell what he knew had hapned
to his Maſter, whom they did ſo highly eſteem. <hi>Carmelin</hi> who was not made
of iron or wood, ſeeing himſelf entreated by ſo many fair ones, thought he could
do no leſs then ſatisfie them, ſo that having by the command of <hi>Amaryllis</hi> taken
a ſeat, he began to ſpeak in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ladies, Gentlewomen, Nymphs, Hamadryads, Nayads,</hi> or fair <hi>Shepherdeſſes</hi>
(I know not how to call you, ſuch a confuſion hath the Maſter I now ſerve made
in my former Learning, by forcing me to new principles.) <hi>It being then ſo,</hi> that it
is your deſire to know ſome incomparable adventures of the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis,</hi> 'tis
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43725:160"/>
not without ſome reaſon that I make uſe of this expreſſion, for I have been told
that a famous Author began thus all his Chapters. <hi>It being then ſo,</hi> that it is
your deſire to know thoſe noble and pleaſant adventures, I am firſt to tell you
of <hi>Meliantes,</hi> who is a Sepherd, as he ſaies, of that Country, which, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
is ſomewhat near thoſe people, who wear great Balls of Linnen about
their heads. 'Tis <hi>Perſia,</hi> now I have hit it. To bring it into my mind, I was
fain to think on a peece of wine that a while ſince was pierced before me, for I pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize
Artificial Memory. Now though this <hi>Meliantes</hi> ſaies he is that Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
he ſpeaks as good French as you or I and his noſe and eyes are made alike,
and of the ſame colour as ours. He ſaid then that his Miſtreſs, whoſe name I
cannot remember, unleſs I hear it, was ſtollen away by two Gyants, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
in a Caſtle, whence it was neceſſary my Maſter ſhould redeem her. As
for my part, <hi>Hircan</hi> engaged me alſo in the deſigne; and becauſe my Maſter nor
I could not pretend to any great ſouldiery, and that in matter of War, we were
more likely to retreat then advance, he promiſed to make our bodies ſo hard, that
ſwords ſhould not hurt them. This <hi>Hircan</hi> ſaies he is a Magician, and I believe
he may be one, for certainly he is a gallant man, as to that point. He doth no
more at his houſe then ſay, Lacquay lay the cloath, and preſently you find the
Table excellently well furniſhed. He might as well therefore make us as valiant
as he ſaid. My Maſter put on a habit which they tearm an <hi>Heroical</hi> habit: and
for my part, I was armed <hi>cap à pee;</hi> but it was ſuch an encumbrance to me, that if
my noſe had dropped, I muſt have deſired my Maſter to wipe it. After a great
many ceremonies we were put into a Coach which at firſt went by land, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
through the air, as <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſaid, but for my part I could perceive no ſuch
thing. I ſlept in the place where I ſate, and my Maſter having done the like, he
dreamed that a Magician drew us out of the Coach, and that he made us eat on a
marble Table. You are to conceive that was only to cool the broath; that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
us to ſee birds that were Gardeners, men that were as clear as glaſs, and a
furnace wherein we were burnt, and then that having raiſed a great hall in the
Wilderneſs, he made ſervants come out of the hangings, and bring us ſomewhat
for collation, and that I drunk and eat as much as ſix men. I maintain'd againſt
him that there was never any ſuch thing, and that my guts cryed vengeance on
this dream. This made him ſomewhat angry, but he is ſince appeaſed. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
then to our adventure, 'tis true that an ancient grave man having awaken me,
drew me out of the Coach with <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and that through obſcure waies, we came
at laſt to a great Cellar where we fought with Monſters. To tell you what
blowes we gave, and what we received, is more then I can do, for I had not the
leaſure to count them, ſo was I amazed. 'Tis true, I was not ſo much out of
my ſelf, as if I had ſeen my bloud running out of my body, for had that hapned,
I think I ſhould have been no longer for this world, and ſhould have died for
fear, though my wounds were no more dangerous then ſcratches: and this certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would have hapned, had our enemies had any fire-arms, for if they had had any
muskets or Canons, the very report would have carried away my wits. But we
were ſo fortunate as to overcome our adverſaries, and over and above killed a
Dragon. I muſt indeed confeſs it was not very terrible, for it ſtirred not from
the ſame place, and there came out no fire at his throat; yet my Maſter was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of it and thought it a great glory to have overthrown it. After this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
we delivered <hi>Meliantes</hi>'s Miſtreſs out of priſon, and returned with her into
the Coach. <hi>Lyſis</hi> related all this this morning to <hi>Hircan,</hi> and then it was he and I
had ſome diſpute about his fond imaginations: but to tell you the troth, after
ſuch travel undergone, where it was my hope we ſhould have been made rich
men, there was only beſtow'd on each of us a Crown of Lawrel. Here's mine,
which I ſtill wear inſtead of a hatband. Nay they would have had me loſe my
at by the bargain, for I had much adoe to get it. The praiſe I ſhould have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
would by that time have coſt me dear enough. I am now at length ſuch as
you ſee me, and ſuch as I am, having learned out <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s houſe I am come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43725:161"/>
while my Maſter is gone a hunting with all the reſt of the company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> having thus finiſhed his diſcourſe, which had pleaſed the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
very well, <hi>Amaryllis</hi> told him, that if it were true, that he came purpoſely
to her houſe to ſee her, ſhe was extreamly obliged to him, but that ſhe imagined
he was come rather to ſee the Nymph <hi>Liſetta,</hi> whom ſhe had entertained for her
ſervant. The anſwer to this was a ſmile a very unhandſome one, and <hi>Amaryllis</hi>
continuing her ſpeech, asked him whether he did not firmly believe that <hi>Liſetta</hi>
had been an <hi>Hamadryad.</hi> I muſt needs believe it ſince all the world ſaies ſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
he. I am made believe that I have not ſo much judgement as others, and
that I do not ſee things as they are, ſo that though my own reaſon perſwades me
to any thing it apprehends, yet muſt I not be ſuffered to give it any credit. I
have often ſeen ſcarecrows of wood, but I know not what the other means, nor
ever ſhall till I have read my Maſters Books. Not to lie for the matter, his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
are extreamly troubleſome, and were it not that he is of a quiet diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
I had left him ere this. 'Tis true, there is ſome pleaſure in his company,
for if ſometimes I have fared hardly, ſince he came to <hi>Hircans</hi> I live like a little
Prince. What a miracle was that Feaſt whereat <hi>Orontes</hi> entertained us the other
day? I made one there, and remembring I had read in a certain book, that <hi>red</hi>
is the colour of <hi>Vertue,</hi> I drank as much Wine as I could for to paint my noſe and
my cheeks. I ſee then, ſaies <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> that of all the Gods your Maſter hath
quoted to you, there's none you honour more then <hi>Bacchus.</hi> If you pleaſe,
though we drink not much Wine, you ſhall keep his Feaſt to morrow with us. I
am to cut down a little Vinyard I have in my Cloſe. <hi>Carmelin</hi> upon this betook
him to his conſiderations, ſaying, that if he returned not, his Maſter would be
much troubled for him: But <hi>Amaryllis</hi> told him ſhe would excuſe him, ſo that
he preſently reſolved to ſtay. There were only two Gentlewomen ſtaid ſupper
there, the reſt went to their homes; but at night they came again to paſs away
the time with their neighbour. They danced and ſung together, and <hi>Carmelin</hi>
with his <hi>Liſetta</hi> were taken in. When it grew late they aſſigned him a bed, and
the reſt retired.</p>
            <p>The next morning <hi>Amaryllis</hi> ſet the Gatherers on work, and was very pleaſant
with them, and ſomwhat the more becauſe ſhe had <hi>Carmelins</hi> good company, who
with her aſſiſtance, ſtarted out a moſt heroical deſigne.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Lyſis,</hi> to whom it is time to return, roſe in very much diſquiet, not
thinking it was yet time to leave off his Heroical accoutrements, though he had
promiſed the day before not to be in them any longer. He bethought himſelf
that <hi>Charite</hi> had not yet ſeen him in that bravery, and that ſhe had not appeared
at all at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s. He therefore made a vow not to quit his Coat of Male till he
ſhould meet that fair Miſtreſs of his. He ſaid ſo to all he met, to prevent the
wonder they might be in not to find him clad as a Shepherd. Every one appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his reſolution, he dined very quietly, though he ſtill ſeemed to have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to ſay, either as to the ſtrange and unfamiliar humour of <hi>Charite,</hi> who hid
her ſelf from him aſſoon as ever ſhe ſaw him, or as to the loſs of <hi>Carmelin.</hi> As
for his Miſtreſs, he was promiſed a ſudden ſight of her; and for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> they
told him that they had ſent to ſeek him.</p>
            <p>About two or three in the afternoon, <hi>Hircan</hi> and the reſt being gone abroad
for ſome recreation, <hi>Lyſis</hi> perceived in the highway a great duſt, and having
looked a long time that way, he imagined there had been a great train of horſes
and Carts. Are they not the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Shepherds that are now come? cries he
out. There comes the baggage.</p>
            <p>Every one looked that way, and they diſcovered a Wagon, and a Coach after
it, with a many people afoot. As this Pageant came nearer and nearer, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the Waggon a man ſitting aſtride a Barrel, and it was ſoon known to be
the courteous <hi>Carmelin.</hi> He had on a white pair of drawers and a white waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat,
a skarf of vine-leaves, a Crown of Ivy, and a Cup in his hand, ſo that he
ſeemed to be very pleaſant to ſee himſelf repreſent the Father of Good-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43725:161"/>
There was a deal of boughes all about the Waggon, and two ſturdy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
fellows that led it, were alſo crowned with vine-branches. Eight women ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
went before, with their Paniers and pruning Hooks, and the two Basket-carriers
followed them. An old man who yet had a pleaſant countenance, rid
on an Aſs after the Waggon, to repreſent <hi>Silenus. Carmelin</hi> ſung a drinking
Song, to which all the reſt anſwered. Being come upto the company of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
he cauſed the Waggon to be ſtaid to begin another Song, of the beſt he
had and that done, he was preſented with ſome Wine which he took off. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Amaryllis</hi> and her neighbours, who were all in Petticoats, came out of the
Coach, having each of them a basket of ſmall Ozier under their arms, and little
guilt hooks in their hands; and <hi>Amaryllis</hi> advancing the foremoſt, made towards
<hi>Hircan,</hi> to whom ſhe made a low courteſy, ſaying to him, Learned Magician, I
am come hither, ſent by <hi>Bacchus,</hi> to make you this ſmall preſent, which you will
accept when you conſider it comes from that God who is more powerfull then
all the reſt. 'Tis he that cauſes and continues our mirth; 'tis he makes ſervants
ſpeak confidently to their Miſtreſſes, and 'tis he that makes the Souldier
couragious, though he were naturally a coward. If you adore him
with a conſtant minde, he will alwayes preſerve your vines from the froſts,
and will ſend you ſuch ſtore of Wine, that it ſhall be as cheap as the water of
<hi>Morin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amaryllis</hi> having ſaid theſe words, <hi>Hircan</hi> took from her a basket of Grapes,
which ſhe preſented to him, and thus he returned her his thanks. Faireſt Nymph
ſayes he to her, I chearfully receive this preſent both for the God <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s ſake,
and hers that brings it me from him. And if you tell me that he whom you
adore is ſo powerfull that it makes Lovers ſpeak without fear, I aſſure you I have
much need to acknowledge him, to the end I may freely diſcover to my Miſtreſs
the afflictions I am in for her ſake. <hi>Amaryllis</hi> knew well enough what he aimed
at, yet made no reply, to give way to another Nymph, who addreſſed this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to <hi>Lyſis.</hi> Incomparable Shepherd, the glory and Ornament of <hi>France,
Bacchus</hi> having been acquainted with thy merit, would not be the laſt to viſit
thee. He knows that the <hi>Aquatick</hi> Gods, the <hi>Hamadriads</hi> and the <hi>Nayads</hi>
have converſed with thee, and therefore he ſhould have thought himſelf unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
ſhould he not have the honour to ſee thee. In teſtimony of the reſpect he
acknowledges due to thee, he ſends thee by me this basket of <hi>Grapes,</hi> with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of ſome of his new Wine when it is preſſed; in the mean time, accept this
preſent. Thou art alſo to know that I have ſupplanted my ſiſters to obtain this
my Ambaſſage to thee, for having all left our Country to come and ſee thee, 'twas
no mean contention for the honour to ſpeak to thee firſt. Fair Nymph, replies
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> I know not in what words to thank your <hi>Bacchus</hi> for all his favours; for
how can I ſatisfie a God, ſince I do not think my ſelf in a capacity to recompence
you, who are but his Waiters, or his Prieſteſſes? However, be pleaſed to receive
my good will, and excuſe my performances.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe ended, one of the Country fellows that led the Waggon, came
and brought a bottle of ſweet Wine for the Company, without any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
then ſaying, Behold what <hi>Bacchus</hi> hath ſent you. He had but little to
ſay, and yet he delivered it ſo unhandſomly, that all the company laught at it.
That hindred not the Ladies from getting into the Coach again and follow <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
his Chariot, which began to put forward with all the Brigade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> was the moſt taken at this ſight, and had he not heard all conclude it
was <hi>Carmelin</hi> that rid in the Waggon, he would have thought it had been <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
himſelf, according to the firſt imagination he conceived of things, which
was that of taking all fictions for truths. <hi>Carmelin</hi> indeed was well enough made
for a <hi>Bacchus,</hi> ſave that he had a little too much beard, for his noſe was as red as
a roſe, and his cheeks were no leſs. Nor did his Maſter think him ill accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated,
which made him ſay, This is indeed an excellent piece of Gallantry. See
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43725:162"/>
how <hi>Carmelin</hi> is become a brave perſon, I am afraid he'll go beyond me. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how knowing he is in matter of <hi>Metamorpheſis</hi> and the <hi>Divinities</hi> I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of belief he hath been changed into that God which makes the Vine flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.
If it have been for ſo excellent a deſigne as this, that he hath been abſent
this laſt night, I confeſs he hath had reaſon to do ſo.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſpoke thus, all the equipage of the God <hi>Bacchus</hi> went in at <hi>Oron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi>'s,
the great Gate being opened to let in the Waggon. The noiſe which the
Gatherers made with their ſinging, made <hi>Angelica</hi> look out at the window. As
ſoon as ſhe perceiv'd this great pomp, ſhe gave notice to her mother and her aunt,
who with <hi>Orontes</hi> came preſently down, and thereupon <hi>Amaryllis</hi> and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
preſented them with Grapes, as preſents from the God. They gave
them alſo ſweet Wine, for which they returned them infinite thanks, and ſpoke
much in the praiſe of <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> who they were beholding to for this conceited
invention. <hi>Amaryllis</hi> perceiving that <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> were pleaſant enough
in their humours, quitted all her reſervedneſs and gravity before them, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
among the Gatherers to <hi>Carmelins</hi> Songs.</p>
            <p>Awhile after their arrival, four Gentlemen, husbands and fathers to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen
that were with <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> being come another way on horſeback, came
and had their part of the Vintage-recreation. About the ſame time <hi>Hircan, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi>
and the reſt who came ſoftly after, entred the place, ſo that <hi>Orontes</hi> had by
that time a conſiderable Aſſembly at his houſe. Have we not ſome noble deſigne
in hand? ſaies <hi>Amaryllis;</hi> I have this morning gathered all the Grapes in my
Cloſe, there being not many Vines; and this afternoon I bring my Gatherers in
triumph. You make it appear that you have read the <hi>Dyoniſiacks,</hi> ſayes <hi>Orontes,</hi>
you are the moſt knowing Shepherdeſs that ever was. Yet there's ſomewhat
wanting in this triumph of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> ſayes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> you have neither <hi>Fawns</hi> nor <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
and they are ever of attendance to this God. Theſe women alſo whom you
have brought with you, have been too modeſt to be the Prieſteſſes of <hi>Bacchus;</hi>
they ſhould have had the Javeline, a Timbrell, or Cymbals in their hands, and
they ſhould have danced moſt furiouſly and vehemently. Content your ſelf
with what is done, without thinking of reforming us, replies <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> all thoſe
I brought with me are of my neighbourhood, where never were celebrated the
Feaſts of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> another time we'll do better.</p>
            <p>After this diſcourſe, <hi>Carmelin</hi> was taken down from his Chariot, and all the
company went into <hi>Orontes</hi>'s Hall, where was preſented the Collation. Upon
that; <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> come in, they were ſoon told they were come
too late to ſee the greateſt piece of mirth in the world, and they deſcribed to them
the preparation of the <hi>Bacchanals. Montenor</hi> was ſorry he had ſtaid ſo long,
but <hi>Anſelme</hi> thought he was there ſoon enough, ſince he found <hi>Angelica</hi> there.
When he was at any diſtance from her, he ſpoke to her by his amorous looks, and
made it appear how impertinently the Poets make Loves without eyes, for how
could one that were blind, teach us the uſe and advantage of Looks?</p>
            <p>While this Lover was ſatisfied thus, <hi>Hircan,</hi> who knew that <hi>Amaryllis</hi> had not
undertaken this gallantry but for his ſake, took it for ſuch an expreſſion of her
affection, as pleaſed him extreamly, ſo that it inflamed him more and more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, and his diſcourſes to her were the moſt pleaſant he could think on.
As for <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who was not then ſo much taken up with his Loves, but he
could attend other things that preſented themſelves; he told <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that he
wondred not much he had left him, and that he conceived it was the affection he
bore <hi>Liſetta,</hi> had forced him to that eſcape. I am a conſcientious man, ſaies
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> 'tis true, I love that wench, yet I had no deſigne to lodge at <hi>Amyril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>'s,
had I not been kept there. It ſhall be ſeen what the Gods will decree upon
thy inconſtancy, ſaies <hi>Liſis;</hi> hadſt thou ſtill loved the rock <hi>Parthenice,</hi> ſhe might
haply have recovered her former ſhape, and conſcious of the obligation, would
have beſtowed her ſelf on thee. But let's talk of ſomewhat elſe, this pleaſes thee
not. Give notice to all that are here, that they hear me. Gentlemen and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43725:162"/>
cries out <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and you Gentlewomen and Shepherdeſſes, be pleaſed
to hearken to my Maſter.</p>
            <p>Gracious preſence, ſaies <hi>Lyſis!</hi> the Triumph of <hi>Bacchus</hi> puts me in mind, that
it were fit there ſhould be order taken I might ride in Triumph too. I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
<hi>Gyants</hi> and <hi>Monſters,</hi> I have accompliſhed an incomparable adventure;
'tis for this that I deſire to triumph, riding in a Warlike Chariot, in my Heroical
accoutrements, with my Crown of Lawrel on my head, as I now have it. This
Chariot ſhall be drawn by four white horſes; there ſhall Souldiers march order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before me, carrying Pictures, wherein ſhall be repreſented divers things: In
one ſhall be ſeen the flying Horſes, in another the enchanted Caſtle, and ſo of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things that make up the Hiſtory; but ſince I cannot have thoſe I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
neither dead nor alive, there ſhall be ſome ſturdy ruſticks to repreſent
them, and ſhall be faſtned with iron Chains behind the Chariot, as if they were
my ſlaves. There ſhall be the Conqueror <hi>Anarimander,</hi> the two Gyants, the
hulchback'd Souldiers, and after that ſhall come the Effigies of the Dragon.
Can it be thought that the <hi>Romans</hi> who were ſo great Captains, did not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
make uſe of ſuch ſhifts, and gave not money to poor people to be their
ſlaves for one day, to make their triumph the more magnificent? Let this be put
off for a while, ſaies <hi>Philiris,</hi> till the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Shepherds are come. 'Tis well
advis'd, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> for there will be more to ſee me, and my glory will be the
greater: I will have as much patience as can be expected.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who had never ſeen <hi>Lyſis</hi> before, and had only heard of him, found
him a more egregious fool then they imagined, and above all things wondred at
his extravagance in his cloaths. It hapned juſt then that he himſelf took notice
of them ſo that he ſpoke further thus; Now, ſaies he, that I am clad after the
<hi>Grecian</hi> mode, I think on all the <hi>Grecian</hi> ſports. Their Olympick games were an
excellent diverſion. I ſhould wiſh there were as well in this Country all ſorts of
Games, we ſhould renew the ancient Running, Wraſtling, Leaping, and other
Recreations when I am fully eſtabliſhed, I ſhall beſtow ſome thoughts that way.
Beſides, ſince it is my reſolution to govern altogether according to the ancient
Cuſtoms; it ſhall not ſuffice to Crown the Conquerors, but there ſhall alſo be
Odes ſung in their, praiſe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ymns to the honour of the Gods. Now to doe
this there muſt be excellent Poets, which we cannot have if we have not <hi>Muſes</hi> to
<hi>inſpire</hi> them; for the Poets diſcover by their Invocations of thoſe fair Goddeſſes
at the beginning of their Works, that their ſpirits languiſh without their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
We ſhall therefore endeavour to have that Novenary Company, which
is no hard matter, ſince all good Poets bring them over to their own Countries.
I think I have heard ſay, that <hi>Ronſard</hi> went to Mount <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> and brought
them away and planted them in the Province of <hi>Vandoſme,</hi> but that they returned
to their former habitation aſſoon as he died. Are not we able to make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
hither again? We need only ſend <hi>Philiris,</hi> who, to divert him in his journy,
may have <hi>Carmelin</hi> with him: They are very fit for the deſigne, for <hi>Philiris</hi> is
already as good in Verſe as Proſe; and as for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he is alſo a lettered man;
ſometimes he ſpeaks nothing but Sentences. You muſt take your journey one of
theſe daies, my friends: the enterpriſe will be to you reputation. Then ſhall
you be able to do miracles in <hi>Poetry,</hi> and the ſeven Liberal Sciences; for the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes
you ſhall bring with you, will teach you all things: You ſhall take ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
at <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> I do not believe the <hi>Muſes</hi> will come hither by Sea, ſaies
<hi>Philiris,</hi> they would be afraid leſt all their Learning might be ſhipwrack'd. <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
ſhall then lend you his Coach and flying horſes, replies <hi>Lyſis.</hi> We ſhall be
overcrowded if we take in all the <hi>Nine</hi> fair Ladies, anſwers <hi>Philiris,</hi> I will rather
between this and that time bethink me of ſome better invention, 'Twill be a
brave thing to ſee the Muſes in this Country, ſaies <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>liantes:</hi> but if they would
oblige us, they ſhould endeavour to give us a ſpring of <hi>Hippocras,</hi> inſtead of that
of <hi>Hippocrene.</hi> I believe they will have a many more viſitants, and that their
Fountain will be preferred before any waters in <hi>France.</hi> Since their Maſter
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43725:163"/>
               <hi>Apollo</hi> is the God of Phyſick, he will alſo enable them to cure all diſeaſed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as well as divert melancholick minds. Some then ſhall go to viſit them to
learn their Art, others for remedy againſt their indiſpoſitions, and moſt out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity;
and this is it makes me believe it will be hard to make them keep in
<hi>France,</hi> for they muſt ever be on ſome Mountain, where every one muſt have her
Grot to ſtudy in, as your Hermits do in their Cells; whereas here they'll be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
diſturbed by importunate viſits; and though they were troubled with
none but ſuch as deſire to be <hi>Poets,</hi> yet would they have enough to divert them
from their meditations; Nay I believe if they will permit all to drink at their
Fountain, it would be dry in one day. There is yet another inconvenience they
are ſubject to, if there be not order taken, and it is this, <hi>France</hi> is well ſtored with
a ſort of people who make it their buſineſs to cajoll and corrupt young Maids;
it's to be feared they may do theſe ſome injury, and ſo that honourable Chaſtity
which they proſeſſed ſo much before, will be deſtroyed; and you know
that aſſoon as a maid is loſt once as to honeſty, in <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe is preſently betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the devotion of a ſort of Pimps, and ſuch other props and pillars of Taverns
and Bawdy-houſes; and it may be the misfortune of the Muſes to fall under the
mercy of ſuch infamous perſons, ſo that to the ſcandal of all the world, they muſt
proſtitute all their knowledge to them: and where there ſhould be men of good
reputation, making Verſes in the ſhade of a Lawrel Tree, on the brink of ſome
Fountain, or elſe in the ſilence of a private ſtudy; there will be only a ſort of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds
that compoſe with a glaſs in their hand, or a pipe of Tobacco in their
mouthes and will be delivered of more hiccocks then Verſes! They will alſo be
as baſe and laſcivious as Satyrs, which is the reaſon that commonly their Works
come out under that name. I am obliged to you for theſe conſiderations, ſaies
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> you ſhew your tenderneſs of the honour of the <hi>Muſes;</hi> but is your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo weak as to believe I had not prevention enough to provide for all theſe
diſorders? When they ſhall have choſen ſome little Mountain in this Countrey
for their abode, I ſhall eaſily keep away the lewd Robin-good-fellows of <hi>Paris</hi>
to come and ſee them: They ſhall be kept in with good Walls, and there ſhall be
ſtrong Guards at the Gates.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Lyſis</hi> ended this diſcourſe, it hapned <hi>Charite</hi> had ſomewhat to ſay to <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi>
ſo that ſhe came into the Hall to acquaint her with it; but ſhe went out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
immediately ſeeing ſo many people, and eſpecially <hi>Lyſis,</hi> for ſhe was aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to appear before him, and was afraid ſomwhat might be ſaid to her as ſhe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by. The Heroick Shepherd ſhifted off his diſcourſe when he perceived her,
ſo abruptly, that all wondred at it. O God! ſaies he in himſelf, I have ſeen her,
and ſhe hath ſeen me, now I have my deſires, ſhe hath at length ſhown her ſelf,
notwithſtanding her ſolitary humour.</p>
            <p>But after this, perceiving that <hi>Charite</hi> was gone, he was ſad as might be, ſo
that he entred not into any further talk with any body. <hi>Hircan</hi> in the mean time
having ſpoken to <hi>Amaryllis</hi> more clearly of his affection then ever, ſhe told him
that ſhe thought her ſelf much honoured, if he loved her only on honourable
grounds; and thereupon an ancient Gentleman, a kinſman of <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near them, ſaid that the Aſſembly was ſo great and noble, that he imagined
himſelf at the contract of a Marriage. It ſhall not be my fault if it be not ſo,
ſaies <hi>Hircan;</hi> I wiſh the things I have ſpoken to your fair Niece here, were already
effected; and if you pleaſe, you ſhall know what they are. He thereupon told him
his ſuit to <hi>Aamaryllis,</hi> and the advantages of her marriage with him; ſo that the
old Blade liked all very well; and having underſtood that his Neece, who was
the moſt concern'd in it, conſented, he went and propoſed the buſineſs to <hi>Orontes,</hi>
and the other Gentlemen. The matter was ſo advanced, that they ſent for a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to paſs the Contract, and a Prieſt to make them ſure. 'Twas ſaid that a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
permiſſion had brought this Aſſembly together, ſince that if they had been
to be betroathed upon previous aſſignation, they could have invited none other
but what were preſent, for the chiefeſt friends of <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Amaryllis</hi> were
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43725:163"/>
there. <hi>Lyſis</hi> was almoſt out of himſelf to ſee the buſineſs ſo ſoon effected,
and becauſe he was for its going forward, he ſigned the minutes of the Contract
as well as the reſt. While all this was in agitation, <hi>Anſelme</hi> had the oportunity
to ſpeak to <hi>Angelica,</hi> and their paſſions were ſo violent, that though they had
ſufficiently declared one to another their minds, yet they reſolved on a viſit at
night, as they had deſigned the day before. <hi>Angelica</hi> told him that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
might be about ten of the clock in a Bower of the Garden where ſhe would
be ſure to be, and that ſhe would order the back-gate to be left open for <hi>Anſelme</hi>
to come in at.</p>
            <p>The complot being made, they ſeparated, to avoid ſuſpicion, when in the mean
time <hi>Lyſis,</hi> whoſe mind was burthened with excellent deſignes, went out of the
Hall and ſet upon <hi>Jacquelina</hi> the Kitchenmaid. Fair Companion of my Miſtreſs,
ſaies he to her, ſhall I never obtain of you that favour which you may grant me
without any hurt to your ſelf? Tell me what hour I may entertain <hi>Charite</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
'Tis ſo long ſince I have ſpoken with her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it even grieves me to death.
Come at night between nine and ten into the Garden, replies the maid, there you
will find her; ſhe commonly reſts her ſelf on a green Plat in one of the Alleys,
ſo much is ſhe taken with the coole of the evening; when ſhe is to go to bed, we
muſt ever go and fetch her thence. <hi>Lyſis</hi> thank'd the maid for this notice, and
promiſed her not to fail at the time aſſigned.</p>
            <p>The Sun being already ſomewhat low, <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> retired, ſo did
the Gentlemen of <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s quarter; and as for her part, ſhe took Coach with
the Gentlewomen her Gatherers. <hi>Hircan</hi> being unwilling to leave his Miſtreſs,
went along with them in the Coach. As for the Countrey-people whom
<hi>Bacchus</hi> had brought with him, they had before taken their leave. <hi>Fontenay</hi> and
the other Shepherds ſeeing their Hoſt had left them, returned nevertheleſs to his
Caſtle, and carried <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> along with them. Now that there is a freſh
gale of wind ſtirring, would you not gladly be a little warmer about the head,
ſaies <hi>Philiris?</hi> this ſingle Lawrel cannot keep off the inconvenience of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I feel nothing I ſwear to thee, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and I would not by any means
have been Crowned otherwiſe in ſo honourable an Aſſembly as we have been in;
beſides, that <hi>Charite</hi> hath ſeen me in this poſture, which comforts me above all:
Not will I be otherwiſe cloathed then I am now, at <hi>Hircans</hi> Wedding. 'Tis true,
that when it is once night, I ſhould not think my hat any inconvenience.</p>
            <p>With ſuch diſcourſe the Paſtoral Company came to their ordinary abode; and
while Supper was making ready, <hi>Lyſis</hi> addreſſed himſelf thus to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> Thou
haſt known the beſt part of my nobleſt adventures, courteous <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and I
believe there is not any one which thou doſt not admire, and celebrate to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
as the eloquent <hi>Philiris</hi> does, who hath promiſed me to diſpoſe them into a
<hi>Romance,</hi> that ſhall go beyond all have been yet ſeen in the world. But I am not
to diſſemble or diſguiſe my ſelf to thee: I am not yet ſatisfied, though it may be
ſaid I do but dream when I think to effect any great matters to make my Hiſtory
the more remarkable. I never ſpoke to my Miſtreſs in any ſecret place, and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had any deſigne to ſteal her away; yet it may be found in Books, that a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Lovers that were not comparable to me, have done all this. 'Tis true, they
are not the more to be eſteemed for any of all theſe things, for theſe were all the
adventures they were ever guilty of; whereas I have run through ten thouſand:
yet muſt I not omit this. I am reſolved this night to ſpeak to <hi>Charite,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to deliver her out of <hi>Orontes</hi>'s: for indeed ſhe is not in a condition
worthy her perfections. She hath ſometimes told me that ſhe was abuſed, and
that ſhe was kept in great ſubjection. If thou wilt but aſſiſt me in this occaſion,
I will do as much for thee in another. I cannot deny you, ſaies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> but if
I love the great Stone you would have me, would you undertake to bring away
ſuch a heavy piece? We ſhall try, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> Love will furniſh us with force
and artifice. Let's for the preſent think on what I propoſe: Know then that I
have had notice from <hi>Jacquelina,</hi> to come into <hi>Orontes</hi>'s Garden, there to ſee my
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43725:164"/>
My Miſtreſs. But I pray tell me, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> what ſhall we do with her when
we have her? We will carry her into ſome ſtrange Country till our friends
ſhall agree to the match, repy'd <hi>Lyſis:</hi> But in the mean time, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
will you take nothing of her by way of advance? What a propoſition doſt thou
make? ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that's a thing <hi>Pamphilus</hi> would never do to <hi>Niſa, Perſiles</hi> to
<hi>Sigiſmonda, Liſander</hi> to <hi>Caliſta, Polexander</hi> to <hi>Ericlea;</hi> and to go a little higher in
the Chronology, what <hi>Clitophon</hi> never did to <hi>Leucippa,</hi> nor <hi>Theagenes</hi> to <hi>Chariclea:</hi>
All theſe Lovers had about them a modeſty which kept them from asking any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
favours of their Miſtreſſes then kiſſes; They lived together like brother
and ſiſter; I do not mean as <hi>Jupiter</hi> with his ſiſter <hi>Juno:</hi> beſides, thou art to
know <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that <hi>Charite</hi>'s thighs are two Pillars of white Marble, which I
compare to thoſe which the great <hi>Alcides</hi> erected at the end of his Travels. There
will be found written that there is no going beyond, and that to do it is a thing
forbiden our hands, nay our very deſires; it is not yet time that the ſpring of that
Beauty ſhould be rob'd of its roſe. You are ſo honeſt a man, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that
you ſhall not need ſwear that you deſire the preſervation of <hi>Charite</hi>'s chaſtity;
but that which troubles me is, to know how we ſhall be tranſported into thoſe
far Countries where you deſire to go: It will coſt us much to carry all neceſſaries
with us; I know not at preſent whether your purſe be ſo heavy or no. Muſt we
not go to <hi>Bertrands</hi> for our Sheep, and take them along with us? That were
too great a trouble to us, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that imagination of thine is very ruſtick:
Can people that run away carry a Flock with them? yet I am obliged to thee
for what thou haſt ſaid, for thou haſt often put me in mind of my poor ſheep,
whereof I have had no great care ſince we came hither, becauſe our Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and other recreations have made me paſs away the time the more pleaſantly.
I know I am to blame that I have not brought them hither to feed with <hi>Hircans;</hi>
But to ſatisfie thee in the reſt, know that we need not be ſo rich to undertake this
deſigne I now have. We will take <hi>Charite</hi> with us into <hi>Hircans</hi> Coach, and ſo
we ſhal be tranſported immediately into far Countries. We ſhal want nothing by
the way, we ſhall meet with <hi>Magicians</hi> that will entertain us, and if there be but
Hangings in their Chambers, we ſhall never die for want of meat. But if they be
hang'd with <hi>Mats,</hi> ſhall we like Aſſes feed in the ſtraw? Thou are too diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> know that if we pleaſe we ſhall need take no Inn by the
way, for we ſhall be in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> in an inſtant, and there we'll put on Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
weeds, and ſo ſhall be magnificently entertained in the Palaces of ſome
great Lords; for it's ſeen that in all Romances, Lovers have ſomewhat charming
about them, which makes them be eſteemed and ſought after by all they meet
with, ſo that they never go into any place but they fare well, they having no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſo much as to open their Purſes. Let what will come on't then, ſaies <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin,</hi>
I'll ſee the effects of your enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>As theſe Shepherds were engaged in this diſcourſe, <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who commanded
all in his Couzens abſence, cauſed Supper to be brought up, and all ſate down.
Supper ended, <hi>Lyſis</hi> of his own accord put off his Crown and took his hat,
thinking it more convenient to wear in the night. He went out ſecretly with
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> and ſuffered the reſt to go to bed, who thought he had been abed
too.</p>
            <p>After a many diſcourſes in the fields, <hi>Carmelin</hi> told his Maſter, it might very
well be about the time appointed; <hi>Lyſis</hi> thought ſo too, ſo that he took his way
towards <hi>Orontes</hi>'s with his faithfull Companion in Love and Arms, who was ſo
deſirous to ſee what he would do, that it was curioſity rather then duty obliged
him to follow him.</p>
            <p>They found the Garden dore open, <hi>Angelica</hi> having given order it ſhould be
left ſo, to keep promiſe with <hi>Anſelme.</hi> This ſeemed ſuch a fortune to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who
was glad to avoid the ſcaling of the Walls, that it put him into great hopes his
deſigne might have a happy iſſue. As he went about the Garden to find that
graſſy place where <hi>Charite</hi> reſted her ſelf, <hi>Anſelme</hi> who was carefull of his hour,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43725:164"/>
comes in at the ſame dore, and went directly to the Bower where <hi>Angelica</hi> was
to expect him; ſhe was already there, and waited for him with ſome impatience.
<hi>Anſelme</hi> courted her with all the Love-Complements that a favour ſuch as ſhe
had done him could deſerve, and as ſhe promiſed him far greater, if he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a faithfull Love to her, ſo he made a thouſand proteſtations of an eternal
conſtancy. He was preſently paid again by her in the ſame coine; and this gave
him the confidence to kiſs his Miſtreſs, as if he wiſhed that their lips preſſing
one anothers, ſhould ſeal with a Love-ſignet, the promiſe they had made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> in the mean time, who had a better ſight then his Maſter, told <hi>Lyſis</hi>
he had found a Walk wherein there was a bank of Trifoly, and that he perceived
ſomebody lying down thereon: <hi>Lyſis</hi> looking towards it, thought it had been
<hi>Charite,</hi> but it was only a Faggot dreſſed and ſwath'd about, which <hi>Jacquelina</hi>
had put there to deceive <hi>Lyſis;</hi> he makes towards it very ſoftly; and as he
thought he had <hi>Charite</hi> by the Coat, the apparition retreats a little: How's this?
ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> your Miſtreſs ſlides along the graſſe like a Snake; Speak lower,
ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> or hold thy peace leſt thou frighten her.</p>
            <p>Having ſo ſaid, he came nearer and nearer, and took hold of a ſleeve ſtuffed
with rags, which was faſtned to the Faggot, thinking he then had his Miſtreſs
faſt enough; What do you here ſo ſolitary? my Faireſt, ſaies he, do you not
fear the Mildew? that you prefer this place before <hi>Orontes</hi>'s houſe, is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you are more diſſatisfied then ever? Tell me without diſſimulation, for I
am come hither to deliver you out of your miſery; you ſhall henceforth be with
him, who is more carefull of you then himſelf.</p>
            <p>As he had ended theſe words, his fair <hi>Charite</hi> made a great ſtruggle to get out
of his hands, for the Kitchen-maid, and ſome other ſervants of <hi>Orontes</hi>'s being
at the end of the Walk, held a Cord that was faſtned to the Faggot, which when
they pulled, drew it away; Come and help me <hi>Carmelin,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lyſis,</hi> there is
ſome rival takes away <hi>Charite</hi> by the other arm: I muſt needs think ſo though
I can ſee none, the night hinders me to perceive it; but yet do not come, leſt we
ſhould by that means pull this tender bodie in pieces. Thus was the fair <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoclea</hi>
diſmembred by her Lovers, who would all have her. Here he paws'd a-little,
whereupon the ſervants having given another good pull, brought away
clearly the dreſſed Faggot. <hi>Liſis</hi> had nothing left him but an old glove ſtuffed
with paper that had been ſewed to the ſleeve for to make a hand. Wo is me!
ſaies the poor Lover, what have I done? wretch that I am, is not this <hi>Charite</hi>'s
hand? my violent pulling of her hath now left her but one hand.</p>
            <p>This he ſpoke ſomewhat lowd, and the ſervants made no ſmall noiſe with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſo that <hi>Leonora</hi> who was not yet aſleep, called her daughter to know what
was the matter below; ſhe perceiving that ſhe anſwered not, though ſhe were
alwaies eaſily awoken, concluded ſhe was not abed; her Chamber being near
hers, ſhe put on her coat, and out of curioſity went in, and not finding her,
would needs know what ſhe did: ſhe comes down into the Garden, at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
whereof ſhe found the maid and ſome of <hi>Orontes</hi> his men: What do you
here, what noiſe you make? ſaies ſhe to them. 'Tis only to put to a trick on
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> replies the maid, who took a buſh for his Miſtreſs. You want ſomewhat
to do indeed; Tell me where my daughter is: are my brother and ſiſter abed?
is ſhe not with them? They are abed Madam, replies the man, and ſure my
young Miſtreſs is abed too: But ſhe is not, ſaies <hi>Leonora,</hi> almoſt out of her ſelf,
I muſt find her out. Having ſo ſaid, ſhe went directly to the Bower where her
daughter was with <hi>Anſelme;</hi> and the two Lovers knowing who it was, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
ſurprized; and ſhe aſſoon knew both <hi>Angelica</hi> and <hi>Anſelme</hi> too: Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him there at an unſeaſonable hour, ſhe could not but ſpeak theſe words to
him, Is it thus then Sir, that you abuſe my goodneſs? Are you not content with
the honourable Liberty which I have ever granted? Does it not ſuffice you to
ſpeak to my daughter every day in my preſence, but you muſt bring her to this
place? As for her part, I ſhall puniſh her impudence; ſhe muſt have a great
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43725:165"/>
deal of confidence to leave me to come hither at ſuch time as I think her abed
Where was it ever ſeen that Gentlewomen of quality have ever taken ſo much
liberty?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonora</hi> was thus chiding both the one and the other, and <hi>Angelica</hi> anſwered
her already by her tears; when <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who went all about looking for <hi>Charite</hi> in
an extream affliction, as thinking he had pulled off one of her hands, came into
that place, where on the one ſide there was ſo much cholor, and on the other ſo
much amazement: The firſt he perceived was <hi>Leonora,</hi> whom his extravagance
made him take for his Miſtreſs, ſo that he ran to her with his arms open, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
embraced her ſaid to her in a ſad accent, Pardon me the outrage I have done
you my faireſt, there may be means to make all good again; my friend <hi>Hircan</hi>
can do any thing. Who hath brought this fool hither again? ſaies <hi>Leonora,</hi>
thruſting him from her; is it you <hi>Anſelme?</hi> I believe you have brought him pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
from <hi>Paris,</hi> to amuſe me with his extravagances, ſo that I might not heed
your ill deſignes; you are to blame for it, and you have done what misbecomes
the reputation which you have in the world. <hi>Anſelme</hi> deſirous to appeaſe this
angry Mother, ſpoke to her in theſe words, I am yet ignorant, Madam, ſaies he,
of that wherein you ſhould think I have committed ſo great a fault, for I will
ſwear to you that I have done nothing with <hi>Angelica</hi> which I ſhould not before
you: all that you can ſay is, that I have ſpoken with her at a time when you
thought me far hence; but can you find no excuſe for that, and will you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that true one which I ſhall give you? I am ſo much a lover of ſolitary
walking, that in ſome melancholick thoughts I came thus far, and finding the
dore open, came into the Garden; your daughter being walking for coolneſs, I
could do no leſs then ſalute her; and our firſt complements ended when you ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
us. This is a fine tale to feed fools with, ſaies <hi>Leonora,</hi> I am not ſo light
of belief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> hearing this diſcourſe not without amazement, perceiv'd <hi>Charite</hi> was
not there, and not deſiring to be informed of the occaſion of this debate, he ſpoke
thus, Tell me quickly where my Miſtreſs is, and ſuffer me not to languiſh ſo long.
Alas I have pulled off one of her hands which I have here; it muſt be ſew'd to the
arm again, and the wound anointed with ſome Balſome, that while it is yet green
the fleſh may knit again. Make this fool hold his peace, if you will, <hi>Anſelme,</hi>
ſaies <hi>Leonora,</hi> I can no longer endure his impertinency; he hath no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
in it then to abuſe me. I was as ignorant, Madam, as your ſelf of <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s
being here, replyes <hi>Anſelme,</hi> he comes from <hi>Hircans</hi> Caſtle, and not from
<hi>Montenors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While <hi>Anſelme</hi> diſcourſed thus, <hi>Carmelin</hi> came and told his Maſter that he
had no occaſion to be troubled, and that he thought he had heard <hi>Charite</hi>
laugh, ſo that it was to be conceived ſhe had had no hurt: But have I not her
hand here, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> I pray let me ſee it, ſaies <hi>Carmelin. Lyſis</hi> gave it him
to hold; and <hi>Carmelin</hi> finding preſently it was but a glove, acquainted his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
with it, who coming ſomewhat to himſelf, began to ſee the truth: he took
back the glove with admiration, and taking his ſervant aſide, ſee, ſaies he, there's
<hi>Anſelme</hi> in the Bower, he is with <hi>Angelica,</hi> and queſtionleſs he had a deſigne to
carry her away. Thou maiſt infer from this, I am not the only Lover that hath
ſuch intentions; but take notice that <hi>Leonora</hi> is there too: I took her erewhiles
in the dark for <hi>Charite;</hi> ſhe is extreamly angry with <hi>Anſelme:</hi> all this have I
obſerved, though my mind was in an extraordinary agitation: wherefore we
were beſt begone, leſt we be taken as acceſaries, and be endicted as raviſhers of
young maids; 'tis true, if things be taken as they ſhould be, I am not ſo much in
fault as my Miſtreſs; for whereas I had only the deſigne to raviſh her, but have
effected nothing, ſhe hath effectually raviſhed me; and if I would have raviſhed
her fair body, ſhe hath raviſhed my poor ſoul: But theſe ſubtile reaſons haply
are not ſo eaſily underſtood, therefore it's beſt provide for our own ſafety; I have
already ſuffered for it. Then, Maſter, let's begone, replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> you
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43725:165"/>
ſhall not need ſpeak to me twice: I have ever feared dangers.</p>
            <p>Hereupon they took the ſame way they came, without the notice of any body;
and when they had recovered <hi>Hircans</hi> Caſtle, they both went to bed well ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for though <hi>Lyſis</hi> had not brought away <hi>Charite</hi> as he intended, yet was he glad
he had not pulled off her hand, as he imagined, which made him reſolve ever to
preſerve the glove he had gotten inſtead of it. As for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> his comfort was,
that he was not beaten, becauſe he imagined that enterpriſes, ſuch as he had
engaged in, were ſeldome attempted, but at the hazard of the ſhoulders.</p>
            <p>While they were going their waies, <hi>Orontes</hi> having heard a noiſe in his Garden,
asked one of his Lacquays what the matter was; he was loath to tell him that it
was only a trick put upon <hi>Lyſis,</hi> but choſe rather to tell him that <hi>Leonora</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with her daughter: The ſtrangeneſs of that accident made him preſently get
up, and putting on a night-Gown, he came down into the Garden; he firſt of all
asked his ſiſter in law what was the occaſion of her crying out, ſhe in few words
told him the cauſe of her diſquiet: I believe your complaints may be juſt, ſaid he
to her, but there are means to remedy all: and thereupon taking <hi>Anſelme</hi> by the
hand, he took him aſide to tell him, that if he loved <hi>Angelica,</hi> he ſhould openly
acknowledge his pretentions to her, and not make uſe of theſe amorous ſhifts, as
being not a little prejudicial to the reputation of young Ladies. <hi>Anſelme</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
that if he thought <hi>Leonora</hi> did not ſlight him, he ſhould think himſelf much
honoured to ſerve her daughter before all the world, and that he could never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe
of himſelf into a better allyance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orontes</hi> being ſatisfied with this diſcourſe, went to appeaſe <hi>Leonora,</hi>
aſſuring her that <hi>Anſelmes</hi> intentions were honourable: and that he had no
other deſigne then to marry her daughter. This ſhe gave ear to, knowing
that <hi>Anſelme</hi> was rich, and that ſhe could not meet with a better match: She ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his pardon for having been ſo rough with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and told him that on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
they would talk further of the buſineſs. Now ſince it was too late for
<hi>Anſelme</hi> to go back to <hi>Montenors, Orontes</hi> kept him at his houſe, and ſent for one
of his Lacquays, who ſtaid for him in the fields with his horſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montenor</hi> was ſomewhat troubled for his friend who returned not; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the morning, his Lacquay brought him an account of him, and deſired
him from his Maſter, to come to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s aſſoon as he could: he failed not to
come, and <hi>Anſelme</hi> propoſed the preſent tranſaction. The paſſion of this Lover
was more violent then to ſuffer any delay; ſo that <hi>Orontes</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi> having
drawn up the Conditions of the Contract, he granted all they deſired one only
thing provided, that there ſhould be no further ſtay in the buſineſs; <hi>Leonora</hi>
made ſome exception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would not be ſo haſty ſaying that ſhe muſt firſt return
to <hi>Paris:</hi> But <hi>Florida</hi> adviſed her not to put her ſelf to that trouble, ſo that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme,</hi>
and <hi>Angelica</hi> were made ſure that morning.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Lyſis</hi> being got up, the firſt thing he did was to contemplate
<hi>Charite</hi>'s glove: he took out al the rags of paper that were within, and when he had
unfolded them, thinking they had been Love-Letters that ſome Rival had ſent to
his Miſtreſs, he found occaſion to quit the jealouſie, for he found nothing but
pieces of accounts for the Kitchin; thoſe he valued not, ſuppoſing they were
thruſt in there by chance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as for the glove, he folded it up in white paper,
to ſhew it ſome day to <hi>Philiris,</hi> as an evidence of the deſigne he had to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<hi>Charite,</hi> which would have been as great an ornament to the ſtory, as if he
had effected it.</p>
            <p>He and <hi>Carmelin</hi> being alone talking of divers things, <hi>Fontenay</hi> and the other
Shepherds came into the Chamber. He wondred to ſee them clad like Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and that of the braveſt: What, ſaies he to them, will you forſake me, my
dear friends? will you continue no longer in the happy condition you had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
your ſelves in with me; Alas! who is the author of this diſorder? but if
any leave me, let <hi>Philiris</hi> ſtay, the incomparable ingenuity that promiſed me to
do ſuch great matters: Do not imagin we ſhall be guilty of ſuch a ſignal unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43725:166"/>
as to forſake you, replies <hi>Philiris,</hi> that we are not now clad as Shepherds,
but as the Country requires, 'tis becauſe <hi>Hircan</hi> is married to day, and that we
muſt be gallant to ſet forth the ſolemnity of the Wedding: Nay then you give a
good account, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and for my part here's my Heroical habit which I have
put on with my buskins as doubting much ſuch a buſineſs; I will alſo put on my
belt and Sword, and will wear my Crown of Lawrel on my head, to do all the
honour I can to the incomparable <hi>Hircan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having ſpoken thus, took all his equipage; and being he was invited to
the Wedding with the reſt, as alſo <hi>Carmelin,</hi> they took <hi>Hircans</hi> Coach for to go
to <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s, where the ſolemnity was kept; There they found <hi>Clarimond</hi> and
his mother, who were in like manner invited: They had been married betimes
in the morning, and few people were preſent; but at Dinner there was a fair
Company: They now ſtaid only for <hi>Orontes</hi> and thoſe of his houſe, with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme</hi>
and <hi>Montenor,</hi> but they came in good time, and excuſed themſelves for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſtaid ſo long, becauſe they had been buſie at a betroathing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You jeſt, do
you not? ſaies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> or is it only <hi>Orontes</hi> his man that marries a Countrey
Laſs he's fallen in love with? 'Tis notably gueſt, replies <hi>Orontes;</hi> no, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
perſons of greater quality; ask <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> what they know of
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montenor</hi> hereupon related the whole truth of the buſineſs, whereat they were
all very joyfull; and yet <hi>Lyſis</hi> could not but break out thus; Since all the world
is reſolved to be married here, without ſtaying till I marry, to make a fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of all amorous adventures; why are you not all marryed together? Why
was not <hi>Anſelme</hi> made ſure yeſterday, that he might have been-married to day as
well as <hi>Hircan?</hi> that had been according to the mode of the moſt famous Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
where all the Marriages happen on the ſame day, and in the ſame place.
Would you not alſo have them lie all in the ſame bed? ſaies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
him, you give us indeed fine examples by quoting your Fables to us. Do
you not yet perceive that they are abſurdities imagined at the Authors pleaſure?
can there be ſuch a concernment and relation between the affairs of ſeaven or
eight ſeveral Families, that they ſhall in one day agree all on Marriages? Is there
not ever ſome delay of one ſide or other? And as for the Weddings of divers
perſons all in the ſame place, where hath there ever any ſuch thing been ſeen? In
ſuch a confuſion, how can each Bridegroom obſerve his duty to his friends, and
place them all according to their qualities?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> would have made ſome lewd reply to this, but his deſigne was prevented
by aſſigning him his place at Table, where he was ſo placed, that he had a hard
task to anſwer all that ſhould queſtion him on divers points of his Loves. When
his mind was any thing at liberty, he fell into a very deep conſideration: It came
into his mind, that when he was diſguiſed like a maid, he was called <hi>Amaryllis;</hi>
and ſeeing now another <hi>Amaryllis</hi> marryed to <hi>Hircan,</hi> who was the perſon ſhe
moſt loved; he knew not whether he might thence preſage any thing to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and that it ſhould ſignifie that he ſhould one day by the Knot of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
be joyned to her whom he adored above all things. Beſides, this <hi>Amaryl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
was ſomewhat like the Nymph <hi>Lucida,</hi> of whom he thought he had been lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
for whom alſo he had ſome ſpark of affection; but ſeeing this <hi>Lucida</hi> had
repreſented <hi>Charite</hi> to him, and that this <hi>Amaryllis</hi> had repreſented to him that
<hi>Lucida,</hi> and that he now ſaw this <hi>Amaryllis</hi> between <hi>Hircans</hi> arms, he ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
ſuffered a viciſcitude of imagination, and ſtood between hope and fear.
Thus out of too great ſuperſtition, he reflected on particulars of no conſequence,
thinking thence to preſage what was to come.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of their dancing after dinner, comes into the Hall the Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Adrian,</hi> with his wife <hi>Pernella;</hi> all that knew them were very glad to ſee
them, except <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who forgetting all other conſiderations, went to hide himſelf
in the Chimney-corner: You are welcome, ſaies <hi>Hircan,</hi> I wiſh you had been
here ſooner to have dined with us; Truly Sir, replies <hi>Adrian,</hi> I thank you for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43725:166"/>
your good wil, I come hither only to fetch away my Couſin; I have bin at a Caſtle,
which I think belongs to you, where I asked for him, but I was told he was here,
ſo that I have cauſed the Waggon to come thus far out of the way: I had told
you I ſhould ſtay in this Countrey ſomewhat longer then my Pilgrimage requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
for I have been with a Gentleman that ought me ſome money, he hath paid
me, I thank God, and beſides he hath entertained me well till now, which, without
offence to you, is a quality ſeldom found in ſuch people; but it may be he did it
to draw me in to truſt him further another time: That may very well be, ſaies
<hi>Hircan,</hi> but I pray reſt your ſelves a little, while ſomewhat be made ready for your
dinner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> hereupon ſaid he had din'd, and that he deſired only to ſpeak with his
Couſin, which obliged <hi>Meliantes</hi> to bring him into the midſt of the Hall; <hi>Adrian</hi>
ſeeing him accoutred as he was, was extreamly angry; What, ſaies he to him,
wilt thou never give over thy follies? thou every day takeſt up new faſhions:
At St. <hi>Clou</hi> thou wert clad like a Shepherd; the other day thou wert like a Witch,
and now thou art like a Player: Well Gentlemen, continues he, turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thoſe that were preſent, you are to blame to make your ſport of this poor
lad: 'Tis true, your Couſin finds us much ſport, ſaies <hi>Anſelme,</hi> but it ſhews his
ingenuity greater then ours to invent new paſtimes: That he is clad as you ſee
him, is only out of gallantry. How now Couſin, (ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> not heeding what had
been ſaid in his excuſe) are you amazed to ſee me clad thus? know that I am not
ſimply a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> but that I am an <hi>Heroical Shepherd;</hi> you ſhall find me one
day painted in Books as you ſee me now. <hi>Adrian</hi> thought not theſe reaſons good
payment, and ſwore he would carry away his Ward with him to <hi>Paris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> You ſhall
ſtay here two or three dayes, ſaies <hi>Anſelme</hi> to him, this is but a Wedding: you
ſhal ſee it is ſo, and withall conſider whether our actions are ſo much to be found
fault with, as that there ſhould be any danger to leave your Ward among us.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe ſomewhat appeaſed <hi>Adrian;</hi> and though he had a pair of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Boots on, yet a Gentlewoman went and invited him to dance a Galliard;
he durſt not refuſe her, and took it as an occaſion to ſhew what he could have
done in his youth. After that they danced a Roundelay, wherein both he and
his wife were ingaged, as alſo <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin,</hi> ſo that it was no ſmall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to ſee their ſeveral poſtures. The Company decreaſed by little and little,
becauſe ſome that were invited to dinner, were not to ſtay ſupper: There were
in a manner none but what belong'd to <hi>Hircan,</hi> that ſtaid. <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella</hi>
having ſtaid the Wedding Supper, though they were ſtrangers, yet were they
lodged in another houſe, for they had need of reſt, being quite wearied, both
with dancing and travel.</p>
            <p>Awhile after the Married Couple went to bed, and <hi>Philiris</hi> with his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
having ſung an <hi>Epithalamium</hi> at the dore, as they were to come down; there
were Nuts ſo ſcattered on the ſtairs, that they came to the bottom ſooner then
they deſired: Beſides which there were a many thrown at them, which made a
ſtrange noiſe; however they had no hurt, and took all in jeſt; but it made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſport when they underſtood all proceeded from the Illuſtrious Shepherd, who
had not been with them to ſing, but had been on the top of the ſtairs to ſhew
them this trick. You have done nobly, ſaies <hi>Meliantes</hi> to him, I believe
you have ranſacked all the Town, to what purpoſe is it to caſt away ſo many
Nuts? Ah! ſayies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> with a diſdainfull ſmile, how little are you acquainted
in the <hi>Grecian</hi> and Heroick affairs! 'Tis to be learned out of all good Authors,
that the Wedding night, Nuts were caſt all about the houſe, that the noiſe was
made in gathering them again, ſhould ſtifle the crying out of the Bride: 'twas
my deſigne to imitate that good Cuſtome. Having by chance found a quantity
of Nuts in the Cockloft of this houſe, I put them into bags, and caſt them at you
as you paſſed by: And thus ought we to obſerve the excellencies we find in the
Poets, and ancient Authors. You never mind theſe things, and that I now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
is leſt you might omit any of the nuptial rites: Have you ſung <hi>Hymen,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43725:167"/>
Hymen, Hymenaee?</hi> Have you invocated <hi>Juno?</hi> have you lighted the Sacred
Torch? We have done all this, ſaies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> but for your part you have been
much out: You have caſt away abundance of Nuts, for <hi>Amaryllis</hi> does not cry
out, there's no Maidenhead to loſe; did you not know ſhe was a Widow, and
that her firſt husband had the firſt fruits? You ſhould have kept your Nuts till
to morrow that <hi>Angelica</hi> is to be married: There you might have beſtowed them
according to the ancient Cuſtome. Whatever's done, ſaies <hi>Polidor,</hi> we muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
<hi>Lyſis</hi>'s ingenuity, to be ſo ready to put in practice a thing ſo ancient as that
no body thought on't, it being a thing of no neceſſity in the times we live in,
when both widows and maids are ſo tractable, that they never cry out the firſt
night. For my part, ſaies <hi>Meliantes,</hi> I am not ſorry for my fall, were it not but to
learn this Cuſtom of <hi>Lyſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philiris</hi> hereupon, who was more pleaſed with this humour then any, went and
knocked at the Chamber-dore where the married couple were abed, not deſiring
it might be opened, and bid <hi>Amaryllis</hi> cry out as lowd as ſhe would, teling her no
body would hear her, becauſe <hi>Lyſis</hi> had taken order to the contrary, having ſown
Nuts all about the houſe, according to the ancient Cuſtom which he finds in his
Books. <hi>Hircan</hi> who had heard the noiſe, whereof he would gladly have known
the reaſon, was very well pleaſed at this news, which made him laugh heartily;
and as for <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> ſhe was no leſs ſatisfied, as having now ſhared with him
the greateſt pleaſures of this life. But in the mean time the Dairy-woman hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the noiſe of the Nuts cracking under their feet, began to remonſtrate the
loſs ſhe ſuffered, becauſe all belonged to her. <hi>Lyſis</hi> who was free enough, would
have given her money to hold her peace, and let him alone; but his Heroick
Coat had neither money nor pockets, ſo that <hi>Fontenay</hi> could not but tell him
that the Heroes were poor people, ſince they never carried a half-penny about
them, nor had any bag nor pocket to put in their neceſſaries, as may be a knife,
ſome ſweet-meats, or notes, In the time when theſe habits were ordinarily worne,
ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> a man needed not carry any thing about him; all he met were ſo
courteous as to furniſh him with all neceſſaries. As for Handkerchiefs, were
there none worne? ſaies <hi>Meliantes,</hi> I believe not, for the Hiſtories nor Fables
mention no ſuch thing: 'Twas handſom to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e a Heros wipe his noſe with his
fingers in a full Aſſembly, and caſt the filth of his brain on the Marble of ſome
Temple, to make it more ſlippery. Yet it was ſo then, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and it was not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,
becauſe it was the faſhion: We do now things that are more ridiculous, which
yet no body wonders at, becauſe every ones does them, and that we have ſeen them
done ever ſince we came into the world. As concerning the convenience of an
handkerchief, I ſhall only tell you what <hi>Montagne</hi> ſaies of a Gentleman, who
thought nothing ſo abſurd, as that a man ſhould carry about him the filth of his
poſe pocketed up in cloath, and thought it more convenient, it were preſently
caſt to the ground.</p>
            <p>While this diſcourſe laſted, the Dairy-woman cauſed her children to gather up
the Nuts, and ſeeing there were but few ſpoiled, ſhe took comfort; there being
ſtill ſome ſcattered about, it chanced <hi>Lyſis</hi> got a fall, as if his heels were as quick
as his mind. His fall was ſo violent, that his guard-coat opened, and his ſhirt
that was tyed up between his legs was unbound, which becauſe it diſcovered thoſe
parts which civility would have ſecret, gave occaſion of general laughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
abuſed him for the inconvenience of his Heroick habit. This gave him occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to tell them that it was no ſuch offence that a man by chance ſhould ſhew
his privy parts, and that the moſt part of the Golden age knew not what cloathes
meant. I believe, ſaies <hi>Philiris,</hi> you are of Doctor <hi>Charron</hi>'s opinion, who is
his Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> would perſwade us to go naked, proving as much as he can,
that nakedneſs is no ſhame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philiris</hi> ſaid no more, and made the reſt give over laughing, leſt <hi>Lyſis</hi> might
think he was openly abuſed. They thereupon took Coach, and though it was
late, yet returned to <hi>Hircans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:43725:167"/>
The next day <hi>Anſelme</hi> married <hi>Angelica</hi> as he had reſolved; and as they had
been at <hi>Hircans</hi> and <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s Wedding, they alſo came to theirs: they brought
along with them <hi>Adrian</hi> and his wife, who though they much obſerved civility,
yet never fared better then when it coſt them nothing. Their Couſin <hi>Lyſis</hi> came
with <hi>Fontenay</hi> and his gang, but he had not his <hi>Heroes</hi> habit on. He was ſo ſad at
his Guardians coming, that he would not cloath himſelf magnificently; he choſe
rather to put on his Shepherds cloaths. <hi>Adrian</hi> thought that Faſhion not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
and therefore chid him not; <hi>Clarimond</hi> came alſo to this Feaſt, but
quarrelled not at all with the Shepherd, becauſe he was engaged in ſome other
diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>There was no great dancing after dinner, ſo that <hi>Hircan</hi> and his wife return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Caſtle, and his friends brought <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Pernella,</hi> and their Couſin
<hi>Lyſis</hi> thither afterward. The poor ſhepherd was the ſaddeſt man in the world,
to ſee that his Couſin was come back to fetch him away in a time when he hoped
to be moſt merry with the new married: Had it not been for him, he would
have found out a thouſand waies to paſs away the time jocondly; and would not
have parted from <hi>Orontes</hi>'s without ſpeaking to <hi>Charite,</hi> or ſo much as ſeeing
her. His Companions diſcourſed the beſt they could to cheer him up at ſupper,
but he took no pleaſure in any thing they ſaid.</p>
            <p>Awhile aft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r all went to bed; <hi>Hircan</hi> was now a lover of the night rather
then the day. When he was up the next day, he deſired his friends to put on
their Shepherds Weeds again, and to play the fools more then ever, to make
ſport with <hi>Adrian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the honeſt Citizen was up, he was for his return to <hi>Paris</hi> immediately,
reſolving not to go to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s to take his leave of <hi>Anſelme,</hi> becauſe he would
not diſturb the enjoyments of Marriage: He went only to ſee <hi>Hircan,</hi> and gave
him thanks for the honour he had done him and his Couſin, telling him he would
be no further troubleſome to him, but return to <hi>Paris,</hi> whither if ever he came,
he would entertain him the beſt he could. As he was in his ſhallow Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Fontenay, Philiris, Polidor</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi> came into the room, and <hi>Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay</hi>
ſpoke the firſt; What, ſaies he, Seigneur <hi>Adrian,</hi> you will rob us of the deareſt
treaſure we can ever poſſeſs; will you take away <hi>Lyſis</hi> from us, who is the Prince
of the Shepherds of <hi>France?</hi> you would carry him into a dirty City, which is not
his element<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis here he takes pleaſure to be, you do him as much injury as us:
If he go hence, all the Divinities of the Country will bewail his departure, and
will endeavour to puniſh you for it: I underſtand nothing of your Shepherdry,
ſaies <hi>Adrian,</hi> and my Couſin ſhould know no more then I: His father was no
Shepherd, he was a good honeſt Silkman, as I am; let him follow the way we
have gone before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> hearing this conteſtation out of another Chamber, went down preſently,
where he found <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and bidding him take his ſheephook, as he had his,
told him he would go into the fields to hide himſelf from his Couſin, who would
carry him away: <hi>Carmelin</hi> thought it the beſt courſe; he began to be in love
with a Country where he had ſo long fared well; he did not imagine he could
meet with a better fortune in <hi>Paris:</hi> He therefore cheerfully followed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
and <hi>Lyſis</hi> meeting in his way one of <hi>Hircans</hi> Lacquays, deſired him to
bid <hi>Philiris</hi> return to his Flock, and come to him ſecretly in his ordinary Paſtures,
if he had any thing to ſay to him. <hi>Adrian</hi> in the mean time being reſolved to
carry him away, whatever they ſaid to the contrary, ſought him out every where,
but not finding him, grew very angry, ſaying they were much to blame to keep
from him a youth that was committed to his Tuition: You know not where you
are, ſaies <hi>Fontenay</hi> to him, if you had ſpoke to your Ward of this Caſtle, he
would have told you it belonged to a Magician that hath great power: If you
do not hearken to our admonitions, do you know how he will puniſh you, and
that juſtly? He will take ſuch order that you ſhall never hear any thing again:
I care much indeed for all your follies, ſaies <hi>Adrian,</hi> I defie you all, whatever you
are, to do me any hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:43725:168"/>
The Shepherds having reſolved with <hi>Hircan</hi> what they ſhould do, began to
open their mouthes one before another, as if they had ſpoken: ſometimes they
came near <hi>Adrian,</hi> and ſpeaking as low as they could, ſaid to him, Well do you
hear us now caitife that ſlighteſt the power of the ſage <hi>Hircan?</hi> We are afraid
to burſt a vain by forcing our ſelves to cry out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amaryllis</hi> having had notice of this pleaſant adventure, came into the place,
and moved her lips a long time before her husband: ſome Lacquays that came
in did the like; <hi>Adrian</hi> ſeeing all this, and not bearing ought, was extreamly
troubled: He went into the Kitchin to ſee if he could hear any thing there; but
they had given the watch-word to all there to do the like: They came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> him
bawling in his ears, and ſometimes moving their lips very faſt; that put him into
ſuch a vexation that he ſtamp'd again, and told them it was out of ſpight obey
ſpoke ſo low: For their part they ſeem'd to be as mad as a dumb man, who by
all his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ignes cannot make people underſtand him. <hi>Adrian</hi> cry'd out ſometimes
as lowd as he could, What do you ſay? ſo to invite them to ſpeak as lowd as he:
He would fain have met with his wife, to ſee if he could hear her; but ſhe was
gone out with the Waggoner to ſeek <hi>Lyſis.</hi> At laſt he was almoſt perſwaded that
he was deaf for all his life; but <hi>Hircan</hi> coming near him, ſpoke ſoftly in his ear,
yet with the ſame action as if he ſpoke very lowd, My good friend, ſaies he to
him, you ſee you are deaf, ask my pardon for having ſlighted me, if you will be
recovered; I cry you mercy with all my ſoul, ſaies <hi>Adrian,</hi> oblige me ſo far as
to reſtore my hearing to me, and as long as I live I will be your moſt humble
ſervant.</p>
            <p>Upon that, <hi>Hircan</hi> brought a little oyle on a plate, and with a feather he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
his ears, to obſerve ſome ceremony, which done, he ſaid to him in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
tone, do you not hear me now? O Lord! yes, replies he; VVhat a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
man are you; I alſo hear the noiſe of a Threſhers Flail, and the Turky-Cocks
which are in your Court: I ſhould never have heard the Muſick of our
Pariſh; I ſhould never have heard all the clocks of the City; and I had been
an undone man as to my Trade, for I ſhould never have underſtood any thing but
by ſignes. You ſhould have had this convenience in recompence, ſaies <hi>Philiris,</hi>
that if your wife had been untoward, you ſhould not have heard her ſcolding:
and if our Magician had been pleaſed to deprive her of her ſight, as he hath done
you of your hearing, you would have made a fit couple according to the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
That is, A deaf husband, that he may not hear the tatling of his wife;
and a blind wife, that ſhe might not ſee the ill carriage of her husband; VVe
live ſo quietly together, replies <hi>Adrian,</hi> that there is no need of theſe expedients,
I am glad I am not deaf, that I might not fall into that miſery of having
worſe then hanging ſpoken of me, and I not hear it: Acknowledge then the
power of the Maſter of this place, ſaies <hi>Fontenay;</hi> know alſo, that had it not been
for him, inſtead of finding here a Couſin that you look for, you had only found
a Tree of his name. This illuſtrious Shepherd the Gods had once Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos'd;
he lived within a bark as the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> do, but <hi>Hircan</hi> reſtored him
to his former ſhape; and hath done the ſame courteſie for a maid of his wife's,
called <hi>Liſetta,</hi> who had been chang'd into a Cherry-Tree. I do not mention
how he made <hi>Lyſis</hi> put on the form of a maid; that's not ſo great a miracle; but
who will not admire his power, when ſeeing the Shepherd <hi>Lyſis</hi> and his man
<hi>Carmelin</hi> prepared for ſtrange accidents, he made them invulnerable, as I believe
they are ſtill, ſo that they fought with Gyants and Monſters, and received no
hurt: Here's my Companion <hi>Meliantes,</hi> that knows all well enough, 'twas by
that means he obtained his Miſtreſs, who was kept in an Enchanted Forreſs: But
obſerve what is yet moſt ſtrange in this buſineſs; 'twas not in this Country that
your Couſin accompliſhed all theſe VVarlike enterpriſes, 'twas in an iſle ſix
thouſand miles diſtant from this place whither they were carried in a Coach by
flying horſes: 'tis but four daies ſince they came back; I ſpeak to you of a freſh
adventure. The equipage he was in the day before yeſterday, when you came
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43725:168"/>
hither, was accordingly warlike. If you think I abuſe you in all this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I give you
leave to inform your ſelf from his own mouth, you will find he will tell you much
more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> was aſtoniſhed at this diſcourſe, whereof he underſtood not much, as
being of no experience in <hi>Romances.</hi> The Lacquay who had met <hi>Lyſis,</hi> had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before, told <hi>Philiris</hi> his meſſage; but <hi>Philiris</hi> having no mind to go to him
alone, told his Companions that they muſt break faſt ſo as to need no dinner,
and that done, go to the place where he ſhould find their incomparable Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
and carry <hi>Adrian</hi> with them, to ſatisfie him at leaſt in ſomewhat. Upon
this his wife returns, who ſaid ſhe could hear nothing of her Couſin: They bid

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL the way-long <hi>Philiris</hi> and his Companions entertained
<hi>Adrian</hi> and his wife with the wonders of <hi>Lyſis</hi> his life,
and his ſtrange adventures. They knew not whether they
ſhould take all for true misfortunes, or for fictions; and
that which troubled them moſt was, to ſee the ſerious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions
of thoſe from whom they had thoſe fine relations.
They went on till they came near the little houſe of the
Vine-dreſſer <hi>Bertrand,</hi> whence they ſaw <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin</hi>
come forth. Aſſoon as <hi>Fontenay</hi> perceived <hi>Lyſis,</hi> he cry'd out to him, Do
you hate us ſo much Shepherd, that you would be gone and not bid us a diew?
My journey hath not been far, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and beſides, I uſe no ceremony to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you: But alas! can I call my ſelf a Shepherd and not ſhed tears? <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin</hi>
will tell you I am a Shepherd without Sheep: 'Tis too true, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
Our Hoſt, ſeeing we came not back in a long time, and that we ought him ſome
money, hath ſold our ſheep to the firſt Drover that came by; nay he ſaies we are
ſtill in his debt; the poor dumb creatures being ſo out of caſe that he could make
nothing of them: My Maſter was much the better to tell him again, that he
ſhould have kept them for us, and have ſent them abroad every day: He told
him he had not the leaſure to do it, that they would have grown worſe and
worſe, and that he had a Vintage to look after. That's the true account of my
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43725:169"/>
misfortune, ſaies <hi>Lyſis</hi> with a ſad countenance; this is all the ſatisfaction I could
get of the ruſtick beaſt. The worſt on't is, that being unwilling to be at the
charge to keep my dear <hi>Muſedore,</hi> a loving cur I had left with him, he hath bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
him ſo, that he is run away to get a condition ſomewhere elſe; If I knew
where he was, I would go for him: and if I thought my ſheep were yet alive, I
would buy them again, though they coſt me ſo much apiece as the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lock
ſtood me in. Here's my Couſin, who once before did me the like diſcourteſie;
but for that time I was comforted by <hi>Anſelme,</hi> as being reſolved to leave the
place I was in then: As for this Country, the caſe is not the ſame, for I intend to
live here alwaies, and in the mean time I ſhall have nothing to do, having no
flock to look after. You ſpeak as if there were no more ſheep in the world, ſaies
<hi>Philiris,</hi> I undertake you ſhall find enough; you muſt not be troubled for ſuch
a ſmall matter: That which adds to my grief (ſaies <hi>Lyſis</hi> to him ſoftly taking him
aſide) is that thou haſt not done as I deſired thee by the Lacquay; thou art not
come privately to me that ſo no body might know where I was, but haſt brought
<hi>Adrian</hi> along, who is the only man in the world that I fear, and whom I deſire
not to be near. I muſt tell you the reaſon why I did it, replies <hi>Philiris,</hi> 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we have prevailed ſo far with this your troubleſome Couſin, as that he is
not ſo eager to take you away: Nay it's more likely he and his wife will ſtay
with us: O God! what good news is that, cries out <hi>Lyſis,</hi> if it be ſo, I will never
be ſad, for this adventure will furniſh me with joy as long as I live. It is then
true my dear and ſweet Couſins, that it is not your deſire I ſhould return any
more to <hi>Paris</hi> (continues he, turning towards his friends) all theſe Shepherds
will be obliged to you, becauſe they eſteem my company; but I am moreover
aſſured that you will enter into <hi>Shepherdry</hi> as well as we: O what a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing it is! you ſhall be added to the number of the <hi>Pariſian Shepherds</hi> that
are to come hither; can you tell any news of them? I will not contradict you
for the preſent, ſaies <hi>Adrian,</hi> do me only the favour as to tell me what kind of life
you have led ſince you left <hi>Paris,</hi> for theſe Gentlemen, whom I have born com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
hither, have told me ſtrange things, whereof I would be aſſured from your
own mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You deſire what's moſt juſt and reaſonable, as I am an <hi>Heroick
Shepherd,</hi> ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſince you are he among my friends, to whom Authority
hath given me in charge, 'tis fit I give you an account of my actions. It's only
neceſſary we go into the ſhade; Here we have it, ſaies <hi>Polidor,</hi> ſhewing him a
little thicket; but is there no need you feed your own body before you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the minds of others; I and <hi>Carmelin</hi> have juſt now been at a banquet where
a man fears neither poyſon nor exceſs, replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> bread, nuts and grapes which
we bought of the Countrey-people, have been varieties wherewith we have ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
nature, to reduce our ſelves to moderation after the ſumptuous Feaſts at the
Marriages of <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Anſelme.</hi> A little water taken up in the hollow of the
hand out of the fluid Criſtal of a Fountain hath afterward baniſhed our thirſt,
in commemoration of that happy time of the <hi>Golden Age,</hi> which knew no other
drink, nor other cup. There needs not much to ſatisfie the man who bridles his
appetite with his reaſon; but he that ſuffers himſelf to be carried away by the
flattery of his ſence, though there were a thouſand worlds; yet 'twere not enough
to ſatisfie him. Theſe indeed are golden words, ſaies <hi>Adrian,</hi> who was a lover
of Temperance, if you ſpeak thus alwaies, I ſhall have a better opinion of you
then ever I had yet. He having ſaid ſo, they made towards the thicket, where
all being ſate down on the graſs, <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſpoke thus.</p>
            <p>Since you are already acquainted with a good part of my life, Couſin <hi>Adrian,</hi>
you deſire not I ſhould loſe time in long relations; I ſhall only tell you briefly
the ſum of my affairs: Being come into this Countrey with <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenor,</hi>
the firſt thing we did was, to go and ſee <hi>Leonara</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s
houſe, where I muſt confeſs to you, I love to be above any place, becauſe <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
lives there, which <hi>Charite</hi> is that incomparable Beauty by whom I have long
ſince bin enchanted: The amorous diſcourſes we had together, are unſeaſonable as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43725:170"/>
to the preſent occaſion: It ſhall ſuffice to tell you that when I parted thence, I
made acquaintance with <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who lives here hard by, one whoſe diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pleaſes me extreamly, were it not that he beſtows his wit in abuſes. The next
day I gave my fair one a <hi>Serenade</hi> with much reputation, for I did wonders on the
Gitarre; but in purſuing a <hi>Hamadryad</hi> that plaid on the Lute, I loſt my way, ſo
that I lay that night in the fields, which was an adventure rather pleaſant then
troubleſome. The next day I met with a Hermit who put me into my way, which
I loſt again, but ſo fortunately that I met with the Magician <hi>Hircan,</hi> who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
me very courteouſly, did me the honour to let me ſee his <hi>Nayad Synopa:</hi>
He afterward changed me into a Maid, and I lived in that condition at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s
with all the content in the world. He after that unchang'd me again, becauſe
they would have put me to death upon a falſe accuſation: And awhile after I
met in the fields this <hi>Carmelin,</hi> whom you ſee, who told me I was in <hi>Brie,</hi> and
not in <hi>Forreſts;</hi> upon which conſideration, as alſo becauſe of his great learning,
I took him into my ſervice; and went my waies to <hi>Clarimonds,</hi> reſolv'd to have
no more to do with <hi>Anſelme</hi> and <hi>Montenor,</hi> who had put ſuch an affront upon
me. I ſent to buy Sheep, which done, I went to <hi>Hircans,</hi> where I had almoſt
quarrelled with <hi>Fontenay.</hi> I was once like to be impriſoned by the Vineyard-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
I received a unſatisfactory anſwer to a love Letter I ſent to <hi>Charite;</hi> and at laſt
my afflictions obliged the Gods to change me into a Tree: I could not become a
man again for all <hi>Clarimond</hi> could do; he did nothing but water me to make me
bud forth, and when it was once night, I play'd, I danc'd, I collation'd with t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
Divinities of the Country. <hi>Carmelin</hi> would not believe any of theſe miracles,
but I made him taſte part of our entertainments: After this <hi>Hircan</hi> reſtored me
to my former ſhape. I returned again to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s being as much a man as ever I
was, I ſent a Letter and a Bill to be poſted up and down, to <hi>Paris,</hi> to invite the
Wits of the times to come and ſee me, which hath already had its effect. About
that time I received a heavy <hi>Command without Command</hi> from <hi>Charite,</hi> and was
ſick in imitation of her: I met with <hi>Philiris, Polidor,</hi> and <hi>Meliantes,</hi> who were
newly arrived into this Country, and I ſaw two converted Shepherdeſſes, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenice</hi>
and <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> one is married to <hi>Hircan,</hi> and the other was chang'd into
a great <hi>Stone.</hi> Theſe brave Shepherds here preſent have all related their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to me, which are moſt admirable: They have ſeen the Ambaſſadors were
ſent to me from the Shepherds of <hi>Paris:</hi> We have acted Playes before them, to
ſhew them how pleaſantly we paſs away our time; you came hither when we
were at one but ſince that, <hi>Hircan</hi> ſent me to an Inchanted Caſtle, whence I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the fair <hi>Pamphilia;</hi> but the dangers I ran through were ſo great, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
relation is enough to cauſe horror: I was fifteen daies in the air with <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
much higher then the region wherein the Meteors are formed; I have bin in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
blacker then the abode of <hi>Pluto:</hi> I have fought with Gyants, ſo high as that
they might have ſcal'd heaven without Ladders, and with crump-back'd and
breaſted fellows, who ſeemed to be made to diſgrace nature. I overcame alſo a
Dragon, which roſe up out of the foam of the Serpent <hi>Python,</hi> which was killed
by <hi>Phoebus.</hi> And theſe are my principal adventures, which I am very glad I have
had the occaſion to relate, both that you may believe, aud to rub <hi>Philiris</hi>'s me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
who hath undertaken to diſpoſe them into a Book. When it is perfected
you will find theſe things better deſcribed and more adorn'd; for being to ſpeak
to you in haſte, I have not had the leaſure to ſcrue my ſelf up to any imbelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having ſpoken thus, <hi>Adrian</hi> was quite beſide himſelf to find that what he
ſaid, anſwered to what the other Shepherds had told him. He knew not what to
think of it, and yet he told his Couſin that he did not half underſtand his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
becauſe his terms were extreamly Poetical. He thereupon takes <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
aſide, and there being no other of whom to enquire the truth of what he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
ſaid to him, I ſee thou haſt the countenance of an honeſt fellow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
am I glad my Couſin hath entertained thee, for he muſt have one to help
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43725:170"/>
him in a place which is not his native Countrey. I will do any thing lies in my
power for thy preferment, thou ſhalt in requital only tell me whether all thy
Maſter hath related be true or no: I ſhall tell you no more then I know, replies
<hi>Carmelin;</hi> as concerning his transformation into a Tree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'twas not ſo much as he
thought it, for his face could be ſeen; but for the Divinities which viſited him,
to paſs away the time, I have known by experience but too much of the certainty
thereof, as a puniſhment of my incredulity. As for our Combats with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
they are as true as that I am <hi>Carmelin;</hi> though we got the victory yet did
we receive good blowes, but I cannot ſhew you any marks to verifie what I ſay,
for <hi>Hircan</hi> had made us both, as he cals it, invulnerable, that is to ſay, that we
could not be wounded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> having ſaid thus, <hi>Adrian</hi> turned to the reſt, and ſaid to them, this
honeſt man doth alſo confirm what his Maſter told me; but though I ſhould
believe all more firmly then I do, yet it but obliges me the more to take him with
me to the good City of <hi>Paris,</hi> for there's not ſo much danger there, nor any
Monſters to fight with: If any one have done you wrong, there's juſtice to do
you right; and if a Witch ſhould change one thing into another, ſhe may be
burnt in the <hi>Greve.</hi> What ſimplicities do you ſpeak, good man? replies <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antes,</hi>
if your Couſin hath run any danger for me, he hath done the greateſt work
of charity in the world; and beſides that the Gods will reward him, he hath gotten
eternal renown thereby: ſuch a reputation as his, cannot be too dear bought.
That he hath undergone a Metamorphoſis in this Country, and ſuffered much
affliction, it hath been on occaſion ſo noble, that there's not any but could have
wiſhed the ſame fortune. 'Tis for love that he ſighs, 'tis for love that he weeps;
and which is yet more remarkable! 'tis for the love of the fair <hi>Charite:</hi> would
you forbid him ſo noble a paſſion? would you put off humanity to commit ſuch
a ſignal act of brutality? Since you have married the Gentlewoman your wife,
is it to be queſtioned whether you love her? If it be ſo, would you forbid ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man that you could not be without your ſelf: But is it in your power, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mans in the world, to hinder <hi>Lyſis</hi> to love, ſince Nature hath furniſhed us with
the precepts thereof from our infancy? All this is well and good, ſaies <hi>Adrian,</hi>
I know well, that as one hand waſhes the other, and both the face, ſo the husband
and the wife help one another mutually, and may afterward do good to their whole
race: and this is the reaſon why I married, and I ſhould not be ſorry if my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin
were ſo too, nor conſequently can I find fault with him for being in love;
but there are many things to be wiſhed in his perſon, before we entertain any
thoughts of that buſineſs. We have it from <hi>Plutarch</hi> that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> put a note
of Infamy on thoſe that did not marry, ſaies <hi>Carmelin.</hi> They durſt not appear
at the publick Feſtivities, and in mid-winter they were forced to dance naked,
ſinging a certain Song made in abuſe of themſelves. Beſides all this, when they
were old, the younger ſort of people went before them, and did them no reſpect.
Thus you ſee how the ancients deteſted <hi>Coelibate,</hi> and deſired nothing ſo much
as to propagate man, who is the King of all the other creatures. Moreover,
happy marriages make us enjoy on earth the felicity of heaven. Tis all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
we have againſt the miſeries of this life: There is no affliction ſo grievous
which the hearts of a husband and a wife joyn'd together, cannot ſupport. Thus
the wife of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> having cauſed her hair to be cut off, bore arms as well
as he, which comforted him infinitely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> having ended his diſcourſe, ſcratch'd his head a little, as if he would
have made ſomewhat more come out by the ſtirring it received from his nails:
This ſtart of <hi>Carmelin</hi> is not to be wondred at, ſaies <hi>Philiris,</hi> we know he hath
his common places as a Sergeant of a Company his Halbards. If all his ancient
Lectures came but into his mind, there's no Subject on which he is not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
us: Truly, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> when I heard Marriage ſpoken of, I could
not but out with what was at my tongues end. There's ſomewhat elſe in the
wind, ſaies <hi>Meliantes,</hi> queſtionleſs thou haſt a great mind to be married, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43725:171"/>
wouldſt fain have us find out a wife for thee. But not to quit the diſcourſe we
were in before; let's ſpeak to <hi>Adrian:</hi> We deſire him to tell us what fault he
finds in his Couſin. He wants many things, replies <hi>Adrian,</hi> eſpecially that he
knows neither Trade nor Traffick to get his living by: How ſhall he maintain a
wife and children? what quality ſhall he be of in the world? He will be ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
every where, and taken for an idle perſon: 'Tis true, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that ſince
man ſinned, God hath condemned him to get his bread in the ſweat of his brows:
'tis ſaid that he that doth not labor ſhal not eat, and that to do nothing is to do ill;
ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> ſends the idle perſon to ſchool to the <hi>Ant.</hi> Hold thou thy peace <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin,</hi>
ſaies <hi>Lyſis</hi> to him, no body asks thee any thing: Thou wilt anon ſpeak
more againſt me then thou canſt for me, for thou powreſt out thy ſentences as
they come without any conſideration. Be not thou among thoſe that are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
to me; I am ſufficiently afflicted to be far from my expectation, as alſo
to ſee that my couſin will not be a Shepherd, nor ſuffer me to be one, as I had
been made believe. Do not impoſe ſilence on your man, who ſpeaks
ſo well, replies <hi>Adrian,</hi> I am glad you are with ſuch a brave Doctor; you have
in him a good preceptor; he would ſhew you that you ought not to ſpend your
time here in acting of Comedies and dancing with young maids: 'Twere better
be in ſome good imployment, that were the way to find a good match, ſince you
are ſo much in love, for it is ſaid at <hi>Paris,</hi> That Offices are the Porters that let a
man into the Palace of Marriage. Will you never give over doating, ſaies <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantes?</hi>
Is not <hi>Lyſis</hi> in the nobleſt condition in the world? Is he not one of
theſe illuſtrious Shepherds which we find in the <hi>Arcadia?</hi> That we are clad in
white, is only in imitation of him; he hath undertaken to reſtore the felicity of
the firſt age of the world. If you will participate with us, you muſt be a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
as well as he: Otherwiſe you muſt ſtill live at <hi>Paris,</hi> where all vices are in
their thrones, and where you are lock'd up to the mercy of afflictions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets.
The infections are ſo great, that the Phyſician often dies before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and thoſe that carry the dead to the ground, leave them at half way. 'Tis
true, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> Multitude is never without contagion, and what is worſt of
all, there is a plague of ſouls as well as of bodies; I deſire my Maſters pardon
for this word: I'll ſpeak no more. When he ſpeaks only of Shepherdry or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis,
I ſeem to be ignorant enough; but when it comes to morality, I'll
make it known I am no ſmall Clark, and therefore 'tis not to be wondred if I lay
hold on any occaſion to ſhew my Learning. Every one is glad to ſhew what he
knows; 'tis I know not how long ſince I have ſpoken ſo much: I pardon thee
ſince thou deſireſt it ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> but do not interrupt any body but to ſom purpoſe.
<hi>Carmelin</hi> obſerves his time to ſpeak very well, ſaies <hi>Polidor,</hi> it puts me in mind of
thoſe pickeerers in an Army, who charge, and fall off, then charge again, ſo doing
for a many times together.</p>
            <p>Every one was taken with that conceit, and as the Shepherds went on ſtill in
diſcourſe, <hi>Pernella</hi> takes her husband aſide, and told him ſhe knew no reaſon
why he ſhould talk ſo long with people, who ſeemed to be as great fools as their
Couſin, and that if <hi>Lyſis</hi> would not return to <hi>Paris,</hi> they muſt were it but to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the reſt of his friends with it. He anſwered, that ſince the day was farr
ſpent, there was no thinking of going till the morrow, becauſe he would not lie
by the way, and that then they ſhould ſee what were to be done.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Clarimond</hi> who had been abroad upon ſome occaſions paſſed
by, and alighted to ſalute the Shepherds. We are here in a great conteſtation,
ſaies <hi>Fontenay</hi> to him. Here's <hi>Adrian</hi> who would take away from us the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> who is the honour of this Country: He will have him by all means
take another courſe of life, and get into ſome Office in the City. He is in the
right, replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> with a ſmile, and you that would hinder it, I muſt tell
you you are all fools: That's it we would tell them Sir, cries out <hi>Pernella,</hi> ah!
you are a brave Gentleman. For my part I have been theſe three hours with
them, but I durſt not open my mouth, leſt they ſhould ſpeak to me, for their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43725:171"/>
ſtrange diſcourſes do ſo amaze me, that I think my ſelfe in another world. I'll
promiſe you Miſtreſs, continued <hi>Clarimond,</hi> to make them find their wits, before
a few daies be over. They are perſons at leaſt of as good quality as <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and
yet they will do no good in the world: They entertain themſelves with Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
extravagances, and becauſe they find your Couſin ſick of the ſame diſeaſe as
themſelves, they love his company. I am now come from a great man in this
Country who hath promiſed me to found an Hoſpital purpoſely for them; there
ſhall they moſt charitably by whipt till this humour be over. May that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
have his hearts deſire, ſaies <hi>Pernella,</hi> he muſt needs be a very devout man,
I would I might ſpeak with him, that I might get him to do ſomewhat for our
Couſin: We'll talk of it when we meet next, replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> at the preſent I
am ſomewhat in haſte.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> in ſaying this went his way, and the Shepherds would ſtill make <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
and his wife believe that they would live in a Paſtoral way, and that they were
not out of their wits. They therefore looked very modeſtly, and ſwore that
<hi>Clarimond</hi> himſelf was mad, and that it would not be long ere he ſhould put on
the fools Coat. They adviſed <hi>Lyſis</hi> not to walk any more near his Caſtle, nor
take any Paſtures that way if ever he had any ſheep.</p>
            <p>He thought their councel very good, and ſo returned cheerfully to <hi>Hircans</hi> with
his Companions and his Couſins too, ſince he could not avoid it. <hi>Fontenay</hi> told
<hi>Hircan</hi> what diſcourſe had paſſed, wherein there wanted not matter to laugh
at. <hi>Adrian</hi> comes to ſee <hi>Hircan,</hi> to whom he ſaid, that he could not but wonder
how a man ſo wiſe and ſo learned as he was, would entertain into his houſe ſuch
people as <hi>Lyſis</hi> and his companions, and that he had met a Gentleman who told
him they were all out of their wits, which was eaſily diſcovered by their actions
and words, though ſometimes they ſtrived to be very ſerious. <hi>Hircan</hi> reply'd,
that that Gentleman was deceived, and that he would give him the lie wherever
he met him So <hi>Adrian</hi> was ſent back again with little ſatisfaction: He and his
wife retired to conſult what they ſhould do, and <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> did the
like.</p>
            <p>Thou maiſt eaſily perceive <hi>Carmelin,</hi> ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that this Couſin of mine who
cals himſelf my Guardian, is a moſt importunate fellow: Though I were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to paſs away my time in the Country, yet ſhould I hardly be brought to
live with him in the City. As for his wife, ſhe is no better then he; I muſt
therefore find out ſome way to get them hence, without force or noiſe; but the
myſtery of all will be at the ſame time to accompliſh ſomewhat that may recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
me to <hi>Charite</hi> and all poſterity. 'Tis there I muſt make appear the very
edg of ingenuity. Without any long preambles, I will in a word tell thee the beſt
expedient I know, and that is to counterfeit my ſelf dead for awhile: <hi>Adrian</hi>
will preſently return to <hi>Paris,</hi> as having no more to do here: But you do not
conſider, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that he or your heirs will poſſeſs themſelves of all you
have, and you ſhall be forced to beg: I can re-enter into my poſſeſſion when I
pleaſe, replies <hi>Lyſis:</hi> I ſhall ſoon make my ſelf known: and beſides, though I
had nothing of all my father and mother left me, muſt I be caſt down and fare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the worſe, ſince that in all <hi>Romances</hi> you will find divers in ſtrange Countries
having nothing in the world, who yet were Princes or Knights, of better houſes
then I am of. They lived only by what they borrowed of good friends whom
they found every where; does that ſeem ſtrange to thee? Do the <hi>Romances</hi> ſpeak
any thing incredible as to that point? Sometimes <hi>Montenor</hi> hath entertained us,
ſometimes <hi>Orontes,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Hircan,</hi> nay ſometimes <hi>Clarimond,</hi> though he ſeem
now to be my greateſt enemy; and this is a thing not to be paſſed by without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.
As plainly ſhewing that all true lovers are favoured by heaven. Thou
ſeeſt alſo that <hi>Polidor</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi> who are of a Country further diſtant hence
then ours, and have nothing of their own, do yet live plentifully enough, by the
courteſie of thoſe friends they meet, who are their benefactors. There are in
ſome books Lovers mentioned who have lived only upon Roots in the deſerts like
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43725:172"/>
Hermits, and divers have been hirelings to Shepherds to get a livelyhood: What
ſhould hinder but we may do the like if we be brought to that extremity, ſince 'tis
no more then we have done for our recreation? You are wiſer then I, replies
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> and therefore all the anſwer I make you is, that I will not contradict
you in any thing, but will be alwaies of your opinion, Hear then what my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
is, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I will feign my ſelf dead, both to get away this <hi>Adrian,</hi> and
withall, to find out whether my Miſtreſs will have any compaſſion on me, and
that's it I aim at principally. Now there's a great difference between <hi>death</hi> and
a <hi>Metamorphoſis;</hi> for I ſuffered my ſelf to be metamorphoſed into a Tree with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reſiſtance, becauſe there was ſome hope I might one day be reſtored to
my former ſhape; but as concerning death, when we go that journey we ſhall
never return: That makes me reſolve to die only in jeſt, for if I ſhould diſpatch
my ſelf as many have done that I could name, 'twere a ſtrange folly, ſince 'tis
not beyond hope I may one day be happy. There are a many in your <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
that have killed themſelves becauſe of the cruelty of their Miſtreſſes; and they
again, ſome of them having notice of their death, have murdered themſelves after
them, or at leaſt have all their lives repented their cruelty and diſdain. It may
be ſeen by this, that if thoſe deſperate people had had the wit to feigne death,
they might have been extreamly happy. My intention thereof is ſo much the
more excellent, and there is now no more to do then to bethink us of the means
to put it in execution. There are ſome that hide a piggs bladder full of bloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their skins and their ſhirts, and give themſelves a ſtab there; they fall and
ſeem to be quite gone, till every one runs to help them; but I do not like that
way: a man might hurt himſelf if the Ponyard went a little further then it ſhould;
but there are other accidents ſtranger yet; beſides, that when they came to ſearch
your wound, the cheat would be diſcovered, which would be ſcandalous and
laught at. I will therefore play my game better if I can. I will take a glaſs of
Wine with ſomewhat in it which every one will conceive to be poiſon, and when
I have drunk it off, I will be as ſtiffe as an iron barre, and will keep in my breath
as if I were dead; a while after thou ſhalt make as if thou haſt buried me, and
the buſineſs is done. Now I will lurk ſomewhere till <hi>Adrian</hi> be gone, and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
being acquainted with my death, ſhall have time enough to bewayle my loſs.
When thou ſhalt perceive her grief exceſſive, and that ſhe wiſhes from her heart
I were alive again, that ſhe might honour me with her affection, which ſhe had
denied me before, let me know it immediately, that I may go and take her
at her word, and receive the recompence of my afflictions. Now when we are
come thus farre, there are inventions enough to make the world believe I have bin
rais'd again; and thus I ſhall ſo much the more ingratiate my ſelf with <hi>Charite,</hi>
who will look on me as a man highly in favour with the Gods. Thus will I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
my deſire; and what will moſt comfort me is, That I have run through all
the adventures of the beſt Hiſtories, and that my own will be the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd
in all the world. As for the ſtealing away of <hi>Charite,</hi> I think no more
on't; 'tis enough I once had ſuch a deſigne. My thoughts are now all taken up
with my feigned death; perhaps 'twill be generally believed that I was dead in
deed, and was raiſed again; ſo that <hi>Philiris</hi> ſhall not mention it as a fiction in
his book, or if he do, he ſhall ſpeak of it as an opinion of ſome few but which he
ſhall condemn as erroneous, affirming my death to have been real.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſaid this, he thought little of <hi>Polidors</hi> being behind him, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all his diſcourſe. This Shepherd having heard <hi>Liſis</hi> his deſigne, retired as if
he had heard nothing, and reſolved to give notice to his Companions, that they
might act their parts well when the buſineſs came upon the Stage. As for <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin,</hi>
his Maſters enterpriſe, to him, was very indifferent, for he thought better
to do ſo then loſe him quite, which haply he had done if <hi>Adrian</hi> had taken him
away to <hi>Paris.</hi> He therefore promiſed him his utmoſt aſſiſtance, and ſo they
went both to <hi>Hircan. Adrian</hi> and <hi>Pernella</hi> came thither at the ſame time to
know whether they might be gone with their Couſin the next day; <hi>Hircan</hi> told
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43725:172"/>
them that after three daies they ſhould have him away, deſiring in that time, to
ſatisfie himſelf with his converſation; <hi>Pernella</hi> told him they could not ſtay ſo
long, that it was a good while ſince they had been from home, and that they had
left in the Shop but one Prentice of whoſe fidelity they were not over-confident.
<hi>Hircan</hi> regarded not much theſe remonſtrances, and while <hi>Pernella</hi> was thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up, <hi>Fontenay</hi> who had bethought himſelf of a new invention to make ſport,
ſate down in a chair, whence he pronounced theſe words with a languiſhing voice,
What my bright Sun, ſaies he, will you leave us already? Would you ſhine in
another hemiſphere, whence you will never return? Alaſs, 'tis fit the
world be all ſerved by degrees: Why will you forſake me fair <hi>Pernella,</hi> the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of this age; life of my ſoul, what will you return to <hi>Paris,</hi> there to be
the Pearl of your Quarter? Continue rather in this Country, where you ſhall
receive greater honours; I will make Verſes of you ſhall make you famous over
all the world, and you will be more talked of then <hi>Petrarch's Laura.</hi> If the fair
<hi>Cytherea</hi> be ſometimes drawn by Swanns; I would have you like that Goddeſs,
and I will be your ſweet ſinging Swan to draw your glorious Chariot. What
do you think on dear Couſin, ſaies <hi>Hircan,</hi> have you forgot you are married?
have you loſt all remembrance of the fair <hi>Theodora</hi> your wife? You muſt love
her eternally, you muſt not be inconſtant: When I married her, I was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Miſtreſs <hi>Pernella,</hi> replies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> had I known her, I ſhould have
loved none but her: 'tis ſhe that is deſtined for me, let <hi>Adrian</hi> turn her over to
me, I earneſtly intreat him, and let him look after <hi>Theodora,</hi> he ſhall have her
in exchange that he may have no occaſion to complain: What trick is this put
on me? cries out <hi>Adrian,</hi> am I come among a ſort of Adulterers? what vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
is this to propoſe to me the greateſt baſeneſe in the world! I will have my
wife and my Couſin together; if I ſhall not be ſuffered to take them away, I will
bring the power of juſtice to do it. You do not conſider where you are when
you ſpeak this, ſaies <hi>Meliantes,</hi> no Officer dares come within three miles about of
this place. There are in this houſe charms that can reduce them all to duſt:
There came hither one once and took one of <hi>Hircans</hi> men by the chollar, his
hand preſently fell off, and ſome Sergeants being ſomewhat incivil, were all faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to ſtakes, and after they were rubb'd well with oyle and brimſtone, they
burned a long time to give light to Travellers in the night.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Meliantes</hi> ſaid this, <hi>Lyſis</hi> asked <hi>Hircan</hi> whether he and <hi>Carmelin</hi> were
ſtill invulnerable, and whether for his own part, he had not loſt that priviledge
by putting off his Heroick Coat: <hi>Hircan</hi> aſſured him he had not, ſo that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to defend himſelf couragiouſly, if any Sergeants preſumed to touch his
body to carry him away to <hi>Paris.</hi> There came up on this occaſion a freſh ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
into his mind, which he never had before: he would needs know how
<hi>Hircan</hi> could aſſure him he was invulnerable, ſince he was wonnded every day by
the darts of love: <hi>Hircan</hi> told him it was true indeed, that love had wounded
him, but that it was before he had made uſe of his charms, and that beſides, he had
promiſed only to fortifie his body againſt the <hi>Arms</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> but not againſt the
<hi>Arrows</hi> of <hi>Cupid,</hi> which are ſo ſmall that they are inviſible, and pierce inſenſibly
through the eyes even to the heart. This ſatisfied <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and being retired with
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> he told him he was very glad to know he was as invulnerable as when
they were in the Caſtle of <hi>Anaximander;</hi> and there's one thing, ſaies he, will
much promote my deſigne, which is, when I have taken the poiſon, it will be ſaid
that in regard I could not be hurt in any part of the body, and that ſwords
and daggers could do no good upon me, I could not poſſibly die but by a drink.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> approved this, and in the mean time <hi>Hircan</hi> ſeeing <hi>Adrian</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
mad for anger, entertained him with this diſcourſe. You are to
conſider my good friend, ſayes he to him, that you are now among
<hi>Shepherds,</hi> whoſe principal profeſſion is to love: All their books ſpeak of nothing
elſe; they know nothing elſe, and therefore be not offended at their too free diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes;
they are a ſort of people that are much given to the exerciſe of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43725:173"/>
and will be in the purſuit of a woman ten years, ſo that at the end of ſuch
a term ſhe requite them with a piece of old ribbond wherewith ſhe have tied up
her hair: They are not impudent as you think them: their Laws are againſt it:
they do not ſpeak to their Miſtreſſes but they tremble; and if they deſired to
touch her breſt, fear would ſo benum them, that their hands would grow ſtiff at
half way. I have a wife as well as you, but if fifty Shepherds, ſuch as <hi>Fontenay,</hi>
ſhould be in love with her, I ſhould have never a worm the more in my head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I know he is the fearfulleſt man in the world; and beſides, that he hath the
reputation to be impotent; you muſt in your ſelf laugh at ſuch a mans paſſion,
yet make as if you were angry before him, that he may not take you for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
fool: if you carry your ſelf ſo, I believe you cannot do amiſs, and you
may afterward tell ſtories of your Lovers affections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> was not ſatisfied with theſe reaſons, nor indeed did <hi>Hircan</hi> endeavour
much to appeaſe him; what he had ſaid to him was by way of abuſe. <hi>Adrian</hi>
therefore was extreamly troubled, and though his wife had turned over thirty,
and was black and lean, yet did he think her handſome, and was a little jealous:
'twas an infinite pleaſure to ſee him ever and anon look towards <hi>Fontenay,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
what countenance he made on <hi>Pernella.</hi> This feigned Lover having fetcht
three or four deep ſighs, fell down all along upon chairs as if he had ſwouded,
whereat his companions ſeem'd much troubled, rubbing his temples, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
water on his face.</p>
            <p>When they had brought him to himſelf again, he for a long time ſtared on all
that were about him, Alaſs! my dear friends, ſaid he, why have you ſo ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
the ſweet extaſie? My mind pleaſed it ſelf in the Ideas of all worldly
pleaſures, and now it knows nothing real but its own affliction: I burn witout
hope of enjoyment, for an ungratefull woman, that hath not vouchſafed me ſo
much as a look, ſince I have declared my affection to her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> upon this, ſaid that ſince he was ſo ill he were beſt be had to bed, which
made his companions lead him to his chamber, making a thouſand extravagant
poſtures. Thus theſe Gentlemen, ſince they became acquainted with <hi>Lyſis,</hi> were
ſo accuſtomed to abuſe him, that they abuſed one another, and would not ſpare
<hi>Adrian</hi> nor his wife, ſuppoſing their minds of the ſame mettal with their Couſin,
and that ſimplicity was entailed on the whole race from generation to generation.</p>
            <p>There was only <hi>Lyſis</hi> that ſtaid with <hi>Hircan,</hi> who began to bring afreſh into
his mind the pleaſures of their former life, becauſe <hi>Adrian</hi> was preſent, whom he
would alſo perſwade that the ſhepherds life was the moſt happy. In the mean time
<hi>Carmelin</hi> took occaſion to go and ſee <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> who was alone in her Chamber,
where ſhe asking him what the other Shepherds had done ſince they were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
He anſwered, that he knew not what to ſay of them, and that they knew not
what they did themſelves, they were ſo in love. And is it poſſible <hi>Carmelin</hi> can be,
and not be in love? Truly Madam, reply'd he, ſince I have ever found you my
good friend, I will freely tell you what my heart thinks. A man muſt once in his
life at leaſt, diſcover what his inclinations are. 'Tis poſſible I may be in love,
but not with <hi>Parthenice:</hi> Were I a ſtone like her whom my Maſter will have me
love, 'twere not amiſs I were joyned to her; but then ſhould I not love her nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and thus would I reaſon; I would ſay, that in ſuch a condition I could
neither receive nor return any thing of love. Let every thing love what's like
it, let ſtones be in love with ſtones, graſs with graſs, plants with plants, and let
the vine if it will, clime up an elme: I have often heard it ſaid that this is done
by a certain ſympathy of nature, whoſe deſigne is to joyn all things together: But
it makes for me, whatever my Maſter ſaies; I ſhould ſin againſt nature if I ſhould
not love what were of my own ſpecies: It ſignifies much indeed, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> tels
me that Ivie ſcales the walls to ſhew it loves ſtones, and that I ſhould do ſo too,
as having ſome relation to the Ivie, ſince I repreſented <hi>Bacchus.</hi> This was the
ſubject of our diſcourſe this morning, where we were alone; but my full and
final anſwer was, that I was a man, and could eat and drink, and not Ivie, good
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43725:173"/>
for nothing but to clap on iſſues. He thereupon told me, that to puniſh my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Ivie, the Gods would change me into that plant, and that he
thought the part I plaid in the paſtimes of the Vintage, was a great preſage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
ſince I was then compaſſed about with branches which I ſhould one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
bear. At laſt, <hi>quoth he,</hi> 'tis the moſt convenient Metamorphoſis for thee, and
<hi>quoth he,</hi> thou art to hope no leſs. I have given over, <hi>quoth he,</hi> the deſigne of
changing thee into a Fountain, as I once thought, <hi>quoth he,</hi> when I thought it fit
thou ſhouldſt water the bottom of the beloved rock. It will be more proper,
<hi>quoth he,</hi> that thou be Ivie, that <hi>quoth he,</hi> thou maiſt climb up the rock of <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
and embrace it, <hi>quoth he,</hi> with thy branches. Your diſcourſe indeed is not
amiſs, I muſt confeſs, ſaies <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> interrupting him, but I muſt tell you one
thing, if you did not uſe that <hi>quoth he,</hi> ſo often, you would do better: I have
often heard you uſe that kind of expreſſion, which is not good, for that repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is ſuperfluous: but yet I would not tell you ſo much till now that we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
I am obliged to you for being ſo tender as to the ornament of my lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> for it is a ſigne you will ſhew me favour in things of
more importance: but I muſt tell you it is not without reaſon that I repeat the
word <hi>quoth he,</hi> ſo often; for 'tis to let you know that it was not I, but my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
ſaid ſuch a thing: if I durſt, I would not cloſe up every period, but ſecond
every word with it, that you may not be miſtaken; and know that all I tell you,
is by way of allegation. I ſhould be very ſorry you ſhould think I my ſelf ſaid
that it was convenient for me to be metamorphoſed into Ivie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amaryllis</hi> laught at this very heartily, and confeſſed that <hi>Carmelin</hi>'s excuſe
was extream pleaſant, and thought that no other body could have had the wit
to imagin ſuch a one, though many in their relations uſed the like repetition, and
that as frequently: However ſhe told him, that if he was troubled to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that his Maſters diſcourſes were not his, it ſignified he did not eſteem him
much: You'll pardon me there, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> but I muſt tell you freely, that
my Maſter ſpeaks many things which a man muſt not believe, which proceeds
from that diſturbance of mind he is in by reaſon of his love, and in this he will not
contradict me, for it were not for his credit. Since you will not believe him,
ſaies <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> what is your deſigne then? 'Tis only that I dare not declare
my ſelf, leſt I ſhould be thought unconſtant, reply'd <hi>Carmelin;</hi> as for your part
Madam you know partly what I would ſay: I would to God I had ſeen <hi>Liſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
before <hi>Parthenice!</hi> I ſay no more. You would tell me, ſaies <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> that
if you had fallen in love with <hi>Liſetta</hi> before <hi>Parthenice,</hi> you ſhould have been
ſent to the former, which you would have been glad of, becauſe ſhe were the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
company. I have found out an expedient in this buſineſs of yours, for <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
having related to me all your adventures, told me how that one night, being
with <hi>Lyſis,</hi> while he was a Tree there was a Nymph called <hi>Lucida,</hi> who ſaid that
you ſhould have for Miſtreſs the greater of the <hi>Hamadriads</hi> which were in the
Company: She that was ſpoken of was <hi>Liſetta,</hi> who is now reſtored to her
former ſhape. Now it muſt be ſaid that you have been in love with her ever ſince
that time; and that all the hurt you have ſaid of her ſince, was only to ſhew
how far you were ſenſible of the ſmart of your whipping.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> was almoſt out of himſelf at this good councel, which he was the
gladder to receive from <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> becauſe 'twas ſhe had been the Fountain
<hi>Lucida:</hi> She was thanked with almoſt as many conges as words, whereupon
<hi>Carmelin</hi> left her and returned to his Maſter, to whom he ſaid that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
a great ſecret from him out of a certain fearfullneſs, but that he could hide
it no longer. <hi>Lyſis</hi> told him he ſhould be glad to hear it, ſo that <hi>Carmelin</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him, that he had been in love with <hi>Liſetta,</hi> ſince the time ſhe was an
<hi>Hamadryad,</hi> and that he had obeyed the command he had received from <hi>Lucida</hi>
to love her: Why didſt thou not tell me ſo? replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> why didſt thou profeſs
love to <hi>Parthenice,</hi> committing an inconſtancy, and an infidelity wherein I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
thee, as not knowing thou hadſt before loſt thy liberty? I did no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43725:174"/>
inform my ſelf, becauſe I thought thou hadſt had it ſtill; for when I ſpoke
to thee of <hi>Synopa, Lucida, Liſetta,</hi> and her companion the <hi>Apricock-tree-Nymph,</hi>
thou ſaidſt they were all witches, and that thou wouldſt avoid their aſſemblies, as
thoſe of the <hi>Sabat.</hi> I beg your pardon for theſe faults, ſaies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> my mind
was then full of bad opinions: I believe it and pardon thee, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> it was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
judged that thou never hadſt but a feigned paſſion for <hi>Parthenice,</hi> ſince thou
didſt ſo ſoon forſake her, and didſt diſclaim her aſſoon as ever that misfortune
of loſing her proper from hapned to her. 'Tis ſaid, that he who leaves off loving,
never lov'd; I did much ſuſpect that there was ſome reaſon for thy averſion to
that poor <hi>Rock:</hi> Let's think on't no more, <hi>Carmelin,</hi> fate hath decreed that thou
love <hi>Liſetta:</hi> Thou art now the happieſt among the happieſt Lovers in the world,
thou liveſt in the ſame place with thy Miſtreſs, thou canſt ſpeak to her at any
time, or thou maiſt ſee her at leaſt: O how would far more illuſtrious Shepherds
then thou art, wiſh ſuch an adventure, nay even the diſgras'd and disfavour'd ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<hi>Lyſis</hi> who muſt die anon, becauſe he cannot enjoy that happineſs Alaſs! my
tongue, diſcover no more, leſt you be over-heard of ſome who are ſtrangers
to what hath been reſolv'd in the councel of our thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelins</hi> joy at this time made no harmony with the ſadneſs of his Maſter,
ſo that he only thank'd him in common expreſſions for the favour he did him by
ſuffering him to love <hi>Liſetta. Lyſis</hi> in the mean time, whoſe thoughts were very
changeable, reſolved to ſpeak thus to <hi>Hircan</hi> who made towards them. I have
been a while ſince in thy Kitchin, where I obſerved the killing and dreſſing of a
pigg, ſaies he to him, which put me in mind of the ancient ſacrifices; wherein
they conſulted the entrails of the Beaſts: 'Twere requiſite my Couſin ſhould
be deſired to ſacrifice, to know if he ought to oppoſe my being a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.
I ſhould alſo deſire to be reſolved of it by the flight of birds, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
waies of preſaging: Speak no more of it, ſaies <hi>Hircan,</hi> I ſhall uſe no more
perſwaſion to him, you ſhall be a Shepherd in ſpight of all his fooliſh conceits:
Yet would it at leaſt be a noble thing to ſacrifice and obſerve all the ancient Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
replies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> we ſhould have brought victims for the proſperity of your
Marriage, as alſo to thank the Gods for their aſſiſtance to me in divers dangerous
adventures. Some Shepherdeſſes ſhould bring baskets full of Flowers, others
Veſſels with fire and a romatick odours, and then the Shepherds ſhould lead up
the Crowned Victims: Thus ſhould we gain admiration by that excellent order,
as a thing that had not been ſeen of a long time. Men ſometimes are not pleaſed
with novelties, if their minds are not prepared to receive them, replies <hi>Hircan,</hi> and
therefore let us not ſo haſtily introduce thoſe cuſtoms you ſpeak of: 'Tis true
they are ancient, but they would be new to us becauſe they have been ſo long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> having ſaid this, retired, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> preſumed to ask his Maſter what
were the moſt certain and remarkable preſages beſides the flight of birds; He
told him that when a man undertook any buſineſs, he muſt obſerve the perſons
he firſt met, and what diſcourſe he had with them, or ſome other circumſtance,
and thence make ſome conjecture at what may happen. <hi>Carmelin</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
able enough for this; and ſo leaving his Maſter to his melancholick thoughts,
he would go and ſee his Miſtreſs, but before-hand would trie ſome preſage,
thereby to know the end of his loves: he went into a place where he found a maid
heating the oven, which having acquainted his Maſter with, he told him that
that maid repreſented <hi>Liſetta,</hi> who had put fire into his breſt; and as for the bread
ſhe put in to bake, that ſhewed that the fair one ſhould participate of his flames,
and ſhould give him her heart to heat. This good preſage could no leſs then ſtir
up <hi>Lyſis</hi> to ſeek ſuch another; but he would go more ceremonially to work, and
the many other deſignes he had to bring about, diverted him from thinking on
this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> being over head and ears in love, would needs trie one more whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he could meet with his Miſtreſs. He came down into a Parlor where he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43725:174"/>
found <hi>Amaryllis</hi> talking with three Countrey-peoyle, who had brought her ſome
wheat which they ought her for rent. There was a napkin laid at the Tables end,
with a piece of ſalt pork, the better to make them taſte a glaſs of wine. <hi>Amaryl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
bid <hi>Carmelin</hi> do as they did, which he would not be entreated twice to do, ſuch
was his fear to be troubleſome.</p>
            <p>Being all four at Table, there was a Lacquay filled them ſome wine, and laid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man his glaſs at his trencher; <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſeeing the others did nothing but
eat, and were not yet diſpoſed to drink, as being not ſo bold before <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> he
who had a greater gift of confidence, took his glaſs that ſate next him, and drank
it clearly off. This it may be was a miſtake, for that glaſs ſtood as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; but awaile after he took anothers glaſs and did the like, ſo that for
this there could be no excuſe; it is to be ſuppoſed that he ſeeing he came off ſo
well, no body ſaying ought to him, would needs try to ſhew the ſame trick for
the third: He took therefore the third mans glaſs, and diſpatched it ſo neatly,
that there remained not ſo much left, as to make a ruby on the nail.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> who in the mean time looked out at the window, turns towards
them, and ſeeing that the Country-men had taken off their glaſſes, and <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi>
only ſtood full before him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſhe thought they had all drunk but he: Why
do you not drink <hi>Carmelin,</hi> ſaies ſhe to him? you are too baſhfull. Upon this
the Country-men began to murmur, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> to laugh. What would
theſe good people ſay, continued <hi>Amaryllis;</hi> the Lacquay who had ſeen <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
play the trick, went and acquainted his Miſtreſs: She thought it a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
one, yet asked the feigned modeſt man, why he would drink others mens
wine? he anſwered, That he thought they would not drink any, and that for
his part who had much need of it, he had taken it without ſaying ought, becauſe
he was loath to trouble any body to fill ſo often. Having ſatisfied himſelf, roſe
from the Table, and the Countrey-men had other wine. If <hi>Amaryllis</hi> excuſed
<hi>Carmelins</hi> drunkenneſs, the Lacquay who had ſeen it did not; nor had he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it but to ſee his impudence, and he made it his buſineſs to relate this action to
his Comrades, to enrage them the more againſt him: Nor was this all they had
to ſay to him, for they could not but be envious to ſee <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who was but a
ſervant no more then themſelves, ſpeak as confidently to their Maſter as if he had
been his companion, beſides, they could not brook to ſee him at Table every
day with Gentlemen of quality; and their greateſt regret was, that they were
forced to ſerve one that was no better then themſelves, and preſented him with
wine as the reſt. Upon this occaſion they all entred into a league againſt him,
which may teach us not to wonder ſo much to find envie in Kings Courts, ſince
it can find room under the roof of a Country-Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Being therefore at ſupper, the ſervants minded not <hi>Carmelins</hi> drink, whereas
at other times they were wont to preſent him before he asked for it. He ſhak'd
his head as he looked on one of the Lacquays, to tell him be wanted ſomewhat,
but the Lacquay looking on him as ſeriouſly, ſhook his head as the other did: If
<hi>Carmelin</hi> made any ſigne with his hand, the other made the like, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lacquays did the like whenever he made any addreſſes to them: For they
were reſolved to puniſh him now, for having drunk too much at collation. When
the fruits were ſerved up he was ſo drie, that he would have cry'd out for drink,
but that he was loath to make any noiſe: He therefore roſe from the Table, and
went and drank at the ſide-Table himſelf. <hi>Hircan</hi> taking notice of it, ſaid that
he would have him waited on as well as the reſt, and that he would not have his
men think themſelves his fellows, becauſe he was neither waiting-man nor groom,
but might be rank'd among Gentlemen dependants, as being received into an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation
of Shepherdry with <hi>Lyſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This troubled the ſervants extreamly, but for the preſent there was no further
tumult. <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Pernella</hi> ſate at <hi>Hircans</hi> Table, and <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who ſtill plaid
the diſcontented perſon. After a ſhort walk in the Garden, <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi>
were diſmiſſed to bed, and for <hi>Adrian</hi> and his wife, they might when they pleas'd
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43725:175"/>
have done the like. <hi>Adrian</hi> had all ſupper time obſerved whether <hi>Fontenay</hi> did
not out of affection drink out of the ſame glaſs as <hi>Pernella,</hi> or trod not on her foot
to appoint the time. He had all the while been in ſhe like diſquiets, ſuch was his
jealouſie, and as they walked, he was almoſt reſolved to tye her to a lethern gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
he wore on his doublet, leſt any body might take her away from him. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
therefore ſeen her a bed in the chamber aſſigned them, he ſearcht under
the bed, and on the bed-ſtead, nay under the very feather bed and mat, behind
it, and in the chimney, to ſee if ſome body were not hidden there. Finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
he made faſt the dore with a bar, and beſides put a Cupboard againſt it;
and yet he did not think himſelf ſafe enough, as fearing there might be ſome
body locked up in a great cheſt which was near the window, who might force his
wife, for he was not only jealous of <hi>Fontenay,</hi> but of all the other Shepherds.
At laſt finding the Cheſt emptie, he laid himſelf by <hi>Pernella's</hi> ſide.</p>
            <p>He was no ſooner a bed, but <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who was reſolved to make what ſport he
could with him, comes to the dore and ſings a Court-air with a languiſhing voice,
as if he had been ready to dye for love. <hi>Hircan</hi> helped him with his Lute, and a
while after, the other Shepherds and <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> deſirous to ſhare in the ſport,
made an excellent conſort with them. They ſung all manner of ſongs, and that
in ſuch abundance, that <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Pernella</hi> were almoſt ſtunn'd with the noiſe.
When they had given over, <hi>Fontenay</hi> fetch'd three or four ſighes, and made this
complaint.</p>
            <p>Muſt then another be maſter of her whom. I cannot be ſervant to? Muſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
body enjoy my ſoul? Ah my Faireſt! why do you ſlight me? There is
ſuch a Nymph of <hi>Diana</hi> that loves me better then her Miſtreſs. There are thoſe
that run after me, and offer me all that I offer you; but I reſerve my ſelf for you
alone. If you will grant me nothing, yet refuſe not my heart, which I preſent
unto you. Do me the favour to accept it, and aſſure me only by one word of
your mouth, that you do it: Let your fair lips, whoſe motion is the reſt of the
ear, neatly pronounce what they ought to ſay to me. Though you loſe nothing
thereby, yet I ſhall think my ſelf a great gainer.</p>
            <p>The Shepherd <hi>Fontenay</hi> uttered a many other amorous diſcourſes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſung with the reſt. <hi>Adrian</hi> in the mean time ſwore he would be gone the
next day, though he left <hi>Lyſis</hi> behind him; and that he would ſue for reparation
for the affronts done him. The more he ſpoke, the greater noiſe did they make,
that it might encreaſe his madneſs that he was not heard.</p>
            <p>This diverſion having laſted above an hour, the company of Muſitians per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him to ſleep. The good mans ears was ſo ſtunn'd, that he thought he
ſhould be deaf, as he had been before: however theſe diſquiets were not ſo great
but they ſuffered him to take ſome reſt. Being gotten up the next day, as he came
down to ſee if there were anymeans to be gone, <hi>Carmelin</hi> comes out of his maſters
chamber, and told the other Shepherds that he was very ſick. <hi>Fontenay</hi> and his
companions went thither immediately, and <hi>Adrian</hi> with them, but his wife was
not with him; for he had locked her in the chamber while ſhe was a dreſſing.
A while after, <hi>Hircan</hi> comes in; and <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſeeing all that company, ſate up in his
bed and began this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The Gods have at length had compaſſion on me, and delivered me out of
<hi>Adrians</hi> tyrannie. See they have ſent me a ſickneſs which I ſhall never recover.
He that having ſometime been a tree, ought to have hard fleſh: He who hath
been invulnerable, who hath quelled ſo many Monſters; and he laſtly, who
thought himſelf ſo reſerved to reſtore the earth to its firſt felicitie, behold he is
beaten down by the firſt approaches of a feaver that have aſſaulted him. Fear
not that ſayes <hi>Hircan,</hi> be of good courage; what ails you? will you have any
thing to breakfaſt? I have an extreme head-ach replyes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> but I think that
when I have drunk a little wine, I ſhall be able to ſuffer my pain more patiently
and more chearfully.</p>
            <p>'Twas hereupon conſidered whether any wine ſhould be given him, for <hi>Adrian</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:43725:175"/>
ſaid, that if it were a feaver, it would encreaſe it; but <hi>Hircan</hi> having felt his pulſe,
ſaid he had yet no feaver, and that he might have what he deſired. <hi>Carmelin</hi> had
wine ready in a little bottle, he brought him a glaſs of it. <hi>Lyſis</hi> drank it off ſo haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as if he avoided the taſting of it, and when he had done, he made ſuch wry faces
as if it had been phyſick, and after that, he continued his diſcourſe thus:</p>
            <p>My dear friends, be not amazed that I have with ſome trouble taken down this
wine, though I gave it no long time to ſtay in my palate: it is becauſe it hath ſuch
a lewd taſte, that if all the drink in the world were ſuch, you would dye for thirſt
rather then taſte any. 'Tis not but that the Territorie of <hi>Brie</hi> is favourable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to the wines, for the wines of this Country, is in its nature good: but it is
becauſe I have made it otherwiſe on purpoſe, and having a deſign to dye, I put in
the laſt night a certain poiſon which I had carryed about me a long time to make
uſe of, as I have, when any occaſion ſhould preſent it ſelf. And if you deſire
to know more particularly why I would at this preſent diſpatch my ſelf, it is not
only to avoid going to <hi>Paris</hi> with <hi>Adrian,</hi> but alſo to obey the command of my
Miſtreſs. When I asked her a while ſince, what Laws I ſhould obſerve under her
Empire, ſhe anſwered me roughly, <hi>I command you not to obey me any more.</hi> I had
much adoe to underſtand this command, and therefore propoſed the difficultie
of it to <hi>Carmelin</hi> and <hi>Clarimond.</hi> All I could gather from their anſwer was that
I ſhould not obey <hi>Charite</hi> in that command which charged me not to obey her,
and contradicted it ſelf; and that I was only to regard her former commands,
taking this to ſignifie nothing. This ſubtle explication had ſome appearance of truth
and I was ſatisfied with it for wantof a better. But it being not in my power to
ſpeak with <hi>Charite,</hi> to have one from her own mouth, I had a day or two ſince,
a certain inſpiration which hath given me all the ſatisfaction I deſired. Methinks
I hear it ſtill in my ear, telling me that all thoſe who have offered at any explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Charites</hi> command, underſtood nothing in it, and that there is no doubt
but to have commanded me not to obey her any more, was as much as to bid me
dye as ſoon as I could, and not be any longer ſubject to her laws. Let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that is unworthy to ſerve her, dye; and in his death will be found the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of that inviolable Commandement. <hi>I command you,</hi> ſayes <hi>Charite</hi> to me,
that word tells me I ought to obey her, and that according to her good pleaſure
I ſhould dye. That is a thing ſoon doon, and as for the other part which will
have me <hi>to obey her no more,</hi> that will be executed when my ſoul and body are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated.
This argues not but that I muſt ſtill love <hi>Carite</hi> even in the other
world, but becauſe I ſhall be nothing but an unprofitable ſhade uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do her any ſervice, it may be conceived I ſhall obey her no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having ended this diſcourſe, began to roll his eyes in his head and to
ſeign tremblings; ſo that <hi>Adrian</hi> was in a pittiful taking, and asked <hi>Carmelin</hi>
whether it were true his Maſter had put any poiſon into the wine he had drunk.
I am ſure ſayes <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that I having brought this bottle hither laſt night, not
knowing what occaſion there might be of it, <hi>Lyſis</hi> put I know not what into it:
But wretch that I am I was not ſo careful as to ask him what it was, and yet it
will be ſaid that I am partly a cauſe of his death, by reaſon of my negligence.
Beſides that it breaks my heart, when I think he took that mortal draught from
my hand, O heavens! why would you ſuffer it?</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſeem to be extreamly troubled according to the directions
of his Maſter, and <hi>Adrian</hi> amazed as much as poſſible, turned to <hi>Hircan,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
him to apply ſome remedy to his poor Couſin, and to ſend for an
Apothecarie that might give him ſomewhat to make him caſt up what he had
taken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> and all the ſhepherds who had been acquainted by <hi>Polidor</hi> of the diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> made as if they were extremely troubled; and one of them
tells <hi>Adrian</hi> that he knew not of any means to give his Couſin an Antidote,
though the Apothecary had brought any, becauſe he being reſolved to die, would
never take it. Yet <hi>Hircan</hi> made as if he would ſend a Lacquay to the City for
that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:43725:176"/>
               <hi>In the mean time</hi> Lyſis <hi>having trembled a great while, pronounced theſe words
with a dying voice.</hi> A certain benummedneſs begins to ſeize my nobleſt parts; I am
gone my friends. Farewel Shepherds, chooſe out one from among you, who being the
moſt illuſtrious, may give you lawes. If my advice be of any weight with you, take
<hi>Philiris.</hi> I believe the <hi>Pariſians</hi> that are to come, will be much aſtoniſhed not to find
me; but there is no remedy, I muſt obey my Miſtreſs one moment, that I may obey her
no more: I will execute her command without command. As for your part Couſin,
you are partly the cauſe why I embrace death, for ſeeing that you would needs carry
me to <hi>Paris,</hi> it ſhould be my endeavour to dye, though I received no occaſion as being
deſirous to end my dayes here, that I may have the honour to be buried by my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and in ſpight of your teeth remain in this happy country.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe ended, <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſlides down into the bed, as if he had fainted; and
after he had fetched ſome ſighes, he turned to the other ſide, and ſpoke no more.
He kept himſelf ſo much from moving and taking his breath aloud, that the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
concluded he was dead, who was the deareſt friend they had in the world
<hi>Carmelin</hi> caſting himſelf on his bed, cryed out, Alas my poor Maſter! why
would you dye in the flower of your age? you might have yet a good while
enjoyed the pleaſures of life. Ah! ſince he is dead that comforted us all in
our afflictions, ſayes <hi>Fontenay,</hi> it is fit I dye too. He hath ſhewed me the way,
I am not leſs miſerable in my Loves then he. I love cruel one whom the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my ſufferings can make never the more favourable to me. Give me
poiſon as thou didſt thy Maſter, <hi>Carmelin:</hi> I will take it off preſently, and lye
down by him that I may dye in his company. Am I a common Executioner
ſayes <hi>Carmelin?</hi> Am I an adminiſtrer of poiſon? Had I known that the wine
I had given my Maſter had been poiſoned, do you think I would have ſuffered
him to take it? Go ſeek poiſon ſomewhere elſe, there is no more in our bottle:
I would to God there never had been any. If I cannot get poiſon, cryes out
<hi>Fontenay,</hi> I will take a knife and cut my throat; and if I am denyed weapons,
I ſhall find ſome other ſhift to diſpatch my ſelf: I will caſt my ſelf out at the
window, I will hang my ſelf, or ſwallow burning coals, and will keep in my breath
till I am choaked. Take away this deſperate perſon, ſayes <hi>Hircan,</hi> you <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
and <hi>Meliantes,</hi> carry him into ſome chamber, where let him be chained up as
a mad man. O God! how does Love let us ſee this day the ſtrange effects of
his mighty power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> having ſaid this, <hi>Fontenay</hi> was conveyed away, and <hi>Adrian</hi> having
himſelf felt his Couſin, was ſo ſimple as to think him dead. He went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to his wife and told her this ſad news. They were both extremely troubled,
conſidering it would be ſaid generally that they were the cauſe of this poor lads
death, for want of having a better care of him; and were too blame to let him
goe into the Country among ſtrangers, who had ſo confounded his imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that he dyed out of deſpair. Their recourſe was to diſcharge their fury on
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> telling him he was a Rogue, a Traytor, and a Mutherer, and that it
was he had put poiſon into his Maſters wine. He reproached them with being
the cauſe of all this unhappineſs, and that <hi>Lyſis</hi> had confeſſed at his death, that he
dyed to avoid going with them to <hi>Paris. Hircan</hi> came and told them it was ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent
to quarrel in the place where the dead body lay; and that there was as
much reſpect due to the dead as to things ſacred. He thereupon cauſes all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the chamber and locked the dore, not permitting any to go in, and then takes
up <hi>Adrian</hi> after this manner. Let us ſpeak a little with reaſon good friend, ſayes
he to him: What do you mean by making ſuch a noiſe here? Will you have all
the world take notice that <hi>Lyſis</hi> is poiſoned? If that be once known, his body
will be taken hence, and juſtice will proceed againſt him as a ſelf-homicide. He
will be hanged at a Gibbet by his feet: he will have a brand of infamie, and his
goods will be confiſcate: You that are of his kindred will get neither profit nor
eredit thereby. All you have of <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s in your hands will be taken away, and
the children will point at you as they goe to ſchool, as being of near kin to one
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43725:176"/>
that was hanged. You muſt therefore conceal the truth, and give out that <hi>Lyſis</hi>
dyed a natural death.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſilenced <hi>Adrian</hi> and his wife: They had ſome part in
<hi>Lyſis</hi>'s inheritance, which would have fallen to them very ſeaſonably, for they had
already two children, one tabling abroad, and the other at nurſe, and they were
not over-rich. As for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> nothing could make him give over his complaints;
theſe and the like were alwayes his words. I who have ſo faithfully aſſiſted my
maſter, ſhall now be no more thought on He that hath laboured ſhall go without
his reward, and they that have done nothiug ſhall carry away all. Who hath
been with <hi>Lyſis</hi> night and day? Who hath faſted with him for companys ſake,
when there was a neceſſitie? Who hath broke his ſleep to entertain him with
love diſcourſe? Who made clean his cloaths? Who told him fine tales? Who
taught him ſentences taken out of the choiceſt Common-places? Alas! It was
his faithful <hi>Carmelin:</hi> Yet he ſhall inherit nothing of his. Now he is dead, he
muſt be thruſt out of dores like a Rogue. Had he but made his Will, I
ſhould have ſeen whether he had loved me me or no; I ſhould have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with what he would have left me. Muſt the next of kin whom he loved not
at all, and to avoid whom, he is departed the world; be his abſolute heirs? Tis
as much as the beſtowing on the murtherer the goods of him he hath murthered.
Here are his freinds who pretend to be very ſad for his death, but they have not
the fiftieth part of my affliction. 'Tis a good author hath taught me, that if heirs
have tears in their eyes, they laugh in their hearts and as for that invention of
Cloſe Mourning at the burial it was out of a diſtruſt they might not conſtantly
obſerve the ſame ſadneſs in their count-nance, and that their joy might not be
diſcovered at their eyes, which would be a thing of ill example to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Carmelin</hi> continue his complaints, which I believe he had ſtudied,
but <hi>Hircan</hi> told him that he would order things ſo, that his ſervices ſhould not
be forgoten, and though his Maſter had ordered him neither wages, nor conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
yet ſhould he have what would ſatisfie him. He bid him not trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that his Maſter made no will, for that would have been only a ſeminary of
ſuits, and <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s heirs would not have paid what had been bequeathed. To give
you an example of theſe inconveniences, continues he, a rich man making his will,
left all he had to a company of his fellow Citizens to diſpoſe of it, and to let his
right heirs have what part thereof pleaſed them. The heir ſuing the communitie,
the Judge told them: Well, if you are deſirous to accompliſh the Will of the
Teſtator, you muſt let this ſon have what pleaſeth you. What diviſion will you
make? he ſhall have a tenth part; and we will have the other nine replyed the
company. Take then the tenth part to your ſelves, ſayes the Judge, and leave the
reſt to the heir, for he is to have what part pleaſeth you. By this querck the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
heir was reſtored to his right: but all Judges have not ſuch good judgments
as this had; ſo that it would be very doubtful pleading, both for the Inheritors
and Legataries. What ever <hi>Lyſis</hi> had left you, Sir <hi>Carmelin, Adrian</hi> would have
gotten one half, and the Law another. What courſe ſhall I take then? ſaies
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> were it not better be in hazard to get ſomewhat, then to be aſſured of
nothing? What ſhall I ſtay for? wretch that I am, fortune never ſmiled on me
in my life. Do you wonder <hi>Fortune</hi> never <hi>ſmiled</hi> on you, repſies <hi>Hircan,</hi> did you
ever ſee one ſmile upon the <hi>wheele?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> underſtood not this ſcoffe at the firſt, but at length he remembred
that that unconſtant Goddeſs was repreſented on a wheele: He prayed <hi>Hircan</hi>
not to add to his affliction by deriding his miſery: and though <hi>Hircan</hi> knew he
was not ſo ſad as he pretended, yet he ſwore to him, that in caſe the heirs
would give him nothing, he would ſatisfie him out of his own.</p>
            <p>About this time comes in a Lacquey from <hi>Anſelme,</hi> who ſaid his Maſter was
much troubled about <hi>Lyſis,</hi> having heard nothing from him ſince the laſt time he
had ſeen him, and that he was ſent to know whether he had been ſo ill bred as to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43725:177"/>
return without bidding him adiew, or asking whether he would any thing to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
My friend, ſaies <hi>Hircan,</hi> tell your Maſter that <hi>Lyſis</hi> is juſt now departed
this world. The Lacquey would not have believed it, had not <hi>Carmelin</hi> with a
ſad countenance confirmed it. He therefore returned with this anſwer to his
Maſter. <hi>Anſelme</hi> knew not whether it was only a trick put upon him, or that it
was true, ſo that however it were, he thought beſt to go immediately to <hi>Hircans.</hi>
At the outer gate he met <hi>Meliantes,</hi> who acquainted him with the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
To comply with the brave Shepherds that were there, <hi>Anſelme</hi> counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
the diſconſolate as much as could be.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Pernella</hi> asked <hi>Hircan</hi> what he intended to do
with the body, and deſired it might be buried, and put into the ground: He ſhall
not be interred to day, ſaies <hi>Hircan,</hi> his fellow Shepherds will not permit it, their
Cuſtom is to keep the bodies two daies at leaſt, and then waſh them to ſee if they
are quite dead; for there are ſome who being only fallen into a lethargy have
been thought dead, and ſo buried, they recovering again have died mad. Beſides
that you are to know that the bodies of <hi>Illuſtrious Shepherds</hi> and <hi>Heroes,</hi> ſuch as
your Couſin was, are never intered, that's a thing was never ſeen. Read all good
Authors, and you will find it was never done: We think it a baſe thing to be
thruſt into the earth; you cannot do worſe with thoſe that die as Malefactors:
is there any thing more ignominious then to rot, and to be eaten of worms? Is it
not a deſpicable thing to be beſtow'd into the groſſeſt of all the Elements? 'tis
better chuſe the pureſt, as a thing more noble and more deſirable. We perſons
of quality, have our bodies burned after our death. The fire which ſeems to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
to the higheſt ſphere, ſeems tocarry thither with it our Reliques, and that
our bodies are conveyed to the Gods as well as our ſouls. <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s body ſhall
therefore be burn'd on a heap of fagots, in the midſt of my Court; but there
are ſome neceſſarie ceremonies to go before <hi>Hercules</hi> was burnt alive before he
went to heaven; is there any danger to burn a dead man? the bodies of all the
<hi>Caeſars</hi> have been ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> who underſtood nothing of Hiſtory nor fables, was beſide himſelf at
this propoſition of <hi>Hircan,</hi> and proteſted more then ever to apply himſelf to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
for ſatisfaction for all the injuries he had received. He ſaid they were to
blame not to ſuffer his Couſin to be buried after the ordinary manner, ſince it did
not appear he died a Heretick, nay contrary to <hi>Hircans</hi> opinion, he maintained
that it was an ignominious thing to be burn'd; nay worſe then to be caſt into the
common ſhore, ſince they were the moſt wicked that were condemned to the
fire, as Witches, and Traitors. <hi>Philiris</hi> ſtood up to make good what <hi>Hircan</hi> had
ſaid, and would have brought his reaſons out of the ſubtile <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of Dr. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;</hi>
but <hi>Hircan</hi> told him he muſt keep within the limits of <hi>Poety,</hi> and that
they ought not to engage themſelves in things over ſerious. <hi>Adrian</hi> not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
any longer to keep in his vexation, turn'd to <hi>Anſelme,</hi> and quarrelled with
him in this manner; If I come to any trouble for my deceaſed Couſin, I declare
to you now as I did then, and I ſhall declare to you then as I now do, that I will
be righted againſt you. You have taken this poor youth from under my hands,
and though you promiſed me to treat him well, yet you have brought him hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
among a ſort of people that have made him run quite out of his wits. 'Tis
quite contrary to what you ſay, replies <hi>Anſelme,</hi> for if they are mad as you ſee
they are ſometimes, 'tis your Couſin is in fault; they were diſcreet enough when
he came hither, but he hath perverted them, and filled them with his corrupt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
If I had not had a great care of my ſelf, and kept at a diſtance from him,
he would have brought me into the ſame high-way of madneſs: I have ſufficient
witneſs to prove that he would have perſwaded me above a hundred times to
turn Shepherd. Theſe are cheats, ſaies <hi>Adrian,</hi> you are all of you old enough to
look to your ſelves; 'tis not to be conceived that one young man alone ſhould cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
ſo many; my couſin could not be worſ in any place of the world: theſe are Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians
&amp; Atheiſts that fear neither God nor devil; ſince I came into this place I have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43725:177"/>
not heard one word of our Religion. How is it that theſe Apoſtates are ſuffered
in <hi>France,</hi> who are worſe then <hi>Nero</hi>'s and <hi>Julian</hi>'s?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> uttered a many exclamations to the ſame purpoſe, but <hi>Meliantes</hi> told
him that it were not his beſt courſe to uſe ſuch language, and that he had already
felt the greatneſs of <hi>Hircans</hi> power. You are an ignorant Cockney, ſaies <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
very roughly to him, you know not what belongs to Heroick grandeur: Know
that <hi>Heroes,</hi> ſuch as we are, have priviledges which other men have not. They
live after another manner, they are clad otherwiſe, they ſpeak otherwiſe, and
they die otherwiſe. <hi>Adrian</hi> had an itch to ask whether they had not a Paradice
by themſelves, but he kept it in for fear of further offence. Conſider with your
ſelf if you have a mind to ſee the Ceremonies we uſe to the dead, continued
<hi>Hircan,</hi> we will not do any thing the leſs, or more ſecretly for you; if you will
not appear there, hide your ſelf where you pleaſe; nay the truth is, you are too
profane to be preſent at ſuch ſacred Funerals.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe made <hi>Adrian</hi> and his wife retire to their Chamber and in the
mean time <hi>Hircan</hi> opens <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s, whereinto the whole company entred, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
<hi>Fontenay,</hi> who having overcome his deſpair, thought it ſufficient to be
ſad. <hi>Carmelin</hi> went and caſt the ſheet over <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s head, who diſcovered no more
motion then before; and the Gardiner having brought ſuch flowers and ſweet
hearbs as could be found in that ſeaſon, all the Shepherds caſt of them upon the
dead body.</p>
            <p>Hereupon comes in <hi>Amaryllis</hi> ſinging an aire had been purpoſly made on the
death of the Shepherd. Her voice was ſo ſweet and languiſhing, that <hi>Adrian</hi>
thought at firſt ſhe had ſung ſome good prayer, or hymne; but when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the ſence of what ſhe ſung, and the other Shepherds anſwering her, he
was ſtark mad, becauſe the ſubject of it was ſome amorous paſſion. See here my
duck, among what a ſort of people we are fallen inſtead of praying to God for
the ſoul of the poor dead party or ſending for Prieſts to do it, they go even into
his Chamber ſinging <hi>French</hi> aires whereas the <hi>hymnes</hi> of the Church are in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi>
In the mean time I doubt not but my Couſin hath more need of good pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
for he died without confeſſion.</p>
            <p>The Muſick having laſted a good while, he ſtill complained, and in the mean
time <hi>Carmelin</hi> being come out of the Chamber for more branches of Cypreſs
which <hi>Hircan</hi> wanted, a Lacquey met him, and fell on him in theſe words; Thy
glory is now in the duſt, poor ſnake, thou ſhalt play the fool no more, thou haſt
loſt the maſter for whoſe ſake thou wert entertained every where. I ſhall now
ſee thee a poor rogue again. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was ſo peaceable a man that he made no
return again to theſe abuſes, but fell a weeping to ſhew how great his grief was;
but yet in himſelf he took comfort, when he conſidered that thoſe who domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neered
over him, as if he had no dependance of any man, would be one day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
when they ſhould find <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſtill alive. He went therefore to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and gathered ſome Cypreſs, and carried it quietly to quietly to <hi>Hircan.</hi> who ſtrewed
it all about the Chamber, according to the cuſtom of the Ancients, who held
that Tree mournfull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> hereupon reflecting on what he had heard <hi>Hircan</hi> ſay, that <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s
body ſhould be burn'd and not interr'd, fell into ſtrange diſquiets; for as to the
effecting his Maſters deſigne, it was neceſſary he ſhould be interr'd, to the end
that there being nothing to detain <hi>Adrian</hi> in <hi>Bris,</hi> he might return to <hi>Paris,</hi> and
<hi>Lyſis</hi> get out of the Sepulcher in the night, and go into ſome private place, whence
he might afterwards return to his former way of life; whereas on the contrary,
ſhould they burn him, the poor man knew not whether he were not oblig'd to
declare that he was not dead, leſt they ſhould commit ſuch a cruelty as to burn
him alive. At laſt he reſolved to be patient a while, leſt he ſhould have incurr'd
the diſpleaſure of his Maſter, who would have been angry to find him no better
a keeper of his ſecrets, ſo that he reſolv'd not to declare the truth, till extream
neceſſity ſhould require it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:43725:178"/>
While he was thus conſidering, <hi>Philiris</hi> being gotten up into a chair on his knees,
and leaning his hands on the back of it, began to hem, as one that prepares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for a long ſpeech. All the Shepherds ſate down knowing his intention was to
make a <hi>Funeral Oration</hi> on the death of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and every one keeping ſilence,
he ſpoke thus.</p>
            <p>I am not able to tell you, ſad and diſconſolate Shepherds, what we have left
us we can call good, if we conſider what we have loſt, unleſs it be the reflection
of our memory on the content and ſatisfaction we had to poſſeſs the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Lyſis;</hi> for we are rather to continue our thanks to the Gods that we enjoy'd
him ſome time, then cenſure them that they have now taken him from us. They
are poſſibly our crimes have caus'd it, in that we deſerve not to have among us ſo
rare a Maſterpiece, to whoſe excellence heaven and nature had contributed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually.
Whether we conſider the features of his countenance, and the
proportion of his body, or repreſent to our ſelves the delicacy of his diſpoſition,
and the excellency of his mind, there was nothing the earth could be worthy
of. Nevertheleſs this common mother of men being deſirous to enjoy him eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
had obtained of <hi>Jupiter</hi> that he might be received into the quality of
<hi>Trees,</hi> which ſhe nouriſhes by their roots; but the ſage <hi>Hircan</hi> oppoſed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and delivered the illuſtrious Shepherd out of captivity; which though it
was honourable, yet could not but be inconvenient. But heaven not being long
able to be without its own work, hath prevailed ſo far as that it hath taken him
hence, and it might be eaſily judg'd it was reſolv'd to have him, ſince it was the
decree of fate he ſhould expoſe himſelf to all manner of dangers to deliver a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
out of the Priſon of an Enchanter, though his principal profeſſion was far
from that of a Souldier, Notwithſtanding all this, 'twas no violent death
ſnatcht him from us; but methinks the firſt fruits of thoſe delights he now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes,
ſhould not have been ſo burdenſome to him; a natural death came and
gently cloſed up his eyes, and hath not broken nor cut the knots which faſtned
his ſoul and body together, but hath moſt dexterouſly and without any violence
untyed them.</p>
            <p>Theſe words moved <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſo far, that he almoſt forgot he was departed. He
was ready to ſpeak, and to tell the Shepherds they were to blame to ſay his death
was natural, ſince it was violent. He thought that if it was not ſaid he had poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
himſelf, his hopes would have been fruſtrated, and he ſhould deſerve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of <hi>Charite.</hi> He never imagined it would have been ignominious to him if
it ſhould be ſaid he had diſpatched himſelf. The agitation of his mind was ſo
great, that his body moved a little, which <hi>Meliantes</hi> perceiving, acquainted the
Oratour with it; but they perſwaded him it was an illuſion, ſo that <hi>Philiris</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in his Oration.</p>
            <p>I ſhould then have told you, Paſtoral Aſſembly, that it was neceſſary <hi>Lyſis</hi>
ſhould die, ſince it was the pleaſure of heaven, but yet there was no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould oblige us to receive his death otherwiſe then with the greateſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that men are capable of. There's none among us ought for ten years be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the leaſt ſmile, and if any ſuch thing happen it ſhall be a forfeit. How can
we diſclaim ſadneſs? ſince love himſelf, though a God, is not exempted; and I
believe he will no more go naked as he was wont to do, becauſe he muſt now put
on mourning: Nor indeed could he not but be extreamly obliged to this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
as who made it his daily employment, the dilatation of his Empire while he
lived, and at his death commended and conſign'd his ſoul into his hands to be
conducted into that place, where all faithfull Lovers are eternally rewarded. I
ſhould not tell you all theſe things, did I not herein obey cuſtom, who will have
it ſo; for I conceive you are all ready to do <hi>Lyſis</hi> all that is due to him, without
any excitation from my words. However I ſhall preſume to deſire you againſt
to morrow to prepare your ſelves for the ſolemnity of his Funerals, then I ſhall
have more to ſay then I have now, and then I ſhall make a particular relation of
all his perfections, and the nobleſt adventures of his Loves, not for your ſakes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43725:178"/>
who are acquainted with them; but to ſatisfie ſuch as are ſtrangers to them that
may happen to be then preſent, and would be glad to underſtand the life of the
<hi>Heroick Shepherd,</hi> whoſe deſigne was to introduce among us the felicity of the
firſt age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philiris</hi> here ended his diſcourſe, whereof <hi>Lyſis</hi> miſſed not a word, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
elevated with the honour they did him. <hi>Hircan</hi> cauſed all the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
to leave the Chamber, and left <hi>Carmelin</hi> alone to watch the dead body.
They dined a while after, and they brought him what he wanted; but though
there was not too much for himſelf, yet was he ſo charitable, as having lockt the
dore, to preſent his Maſter with half, who confeſſed he never had a better ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
then ſince he was dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> returned to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, there to give an account of <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s pleaſant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
and to ſatisfie all as to the report they might have received of his death.
In the mean time <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Pernella</hi> would needs eat apart, and not go any
more among the Shepherds, whom they took for excommunicated and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
people: Their reſolution was not to return till they had ſeen their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins
body put into the ground in ſpight of all <hi>Hircans</hi> oppoſitions; though they
had buſineſs that much required their haſtening to <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day being ſpent in divers entertainments, as every one was pleaſed to paſs
it away, it was thought fit <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſhould lie in the Chamber where the dead
body lay, though he ſeem'd to be ſomewhat unwilling, and the reſt were diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
into their ordinary Chambers. <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſeeing himſelf alone with his faithfull
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> talked with him a good while, and would needs know what was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſaid of his death. Having underſtood that every one bewailed it, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
it might be ſome affliction to <hi>Charite;</hi> and as for the conſulation was had
about the burning of his body, it troubled him more then all. At laſt he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Carmelin</hi> to bind a faggot about with cloathes, and to put it upon the heap
in his ſtead. <hi>Carmelin</hi> promiſed to do whatever lay in his power. The morning
was not far ſpent, but <hi>Orontes</hi> and all his houſe came to <hi>Hircans,</hi> being extreamly
deſirous to ſee the iſſue of this feigned departure of <hi>Lyſis. Montenor</hi> and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
were alſo preſent, the report it ſeems having ſpread ſo far. All the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
were already entred <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s Chamber, when <hi>Adrian</hi> comes thither once
more to relate his afflictions, telling them they were to blame, not to have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Chriſtian burial on the poor deceaſed party. <hi>Clarimond</hi> comes in juſt as he
was ſpeaking, ſo that having known him to be the man he had ſpoken with in the
fields, and finding him more ſtaid and diſcreet then any of the reſt, he entreated
him to ſtand his friend. <hi>Clarimond</hi> who was of a very good diſpoſition, went
and ſpoke ſoftly to <hi>Hircan,</hi> telling him, that he knew not what pleaſure they took
by perſecuting the poor Citizen in that manner, and that he was ſufficiently abus'd.
You may perceive well enough, ſaies <hi>Hircan,</hi> that it is his couſin <hi>Lyſis</hi> hath begun,
we have only promoted the buſineſs a little; when an humour took him to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
himſelf dead, would you have us ſay immediately that there was no ſuch
thing? Not ſo neither, replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> the humour was too pleaſant to let it
die; but let it now have an end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> made no other anſwer to that, then with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od approve what he had
ſaid; and ſeeing that <hi>Charite</hi> was come with the reſt into the room, he led her by
the hand toward the Shepherds bed, and ſaid to her, Conſider fair <hi>Charite,</hi> what
are the effects of your cruelty: You have given this illuſtrious Shepherd a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
without Command,</hi> which hath been the cauſe of his death: you are to be
commended that you are come hither, to water his body with your tears: It ſhall
be waſhed with no other; but yet, O cruel one, before you darken the fair Suns
of your eyes with the clowdes of ſadneſs, be ſo favourable as to dart ſome of their
rayes on this breathleſs body. It may poſſibly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that ſince you have had
the power to make it die, you may by the ſame power revive it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> perceived by this diſcoutſe, that his Miſtreſs was there, and being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it ſhould be reproacht to her in time to come, that ſhe was not able to raiſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43725:179"/>
up her Lover, he reſolved to return immediately into the world in her preſence.
He therefore rais'd up his head by little, and having uncovered it with one hand,
he rub'd his eyes a long time together, as if he had had a deal of trouble to get
them open.</p>
            <p>The Shepherds cry'd out preſently a miracle, a miracle, a miracle of <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi>'s
eyes, this beauty hath not only reſtored life to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> but even to all his friends
who would have died with him. Let us give her thanks, let us adore her, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Temples to her as a Goddeſs. On your knees Shepherds before this fair
one, ſubmit your ſelves to her. <hi>Charite</hi> ſeeing that they came to embrace her
knees and kiſs the border of her garment, was ſo baſhfull that ſhe repented ſhe
had come along with her Miſtreſs, and would have run away, had not <hi>Hircan</hi> held
her very faſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> beheld her with a languiſhing look, and after a while ſaid to her, Is it you
fair <hi>Charite</hi> that commands me from the other world after you had ſent me thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
What new reſolution have you taken? Will you have me ſtay and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
here for ever? Do not you imagin any ſuch thing, ſaies <hi>Hircan,</hi> 'tis to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
you to happineſs, that you are reſtored to life. O! if it be ſo, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi>
how much better is it for me to be on earth, then to be in hell, or the Eliſian fields,
whence I am now come, and where I have ſeen wonderfull things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian,</hi> who was in the Chamber with the reſt to ſee what ſhould be done,
was extreamly overjoy'd to hear <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſpeak. he went and cry'd out to his wife
that their Couſin was ſtill alive; but <hi>Polidor</hi> told him that he was miſtaken if he
thought that <hi>Lyſis</hi> had not been dead at all, and that he had not ſeen him depart,
but that he was raiſed again both through the charms of <hi>Charite,</hi> and thoſe of
<hi>Hircan. Adrian</hi> who underſtood nothing of ſuch miracles, anſwered
not a word, to avoid further diſpute, but with <hi>Pernella</hi> returned to <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>The Shepherd would have riſen to have caſt himſelf at <hi>Charite</hi>'s feet; but they
told him he were better keep his bed a little, becauſe a man could not die without
being very ſick, and that there was ſtill ſome reliques of the diſeaſe. However he
lifted himſelf up a little higher then he was before, and having a pillow under his
head, he began to ſpeak thus to all that were preſent:</p>
            <p>It is but reaſonable, dearly beloved companions, that I tell you from what
place I come, and that I give you an account of thoſe things I have ſeen. My ſoul
was no ſooner out of my body, but <hi>Live</hi> came and ſeiz'd it to carry it to <hi>Hell:</hi>
I would not have my Couſin <hi>Adrian</hi> nor yet his wife, whom I ſee there in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
ſtart back at that word; they are not to think that going to hell in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of Shepherdry is to be damn'd, as it may be they have heard their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
teach; but it ſignifies only tranſlation into the other world, which is called
hell, becauſe it is lower then this. It is certain that in that place there is a priſon
for thoſe that are found guilty of any crime, but that is called <hi>Tartarus.</hi> All men
are obliged to go into thoſe ſubterraneous places to do homage to <hi>Pluto,</hi> who is
the King thereof, unleſs it happen by eſpecial favour to ſome to be deified aſſoon
as they are dead, and that ſome God plunge them into a river to purifie them, as
<hi>Venus</hi> did her ſon <hi>Aeneas</hi> This honour being not due to me, Love carried me
away into hell; for you are to obſerve that though they are the good or bad
Angels which do this Office for all other mortals, yet this little God did it for
me, becauſe the fates never commended me into the cuſtody of any other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
then him. When we had paſſed down through an obſcute valley, we came
to the banks of the River <hi>Acheron,</hi> where Love left me, and I met with the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryman,
who was going to tranſport certain ſouls: I would needs have gone with
them into the boat, but he thruſt me back with all his might, ſaying he would
not carry me over unleſs I paid him his fair before-hand. I have no other met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
then that which is within me, that is my ſelf: thou feeſt there are remain'd
in me certain grains of the firſt age, and that by my vertues I have guilt the iron
of the preſent. Conſider if I may not be able to ſerve thee in ſomewhat may
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43725:179"/>
recompence thy pains; for as to the pieces of braſs which others give, I have not
brought it with me. All this would have ſignified nothing had not there been
a charitable ſoul that had a double piece, and ſaid it was for us both, conſidering
ſhe had no further uſe of money. When I had croſſed over and was got aſhore,
I went to Hell-gate, where <hi>Cerberus</hi> could do me no hurt, becauſe he was at that
time tyed up with a great iron chain. Being come into the midſt of that great
Palace, I perceived all the other ſouls flying before me, whereat I was extreamly
troubled, for I would have been glad to have diſcourſed with them, and have
asked them how they paſſed away their time in that place. At length there were
two more confident then the reſt, who took me and lead me before the <hi>three
Judges</hi> to whom they repreſented, that <hi>Pluto's</hi> Kingdom was decaying, if there
were not ſome order taken; for whereas a ſoul incur'd greater torment if it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to avoid the darkneſs, I had at once brought ſo much light with me,
that I had frighted all the inhabitants of that low Region. I well perceive the
reaſon of it, ſaies <hi>Radamanthus,</hi> 'tis the ſoul of a Lover, whoſe fire is as pure and
as clear as the Sun, it muſt be plunged into thoſe frozen Rivers, wherein we quench
the flames of <hi>Ambition, Avarice,</hi> and other paſſions. Let it not be ſent thither,
replies <hi>Aeacus,</hi> it deſerves far otherwiſe, we were unjuſt if we did it: You have
not maturely conſidered the buſineſs. <hi>Minos</hi> was of the ſame opinion, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a long time conſulted with his brethren, it was ordered I ſhould be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the <hi>Elyſian fields.</hi> I ſaw, as I paſſed by <hi>Tartarus,</hi> where the ſinfull are ſo
tormented, that their cryes are heard a league off. <hi>Tantalus</hi> is there, <hi>Ixion</hi> is
alſo there, and a many others that have offended the Gods. After I had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
a great way with a ſpirit that was my guide, I ſaw the aire grew by little
and little more clear, and in a moment I found my ſelf in a Countrey which had
light enough to diſcover the excellent things that were in it. There was a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
cheequered with an infinity of flowers, which could not be ſeen otherwiſe
then by travelling over all the Countrys of the world, at the end of that there was
a Grove which had as many different trees, and there I met with a many happy
ſouls who began to receive me with complements for the ſatisfaction they found
in my company. I had not left my civility behind me here, ſo that I anſwered
them in as courteous expreſſions. They were all clad in white, and their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
recreation was to recite Verſes, to play on the Lute or the Gitarre, and not at
Cards nor Dice, which was the diverſion of evil ſpirits. As they were ſhewing
me all their pleaſures, it came into my mind to ask them why we were called by
no other name then <hi>Souls,</hi> and why we were put in the feminine gender, ſince di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
among us had been ſometimes men? There was one going to anſwer me, when
I perceived Love hovering over my head, who took me in his arms, and carryed
me ſo ſwiftly through the air, that the greatneſs of the agitation ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ulled me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep,
ſo that I found my ſelf in this place ere I thought on't.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having thus ended his diſcourſe, which was a knot of lyes invented on
the ſudden, all admir'd the fruitfulneſs of his conceptions. <hi>Philiris</hi> told him,
that as to the doubt he was in, that we were but ſouls only after our death, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> was
not becauſe were were women rather then men, but that not being of one ſex
more then another, we had been called by a name uſed in the feminine gender,
without any deſigne. Be it as it will, ſaies <hi>Lyſis,</hi> but I am glad that my ſoul is
feminine, for then it ſhall be of the ſame ſex as the object of its love; ſince it is
the only deſire of the <hi>Lover</hi> to be changed into the thing loved. See fair <hi>Charite</hi>
how great the affection I bear you is, continued he, nay when I was in the other
world, I had no other regret, but that I had left this too ſoon, and had not ſtaid
to ſee you, that you might not have doubted but that you were the cauſe of my
death: But fate hath laid this obligation on me, that if I dyed not in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
it was in your preſence that I was raiſed up again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charite</hi> knew not what anſwer to make to theſe fine words, ſo that when ſhe
perceived <hi>Hircan</hi> looſen his hold ſomewhat, ſhe made but one ſtride of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
into the gallery, and as ſhe went down, being followed by no body, ſhe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43725:180"/>
conſidered of her returning to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s to avoid further abuſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> in the mean time was extremely comforced at the arrival of thoſe who
were come in laſt, who ſeemed to him to be of more ſtaid minds then the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds.
He therefore approaches his Couſin, and asked him whether he would
not return to <hi>Paris;</hi> whereat the Shepheard was extreamely troubled, imagining
his diſſimulation had been all to no purpoſe, and had not laſted long enough to
ſend away that troubleſome Guardian. As he was ſtudying what to anſwer, <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
prevented him, ſaying, he was too importunate in diſturbing a poor man,
who was but newly returned to life, and that it was ſufficient if <hi>Lyſis</hi> had ſo much
ſtrength as to get up and walk about the houſe.</p>
            <p>This check roughly delivered, made <hi>Adrian</hi> retire, and <hi>Hircan</hi> having promis'd
<hi>Lyſis</hi> on his word, that his Couſin ſhould not diſpoſe of him as he pleaſed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
him to riſe and come to dinner with the company. He was at that time
in ſo good an humour, that he ſuffered <hi>Carmelin</hi> to help him put on his cloaths.
<hi>Hircan</hi> had retained to dine with him all that were in the houſe. As they were
ready to ſit down, <hi>Lyſis</hi> was like to make an ill meal of it, becauſe he ſaw not
<hi>Charite</hi> whom he had ſought all over the houſe. He thought the expreſſions of
Love he had made to her, were come to nothing: but <hi>Angelica</hi> having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
ſome of her complaints, would give him ſome comfort, making him believe
that the reaſon he found not <hi>Charite</hi> there; was not becauſe that ſhe had left
him out of diſdain, but that <hi>Leonora</hi> had ſent her to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s about ſome bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide <hi>Adrian,</hi> who imagined his Couſin would be no better then
he was before, had not quitted his deſire to carry him away; and his recourſe
was to <hi>Anſelm</hi> though he had quarrelled with him, but a little before.</p>
            <p>He asked if he might not be permitted to be gone; to which <hi>Anſelm</hi> replyed,
if you are in ſuch haſt you may go your wayes preſently: but as for <hi>Lyſis</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
you, that as I brought him hither, ſo I will bring him hence. Within 15
dayes at fartheſt I muſt be at <hi>Paris,</hi> there being ſome occaſions that call me thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It is not ſo long that there can happen any great alterations in your Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins
mind, that you ſhould much fear. <hi>Adrian</hi> was loath to ſubſcribe to this,
but <hi>Clarimond</hi> interpoſing, adviſed him to accept what was propoſed. He was
forced to it out of the good opinion he had of that Gentlemans faithfulneſs and
ſinceritie. However, ſince it was too late to get to <hi>Paris</hi> that night, he deferred
his journey till the next day, and <hi>Hircan</hi> being acquainted with his reſolution,
made him very welcom, becauſe he gave him that further time to make ſport with
<hi>Lyſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While all this was working, <hi>Carmelin</hi> knew not whether he ought to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or ſad. As ſoon as his Maſter was gotten up, he went to ſee <hi>Lyſetta,</hi> to whom
he had not proffered his ſervice ſince he had <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s permiſſion. His Maſters death
had taken away all ſuch thoughts. The firſt propoſition he made thereof to her,
ſhe only laughed at him for his pains, ſo that he was very ill ſatisfied. The worſt
on't was, that he durſt not declare it to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> becauſe he would have given him
no other advice then to play the mad Lover like <hi>Fontenay.</hi> He could not ſing to
entertain her with <hi>Serenades,</hi> and could play upon no other Inſtrument then a
Flute. Beſides he was a man that would not abate any thing of his reſt, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
your Lovers laws. He returned therefore with theſe diſquiets to dine with
perſons of honour and qualitie, as he was wont to do.</p>
            <p>As they were waſhing before they ſate down, <hi>Hircans</hi> man acquainted him
that there was below an ill favoured fellow, and as ill accounted, who had a great
deſire to come up. How came he to thee ſayes <hi>Hircan,</hi> ſaid he nothing of any
buſineſs he had with me? When I ſaw him alight, replies the man, I asked him
what he would have. I am lately come out of <hi>Champagn,</hi> replyed he, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to return thither again, I am gotten out of the way, ſo that I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
in vain ſought out an Inne for to bait in, in theſe Quarters. You are very
ill directed, ſaid I to him, Do you think to lodge here? Do you not know that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43725:180"/>
this is a Gentlemans houſe, and not an Inne? Notwithſtanding theſe words, he
ſticked not to tye his horſe up to a Lattice and give him ſome hay, which he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
up and down near the ſtable; and very faintly made this reply, Since it
is a Gentlemans houſe, it is better for me then if it were an Inne. I am every
day honourably received at Princes tables, and therefore your Maſter will be
glad of my company, and I deſire you only to acquaint him that <hi>Muſardan</hi> is
here, that name is ſufficiently known all over <hi>Europe;</hi> they that know it not
muſt needs be ſuch as have not forgotten their pap. Having told me ſo I thought
beſt not to diſpute with him any further, but rather to make haſte up to acquaint
you with his coming: but becauſe he followed me very cloſely, I entreated him
to ſtay at the ſtair-foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I believe he does ſtill. You will find it is ſome Maſter
Fool I warrant you, ſayes <hi>Clarimond.</hi> Do not ſay ſo, replyes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> art thou
come hither again to ſpight me, and quarrel with all good people that ſhall
come to me? If this <hi>Muſardan</hi> be he I mean, he is one of the moſt excellent
men of this age. I will go and entertain him upon your commendation, ſayes
<hi>Hircan.</hi> He went preſently to this man, who had a cloak and breeches of black
Serge, with a doublet of Dowlaſs, foul enough in conſcience, ſo that the perſon
ſeemed not to be of any great qualitie.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Muſardan</hi> ſeeing <hi>Hircan</hi> coming to him, made a low congie, and ſaluted
him with this complement, which he had ſtudied before. <q>I crave your pardon
Sir, ſaid he to him, that I have preſumed to give you a viſit ſo privately; for I
beleive, that ſince you may not at any time ſee thoſe labours of my mind
which I have put forth a while ſince, I may alſo be permitted to ſee you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He thought he had done wonders in diſcovering himſelf by this diſcourſe, that
he was an Author of the Times; but <hi>Hircan</hi> made him this return. 'Tis true
indeed Sir, that you have a priviledge to viſit when you pleaſe all thoſe that have
ſeen your excellent Works, and that they are every one obliged to entertain you
once at leaſt, ſo that if you will you need never eat at home; and I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
that though the Books I think you ſpeak of, never came to my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
yet ſhall I be one of thoſe who think themſelves not the leaſt honoured
to ſee you at their table.</p>
            <p>Though this anſwer was full of ſecret Satyre, and touched this Paraſite with
his impudence, yet he reſolved to accept what was proffered him. He told <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
alſo that he was out of his way, but that he was happy in the misfortune
that had procured him ſo noble an acquaintance. <hi>Hircan</hi> without any farther
ceremonie, deſired him to walk up, and ſent a Lacquey to the ſtable to ſee his
horſe provided for. When he was come into the dining room, he was ſomewhat
put out of countenance to find ſo many there. Here is a man knows you very
well by reputation, ſayes <hi>Hircan</hi> to him, pointing at <hi>Lyſis;</hi> he hath read the
Books you have put out. This is then the <hi>Muſardan</hi> I ſpoke of, ſayes <hi>Lyſis</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
let me embrace him, let me kiſs him; he is my dear friend though he ſay
nothing of Shepherdry in all his books. In ſaying this, <hi>Lyſis</hi> embraced him about
the neck, and <hi>Muſardan</hi> told him he was much obliged to him that he had
vouchſafed to look on his Works. After this <hi>Lyſis</hi> turned to his companions,
and ſaid to them, run Shepherds and ſalute this excellent wit. There are above
eighteen books that bear his name, and they are all Love ſtories. O the rare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity!
cryed out <hi>Phyliris,</hi> he teaches us to govern our ſelves amidſt the violent
flames of that nobleſt paſſion, which ſeizeth our ſouls. Why are not all that
live in <hi>France</hi> like him! Ignorance ſhould then be baniſhed the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The other Shepherds made ſome ſuch like exclamations in ſaluting him, ſo
that it heightned him into an inſupportable vanitie, and made him believe he had
already obtained the general approbation. <hi>Hircan</hi> commanded a ceſſation of
theſe complements, and that all ſhould ſit down to table according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
qualities. <hi>Lyſis</hi> whoſe memory was very much taken up with the cuſtoms of
Antiquitie, ſaid he did not think fit they ſhould ſit all about the table, but only
on one ſide, and leave the other for the Steward and waiters. He wiſhed alſo
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43725:181"/>
they were laid on beds to eat, and not ſit on chairs; and his deſign was that they
ſhould not go to the table, but that it ſhould be brought to them, and taken
away when they had done. 'Tis very convenient indeed to lie on a bed and eat, ſays
<hi>Hircan,</hi> for a man hath this advantage at leaſt, that if he be drunk, he is in a good
place to ſleep. But if we ſhould now get Workmen to make tables and beds as
<hi>Lyſis</hi> would have them, we might ſtarve before they were done. Wherefore let
us now fall to dinner, another time we'l think on't.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> made no reply at all, becauſe he inſenſibly fell into another thought.
He thought <hi>Muſardan</hi> to be a very good Author, and was in doubt whether it
were not better give him his Hiſtory to compoſe then to <hi>Philiris,</hi> of whoſe elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
he had experience only in his diſcourſe, and had no tryal of his Elegance,
which is a thing requiſite to write well. At length, to look further into the man,
then he could diſcover by his books, he thought it not amiſs to ask him whether
he had not ſeen the Letter he had ſent to <hi>Paris,</hi> directed to all Poets and Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſts.
<hi>Muſardan</hi> replyed, that his friend the <hi>Fabuliſtus</hi> had ſpoke to him of a
Letter ſent from an unknown Shepherd, but that he had not ſhewed it him. Then
it ſeems you are not come hither purpoſely to ſee me, replyes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that <hi>Fabuliſtus</hi> whom you ſpeak of, though he be as great a <hi>Poet</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manciſt</hi>
as your ſelf, as his works ſpeak him; yet it ſeems according to what you
ſay, he thought very indifferently of my Letter, ſince he hath not communicated
it. By this I perceive you are not of that company of <hi>Pariſians</hi> who are to come
hither and turn Shepherds; you ſhould have ſhewn others the way, and you
give me occaſion to remit of that good eſteem I had of you. You ſee all that
are about me clad in white, they are Shepherds, ſuch as I would have you to be
alſo.</p>
            <p>The Shepherds to comply with <hi>Lyſis,</hi> confeſſed they were all of that happy
condition he attributed to them; and to make the better ſport, they fell into the
moſt extravagant diſcourſes they could imagine. Their talk was like that of their
late comedies, unleſs it were that they changed their ſtile oftener, and that the
ſame Shepherd ſpoke ſometimes by <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Gallimathias. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liris,</hi>
who read bad books as well as good, had had the patience to read <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſardans,</hi>
and picked out the ridiculous abſurdities; ſo that having a good memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
he ſpoke only in the expreſſions of that Author, which was the beſt humour
of all. 'Twas not to give his words any other ſenſe, they were ridiculous enough
of themſelves, without any addition. <hi>Muſardan</hi> was nothing moved at it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he took no notice of it, or was proud to hear himſelf quoted.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Fontenay,</hi> after he had a long time beheld <hi>Pern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lla</hi> with a languiſhing
eye, he renewed his diſcourſes of the deſperate Lover, whereat <hi>Adrian</hi> and ſhe
were not well pleaſed; but yet ſuffered all, as being fully reſolved to be gone the
next day. <hi>Clarimond</hi> having obſerved the divers poſtures of thoſe Shepherds,
thought them ſuch as he could not bear with, ſo that he was not able to contain
himſelf any longer. He told <hi>Hircan</hi> that he thought their deſign was to play
the fools perpetually at this houſe, but that it was now time to break up the
enchantment, ſince they both abuſed thoſe that knew them and that knew them
not; and that for concluſion of the Comedie, <hi>Lyſis</hi> muſt be convinced of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
What errours doeſt thou mean? ſayes <hi>Lyſis:</hi> ever ſince I have known you
I have done nothing elſe but told you of them, replyes <hi>Clarimond,</hi> I mean thoſe
imaginations which the <hi>Romances</hi> have infuſed into you. Its now time you ſhake
hands with them. Thou art then it ſeems the ſame <hi>Clarimond</hi> who contemneſt
the inventions of good Authors, replyes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I am glad <hi>Muſardan</hi> is come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo ſeaſonably. He ſhall maintain his companions quarrel and his own. I have
often promiſed thee that when we met with any able wit of the age, I would give
thee leave to ſay what ever thou canſt againſt the books which thou doeſt ſo much
hate, that thou mayeſt be confuted and confounded by one that can tell how to
anſwer thee. I do now take you at your word, ſayes <hi>Clarimond.</hi> I will ſet upon
all your <hi>Fabuliſts</hi> both ancient and modern, we cannot chooſe a fitter time then
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43725:181"/>
now that we are in the moſt honourable Aſſembly in the world. For my part
I take <hi>Anſelm</hi> for our Judge. Be it ſo ſayes <hi>Lyſis,</hi> he is an indifferent perſon, he
is not prejudiced for either partie.</p>
            <p>Every one having heard this controverſie which was newly riſen, all endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to advance it by approving it, that that excellent reſolution of a fair and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
diſpute, might not be loſt. <hi>Clarimond</hi> endeavoured nothing ſo much as to
ſhew his reaſons why he hated <hi>Romances</hi> and <hi>Poetrie:</hi> and as for <hi>Muſardan,</hi> they
bid him prepare himſelf to anſwer what might be ſaid againſt his <hi>Profeſſion</hi> He
was ſo vainglorious as to promiſe full ſatisfaction in all things: and as for <hi>Anſelm,</hi>
though he would not confeſs himſelf able to diſcharge what was ſaid upon him,
yet was he forced to undertake it. They diſpatched dinner out of eagerneſs after
the pleaſure to hear the pleading of two ſuch famous caſes as now preſented

                        <p>WEre there remaining in the world but a confuſ'd memory only of all the
fabulous Books which antiquity brought forth, and that there could be
ſeen but the Titles of them ſome where, I ſhould have no cauſe to quarrel with
a thing whoſe miſchief expired with the age that bred it, and did not ſurvive to
injure this: But when I conſider that the moſt abſurd imaginations and <hi>reſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
of the world have outlived thoſe that believed them as articles of faith,
and have been tranſmitted to us though our Religion condemns them, I can
not contain my ſelf, but muſt openly diſcover how little reaſon men have to
hold ſo many impertinences for Oracles. The miſchief they do, ought to
make the greater impreſſion on us, when we find that theſe ancient follies do
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43725:182"/>
not only gain eſteem, but men make it their daily imployment to invent others
in imitation of them. And this is the reaſon, why (out of a deſire to ſerve the
publick, and eſpecially ſome particular men who pleaſe themſelves in reading
or compoſing ſuch things) I have undertaken to acquaint them how they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend
their time, and what impertinences they are to meet with in <hi>Romances</hi>
and <hi>Poetry.</hi> He who would diſcourſe of all the ancient Poets, would not in
one day ſee the end of his labour; I muſt therefore encounter only with the
moſt famous among them and in the firſt place bring <hi>Homer</hi> on the Stage, who
is called Prince of the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets: A man needs do no more then read his
<hi>Iliads</hi> and his <hi>Odyſſes</hi> to find all the fopperies imaginable amaſs'd together. I
will not taxe him with the overturning of the whole <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and whereas it
is held that the <hi>Trojans</hi> overcame the <hi>Grecians,</hi> he hath feigned that the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
overcame the <hi>Trojans,</hi> to honour his own Country; but there's ſo much
to be ſaid againſt him, that that may be abated: Let all his Works be read,
and there will be found leſs invention in them then in thoſe of your old
Knights of the <hi>round Table.</hi> The whole ſubject of the <hi>Iliads</hi> is briefly this,
That <hi>Briſeis</hi> being forced away from <hi>Achilles,</hi> he ſtaid all alone in his Ship, and
would go no more to the Wars, during which time the <hi>Trojans</hi> made ſeveral

                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> upon the <hi>Grecians,</hi> wherein the <hi>Grecians</hi> being put to the worſt, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
themſelves to that ſon of <hi>Peleus,</hi> who would not bear arms till his friend
<hi>Patroclus</hi> was dead he after this kils <hi>Hector</hi> in a duel, and having faſtn'd his body
behind his Chariot, drew it up and down through the Camp. Though this name
of <hi>Iliad</hi> ſeems to promiſe an entire relation of the ſiege of <hi>Ilium,</hi> which is a
Fort, by which was meant the whole City; we find in <hi>Homer</hi> neither the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
nor ending thereof; and if we had it not from other Poets, we ſhould
have known nothing. 'Twas a ſtrange want of judgement not to put down nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the cauſes nor progreſs of ſo great alterations: 'twould not have coſt
him much; he had no more to do then to bring it in by way of relation from
ſome old Captains to one new come into the Service: So that whereas we
now can hardly underſtand what was done in two or three months of the War,
we ſhould then have been acquainted with the actions of ten years and above,
for he ſaies the ſiege of <hi>Troy</hi> laſted ſo long, which ſo embroyles our minds,
that we cannot imagin how both ſides ſhould ſtand it out ſo long, and what no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
adventures paſt between them. it had been better <hi>Homer</hi> had made it his
buſineſs to tell us that, ſo to leave a perfect work, then to have undertaken
that of the <hi>Odyſſeys.</hi> But all this ſignifies not much, for it may be ſaid he died
in his deſignes, or that ſome of his works have been loſt; we muſt therefore
be content that he hath left us any thing worth our notice. Inſtead of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into <hi>Olympus</hi> the war of his imaginary Gods fighting among themſelves,
he brings them fighting amongſt men. He makes them rail at one another,
and commit ſuch palpable impertinences, that I know not how the <hi>Grecians</hi>
that did adore them, could poſſibly ſuffer him. He makes the Gods carefull
and tender only of the <hi>Trojans</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> as if there were no more people
in the world. They never ſpeak of any other Nations, whereof there were no
ſmall number on earth and whom they were equally obliged to protect. But
though they are only troubled to make thoſe two peoples fight, and ever and
anon have their Aſſemblies to that purpoſe, and are as many for one ſide as
the other, yet have they not the wit to reconcile the difference, and prevent the
ruine of the moſt ſignal Heroes in the Camp. Do you think it a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for men to ſee <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> quarrelling every foot, when they were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and ſiſter, husband and wife? Is it not a fine tale that <hi>Jupiter</hi> tels that
Goddeſs, when to threaten her, he asks her whether ſhe had forgotten the time
that being angry with her, he hanged her up in the air with two anvils at her
feet? Was it not a fine ſight to ſee her in that poſture, was it not an invention
worthy a God? 'Twas indeed an expedient to make his wife longer by a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43725:183"/>

As for the Ornaments of this <hi>Iliad,</hi> you will find them all of a barrel, and
that <hi>Homer</hi> convers'd with no other Poetical figures then ſimilitudes; ſo that he
could not expreſs the leaſt engagement or ſcuffle of the Army, but by one;
but that which is moſt ridiculous is, that they are all of a ſort. You will find
that a man that's mortally wounded and falls to the ground, is every where
compared to a Tree blown down by the wind, or cut down with an axe; and
what is yet more tedious is, that in every page almoſt, you ſhall find ſome He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes
furiouſly aſſaulting his enemies, ever compared to ſome wild beaſt rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
among a flock of ſheep, or a bird of prey, purſuing or devouring the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer

of four hundred and better, I'll deſire no credit be given to ought I ſay. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
theſe there are others which are not ſo frequent, yet are they the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertnent
in the world. The <hi>Grecians</hi> marching in battalia are compared to
Cranes which flie in Troops; and in a certain place where they make a great
noiſe about <hi>Sarpedon</hi> who had been put to death, they are compared to flies
buzzing about the milk-pans and the cheeſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and loathſomeſt compariſon that could be. Thoſe who drew one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who ſhould have <hi>Patroclus</hi>'s body, are compared to the prentices of a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
liquoring an oxe-hide to make it ſupple, and pulling it with their nails to
ſtretch it. As for <hi>Homers</hi> language, it muſt be conceived the <hi>Greek</hi> is not too
pure or elegant, for that ſeven Cities ſtrove whoſe Citizen he ſhould be, was
only becauſe he made uſe of ſo many different dialects, ſo that it could never
be judged what Countrey-man he was; and I only leave it to be judg'd what
grace it were in one of our Poets, for to make up his rimes and cadences, to
huddle together, with the pure French, the expreſſions and phraſes of <hi>Gaſcony,
Picardy, Champaigne,</hi> and <hi>Normandy.</hi> And yet this Prince of the <hi>Greek</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
who hath done what's as bad, muſt yet carry away the general eſteem; yet
I ſhall be told that ſome very famous Authours have thought their diſcourſes
ſingularly adorned when they made uſe of ſomewhat of his; whereas if a
man ask them why they commend him, they will tell you, becauſe he is fraught
with ſentences; but what ſentences are they doe you think? They are, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,

that can ſpeak can do it as well, for reaſon dictates as much to us, word for
word, without ſeeking to Philoſophy, though a mans language know nothing
of the flowers of Rhetorick. There are a many that make uſe of examples
drawn out of <hi>Homer</hi> as moral and political diſcourſes, as to ſay that <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
wiſhed he had ten <hi>Neſtors,</hi> that <hi>Diomedes</hi> had but one companion to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
an enterpriſe. They apply that diverſly to their purpoſes; but
what commendation can ariſe to him hence? Is there any thing ſo miraculous
in all this? Are not the leaſt things in the world applicable thus? It will
be inculcated again, that if <hi>Homer</hi> be not to be eſteemed for his language,
he ſhould be for the excellent precepts he gives Souldiers; and that the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi>

that <hi>Heſiod,</hi> who treated of Countrey-affairs, was only a Poet for the

among <hi>Darius</hi>'s Gods a rich Cabinet, <hi>Alexander</hi> thought nothing worthier to
be put into it then <hi>Homers Iliads,</hi> which he had ever under his pillow; but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
this ſtory to be true, I ſay the book is never the better for it, and that if
that Prince made ſuch uſe of it, it was for want of other books: For is there
any likelyhood that he who was ſo great a Captain, ſhould ſo highly eſteem
diſcourſes of Warr written by a man that was never in any, and ſpeaks of Arms
with as much impertinence, as that a School-boy that were at this time to write
a Romance, could not poſſibly commit ſo many faults of judgement: Can
there be any greater then to make his Heroes relate long ſtories on their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogies,
or ſome other as trivial diſcourſe, in the heat of the battel, when it
ſhould be conceived they had not time to breath, and that the reſt who were in
the ſcufflle had not the leaſure to hear them? Is there any thing in the world
more ridiculous then that combat between <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Hector,</hi> which was fought
with a great preparation in ſight of both Armies? Theſe two valiant Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
having broke a Lance or two, fell to throw ſtones at one another, and
preſently the Herald came and ſeparated them, fearing they ſhould come to
diſpute the buſineſs with their ſwords: Is it not a pleaſant combat to make
ſuch a noiſe in the world as it does? Is it not another fair impertinence in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
engagement, to make <hi>Helenus</hi> who perceived that the <hi>Trojans</hi> had the
worſe, go and bid <hi>Hector</hi> charge <hi>Hecuba</hi> to pray to the Goddeſs <hi>Minerva?</hi>
why did he not go to her himſelf, he who was a Prophet? Was there any
reaſon that great Captain ſhould leave his Souldiers to go upon a meſſage
which any boy belonging to the Army might do as well? and yet <hi>Hector</hi> was
ſuch a cockſcombe as to return to <hi>Troy,</hi> where he trifles away a deal of time
to talk with his wife, and play with his ſon, while the <hi>Grecians</hi> committed a
great ſlaughter on their enemies. <hi>Alexander</hi> was too great a wit to think well
of this, and I could never imagin he could eſteem himſelf more unhappy then
<hi>Achilles,</hi> becauſe he had not ſo good a voice to ſing his praiſes, ſince he could
not but know that if his conqueſts had been as fabulouſly deſcribed as the
ſiege of <hi>Troy,</hi> the world would not have believed the leaſt part of them. That
he cauſed a City to be built to the honour of <hi>Homer,</hi> there's not ſo much glory
in it as it conceived, ſince he built another to the honour of his horſe. This
Poet hath nothing that can any way entertain great minds: He makes Heroes
do things mean and unworthy, they turn the ſpit, boyle the pot, and they are
ſuch gluttons, that to ſtir them up to their duty, their Captains are to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
to them that they ſhall have the beſt bits at the Feaſts, and their Goblets
full. It may be alſo eaſily obſerved that honeſt <hi>Homer</hi> hath not obſerved any
decorum at all: and if we will paſs into the <hi>Odyſſeys,</hi> we ſhall that when
<hi>Vlyſſes</hi> was to depart the Iſland, where <hi>Calipſo</hi> retained him, that Nymph makes
him build his own ſhip, as if ſhe who was ſo powerfull could not have found
ſome other to have taken that pains inſtead of her Lover. But 'tis true, he
was not only a Carpenter, but a Joyner too, for he had made in her houſe a
fine bed-ſtead, having no other tool but a pair of Ciſſers, as he makes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to his wife at his return.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Odyſſeys</hi> are fraught with nothing but abſurdities, and that <hi>Vlyſſes</hi>
whoſe travels are deſcribed in it, is ſuch a ſimple fellow, that hearing a certain
Poet ſing the Wars of <hi>Troy,</hi> at the relation whereof he ſhould have rejoyced,
ſince he had gotten great fame there, he could never refrain weeping; and
yet his Hoſt <hi>Alcinous</hi> is ſo well ſatisfied with his perſon, though he had been
found naked as a worm at the river ſide, that the very firſt day he asks him
whether he will be his ſon in law: But 'tis true, he makes the propoſition
very pleaſantly, and ſhews how little he deſires it ſhould take effect; for he
tels him at the ſame time, that if he have no mind to ſtay any longer, he
will give him a Veſſel to be gone.</p>
               <p>There are the like viſible lowneſſes all through that Book, nothing that's
noble or generous. This <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> tels fooliſh tales to his Swine-herd: he asks
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43725:184"/>
an alms of his wife, and fights with a beggar. One of <hi>Penelope</hi>'s Suiters tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him he ſhould have his ſhare as well as the reſt, he caſt an oxe-hoof at his
head; and if the good man be to relate any thing, he weeps exceſſively; and
the reaſon why he gives over talking is (ſaies he) <hi>that it might not be thought it
was the wine that made him weep.</hi> I know no reaſon why that <hi>Pallas,</hi> who was
ſo ſtrong of his ſide, ſhould not reſtore him to his poſſeſſions, without ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him to commit ſo many ſimplicities. From all this it may be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that <hi>Homer</hi> who was the author of all this, was but a Bagpiper, that beg'd
his bread from dore to dore, and would needs deſcribe ſome part of his own
beggery, under the name of a Prince. But if you think I paſs over any noble
inventions that may be found in the <hi>Odyſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> let us now conſider if they art
worth the mentioning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> was in <hi>Sicily</hi> when <hi>Polyphemus</hi> devoured three of his companions,
he told him his name was <hi>Nobody,</hi> ſo that having ſtruck out his eye, when <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemus</hi>
cry'd our, and the other Cyclop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> running to him, had asked who had
done him that miſchief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he could make them no anſwer but <hi>Nobody,</hi> whereat
they laught, thinking he had made himſelf blind. This is a tale ſo fond and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
that Country people are able to make as good; and I aſſure you
that ancient ſervant-maids of this Country have one in imitation of this, that is
far more ingenious. As concerning <hi>Circe</hi> the Sorcereſs into whole Palace <hi>Vlyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
comes, I wonder how he could meet with men ſo blunt, as to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this fable had any thing in it, becauſe by the <hi>Grecians</hi> chang'd into ſwine,
are repreſented the voluptuous; and by <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> who kept himſelf from that
charm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the vertuous and diſcreet perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but there is a ſecret in this which ever
any Author was troubled with; <hi>Homer</hi> ſaies that <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> lay with <hi>Circe</hi> a whole
year together: Is this the rare example of continence that your Mythologiſts
find here; Were thoſe who had but drunk of a pleaſant poiſon, more blamable then
he that had committed adultery with a ſorcereſs? The Poet deſirous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to take occaſion to make the ſhades of the dead, do ſomewhat in their
turn, makes it be told <hi>Circe</hi> that <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> muſt go to hell to ſpeak with the divine
<hi>Tireſias,</hi> to know how he ſhould preſerve himſelf as he went into his Country,
as if ſhe who was daughter to the Sun, and a knowing ſorcereſs, could not have
done him a courteſie in that point; but there is beſides herein a notable imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency:
for without all theſe ceremonies the ſilly fool might have as eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to <hi>Ithacia,</hi> as traverſe a ſnacious Sea that brought him into the Countrey
of the <hi>Cimmerians,</hi> a horrid and folitary paſſage, through which he was to go
into hell.</p>
               <p>Thus are there an infinity of ſuperfluous things in the <hi>Odyſſes,</hi> as well as in the
<hi>Iliad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>s</hi> is forewarned of his death by his horſe, which might have
been brought about ſome other way, without making a beaſt ſpeak.</p>
               <p>As for the adventure of the <hi>Syren's,</hi> was it neceſſary that this <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> who was
ſo wiſe a man, ſhould be bound to keep him from going to them? As for the
principal occaſion of the Hiſtory that mentions the young Lovers of <hi>Penelope,</hi>
who wooed her with ſo much beat; I find that too, extreamly impertinent; for
ſhe having a ſon of age to beat arms, and twenty years being paſſed over ſince,
muſt needs be at leaſt forty years of age, ſo that ſhe could not raiſe ſuch paſſion
as <hi>Homer</hi> would make us believe.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing may be in a manner ſaid of <hi>Helen,</hi> when ſhe had continued
ten years in a City full of deſolation, her beauty muſt needs be decayed, and
that might take away much of the eagerneſs of having her in poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Now I have told you all that lies open to cenſure in this Poet; its time I
ſpeak of <hi>Virgil,</hi> who without diſpute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is more polite, as having converſed with
great one, yet is he no more cenſure-proof then the other. I meddle not with
his <hi>Aeglogues,</hi> nor yet with his <hi>Georgicks,</hi> for 'tis not there he hath moſt ſhew'd
himſelf a <hi>Poet,</hi> and fallen into fabulous narrations. We muſt paſs immediately
to the <hi>Aeneids,</hi> and to ſhew you it deſerves not the reputation it hath obtained,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43725:184"/>
beſides that the chaſte <hi>Dido</hi> is there innocently calumniated, and that there
is a huge error in the Chronologie, in regard <hi>Aeneas</hi> could not go to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
which was not built in two hundred years after the taking of <hi>Troy;</hi> I
declare to you that there is not in that piece any thing of invention that may
ſurprize an ordinary mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aeneas</hi> being toſſed up and down at ſea, <hi>Juno</hi> promiſes <hi>Aeolus</hi> a wife
on condicion he perform her will, as ſhe promiſes one to <hi>Somnus</hi> in the
<hi>Iliad. Aeneas</hi> relates to <hi>Dido</hi> the taking of <hi>Troy</hi> with the ſtratagem of the
woodden horſe, which was an invention abſurd enough; but we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
this Author, ſince it is borrowed of <hi>Homer,</hi> who mentions it in his <hi>Odyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
He afterward gives an account of his Voyage, and how he eſcaped the
Gulfs of <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi> as <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> had done. If that <hi>Grecian</hi> took a
journey to hell, this <hi>Trojan</hi> muſt do the like; all that I wonder at is, how
they met not there.</p>
               <p>The exerciſes which were at the Anniverſary of <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> were the ſame
which were at <hi>Patroclus</hi>'s death. <hi>Juturna</hi> helps <hi>Turnus</hi> in the fight, and
<hi>Venus</hi> aſſiſts <hi>Aeneas,</hi> for the Gods are no leſs concerned in all theſe affairs
then in thoſe of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War. To quote yet a more ſtudied imitation,
as <hi>Thetis</hi> gave her ſon a buckler made by <hi>Vulcan, Venus</hi> gives her ſon one. I
forgot erewhile to ſpeak of this <hi>buckler,</hi> though it be one of <hi>Homers</hi> moſt
egregious impertinences, becauſe I would mention it with that of <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
that ſo I might compare them together. In the Buckler of <hi>Thetis</hi>'s ſon, the
heavens were repreſented, with all the ſignes of the <hi>Zodiack, Vulcan</hi> had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
therein two different Cities, in the one there was nothing ſeen but feaſting,
dancing, and marriages; and in the midſt of the Aſſembly might there be ſeen
two Councellers pleading before the Judges; one ſaid he had ſatisfied the debt,
the other proteſted he had received nothing; and at length they agreed the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
ſhould be referred to arbitration, and the people ery'd out that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
it ſhould be ſo. The other City was all in arms, by reaſon of the many
factions among the Inhabitants; ſome lay in ambuſh near a River, where the
herds came to be watered, ſaies <hi>Homer,</hi> and as two Shepherds came near play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on their pipes, they ruſhed on them, and having killed them, carryed away
their oxen and their ſheep. This tumult being heard, there came others on
horſeback to fight the enemy; <hi>Vulcan</hi> had beſides made on this Buckler a
Harveſt and a Vintage, with ſome other conceits which I mention not. But was
not this an excellent piece of ſculpture? This comes nearer a true Hiſtory
then a Picture; and as <hi>Homer</hi> deſcribes it, it is to be believed that all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
he ſpeaks of marched in the buckler, and fought one with another, and
talked ſo loud that you might have heard them. There was no leſs want of
judgement in that of <hi>Aeneas. Virgil</hi> would perſwade us that <hi>Vulcan</hi> had
incloſed in it the whole fate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and thus he repreſents it to
us: He ſaies there was ſeen in it the ſhee-Wolfe that ſuckled the twins, and
<hi>Rome</hi> at a little diſtance, where the <hi>Sabine</hi> Virgins were raviſhed. There was
alſo repreſented the Warre between the two peoples, and then their agreement
before the Altar of <hi>Jupiter; P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rſenna</hi> there beſieged the City; <hi>Cocles</hi> cauſes
a bridg to be broken under him. <hi>Cloelia</hi> croſſed the <hi>Tyber</hi> on horſeback:
<hi>Manlius</hi> ſtoutly defended the Capitoll; the Geeſe awoke the ſleeping Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels.</p>
               <p>The Poet deſcribes all theſe things as if they had hapned all of a day. I
would fain know how all this could be repreſented in the ſame place. For old
<hi>Rome</hi> who <hi>Romulus</hi> founded, was nothing like what it was in the time of the
<hi>Gaules:</hi> Beſides that, it muſt needs be very hard to repreſent a City ſometimes
full of mirth, ſometimes of war, ſometimes beſieged by the <hi>Etruſei,</hi> ſometimes
by the <hi>Gaules.</hi> All theſe divers faces of affairs cannot be at once deſcribed;
and <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeaks of ſo many particulars, that to make them be underſtood
clearly, as he relates them; there muſt of neceſſity have been above fifty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43725:185"/>
in the buckler, like ſo many ſeveral pictures to repreſent the different
conditions of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome other affair which paſſed at ſome
diſtance; but <hi>Virgil</hi> never troubled his thoughts with any ſuch order. It may
be now ſeen how well he hath thrived in imitating his predeceſſor; and if there
were an exact inquiſition made, it will be found that other places lie as open to
cenſure. He ſaies <hi>Vulcan</hi> forged a Thunderbolt which conſiſted of three
parts of rain, three of a moiſt cloud, three of fire, and three of a ſouth-wind.
Is it not a huge abſurdity to make a Smith work in moiſt things? This cannot
be pardoned him, unleſs it be anſwered that he is conformable to the other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
who ſpeak diverſly of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> that the Gods have nothing which
comes not through his hands. He makes their Arms, he makes them Jewels
inriched with divers precious ſtones, he furniſhes them with Chariots, and he
builds them houſes, ſo that at this rate it can never be diſcovered whether he
be an Armorer, a Goldſmith, a Carpenter, or a Maſon?</p>
               <p>And thus is <hi>Virgil</hi> wanting alſo, as to the diſtinguiſhing of things: nor can
I learn what age <hi>Aſcanius</hi> was of when his Father went into <hi>Italy,</hi> for though
the Poet ordinarily ſpeaks of him as a child to be carried in ones arms, yet he
attributes (very undecently) as much ſtrength and valour unto him as to his
Father. Moreover he finds us more work when he ſpeaks of the Golden
branch about which the Mythologiſts have ſweated ſo much; he ſaies that
that branch is like the Miſſeltoe that grows on Oaks; it muſt be then no ſmall
trouble to know what it is, ſince it muſt be conceived to be infallibly the
Miſſeltoe it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ovid</hi> ſhall come next this Poet; as being his contemporary, and I ſhall
only quote his Book of <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> which is his Maſterpiece. His only
deſigne in that Book was, to faggot together all the fables which his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
had invented; and if he added any thing not written before, they
were only old Tales he had learned of the Spinſters in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I oppoſe againſt all the Divinities he there mentions, that little Treatiſe
of mine, called the <hi>Banquet of the Gods,</hi> which I believe my Judge hath
read, and divers in this company; and as for his ſeveral tranſmutations, I
have already made them ridiculous enough by the diſcourſes I have divers
times made upon them in ſo many places, that there's none here preſent
can pretend ignorance. Yet I ſhal add thus much, that though the Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
be nothing but an extravagance, yet it is not ſo much to be found fault with
when there is a pertinent reaſon given thereof, as to ſay that ſuch a Lover
was Metamorphoſed into an hour-glaſs, becauſe he ſhould have no more reſt
after his death then he had before; but to make a man be changed into I know
not what Tree, and bring in no occaſion that carries any likelyhood of ſuch
a thing, then is it a thing below contempt.</p>
               <p>Now you ſhall find that <hi>Ovid</hi> fails in this particular almoſt every where;
and for to quote his incongruities, a man muſt quote the whole book: I
will only touch at that which ſeems to be moſt ſolid, and fulleſt of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.
I come to the Metempſychoſis, or tranſmigration of ſouls he would
ſpeak of. He puts down, That <hi>Pythagorus</hi> ſaid that he had ſometimes been
<hi>Euphorbas,</hi> and that in the Temple of <hi>Juno</hi> he knew again the Buckler he had
uſed in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Warr: But how comes it that this impertinence hath
been ſuffered and he not laught at? I will not reproach it unto him, that
the tranſmigration of ſouls out of one body into another is a falſhood; we
will forgive theſe opinions in Heathen Poets; but on condition they bring
ſome colour for their lies, and not ſuffer them to lie open to contradictions.</p>
               <p>Now here's a manifeſt one, not only in <hi>Ovid,</hi> but alſo in all thoſe who
ſecond him in the ſame opinion: For they affirm that the God <hi>Mercury</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſend away the ſouls that were in hell, to aſſume new bodies, makes
them drink of the river of oblivion, that having loſt all memory of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
they had ſuffered in the world before, they ſhould make no difficulty
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43725:185"/>
return thither. It may be infer'd hence, that <hi>Pythagorus</hi> could not call to
mind the parts he had plaid before, and if he could have done ſo, I would
have asked him why others had not the ſame priviledg. I queſtion not but the
chiefeſt glory <hi>Ovid</hi> can pretend to is, to have knit together ſo many ſeveral
Narrations: But in ſpight of all the Pedants from whom I have heard that
ſaid ever ſince I was a child, I will maintain that couching of them, to be
the moſt impertinent thing in that Poet: He that will fill a book with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ſtories, ought to obſerve ſome order through his work; as for example,
he ſhould follow the Chronology, or treat of every thing according to the
ſeveral heads which he divides his books into; but <hi>Ovid</hi> hath done no ſuch
thing. His ſtories do naturally and inſenſibly ariſe out of the Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
they are nailed one to another; and 'tis eaſily ſeen he rather wanders then
follows a direct line, ſo that there's no memory ever ſo great and happy,
which reading his book, muſt not loſe the occaſion of the diſcourſe where it
is once interrupted. Some Metamorphoſis having hapned, there chances to
be ſomebody that relates a thing as ſtrange as that, and after his narration,
the Author introduces ſomewhat of his own, and then thinks himſelf obliged
to ſpeak of what had fallen out before in all that Countrey where this was
done. To be ſhort, his method is ſo unſatisfactory, that I could never read
his book but I pittied him, and all thoſe blind people that eſteem him.</p>
               <p>There were ſome other <hi>Latine</hi> Poets of his time, but they are not very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
or they have left behind them nothing but <hi>Odes</hi> and <hi>Epigrams,</hi> which
do us no hurt.</p>
               <p>I come forward to the <hi>Italian</hi> Poets. There's <hi>Arioſto</hi> hath made a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi>
that's peſtered with moſt abſurd inventions. His Fable is an imitation
of thoſe of the Knights errants, and yet it contains many things taken out
of <hi>Ovids</hi> Metamorphoſis. The flying horſe of <hi>Aſtolphus</hi> is the <hi>Pegaſus</hi> of
<hi>Perſeus,</hi> and both thoſe Warriers relieve a young Virgin expos'd to a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
Any one may find other relations: Beſides, the order is ſo disjoynted,
that there's above fifty ſtories heaped one on another. The Authour at ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight times finiſhes them, and will leave you two Knights with their
ſwords lifted up ready to ſtrike, to go and ſee what another does; and then
he returns to them and makes them exchange two or three blows, and then
leaves them again.</p>
               <p>Thus does he make us languiſh after his fooleries, and his Knights are
tranſported from one Countrey into another with as much ſpeed as if their
horſes had wings.</p>
               <p>As concerning <hi>Taſſo,</hi> we are as much beholding to him as to <hi>Arioſto,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
turn'd our Hiſtory into a Fable. This laſt hath made it equiſitely imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent;
for though he be obliged to ſpeak as a Chriſtian in his <hi>Jeruſalem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd;</hi>
yet he makes nothing to talk as a Pagan, and bring all the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
divinities on the Stage. There are a many more who have thus made a
confuſion of things without any judgement; but its enough to condemn
them all at once.</p>
               <p>To come up to our own time, I ſhall bring in play the moſt famous Poet
that ever was in <hi>France:</hi> Any one may conceive I mean <hi>Ronſard;</hi> and what
reputation ſoever his works have gotten, I ſhall venture to encounter them.
Let a man conſider his <hi>Sonnets,</hi> his <hi>Poems,</hi> and his <hi>Elegies,</hi> they are all full
of ancient abſurdities; and as for his <hi>Hymnes,</hi> wherein he is thought to have
been moſt fortunate, pitch upon that of the four Seaſons of the year, which
is the moſt eſteem'd becauſe the Fables are moſt of his own invention. The
Father and Mother which he attributes to the winter in one, are not attributed
in another; and thus does he make the Seaſons change parents to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
them to his deſigne. As for his <hi>Franciad,</hi> the ſame things in a manner
may be ſaid againſt it as againſt thoſe other pieces of Poetry we have already
quoted; for if <hi>Virgil</hi> hath imitated <hi>Homer, Ronſard</hi> hath imitated <hi>Virgil</hi> and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43725:186"/>
                  <hi>Homer</hi> together; but the imitation is ſo low and poor, that it will never be
forgiven him. If <hi>Pallas</hi> hides <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> in a cloud when he goes to King
<hi>Alcinous,</hi> and if <hi>Venus</hi> does the like for <hi>Aeneas</hi> when he goes to <hi>Dido, Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard</hi>
muſt needs tell us that that Goddeſs did the ſame favour for <hi>Francus</hi>
when he was to go to King <hi>Diceus,</hi> though he tels us not what neceſſity there
was that that Heros ſhould be ſo hidden. This <hi>Francus</hi> had ſuffered ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
at Sea as well as <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and his good Hoſteſſes muſt needs fall in
love with him: He ſlights them both, though they were very favourable to
him, becauſe he ſtill reflects on the deſtinies who aſſure him he ſhall be the
founder of a new <hi>Troy.</hi> All this <hi>Aeneas</hi> does, and what is yet far more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
for a more punctual imitation of <hi>Homer, Ronſard</hi> cannot make his Heroes
go three ſteps without the command of ſome God. Sometimes <hi>Mercury</hi> muſt
diſguiſe himſelf, ſometimes <hi>Venus;</hi> one while he ſees them in his ſleep, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when he is waking, and a third time he meets with ſome auguries and
predictions, wherein is contained all ſhould happen to him; ſo that when
it comes to paſs, it muſt be repeated once again, nay a third time if there
be any body to relate it to, which is ſo tedious, that it is no ſmall trouble
to read him. Is it not ſtill the ſame invention for want of other? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
would it not have been a rude impertinence among the very Pagans, to
believe that the Gods ſhould ſhift from one place to another ſo ſuddenly to
the relief of a mortal? Theſe Poets never ſuppoſe any addreſſes by prayer
to thoſe whom they have undertaken to honour, but they ſay there was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
thunder heard on the left hand, to aſſure them that <hi>Jupiter</hi> heard them.
Thunder was very common in that time, in any ſeaſon of the year. <hi>Ronſard</hi>
muſt alſo make his compariſons and deſcriptions like thoſe he made his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons;
but though that be a thing hath gotten much eſteem with others, for
my part it loſes with me.</p>
               <p>He makes it a great buſineſs to deſcribe the noiſe of an axe ſtriking againſt
a tree, the great number of boards were ſawen to build Ships, how many
nails were employ'd, and the trouble there was to get theſe great Veſſels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea. This is too mechanical, and I ſhould have wiſhed he had rather
ſtudied to deſcribe mens divers paſſions, and things of greater importance;
it would have been a matter of greater advantage to the Readers. I will not
urge againſt him his lewd rimes. He is ſo conſcientious in point of rime, that
it cannot be judg'd whether <hi>Hectors</hi> ſon was called <hi>Francion</hi> or <hi>Francus;</hi> for,
to anſwer <hi>Vanicus,</hi> he puts ſometimes <hi>Francus,</hi> and to rime <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o? <hi>Nation,</hi> he ſaies
<hi>Francion</hi> I will not tell you that his Verſes are ill form'd, and that there are
faults in the ſyntaxe; I am ſo fair and gentle an adverſary, that I will not take
the utmoſt advantage againſt him. Let us only conſider the deſigne which
<hi>Francus</hi> or <hi>Francion</hi> had to know things to come, which was not to go to hell
for it, but by calling up the ſhades thence, by the means of the Sorcereſs
<hi>Hyantha.</hi> She brings up to him all the Kings of <hi>France</hi> his ſucceſſors, and
thence had <hi>Ronſard</hi> the invention to bring in all our Hiſtory in his <hi>Franciad,</hi>
which though it be a great volume, yet mentions only the firſt race, ſo that
there muſt be two books more as big, for to treat of <hi>Pipin</hi> and <hi>Capet:</hi> That
had been too too long and tedious, and would have carried with it a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
inequality: but what obliged him in the mean time, to mingle our
Hiſtory with his Fables? ſince ſo many Authors have written it, we knew it
well enough, and it would have ſuffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed to ſay, that <hi>Hyantha</hi> related to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
ſon certain actions of <hi>Pharamond, Clodion; Meroveus</hi> and the other Kings.
Does he not ſhew himſelf rather an Hiſtorian then a Poet? If it be objected
that this Sorcereſs was able, word for word, to foretell things to come, and
that conſequently ſhe muſt be made tell them; may not I anſwer, that there
is no likelyhood that a perſon poſſeſſed with divine fury, as this Sorcereſs was,
could deliver her ſelf in ſuch clear tearms, and that with ſuch a conduct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if
ſhe had ſpoken of a thing paſt, whoſe particulars ſhe had by heart. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43725:186"/>
and moſt credible prophecies that ever were, never had any ſuch order,
there is ever ſomewhat of obſcurity, that they which know them, may not
forget themſelves, but acknowledge thoſe have alwayes need of God; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be to explain what they do not fully underſtand, or aſſiſt them to
make that effectual to them which hath been revealed. Beſides all this, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive how it came about that <hi>Hyantha</hi> who was a gentile, ſhould ſpeak
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Church, Baptiſm,</hi> and the contempt of <hi>Idols,</hi> as if ſhe
had been already a Chriſtian; and I wonder how <hi>Francus</hi> whom ſhe ſpoke
to, and who muſt admire theſe ſtrange novelties, ſhould never ask her what
ſhe meant: If <hi>Ronſard</hi> had obtained the penſions he pretended to, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he would have done nobler things. He would have obliged us ſo far as
to bring <hi>Hectors</hi> ſon to the banks of the <hi>Seine,</hi> to build the City of <hi>Paris</hi> to
the memory of his Uncle. 'Twas an excellent imagination to believe that he
would have called his City by the name of a man who had been the ruine of
all their Country and Family; he would rather have called it <hi>Hector. Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard</hi>
had no great reaſon to promote by his Poetry the ridiculous opinion of
ſome fooliſh Chronologers, who would have the <hi>French</hi> deſcend from
this <hi>Francus,</hi> though the name be rather <hi>German</hi> then <hi>Phrygian,</hi> and that it
is not certain that there was a <hi>Hector,</hi> and that <hi>Troy</hi> was ever taken. Since
this Poet, there have been in <hi>France</hi> an infinite number of them of all ſorts; but
ſince their works are but ſmall and inconſiderable, and that without inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any fable, they have only renewed the ancient ones, I ſhall need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſons againſt them, then what I have already alleadged againſt ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as for example, that we muſt permit the ancients to be mad after their
mode; and if we ſhould talk idly in our way, and accommodate our ſelves
to our own times, as they did to theirs, we muſt make the Gods ride in
Coaches or Sedans inſtead of Chariots, and we ſhould feign that <hi>Cupid</hi>
ſhoots at us with a Piſtol, inſtead of an arrow, and the fiction were much
more natural: For ſince it muſt ſet our breaſts a fire, it is much more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that we are wounded with a flaming bullet, then with an arrow, whoſe
head were only of iron or ſome other mettal.</p>
               <p>And thus indeed might the new Poets <hi>tranſlate</hi> and ſet up the ancient Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
againſt which I am briefly to add this, That I find in it no certain rule,
and that I cannot imagin how the Gods ſhould be immortal, ſince there are
ſome of them ſubject to old age. I am alſo to wonder why <hi>Apollo</hi> is ſtill young,
ſince <hi>Saturn</hi> is grown decrepit, and ſince I have heard talk of Gods and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Gods, I could never imagin how any could be half a God.</p>
               <p>The divers Signes which the Poets have placed in the heavens, are no leſs
diſturbance to my thoughts; I ſhould only deſire to know whether there
were any ſtars in the firmament before they writ their Metamorphoſis: But
if any tell me I am too capricious in ſifting of Poetry, and that I am to blame
to endeavour to make it ridiculous, becauſe the fables may haply be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
myſteries, and that there's not any thing which includes not ſome hidden
ſence; I anſwer, That a man may find what he pleaſe by way of <hi>Allegory</hi> in
any relation that is, and that of the ſame ſubject, an inventive mind may
make a thouſand explications; but this evinces not that the Poet had any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
to diſguiſe ſuch excellent truths under his fables; nay though I ſhould
grant that the Poets did purpoſly diſguiſe certain ſecrets, I muſt ſtill never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
deny that any of them did it any thing fortunately. There's too much
confuſion in their fictions, to draw any thing certain out of them. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of a fable a man may light of a piece of <hi>Mythologie,</hi> becauſe a man
may give a thing any face at the firſt ſight; but what follows ſhall have no
acquaintance with it; or if there be any, it will be with a very remarkable
violence.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Homer</hi> ſaies that <hi>Jupiter</hi> embraced <hi>Juno,</hi> and that the ſpring was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
under them; thoſe who endeavour to explain it, ſay, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43725:187"/>
the heaven, and <hi>Juno</hi> the air; and that when the air is warmed by the heat of
the heaven, the earth brings forth plants, as the iſſue of that congreſs. This
explication thus far is eaſily made, but how ſhall it be purſued? Why
ſhould the air bear ſuch a ſpight to the <hi>Trojans?</hi> Why muſt <hi>Neptune</hi> too,
who is the Sea, be their enemy? Is it becauſe <hi>Laomedon</hi> did not pay him his
hire for building their Walls with <hi>Apollo,</hi> who is the Sunne? What an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance
is it to ſay that the Sea and the Sunne built the Walls of a City. But
let us ſee whether <hi>Virgil</hi> do any better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aeneas</hi> is the ſon of <hi>Anchiſes</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> 'twere blaſphemy to take this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally;
for we muſt grant that a Goddeſs had proſtituted her ſelf to a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:
But I will give the Mythologiſts leave to ſay, that divers mortals have
been reputed the children of Gods and Goddeſſes, not that they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
begotten of them, but to inſinuate that they were given to thoſe things
which are in the power of thoſe divinities. Thus the valiant are eſteemed the
ſons of <hi>Mars,</hi> able Muſitians the children of <hi>Apollo</hi> and the <hi>Muſes,</hi> and the
honeſt drunkards the children of <hi>Bacchus:</hi> Upon the ſame account <hi>Aeneas</hi>
is ſaid to be the ſon of <hi>Venus,</hi> becauſe he was given to <hi>Love.</hi> This goes very
well thus far for this Goddeſs brings <hi>Aeneas</hi> to <hi>Carthage,</hi> where ſhe makes
him enjoy <hi>Dido,</hi> and when he hath done, ſhe promiſes him another Kingdom
and another wife; but when ſhe muſt come into fights and relieve him, and
does other actions which have no relation with Love, what explication ſhall
we find for them, ſince <hi>Venus</hi> hath ever been underſtood to be the pleaſure
which is found in amorous enjoyments? And thus the ſence of fables, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
either by Phyſicians or moral Philoſophers, is very claſhing and confuſed,
unleſs they take things all to pieces as they pleaſe: But though this could be
ſo effectually done, as that it might ſerve for ſomewhat, yet would it not
juſtifie the extravagance of the Poets.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid may ſuffice to ſhew the abſurdity of theſe explications, and
it may ſerve for a rule to diſcover all the reſt. It's time I ſpeak of the Poets
which are now in vogue, who invent not any fables wherein they pretend to
any truth, as being not able to advance any higher then Sonnets and Songs. I
need ſay no more againſt them then what I have ſaid already, when I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that their <hi>ſmiles,</hi> their <hi>charms,</hi> and a few <hi>drolliſh</hi> expreſſions, are the
greateſt ornaments of their works, with the aſſiſtance of a few <hi>Antitheſes,</hi>
and ſome <hi>Hyperboles.</hi> But I am to aſſure you that they are now at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
pitch of their art, and that they cannot write any thing which they muſt
not vamp out of their Companions. All their buſineſs is to diſguiſe things,
which they do ſo palpably, that they eaſily put us into an imagination that
their Poetry is like an old pair of breeches, which the Broker hath turn'd
and alter'd ſo often, that at length he knows not which ſide to ſet out. Some
will ſay that their Miſtreſſes eyes are Torches to burn over them when they
are dead; and others that they are Suns whence they receive their light and
life. There are ſometimes ſome petty contradictions in their conceits, which
they accommodate after any faſhion to come to their purpoſe.</p>
               <p>It may be eaſily ſeen that all this is but a pure foolery, and that it is an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
much of kin to Love, fit for thoſe have nothing to do.</p>
               <p>There is yet among us another kind of Books againſt which I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſpeak. Theſe Books are called <hi>ROMANCES;</hi> and to ſpeak
properly, 'tis <hi>Poetry</hi> in <hi>Proſe;</hi> there are a many faſhions of them. The firſt
that ever were ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> treat only of <hi>Knighthood,</hi> but they are ſuch
Monſters as I ſhall not meddle with; they are already quelled, and I am
confident there are not any in this company that eſteem them. Inſtead of
their <hi>Enchantments,</hi> there are books which treat of things with much more
likelyhood, and that in my judgement, whereon they were all begotten, is
the Romance of <hi>Heliodorus.</hi> That Fable made after the manner of a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
is not free from the ſottiſhneſs of the ancient Poets. All the perſons
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43725:187"/>
he introduces are commonly acquainted in their dreams with what they are to
do, ſo that for to procure good dreams they had no more to do then to whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Gnemon</hi> whereof <hi>Heliodorus</hi> talks, is in my opinion a very impertinent
fellow: he would always repreſent the things which <hi>Calaſiris</hi> relates to him
as if they were preſent; and not being content to have ſaid that the ceremonies
of an Anniverſary were not paſſed for him, and that the good old man muſt
needs let him ſee them; he afterward importunes him to tell him who got the
race, becauſe he is in as much perplexity for <hi>Theagenes</hi> as any then preſent.
This humour is repeated too often to be pleaſant, and that we may have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
like thoſe of <hi>Guemon,</hi> we muſt ſay that the relation hath cauſed us
ſo much trouble as to the Prieſt <hi>Calaſiris.</hi> But what a contemptible fellow
was that young <hi>Grecian!</hi> though <hi>Heliodorus</hi> makes him the ſon of an <hi>Areopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gite,</hi>
yet we are to believe he was one of a low poor ſpirit. He ever and anon
ſhakes for fear, and hath no more courage then a woman; but indeed it was
fit he ſhould not be much more valiant then <hi>Theagenes,</hi> who is the principal
perſon in the ſtory This man is not guilty of any generous actions, and I know
not to what purpoſe are introduced the Hiſtory of the ſiege of <hi>Syenea,</hi> nor the
fight between the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> ſince he hath no part in ſo great
tranſactions, and is but a poor captive in chains; whereas it might have been
as eaſie for the Author to have imployed him in ſome noble exploits of war,
and ſo have given us ſome true ſatisfaction. <hi>Heliodorus</hi> hath alſo forgotten
to make his ſtory compleat: He ſhould have ſpoken with <hi>Theagenes</hi>'s parents
as well as thoſe of <hi>Chariclea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> beſtows his daughter in marriage on a ſtranger, who
can hear no news out of his Country. This Hiſtory deſerves well to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with that of the <hi>Loves</hi> of <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Cloe;</hi> the Author makes
theſe young people ſo fooliſh, and ſo diſcreet both together, that there can be
nothing more unlikely: but that which puts me quite off patience is, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that book hath been the occaſion that divers others have written books
of Shepherdry, and I aſſure you they have imitated it ſo well, that they make
all their Shepherds baſtards, not knowing neither father nor mother no more
then <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Cloe;</hi> and that when they were children, they had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away in their cradles by the overflowing of a River, and were afterward
found by ſome body that brought them up. See if <hi>Baptiſta Guarini</hi> in his
<hi>Faithfull Shepherd</hi> be not ſuch a fool as to make uſe of the ſame invention,
and if a very many others do not the ſame ſtill, as if it were of the eſſence
of Shepherdry to be loſt in the infancy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had Books of <hi>Shepherdry</hi> before us, <hi>Montemajor</hi> hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
them with his <hi>Diana,</hi> wherein I find no order at all. Nay what is
more, I meet with nothing in it but fables and enchantments concerning <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia.</hi>
This Sorcereſs had a Chamber wherein <hi>Orpheus</hi> was kept inchanted,
though the Poets ſay he was diſmembred by the Prieſteſſes of <hi>Bacchus</hi> at
<hi>Thebes.</hi> He plaid on his Harp, and as he ſung he acquainted the Shepherds
the Statues of what Ladies thoſe were about him: They were the Princeſſes
of <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe lives the Author might very well have known; and this is a
huge piece of ingenuity, which a many Authors are beholding to, to relate by
way of prophecy what hath been done in their own times. They foretell
things after they are come to paſs. 'Tis true, the firſt of our Shepherds, that
is to ſay, <hi>Ollenix</hi> of <hi>Montſaere</hi> hath no ſuch thing in his Paſtorals of <hi>Julietta,</hi>
but he had done better to imitate that, then have done what was worſe. He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
his books into daies, and brings the Shepherds together out of the fields
and thickets, and never tels us whether they retire, nor how they live. There
are a many Satyrs which lie in ambuſh for the Shepherdeſſes, but that may be
forgiven, ſince it may be ſuppoſed he ſpeaks like the Poets, who make thoſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Gods as frequent in the woods, as if they were but Boars or Stags. It is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43725:188"/>
alſo no leſs to be obſerved what he makes thoſe do whoſe loves he deſcribes.
His Shepherdeſſes are the moſt impudent things in the world, they do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcover their paſſions to the Shepherds without any modeſty; but they
run after them through hills and dales, as it were to force them to their Loves.
Their diſcourſes and their verſes are ſo abominable, that if I read but a leaf,
'tis enough to put my thoughts out of order for fifteen daies, if I do not ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
take ſome antidote.</p>
               <p>All the adventures a man meets with are no other, then that the Shepherds
and Shepherdeſſes avoid, or ſeek one another; but to make amends for this,
when they are altogether in the ſame place, there's ſome one relates a ſtory
every day. Though they are many times Shepherdeſſes that are put upon this
task, yet they confidently cite <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Authors, (as if it were to
be conceived that ruſticall perſons, nay and women, had read ſo much) and
which is more, they bring in the choiceſt examples out of the Philoſophers
and other illuſtrious men. Beſides the Author not conſidering that he made
them all heathens, makes them quote divers paſſages and perſonages of the
Bible. As for example, there was one ſaid,</p>
               <p>That as <hi>Tobias</hi> who was blind and deſtitute of all things, became through
the means of the Angel more happy then ever he had been; ſo that poor Lover
of whom ſhe ſpeaks, came to be happy by the aſſiſtance of his Page, whom God
ſtirred up to relieve him.</p>
               <p>'Tis as true that <hi>Ollenix</hi> does very much obſerve the Chronology: For though
by all circumſtances it ſhould ſeem that his Paſtorals are things as ancient as
the birth of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſince there have not been ſince that time in <hi>Arcadia</hi> any
ſuch as he deſcribes; yet the find ſtories that his Shepherdeſſes tell, relate to
paſſages of theſe times, one at <hi>Vevice,</hi> another at <hi>Florence,</hi> and a third at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona;</hi>
nay there are ſome ſo late as that they happened in the reigne of the
great King of <hi>France.</hi> The Shepherdeſs that ſpeaks, commends that Prince,
as though ſhe had known him, which is the groſſeſt impertinence that can be;
for though this were not a miſtake of the Authors, as to the time, yet is it an
overſight great enough, in regard ſuch ſavage people as he brings in, could
not poſſibly know ſo many particulars of <hi>France,</hi> which lay at too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from them.</p>
               <p>After ſo many defaults of judgement, and the profanation of ſo many
paſſages of holy Scripture as he hath quoted to ſo little purpoſe, I believe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
favour, that if this Author were now living, they could do him no leſs
favour then ſend him to the Gallies for having ſo miſpent his time. Nor hath
<hi>England</hi> wanted its <hi>Arcadia,</hi> whereof it is not long ſince we have had the
tranſlation. I find no more order in that then in the reſt, and there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things whereof I am not at all ſatisfied. At the very beginning you have
the complaints of the Shepherds, <hi>Strephon</hi> and <hi>Clavis</hi> upon the departure of
<hi>Vrania,</hi> without telling us who ſhe was, nor whither ſhe went. Now an
Author ought never to begin his book, but he ſhould mention the perſons
principally concern'd in the Hiſtory, whoſe actions he is to raiſe up beyond
any of the reſt; yet this man makes afterward no more mention of theſe two
Shepherds then if he had never named them; and though he bring them in
again at ſome ſports before <hi>Baſilius,</hi> yet that ſignifies nothing, ſince a man
finds no period of their adventures, and that thoſe verſes wherein they ſpeak
of their Loves, are ſo obſcure, that they may be taken for the Oracles of a
<hi>Sybill.</hi> It is true that Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> dying young, might have left his
Work imperfect; but there's no reaſon we ſhould ſuffer by that misfortune,
and be obliged to take a thing for perfect becauſe it might have beene made
ſo.</p>
               <p>There's nothing now hinders me from ſpeaking of <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> which I put
after the <hi>Arcadia,</hi> as being a later piece, though we had ſeen it before the
other. I know there are a many defend it, but ſince I have put myſelf on
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43725:188"/>
this task, can it be thought I ſhould ſay nothing of it? Is it fit that Book
ſhould be called <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> ſince that in all the volumes of it there is more
ſpoken of <hi>Diana, Galathea, Silvia</hi> and others, then of that Shepherdeſs?
When <hi>Hylas</hi> ſpeaks in good earneſt, and gives greater teſtimonies of his foul
inconſtancy, muſt it not be confeſſed he is a fool in the higheſt degree, and
that conſequently he is not ſlighted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s he ought to be? If I could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
he is no fool, and that he did it in a merry humour, I anſwer, It is
a great omiſſion, in ſuch large diſcourſes not to have let ſlip one word to tell
us ſo, and withall to ſatisfie us as to what ſcruples we might conceive upon
the inequality of his diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Sylvander,</hi> I am in doubt whether the reaſons of his Philoſophy
are alwaies good, and whether he do not ſometimes fall into the ſubtileſt of
<hi>Platonical Idea's.</hi> All the Hiſtories which are related concern ſtrange per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
but there is but one and the ſame invention to bring them all into <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts;</hi>
'tis ever ſome <hi>Oracle</hi> ſends them thither. There are alſo in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
very long diſcourſes, which I wiſh the Author had never made, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to make the work compleat. Then might we have made a more
certain and ſolid judgement of them. But I dare affirm, from what we have
in our hands, that there is no likelyhood there were in Forreſts any Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
ſo civiliz'd in <hi>Meroveus</hi> his time, ſince we have the aſſurance of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
that all the <hi>Gauls</hi> were in thoſe times very ſavage. I have obſerved alſo
a horrid fault in the <hi>Chronology;</hi> for <hi>Childerick</hi> having ſucceeded his father,
and having been driven out of his Kingdom in the time when all theſe Loves
happened, <hi>Clotilda</hi> had remained a long time with her Uncle, and was at
leaſt ſixteen years of age, as ſhe is deſcribed. Now <hi>Childerick</hi> was eight
years in exile, and he reigned fifteen years afterward, and his ſon <hi>Clovis</hi> did
not marry <hi>Clotilda</hi> till ſeaven years after his death, ſo that by this account
this Princeſs was above five and forty years of age, whereas our Hiſtories
tell us, that ſhe was very fair and very young.</p>
               <p>If the Author muſt needs invent fables of <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> they might have been
ſo couched into the Hiſtory, as not to make any diſorder of time. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all this, and many other things over tedious to relate, that Book
hath gotten ſo into the vogue, that I have divers times heard <hi>Lyſis</hi> and his
companions ſay, that it was the <hi>Breviary</hi> of the <hi>Amorous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are other <hi>Romances</hi> which ſpeak not of <hi>Shepherds,</hi> but <hi>Princes</hi> and
<hi>Gentlemen.</hi> We have of this kind the <hi>Argenis,</hi> a book I am not ſo ready to
grant that reputation to that many doe. You find in the beginning.</p>
               <p>That the Vniverſe had not yet ador'd <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the Ocean given place to
<hi>Tyber,</hi> when, upon the Coaſt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> where the River <hi>Gelas</hi> enters the Sea,
there arriv'd in the Port a ſtrange ſhip, out of which came aſhore a young Knight,
tranſcendently handſom.</p>
               <p>Who ſees not but this obſervation is too general for ſo particular a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?
Had the queſtion been about the conqueſt of one of the four parts
of the world, or that an univerſal change of Religion and Cuſtomes had
hapned over the whole earth, it haply would not have beene unhandſome
to note the time ſo particularly; but ſince it only concerns the time of a
Ships arrival in <hi>Sicily,</hi> it had been enough to have ſaid what it was of
the clock, whether it was night or day, Summer or Winter; or what could
have beene moſt preſumed, it might have been permitted to relate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
the affairs of that Iſland were in at that time. To be ſhort, no
man will deny me but that if the Authour had ſaid that <hi>Meleander</hi> reigned
at that time in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and that <hi>Lycogenes</hi> who had taken up Arms againſt
him, was upon the point of concluding a peace when ſuch a Veſſell arrived
into the Haven, it had ſpoken more judgement. When there is a failing in
the firſt word, I know not what may be expected in the purſuit: You find
immediately after, that a Lady finds two young Knights ſo handſome, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43725:189"/>
ſhe made a vow to have their pictures, and though ſhe accompliſhed not
her vow till a long time after, the Authour diverts from the narration
to relate certain verſes which ſhe cauſed to be put under the picture: This
is a diſturbance of the order, to acquaint us with a thing which was not
very neceſſary. You will find alſo all through the book, certain verſes
which are thruſt in to interrupt the Hiſtory: and I know not any which
are not unſeaſonably brought in, except ſome hymnes that are ſung to the
honour of the Gods: As for the divers adventures that are in it, there is
not any thing more miraculous then what we find in ordinary Love-ſtories.
A young Prince is brought up obſcurely, for fear he might have beene
made away: Certain robbers carry him away, and ſell him to a King,
that makes as much of him as if he were his own ſon. This King loſing a
battel, the young Prince is taken and carryed into his Country, where he is
redeemed by his mother. A while after it being diſcovered what he was, the
fame of <hi>Argenis</hi>'s beauty makes him fall in love with her. He goes into <hi>Sicily</hi>
diſguiſed as a maid to live with her. Certain Rebels being deſirous to have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
K. <hi>Meleander,</hi> he defends him, and after he had made himſelf known to his
Miſtreſs, goes away. A while after he returns again in mans habit, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the favour of <hi>Meleander</hi> and <hi>Argenis;</hi> but at length his enemies force
him to quit <hi>Sicily:</hi> He is carried twice into <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and the ſecond
time he relieves the Queen of that Countrey. She ſends him back with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chombrotus,</hi>
who is acknowledged to be the ſon of <hi>Meleander,</hi> who quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the pretentions he had to marry <hi>Argenis,</hi> he reſignes her to <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a ſummary of all the ſtory wherein I find not ought to be raviſhed
at. On the contrary, I think it ſhould be very unpleaſant, ſince the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
of Countreys are not obſerv'd, and that there was never any ſuch
government in <hi>Sicily</hi> as you find there. Thoſe who pretend to criticiſmes, tel us
there is a key to the <hi>Argenis,</hi> but I fear me the lock is ſo much out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that it cannot open that Cabinet, where we are promiſed to ſee ſuch
rarities. They will have <hi>Meliander</hi> to be <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Poliarchus Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the fourth, and <hi>Argenis</hi> to be <hi>France;</hi> but though the Authour ſhould
have meant it ſo, what ground is there to make an Analogy between our
<hi>Hiſtory</hi> and thoſe divers Romantick adventures? You find indeed that the
diſcourſes of State relate to our way of Government, and when he ſpeaks
of the <hi>Hyperefanians,</hi> all the world knows he means the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> that
<hi>Vſinulca</hi> is <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Aquilius</hi> the <hi>Emperour:</hi> but we go no further, and
when we have known all theſe explications we have learned but very triviall
and ordinary things.</p>
               <p>Why ſhould we love truth better under a vail then when ſhe is naked?
Some may haply come and tell me I ſhould not ſpeak of this book as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Romance, as being full of maxims of State which prefer it before
all other; doe but read any book that treats of nothing but Politick know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
and you will find a hundred times as much in it. That this book raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it ſelf into ſuch an eſteem at the beginning was, becauſe in other Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
thoſe things were not commonly ſo frequent, and the Authours
made it their buſineſs to deſcribe the paſſions. Beſides, any other diſcourſe
whatever were as much to the purpoſe as thoſe you find in the <hi>Argenis,</hi>
and I wiſh the Authour had ſet himſelfe rather to ſpeak only things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Archombrotus</hi> found <hi>Poliarchus</hi> at his Mothers, theſe two Lovers
became furious at the firſt interview; they ſhook again for indignation, and
viewed one another from head to foot, as two men that were upon the
point to fight. All this is good; but I would fain know whether they
ſpoke or no, and what they ſaid in the preſence of <hi>Hyamisbe,</hi> who muſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43725:189"/>
needs oblige them to ſome diſcourſe. Two words would have ſatisfied me;
but this was the hardeſt nut of all to crack. Theſe Authours when they
fall into ſuch lurches, paſs over them ſlightly, and I have obſerved in very
famous Books, that when a diſcourſe was to be made on ſome tickliſh
occaſion, you only find that ſuch a one ſaid ſome fine words to his Miſtreſs,
and we are ſatisfied; but when it comes to an eaſie conjuncture, you have
diſcourſes in their full length. As for any eſteem may be made of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
of the <hi>Argenis</hi> I am clearly of the contrary opinion, for there are
a many new words which were never currant at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that if <hi>Salust</hi>
returned into the world, he would hardly underſtand it. A man may
lawfully add ſome words to a language that is in vogue, becauſe uſe may in
time naturalize them; but we muſt leave a dead language ſuch as we
find it in the Monuments of Antiquity, and it is ſacriledg to meddle
with it.</p>
               <p>Now I am to let you know what a thing the Hiſtory of <hi>Lyſander</hi> is. I
proteſt to you that book hath no invention in the world. The Authour
having heard that the beſt Romances ſhould be full of miraculous Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
hath no other ſecret to win us into admiration, then to make a many
unexpected rencontres, wherewith he hath filled his book, which is a thing
very low and extream tedious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſander</hi> coming from <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s relieves her father againſt Robbers in the
Forreſt of <hi>Fontainbleu;</hi> the next day he is ſecond to <hi>Claranges</hi> againſt
<hi>Lidian</hi> his Miſtreſſes brother. <hi>Cleander</hi> leaves his wife to go to <hi>Holland</hi>
with theſe brave adventures: There <hi>Lyſander</hi> relieves the husband and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his <hi>Caliſta.</hi> They return like ſtrange Knights to challenge ſome
French at a Tournament, which done, they take off their Helmets, and
diſcover themſelves. <hi>Lyſander</hi> being in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> ſick, is comforted by a
Capuchin, whom he finds to be <hi>Claranges,</hi> and being gone like a Pilgrim to
<hi>Montſerrat,</hi> he finds <hi>Cleander</hi> and his ſervants clad like ſlaves, having
been taken by a Pirate upon the Coaſt of <hi>Genua</hi> as they returned from <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly.</hi>
The Sermon being begun, they find the Preacher to be <hi>Lidian,</hi>
whom an amorous deſpair had forced into devotion, as well as his rivall
<hi>Claranges.</hi> They bring him back to <hi>Paris,</hi> and diſcover themſelves in theſe
habits one after another.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Cleander,</hi> and many other adventures, <hi>Lyſander</hi>
goes over to a Tournament in <hi>England,</hi> where he fought againſt <hi>Lidian,</hi>
and at length knew him, and <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> who were there upon
the ſame occaſion. In the mean time <hi>Lucidan</hi> having demanded leave of the
King to fight with <hi>Lyſander</hi> who had killed his Uncle; his father <hi>Adraſtus</hi>
appears for his ſon, ſo does <hi>Dorylas Caliſtas</hi>'s father, and <hi>Caliſta</hi> her ſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed.
The <hi>Amazon Hypolita</hi> makes a fourth; but the combat is ſtaid by
the coming in of <hi>Lidian, Alcedon,</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> who had been ſeparted
from <hi>Lyſander</hi> by a Tempeſt. Not to tell you the whole book by heart, you
ſee by theſe examples, it contains nothing but meetings and diſcourſes.
Some are ſeparated, others return, and then they all meet at an hour, ſo that
the Authour deals by theſe perſons as a Puppet-player by his Puppets, makes
them enter and <hi>exit</hi> off the Stage as he pleaſes. And this is all the ſubtilty
in it.</p>
               <p>There are other paſſages farre enough from probability of being ſo as they
are related. Who will believe that <hi>Lyſander</hi> having hurt <hi>Cloridan</hi> with a
Lance, a kinſman and four of his friends ſhould come to <hi>Cleanders</hi> to aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him? How were they admitted into the houſe all armed, and what
rage could animate them to ſuch a miſchief, ſince <hi>Cloridan</hi> denied he knew
any thing of it? Yet a while after, the Author wanting an invention to find
his <hi>Lyſander</hi> fighting work, brings him a challenge from that <hi>Cloridan:</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:43725:190"/>
As for the <hi>Operatour</hi> that dreſſed the cloathes in ſtead of the body, 'tis a
Magick I permit in a <hi>Romance.</hi> But as to the ſpirit that appears to <hi>Cleander</hi>
and prays him to bury his body which was in the bottom of a wel, methinks
it is a tale made in imitation of that of <hi>Athendorus,</hi> but not ſo good, for
certain Pagans were of belief, that thoſe who were not buried, were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the <hi>Elyſian</hi> fields; but as for Chriſtians, that they are ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to be put into holy ground, 'tis onely out of devout cuſtom, and
thoſe that miſs of it are not accounted the leſs happy for that, ſo that it is
not credible a ſoule can be troubled with theſe conſiderations in the other
World, and diſturb its own reſt, to come and deſire one to bury the body
wherein it had once dwelt: But this ſpirit is beſides very complementall;
it asks <hi>Cleander</hi> whether he will command him any ſervice into that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
whither he goes. As for his promiſe to give him notice of his death
three days before it ſhould happen, 'tis a queſtion whether God permits
any ſuch premonitions. For my part I believe they are onely Saints have
that favour done them. Yet this ſpirit comes one morning to give <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
notice of his death; but the manner of it is very pleaſant. 'Tis thought
that ſpirits can in a moment tranſlate themſelves whither they pleaſe, and
can finde us as eaſily in the bottom of a Sellar, as on the top of a Tower:
They need no ſtaires to go up not down by, nor yet door nor window to
come in at: But this knocks at <hi>Cleanders</hi> Caſtle gate till the Gentleman
himſelf came and opened; but it was out of modeſty, becauſe he would no
take him unawares.</p>
               <p>'Tis as hard a thing to believe that a young <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, ſuch as
<hi>Lidian,</hi> ſhould in a little while preach ſo famouſly in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> The Author
forgetting at length that he had undertaken an Hiſtory, inſenſibly falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Fables, like thoſe of <hi>Amadis.</hi> He makes <hi>Calista</hi> bear Armes, he makes
<hi>Hippolita</hi> fight with <hi>Lyſander,</hi> as if the delicacy of a Woman could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
that hardſhip. <hi>Lyſander</hi> goes from <hi>Rouen</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> all armed, as if
'twere the mode of <hi>France</hi> to goe ſo in times of peace, or as if we ſtill li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the age of <hi>Knight-Errantry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> deſirous to doe juſtice by way of Armes, permits the
accuſer of <hi>Caliſta</hi> to fight with any that ſhould defend her. She in the
mean time is placed on a Scaffold hanged with black, according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cuſtome. There are other ſtrange accidents, as when <hi>Hippolita</hi> and
her maid <hi>Erifila</hi> keep the Arms at the Tournament. He ſhould not have
put in adventures ſo eaſily diſcoverable for lies; for they are ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
that if there had been any ſuch thing, many yet alive would have
ſeen them, and ſomewhat might have been found to that purpoſe in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of that King. To conclude, at the marriage of <hi>Caliſta,</hi> a Nymph
fills the Hall with darkneſs, and afterward made an obelisk ariſe, whence
there iſſued ſo much water, that moſt were in fear to be drowned; at
length the water having ceaſed, they read the Propheſies which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thereon. The Author tells us not whether this was done by art, or
by Enchantment, for he knew not himſelf, and his deſigne was to purſue
his ſtile of <hi>Knight-Errantry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus have you an account of <hi>Lyſanders</hi> Hiſtory, and if you think
be deſerves any eſteem for his language, I tell you there are in it a world
of <hi>Gaſcon</hi> phraſes, and the periods are ſometimes ſo long and ſo confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that a man hath much adoe to find any ſence in them.</p>
               <p>Nor doe I believe that the Adventures of <hi>Polyxena</hi> are able to make
good the cauſe of all other Romances of this age: 'Tis a book ill begun,

            <p>This fellows impertinence was inſupportable; <hi>Clarimond</hi> was ſuffered to ſpeak
againſt <hi>Romances,</hi> becauſe of his ſtrength of wit and the reaſons he brought;
but for that wandring <hi>Jew,</hi> that blamed what he was not able to maintain, he
deſerved to be toſt in a blanket. Beſides, it was thought baſe in him to ſpeak
againſt what he had promiſed to maintain; but he could not have kept his word
had he endeavoured it, becauſe he had not read all the books that <hi>Clarimond</hi>
had quoted, nor had he the wit to defend them: they therefore made a
great hooting at this ignorant writer; and <hi>Lyſis</hi> having cauſed the noiſe to
ceaſe, fell a checking of him for having forſaken his cauſe: he told him he
ſhould not write his Hiſtory, as he had once reſolved he ſhould: He ſeeing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43725:191"/>
that they openly affronted him, made no anſwer, but ſhook his noddle, and
ſtunk behind the reſt. <hi>Clarimond</hi> omitted not to importune the Judge, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
pronounce the ſentence on my ſide, I beſeech you; <hi>Muſardan</hi> agrees
with me, and here's none oppoſes what I have ſaid. <hi>Philiris,</hi> who profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Letters as well as <hi>Clarimond,</hi> was reſolved to contradict him out of emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He knew <hi>Muſardan</hi> could ſay nothing to the purpoſe, and his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was to take his part. Taking therefore oportunity to ſpeak, he roſe up and
deſired <hi>Anſelm</hi> to grant him audience that he might anſwer the calumnies of
<hi>Clarimond.</hi> The Judge granted his requeſt, and all being attentive to this new
diverſion, he ſpoke to this purpoſe:</p>

                        <p>I Know not what conſideratons, moſt learned and moſt juſt Judge, I know
not what ſtrange humour hath engaged <hi>Clarimond</hi> into ſuch an Oration
as he hath now made, nor can I tell whether he pretend to gain reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by oppoſing the common opinion; but whether he have ſpoken in good
earneſt, or hath only ſhewn how farr he could go againſt his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there is a neceſſity he ſhould be anſwered, leſt what he hath ſpoken
may be taken for truth by thoſe that have heard it. And ſince you have
been choſen to judge who ſhould bring better reaſons concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in hand, I thought my ſelf obliged to ſpeak, that the nobleſt and beſt
cauſe in the world might not ſuffer any prejudice for want of defence. <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
hath endeavoured to make appear, that in all <hi>Poetry,</hi> and in all <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances</hi>
there's nothing to be found but may be cenſured; but O ye Gods!
does he not fear, that ſo many excellent men as he hath injur'd, may not be
forced to quit the happineſs of the <hi>Elyſian fields,</hi> to come hither and ſeem
cruel to puniſh his calumnies, or at leaſt to encourage me in their protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
The latter I am more then confident of; and I doubt not but I ſhall
ſay whatever makes for my purpoſe, ſince I ſhall not want the ſuggeſtion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
of thoſe excellent Genius's. Ah! <hi>Divine Homer,</hi> who would ever have
thought it would have been neceſſary to ſeek reaſons for thy defence in ſo
great an Aſſembly as this? Yet it muſt be done: and ſince thy <hi>Iliad</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed,
as containing only the fights which paſſed in the ſolitude of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
with the death of <hi>Patroclus</hi> and <hi>Hector,</hi> it ſatisfies to anſwer that it was
not thy deſigne to do any more, and as thou ſaiſt in the beginning, thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendedſt
only to write of the anger of the ſon of <hi>Peleus:</hi> The reſt of the
Hiſtory was ſufficiently well known among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſo that thy pains
were well ſpared; and as for the name <hi>Iliad,</hi> which is alſo condemn'd, it is
proper enough, ſince the fights it treats of happened during the ſiege of <hi>Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi>
As for the <hi>Gods</hi> whom the Poet makes ſo valiant in this war, as if the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> were the only men in the world, there's nothing to be
wondred at, for at that time they were more conſiderable then all the world
beſides: and it was neceſſary to engage the force of <hi>Europe</hi> againſt that of
<hi>Aſia.</hi> Beſides, though the <hi>Iliad</hi> mentions only the care of the Gods over
thoſe people, it infers not they had forgotten the reſt, nor yet that <hi>Homer</hi>
had forgot them; but they could not be ſpoken of without digreſſing from
the matter in hand. And that thoſe whom theſe different divinities affect
moſt, are not alwayes delivered from misfortunes, is not to be wondred at,
ſince they are ſo divided that one power oppoſes another. As for their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43725:191"/>
quarrels, they are things pardonable in Fables. I come to the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons
which <hi>Clarimond</hi> finds ſo much fault with, becauſe they are taken
from hunting. To what can fighting be better compared then to that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
which is as it were a noviceſhip to the War. That <hi>Homer</hi> makes his
Warriors ſometimes like furious beaſts; is it not the greater miracle, in ſo
much as it ſo divercifies the accidents by compariſons, that they ſeem to be
quite different, though they are drawn from the ſame beaſt. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he often draws his compariſon from a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and if a great <hi>Heros</hi> be to
fight with ſome miſerable ſouldier, he ſaies 'tis as if a Lyon ſhould fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſheep; if there comes ſome brave Captain to relieve that Soldier, he
compares him to a good Shepherd that will defend his flock; and if one
<hi>Heros</hi> fight with another, 'tis as if one Lyon fought with another. And
thus he goes on, and for my part I find it an incomparable grace. For when
he ſpeaks of the ſame men, he ever uſes the ſame compariſons, which is much
more rational then to make them ſometimes <hi>Suns,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Trees,</hi> and
ſometimes <hi>Rivers.</hi> The ſeveral natures of ſo many things cannot be found
together. As for the other compariſons, they are not ſo obſcene and low
as is imagined. <hi>Clarimond</hi> finds fault alſo with the Language, and ſayes
<hi>Homer</hi> ſpoke not good <hi>Greek,</hi> becauſe ſo many Countries diſputed about
him whoſe child he ſhould be: but he is to know that it is alſo ſaid he is not
any Countryman on earth, but that he came down from heaven. If he uſe
divers dialects, and ſome words which are ſtrange to other common authors,
'tis becauſe Poetry being the language of the Gods, hath a peculiar ſtile
which is not familiar to men. I will go no further for a teſtimony of the
excellence of his diſcourſe, then the comon opinion, that he is full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
which generally ſerve all mankind. His ſentences are not ſo low; as
you have been told, but they cannot be otherwiſe conceived; and if you
find not in them that majeſty that is expected, we are to blame <hi>Clarimond,</hi>
who by his tranſlation of them into <hi>French,</hi> hath rob'd them of thoſe
beauties which they have in their own language. The moſt learned Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
have ſought them out to ground their tenents on, and the Painters
and Armorers, and the ſubtileſt mechanicks, have acknowledged ſo much
from this Poet, that they confeſs they have learned their profeſſions of him.
He is accordingly called the Maſter of all Arts, and he is painted vomiting,
and all the other Poets licking what he had caſt up. As for Military perſons,
they are the moſt beholding to him for his inſtructions, and out of his
Works may be learned with what courage a man ſhould aſſault his enemies.
how ſouldiers ſhould obey, and the Generals command, and with what
maſculine eloquence a Captain ſhould encourage his troops. As for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of the Heroes in the midſt of a fight, they are not ſo irrational:
They might have been come out of the charge, as being weary of fighting,
and in the time of that repoſe, they might diſcover themſelves one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
As for the combat of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Hector,</hi> that they made uſe of ſtones,
is not ſo ſtrange, ſince fury thinks no weapons amiſs. That eſteem which
<hi>Alexander</hi> and others had of <hi>Homer,</hi> is no fiction; all Hiſtorians agree in
it, and there was never any imagined that that great Poet did ever doe any
thing indecent: In his time, and in that of <hi>Achilles's,</hi> Luxury and Pride
did not reigne as they do now, ſo that the Heroes might well condeſcend to
dreſs what they ate themſelves; and to mention that delicacies ſhould be
preſented to them at Feaſts, ſhews the honour was done them even to thoſe
ſmall circumſtances, which haply cuſtom had in thoſe times made the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.
If <hi>Vliſſes</hi> built a Veſſel, neceſſity forced him to a thing which was not
diſhonourable to a Warriour, and it was only a great Boat which needed
not a Carpenter ſo much to help him, beſides that the ſolitude of his Nymph
would have been troubled with the ſight of ſo many other men. And as for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43725:192"/>
the bed he tels <hi>Penelope</hi> of, he might have done ſomewhat by way of recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the paſtimes of Princes are divers. In fine, the places and the times
might have rendred thoſe things commendable, which now ſeem ridiculous.
As for the lowneſs of ſpirits which my adverſary objects to <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it to be falſe. That this great Heros wept at the relation of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi>
Warr, 'twas not for the hardſhips he had endured there himſelf, but
thoſe of his friends, and perhaps he wept out of affection, which is a thing
permitted the moſt generous; it may be he regretted the abſence of his
wife; <hi>Alcinous</hi> knew his condition by his majeſtick countenance, though he
had been found naked, and the proffer he made him of his daughter, is a
certain argument of the reſpect he bore him. If this <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> be ill handled
by the Lovers of <hi>Penelope,</hi> the fault is to be imputed to them, or at the worſt
to his diſguiſe, which was ſo far neceſſary, that he could not get into his
own houſe but by ſome artifice, his ancient acquaintances being much loſt.
It was the will of <hi>Pallas</hi> he ſhould go through thoſe afflictions, who would
not preſently ſuccour him as ſhe might have done, to ſhew that the Divinity
will not help us unleſs we alſo help our ſelves; and permits the good to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
to recompence them afterwards with happineſs far tranſcending their
former miſery. I will not grant <hi>Clarimond</hi> that <hi>Homer</hi> was a beggar, and got
his living by ſinging at dores; I know divers have been of that opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was blind, and that ſuch muſitians commonly are ſo; but 'tis not
likely a beggar could conceive ſuch rare things. Where ſhould we have
learned the art of War, and the councels of Captains? Are theſe things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to low-ſpirited perſons? If it be true that ſuch a Muſician could
ſing the <hi>Iliad</hi> and the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> through all <hi>Greece,</hi> I ſhould rather believe he
had compoſed thoſe incomparable Works, then that he did only own them,
having found them in the Authors notes, who was ſome great perſon of the
age. <hi>Clarimond</hi> deſirous to diſcredit the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> would have us believe
there's nothing in't but Country-Tales; but the worthy things of it he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits:
Is not that courteſie of <hi>Polyphemus</hi> to <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> an excellent paſſage,
where he tels him that he will eat him the laſt becauſe he gave him good
wine? could the humour of a ſavage be better repreſented? As for the
name of <hi>Nobody</hi> which <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> took on him, the ſubtilty was ſo fortunate
that the other <hi>Cyclops</hi> ſought not after him to puniſh him for the miſchief
he had done to their companion, becauſe they believed <hi>Nobody</hi> had ſtruck
out his eye, but that he had done it himſelf. When an action is inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in it ſelf, yet if great effects follow it, 'tis thought great. The Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis
of <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> companions follows, and <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſcofs at this Heros,
in that he reſiſted the charms which had cauſed the others to be transformed,
and ſuffered himſelf to be ſo carried away by the careſſes of the <hi>Sorcereſs,</hi>
that he openly lay with her; but I ſhall here find a Mythology ſhall take
away the contradiction, and ſhew that <hi>Homer</hi> hath not made <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and luxurious together. <hi>Circe</hi> the daughter of the Sun, ſignifies the
Celeſtial influence which incited the <hi>Grecians</hi> to follow pleaſures; they ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves to be eaſily overcome; but <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> oppoſing all ſuch inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
was not charmed by the ſame drink, that is to ſay, followed not the
ſame vices <hi>Circe</hi> entertains him into her bed, as being extreamly in love with
him. This ſhews that a wiſe man, ſuch as he was, rather commands then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys
the Celeſtial influence, and that when he is confident that it adviſes him
to nothing but what is vertuous, he ſhuns it not, but joynes himſelf to it by
a happy marriage, that all things it ſignifies may come to paſs to his own
glory. And thus we may ſatisfie thoſe that imagin there are any abſurdities
in fables. As for the rencontre of the <hi>Syrens,</hi> it is alſo taken for example in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
noble occaſions, and there are ſuch excellent Mythologies in it, that it's a
thing defends it ſelf As for <hi>Vlyſſes</hi>'s journey to hell, 'twas not ſo needleſs, ſince
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43725:192"/>
                           <hi>Circe</hi> would have him go thither, to ſee what wonders were there, that he
might be encouraged to live well by the reward of the good, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the bad. Thus is there nothing ſuperfluous in <hi>Homers</hi> Works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
if in the <hi>Iliad Achilles</hi>'s horſe prophecies, 'tis to ſhew us that the Divinity
will ſometimes make uſe of irrational creatures to tell us of our duty. I have
no more to ſay upon this occaſion, but that though <hi>Penclope</hi> had been as old
as <hi>Clarimond</hi> would make her, yet it was not impoſſible but that many
young men might court her, were it only for her means. And as for <hi>Helene,</hi>
though her beauty might loſe much of its glory, yet <hi>Menelaus</hi> might have
tryed all means to have her again, as if ſhe had been as fair as ever, and he
as deeply in love with her, in regard he and all the <hi>Greeks</hi> were reſolved and
ſworn to the enterpriſe; and if they had left <hi>Troy</hi> without doing any thing,
it would have been a great diſcredit to them. <hi>Clarimond</hi> having ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cenſured <hi>Homer,</hi> falls upon <hi>Virgil;</hi> and I am not to wonder he ſhould
fight againſt Poetry in the groſs, ſince he attacques this Poet. He blames
him for making <hi>Aeneas</hi> go to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and 'twas for that he obtained the
greateſt reputation among the <hi>Romans.</hi> They thought it a wonderfull piece
of conduct, to have gone ſo high for the motive of the Warr between <hi>Rome</hi>
and <hi>Carthage,</hi> when the diſpute was for nothing but the Empire of the
World. The City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> the Patroneſſe of it, bore an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
hatred in his opinion againſt the race of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who had forſaken
<hi>Dido,</hi> and thence aroſe the Wars between the <hi>Punick</hi> Nation and the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi>
'Tis true, theſe are but Poetical fictions, yet they give the mind great
ſatisfaction. As for the places where <hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>gil</hi> hath imitated <hi>Homer,</hi> I think it
is his chiefeſt glory; it being his buſineſs to deſcribe what paſſed after the
Wars of <hi>Troy,</hi> in the perſon of one of the moſt illuſtrious Heroes that were
there, 'twas fit he ſhould conform himſelf to his ſtile who had firſt writ on
that ſubject. <hi>Clarimond</hi> here takes occaſion to ſpeak of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Buckler in
relation to that of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> for that agitation of mind, whereinto the deſire
to calumniate had put him, hath been the reaſon that being at a loſs in his
order, he hath confounded many things. He blames <hi>Homer</hi> for deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
what was engraven in this Buckler, becauſe it ſhould ſeem to make the
Hiſtory the more true: but will he not acknowledge that if the Poet being
to ſpeak of the pleading of two Advocates, and the fighting of two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Factions, if he make the Reader as 'twere hear their noiſe, and ſee them
march to do their neceſſary actions, he does as good as ſay that the work was
ſo perfect, that by the only countenances of the perſons that are ſeen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
it might be conceived they ſhould ſay ſuch and ſuch things, and by what
they did then, might be judged what they had done, and what they ſhould do.
Thus it appears <hi>Homer</hi> hath rather done a miracle in this caſe, then commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any fault of judgement; and for <hi>Virgil</hi> in the Buckler of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
not to be cenſured for having graven in it the moſt remarkable things
ſhould happen to <hi>Rome.</hi> It may be they were ſevered by diviſions, as <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
would have it; but ſuppoſe they were not, and that there had been
but one City of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Buckler, and that in one place there was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
the Bridg broken under <hi>Horatius Cocles,</hi> and in another the <hi>Capitoll
beſieged,</hi> and at ſome diſtance another thing, though they were adventures
ſhould happen at ſeveral times, the invention was by ſo much the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for this bearing the nature of a Prophecy, things muſt have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
to be conformable to the cuſtome of the Divinities, whoſe Oracles
have ever ſomewhat of obſcurity. From hence <hi>Clarimond</hi> falls into frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
reprehenſions, and is angry that <hi>Virgil</hi> ſhould ſay that <hi>Vulcan</hi> forged a
Thunder bolt for <hi>Jupiter,</hi> conſiſting of three darts of rain, and three of
fire; he believes not that Smiths can work in moiſt things; but does he not
perceive that this is ſpoken myſteriouſly, and that <hi>Vulcan</hi> ſignifies that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43725:193"/>
air that is changed into fire in the upper region, and violently breaking
through what obſtacles do environ it, makes that noiſe which we call thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
cauſing at the ſame time the rain to fall out of thoſe moiſt clouds which
it hath burſt aſunder. Thus do the Phyſicians hide their ſecrets under theſe
fables, and that <hi>Vulcan</hi> is Jack of-all-trades among the Gods, 'tis to ſhew
that the operations both of Art and Nature are not effected without fire, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
corporal or ſpiritual, which is the vehemence of the action, or the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the workmen. <hi>Clarimond</hi> troubles himſelf alſo with trivial particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities,
as to know the true age of <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> and whether it was a golden
bough that <hi>Aeneas</hi> found. He quarrels too much with words, and I think
therefore deſerves no anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He conſiders not the excellent phraſe of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi>
nor the ſweet fluency of his Verſes, which is ſo apparent, that one that
underſtands no <hi>Latine</hi> may perceive it. He next ſets upon <hi>Ovid,</hi> and blames
him ſo much againſt reaſon, that he will never meet with any of his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He thinks it not well that he ſhould ſpeak of ſo many different Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities;
as if he could poſſibly ſpeak of any thing elſe in a time wherein he
was bred up in idolatry. As for his <hi>Metamorphoſes,</hi> they are not ſo extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
as he would make them at leaſt to make them appear ſo he ſhould have
quoted them; but for his part, he mentions only the opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> of
<hi>Metempſychoſy.</hi> If that Philoſopher had never been <hi>Euphorbas,</hi> 'twas his
fault that firſt ſet the ſtory on foot, not theirs that writ it ſince; yet if a
man would maintain he had ſaid truth, he might eaſily do it, though it be
held that <hi>Mercury</hi> made the ſouls drink the water of oblivion when they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
new bodies; For it may be imagined that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> alone had the
priviledg not to drink of it, that he might tell others that he had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times in the world, and that it was ſo with them all, as who paſſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
into the bodies of beaſts, that ſo they might abſtain from all creatures
that had any ſoul in them. <hi>Clarimond</hi> endeavouring to bring <hi>Ovid</hi> quite
into diſcredit, hath not ſtuck to ſay that there is no order at all in his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
He ſhould have conſidered that <hi>Ovid</hi> is a <hi>Poet,</hi> and not an <hi>Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
and that if he obſerved that order which Hiſtorians muſt not tranſgreſs,
his Metamorphoſes had not been near ſo pleaſant. <hi>Poetry</hi> is an <hi>art</hi> full of
<hi>fury,</hi> whoſe ornament is <hi>variety,</hi> and this is the reaſon that <hi>Arioſto</hi> for our
greater diverſion, hath ſo interlaced his narrations. Nor is <hi>Taſſo</hi> to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for quoting the ancient Divinities in his deſcriptions; he were no Poet
that ſhould not uſe Poeticall figures. And ſo I paſs by all thoſe Poets which
may be vindicated in that one word; and now I come to <hi>Ronſard,</hi> whom
<hi>Clarimond</hi> hath alſo preſumed to quarrel with, and reproach with a many
things he hath ſaid concerning the ancient <hi>Divinities,</hi> and his deſign to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> I cannot put my ſelf to the trouble to anſwer his
impertinent reaſons, for they were ſo feeble that I did not regard them nor
ſuffer them to make any impreſſion on my mind. I only remember that he
blamed <hi>Preſages,</hi> and ſome other <hi>ſuperſtitions,</hi> without which a man cannot
ſpeak <hi>naturally</hi> of any matter of Antiquity. He alſo rejects the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which have made <hi>Ronſard</hi> highly famous and eſteemed; for the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of a <hi>Poet</hi> ſhould not be ſo <hi>ſevere</hi> as thoſe of a <hi>Stoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>k</hi> Philoſopher; and
ſometimes for the diverſion of the readers, 'tis haply neceſſary he ſhould
digreſs to the deſcription of the noiſe of a Cart-wheel when it is overburthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or the cryes of birds of prey when they fight. As for the ſweetneſs of
<hi>Ronſards</hi> verſe, it could have been no greater conſidering his time. All the
world confeſs that the honour of having opened the dore to the advancement
of the French Tongue is due to him. Another thing my adverſary quarrels
at in his <hi>Franciad</hi> is, that all our Hiſtory is thruſt into it; but is there any
thing ſo clear as that <hi>Ronſard</hi> began to write in a Poetical ſtile, ſo that there
would have been no inequality in the piece though he had finiſhed it? And
if <hi>Clarimond</hi> think it ill that <hi>Hyanta</hi> ſhould relate things in ſuch order as if
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43725:193"/>
ſhe had read an effective ſtory out of ſome book, and if he think her expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
too clear for a Propheteſs in a fury, I will not condemn him, becauſe I
ſaid erewhile that Prophecies ought to be obſcure; for I maintain hers were
ſuch, and my reaſons ſhall be but what <hi>Clarimond</hi> hath ſaid himſelf. He ſaies
that ſometimes ſhe ſpoke of the myſteries of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, which
though we who underſtand them, think a thing clear, yet <hi>Francus</hi> could
not poſſibly hear any thing more obſcure. To <hi>Clarimonds</hi> queſtion, Why
he deſired not to know what it was, and how <hi>Hyanta</hi> ſhould ſpeak of ſuch
things being a <hi>Pagan,</hi> I anſwer, That <hi>Francus</hi> paſſed it by as a thing unknown
that touched him not; and as for <hi>Hyanta,</hi> ſhe was ſo poſſeſſed by the ſpirit
that made her ſpeak that ſhe knew not what ſhe had ſaid her ſelf. I doubt
not but <hi>Ronſard</hi> would have given us this ſatisfaction, had he continued his
work. As for the deſigne he had to bring <hi>Francus</hi> into the Country of the
<hi>Gaules</hi> there to build a City, he is very unjuſtly blamed, ſince that being a
Poet, he was permitted to feign what he pleaſed, beſides that his fiction was
not at ſuch a diſtance from the truth, but it had the warrant of moſt of our
Hiſtorians. When <hi>Clarimond</hi> had cenſured <hi>Ronſard,</hi> to whom ſo many Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
of his time gave place, he could not but contemn all the reſt, yet hath he
not preſumed to ſift their works, leſt it would have been too much pains, for
it muſt be conceived it could be no ſmall diſquiſition to ſearch out reaſons ſo
deſtructive to the common opinion: He therefore generally condemns them
all, becauſe they have quoted the ancient Fables. It muſt not be believed in
his opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there can be any good <hi>Mythologies,</hi> whereas we have ſuch
abundance of moſt excellent ones, that I know not how he hath been ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
as to ſay ſo. I paſs by all his proofs as being of no weight. I know
my Judge hath read books enough to have learned the contrary to what he
hath alleadged. But it is to much purpoſe for me to be angry with a man
who cannot be reconciled to the Poetry of the preſent age. Is it poſſible
that ſo many excellent wits as are at the Court could never do any thing
to ſatisfie him? Their ſweet ſongs, are they not able to charm him and make
him change his opinion? But here he comes to the ſecond part of his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and falls foul upon the books he calls <hi>Romances.</hi> He hath dealt moſt
unworthily by the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Hiſtory, and not finding any thing in that
piece deſerving juſt cenſure, he quarrels with little formalities. He thinks it
not fit that <hi>Pagans</hi> ſhould regard their dreams who are ſo ful of ſuperſtition.
That natural impatience that <hi>Gnemon</hi> is in to know the end of a Hiſtory,
he would make a ſtrange incongruity, and not conſidering that the world is
furniſhed with cowards as well as ſtout men, he falls out with the Author for
making that young man fearfull. Though <hi>Theagenes</hi> hath diſcovered his
generoſity in all actions whatſoever, yet he excuſes him not, and thinks he
hath not done enough. He would alſo perſwade us that the Loves of <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>
and <hi>Cloe</hi> are impertinent, though they excell in an incomparable natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And there he begins his controverſie with <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> againſt which, all he
can ſay is, that the books which treat of that ſubject, imitate one another.
This makes nothing againſt them, if ſo be they are good; and what he hath
alleadged againſt <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Montemajor</hi> is of no great weight. Though the
order of it ſhould be diſturbed, yet were the thing no leſs pleaſant, and as for
the Fables and Enchantments in it, all's pardonable. As for the <hi>Paſtorals</hi>
of <hi>Julietta,</hi> I think my ſelf the more obliged to vindicate that book, as being
the firſt was written in <hi>France</hi> of that kind. The happy condition of a
Shepherd to which heaven hath called me, engages me to do it. To anſwer
therefore what <hi>Clarimond</hi> hath ſaid of the Works of <hi>Ollenix</hi> of <hi>Montſacre,</hi>
I ſay that if that Author mentions not the abode of his Shepherds, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
little particulars; 'tis becauſe they are of no concernment. That he
makes the maids court the men, 'tis only to repreſent that they lived as 'twere
in the <hi>golden age,</hi> during which the laws of <hi>honour</hi> were not invented. And if
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43725:194"/>
in relating Hiſtories, they quote prophane and ſacred Authors, and mention
things hapned in our times, the reaſon is, that all being fiction, and it being
granted it is the Author that ſpeaks all through, he hath taken the liberty to
accommodate things as well to this age as to the ages paſt, for the greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of the readers. He is not therefore to be cenſured for that; and as for
<hi>Sidney</hi>'s <hi>Arcadia,</hi> ſince it hath croſſed the Sea to come and ſee us, I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Clarimond</hi> receives it with ſuch poor complements. If he hears nothing
of the Loves of <hi>Strephon</hi> and <hi>Clavis,</hi> he muſt not quarrel with the Author
who hath made his Book one of the moſt excellent in the world. There are
diſcourſes of <hi>Love</hi> and diſcourſes of <hi>State</hi> ſo generous and pleaſant, that I
ſhould never be weary to read them. I ſhould ſay much in his commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
were I not in haſte to ſpeak of <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> which <hi>Clarimond</hi> brings in next,
and I am very glad to find that Book generally eſteemed, which ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him to eſteem it alſo. If inſtead of the Title of <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> it had born
that of <hi>Galathea</hi> or <hi>Diana,</hi> he would have made the ſame complaint he does:
he would have asked why that Title more then another: But does he not
conſider that the book begins with the Loves of <hi>Aſtraea</hi> and <hi>Celadon,</hi> and that
moſt of the other Hiſtories are but circumſtances, ſo that the deſign is very
excellently taken. I muſt alſo tell <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that <hi>Hylas</hi> may be inconſtant,
and yet not be mad, as he ſuppoſes, and that there are in theſe daies a many
more inconſtant then he. As for <hi>Sylvander,</hi> if his Philoſophy be <hi>Platonick,</hi>
it is ſo much the better, ſince it is that Philoſopher hath taught us to love <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely.</hi>
If it be alleadged that in the time of <hi>Meroveus</hi> and <hi>Childerick,</hi>
there were no Shepherds in <hi>Forreſt</hi> could be acquainted with ſo much lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and civility as theſe, 'tis very indiſcreetly ſpoken. Who knows not but
that in books, things are raiſed to the greateſt perfection, and that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
mind that compoſed the <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> hath he not made it appear that he
doth not relate the Hiſtories of obſcure perſons, but deſcribes a ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of quality whoſe names and condition he diſguiſes? And if the order
of his narration had been nicely obſerved, he would not have been found to
fail in the <hi>Chronology,</hi> that's only a vain illuſion to frighten us withall. And
that <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſhould be angry that he hath not perfected his Book; what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
is it! what imprudence! will he not anon quarrel with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
We were not worthy to have amonſt us any longer that wonderfull
man whom death hath taken away from us: but I hope ſome able pen will
oblige us by the accompliſhment of what he hath deſign'd according to his
excellent notes and directions. Yet ſuppoſing this were not to be hoped, I dare
affirm, that though there wants a concluſion to this Work, yet it may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as perfect. He that is ignorant of it, let him read it, he will be ſuddenly
raviſhed into admiration, he will find what will make him ſlight all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
of our adverſary, he will be touched in the moſt ſenſible part of his
ſoul, and if he weeps not ſometimes for joy, and ſometimes for grief, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the occaſion, I will confeſs the envious and detractive have gained
the cauſe. I ſhall ſay as much for the Hiſtory of <hi>Argenis,</hi> which can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
to none but men without reaſon. <hi>Clarimond</hi> unjuſtly blames the
Author for having ſaid in what condition the affairs of the world were when
a Veſſel arrived in <hi>Sicily;</hi> for that does not relate only to the Veſſel, and
that the queſtion is not about that alone, but all the other things that are in
the body of the book which concern the affairs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> the <hi>Gaules, Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
Mauritania,</hi> and divers other Countries, ſo that here's no inequality;
nor any mixture of great things and little together. As for the Verſes which
are diſpoſed here and there, ſince they are moſt excellent, moſt unjuſt <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond,</hi>
will you find fault with him that gave them us, for to divert our
minds after they have been long employed in ſomething more ſerious? You
do well to tell us that the true cuſtomes of <hi>Sicily</hi> are not obſerved in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
every one confeſſes it as well as your ſelf, ſince it was only the Authors
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43725:194"/>
deſign, to repreſent divers accidents hapned in <hi>France.</hi> If you eſteem not
his intention becauſe he treats of theſe things with ſome obſcurity, ſhould
you not conſider that he was obliged to carry himſelf with that caution, it
being a thing not a little dangerous to ſpeak openly of the affairs of great
ones? As for the diſcourſes of State which are ſo ſeaſonably introduced,
'tis a black malice to blame a thing ſo noble. As for the interview of <hi>Poliar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
and <hi>Archombrotus,</hi> tis credible they ſpoke not but by thoſe furious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which <hi>Barclay</hi> deſcribes, and that <hi>Hyanisbe</hi> preſently ſeparated them.
<hi>Clarimond</hi> keeps alſo a ſtirr with the language of this book; he thinks there
are ſome new words; but if he obſerve it narrowly, there are none which
are not derived of other <hi>Latine</hi> words which are roots that may ſtill ſend
forth ſomewhat. He is no leſs injuſt when he ſpeaks againſt <hi>Lyſander,</hi> He
hath made long narrations of the divers ſucceſſes of the whole Hiſtory,
to prove they are but <hi>rencontres;</hi> but what would he have had more miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in a Hiſtory of our time? We have no more to do with thoſe ancient
ceremonies, and triumphs with all their ſumptuous preparations. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deſcribe Wars or ſtrange Combats, but we muſt be ſuſpected of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood.
We are now reduced to ſpeak only of ordinary things. <hi>Clarimond</hi>
miſlikes alſo that <hi>Lyſander</hi> ſhould be aſſaſſinated by the friends of <hi>Cloridan,</hi>
who had no hand in the buſineſs, as he afterwards declared to the King. Is
it impoſſible they ſhould bear him ſo much affection as to have engaged in
ſuch a deſign for his ſake; and may it not be preſumed on the other ſide that
he had intelligence of it, but that he denied it to preſerve the favour of his
Prince? The Challenge he afterwards ſent to <hi>Lyſander,</hi> ſufficiently diſcovers
his indignation; and this juſtifies <hi>d' Audiguier,</hi> whom, <hi>Clarimond</hi> taxes not to
know whom to make this Gentleman fight with, ſince <hi>Cloridan</hi> had a fair oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to challenge him, having been wounded by him in ſight of all the
Court. As for the <hi>Tale of the ſpirit,</hi> I will not maintain it to be true; it's
a query for a <hi>Divine,</hi> to know whether the ſouls departed can return hither; it
ſuffices I ſhould tel you that <hi>d' Audiguier</hi> making a Romance according to our
mode could not adorn it better, then by putting in it ſuch things as theſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the apparitions of the heatheniſh Gods, as you have them in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Romances;</hi> nor indeed is it alwaies neceſſary to bring in true things into
Hiſtories of this kind, but ſuch as <hi>the many</hi> take to be true: Now there is
nothing more certain then that there are many believe that ſpirits may be
ſpoken to, and have been ſeen ſometimes. <hi>Clarimond</hi> does alſo think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
<hi>Lidian</hi> ſhould preach, as if he knew the accompliſhments of that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.
He would not have <hi>Caliſta</hi> bear arms, as being too ſoft, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing of the art of War; but doth not <hi>d' Audiguier</hi> make this thing
eaſily credible, ſince he ſaies ſhe would not fight but purpoſly to die? As for
<hi>Hippolita</hi> and <hi>Erifila,</hi> they had a long time exerciſed themſelves in feats of
arms; nor was it ſuch a miracle to ſee people armed about <hi>Paris,</hi> ſince the
Author feigns that <hi>Tournaments</hi> were very frequent. What he hath in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
to this, relates much to the warlike humour of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great;</hi>
and though there was no ſuch thing, yet it was enough to ſhew it might be.
The admirable adventure of the Nymph is no more to be cenſured then the
reſt; for you find in modern Hiſtories, that Magitians of theſe times have
done the like. As for the faults of the language, if a point be forgotten, the
Author paies not the Printers ſcore; and if there be in <hi>Lyſander</hi> any <hi>Gaſcon</hi>
phraſes, there needs good eyes to find them. To be ſhort, <hi>Clarimond</hi> is like
that malicious Painter, who repreſented the feet of the Peacock, and not his
train. He mentions only what he likes not, but thoſe things he could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve,
he meddles not with. Why does he not conſider thoſe duels which
are ſo well deſcribed? Why does he not take notice of thoſe ingenious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
of <hi>Claranges</hi> to him that repreſented to him the grandeurs of the world,
to make him quit his <hi>Capuchin</hi>'s Cell? Hath he not obſerved how <hi>Lyſander</hi>
                           <pb n="77" facs="tcp:43725:195"/>
upon a diſdainfull humour of <hi>Caliſta,</hi> fell off from his marriage when all
their friends had conſented to it. In theſe and other places there are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
ſo charming, that though the Reader deſired to ſee the end of the
Book, yet would he wiſh withall it ſhould not end at all. For the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of <hi>Polyxena,</hi> though there be nothing but relations, yet are they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.
Since the principal end of <hi>Romances</hi> is to <hi>delight,</hi> 'tis requiſite there
ſhould be of all ſorts. And as to Romances in general, <hi>Clarimond</hi> hath ſaid
nothing but what he had ſaid divers times before. He imagins that all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
ſteal one from another, nay he hath been ſo unjuſt as to ſay that there
are few adventures in the <hi>Argenis</hi> which are not as common in other Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but he does not conſider aright. If there be a war in a book, or the
raviſhing of a maid, or the death of a King, and that in another there be
the ſame accidents, does that make the books alike? it cannot be, for upon
that account, the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory were no other thing then the <hi>Greek,</hi> becauſe
in both there are wars, raviſhings of maids, and deaths of Princes, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
make difference enough between things. Wars are begun upon
divers occaſions; maids may be raviſhed divers waies, and Princes are not
ſubject to one only kind of death, ſo that you ſtill find variety in our books;
and if you are not ſatisfied with them, you may in vain wiſh that God would
create another world, or another nature; for as long as we ſhall be what we
are, our Hiſtories can never conſiſt of any thing but ſuits of Law, Wars,
Death and Marriage. If my adverſary take it ill that in a Romance a man
relate a Hiſtory in the ſame words as another hath related it to him, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
not that it is the principal grace of a book, and that if he can make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it, 'tis for want of attention. It's eaſily ſeen he knows not what to
ſay againſt us, and that he can do nothing but follow the imaginations of his
own corrupt humours, ſince that in the concluſion of all, he could reproach
us with nothing but the complaints which are lowdly made againſt us, which
is a thing no leſs natural then that there ſhould be diverſity of paſſions. I
therefore conjure you, moſt juſt Judge, not to regard his ſeeble reaſons,
whereby he endeavours to make it appear to us, that the beſt <hi>Romances</hi> in
the world are worth nothing. It is moſt certain, that being made only for
<hi>pleaſure,</hi> and not obſerving the rigorous laws of Hiſtory, there may be
brought whatever the Author pleaſes, ſo that they preſent us with all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of <hi>Vertue</hi> that can be imagined. 'Tis in theſe we find pleaſure and
profit together, and where even women may learn Civility and Courtſhip.
Theſe things being true, and that it is granted there was never any man hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
but <hi>Clarimond</hi> that doubted of them, I beſeech you to preſerve <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances</hi>
in that reputation which they have gotten in the world, and more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
to confirm unto thoſe I have named, the honour and reſpect they
deſerve.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43725:197"/>
he did it only to exerciſe his wit, and that his heart hath ever thought contrary to
what his tongue hath ſpoken. 'Tis the ſame caſe as that of your Counſellors, who
to get money or reputation, entertain and maintain all the cauſes that come to
them, be they ever ſo bad. I deny not but <hi>Philiris</hi> hath alledg'd very ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
againſt mine; but to what purpoſe are they, ſince they only ſhew the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his wit, and not the innocency of thoſe he hath vindicated? They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
had never conſider'd of maintaining their works by any ſuch conſiderations
as his: for if they had had any ſuch, they would not have done their reputation
that injury as to have conceal'd them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having over-heard this diſcourſe, turns to <hi>Clarimond;</hi> Doſt thou think
thou ſpeakeſt truth in this? ſaies he to him; for my part I muſt confeſs, that though
thou haſt ſpoken againſt what I lov'd, yet had I a greater eſteem of thy eloquence
then I had ever; but when I heard <hi>Philiris,</hi> the caſe was altered. And I aſſure
you notwithſtanding all this, replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that you will finde <hi>Philiris</hi> anon
of another opinion then what he held. That will be a ſtrange blow indeed, ſaies
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> with a ſmile.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> by chance obſerving <hi>Liſetta</hi> near him, who was come to whiſper ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in her Miſtreſſes ear, would needs hold her by the ſleeve; which <hi>Lyſis</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
ſaid to <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> that their loves ſhould not be drawn out any further,
but a happy iſſue put to them. <hi>Liſetta</hi> preſently got away; and <hi>Amaryllis</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for her, that ſhe thought her ſelf very happy to be married to <hi>Carmelin;</hi> but
the queſtion was, whether he had means enough to maintain her. He hath ever
told me he was nothing in debt, replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and therefore I think him rich.
What's more, he's willing enough to work, and by that means he may in time come
to have a good flock of ſheep: As for his vertues, I paſs my word for him; and
if you will clap up an agreement, <hi>Love</hi> ſhall be the <hi>Notary,</hi> and ſhall draw up the
contract, and keep the copies of it. <hi>Amaryllis</hi> told him it were better to delay it
a little, that the two Lovers might try whether their conditions were ſuch as would
agree together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> upon this diſcourſe, went aſide to ſpeak with <hi>Hircan,</hi> who was gone
into a ſtudy at the end of the Hall, and all the counterfeit Shepherds with him.
Dear friends, ſaid he to them, we have taken our pleaſure ſufficiently of <hi>Lyſis.</hi>
His follies would henceforth be rather troubleſome to us then delightful, if we
ſhould ſuffer him to continue in them; beſides, it is ſome touch to conſcience, to
entertain a man ſtill in thoſe extravagances, which are repugnant to reaſon. You
are a great Orator, replies <hi>Meliantes,</hi> you would teach us the precepts of charity,
which we know as well as your ſelf. Why may we not yet a while enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
converſation of <hi>Lyſis?</hi> If he were poſſeſſed with any hurtful folly, you had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be ſo ready to reſtore him. His imaginations never carried him to do miſchief
to any man. If he does not hurt, 'tis certain he does no good, ſaies <hi>Clarimond;</hi>
and wheaeas his minde is capable of great things, if it were well guided; he is
now in ſuch a decay of ſpirits, that if he go on a while longer, it may be deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
to reſtore him. If you do not conſider this, repreſent to your ſelves, that if
you were reſolved to make further ſport with this poor Shepherd, you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it much longer, for <hi>Adrian</hi> or <hi>Anſelme</hi> will carry him away to <hi>Paris.</hi> 'Tis
there we would have him, replies <hi>Meliantes;</hi> 'twill be good ſport to govern him
in great companies. 'Twere a pitty ſo famous a place ſhould want this recreation.
That will never be, ſaies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> for aſſoon as he were there, they would chain
him up, leſt he ſhould run up and down the ſtreets and diſgrace his friends. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him now upon his departure, and learn in time to quit that ſatisfaction you
muſt ſome time be depriv'd of. Conſider that there will be no leſs pleaſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
<hi>Lyſis</hi> to his wits, then there would be to continue him in his madneſs as you
deſire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> was of the ſame opinion, and <hi>Philiris</hi> too, ſo that they ſoon brought
their companions to the ſame point. They then thought it a very good work to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
their Shepherd to himſelf again; and the hopes they had to do it were not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43725:198"/>
ſmall, when they repreſented to themſelves, that <hi>Lyſis</hi> had good natural faculties,
which he could not but diſcover in his greateſt extravagances. His diſcourſes and
his inventions amaz'd all the world; and if his errors had not hindred him from
employing his ſubtilty in good things, he had never done any thing diſcommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>While they were in this diſcourſe, a ſerving man came and told <hi>Hircan</hi> that the
<hi>Hermit</hi> was at the door for an alms. They call'd him by no other name, becauſe
there was no other Hermit thereabouts, and it was the ſame that <hi>Lyſis</hi> had me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
ſome time before. <hi>Hircan</hi> having given order he ſhould come up, the Shepherd
preſently call'd him to minde, and went and ſaluted him with a great deal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement.
I am very glad my Couſin is acquainted with you, ſaies <hi>Adrian</hi> to the
Hermit, I ſhould heartily wiſh you would make him walk in the way of vertue. I
doubt not but he is very well given thereto, replies the Hermit; he was almoſt
perſwaded to enter into that contemplative way of life that I follow; but I believe
all the hurt that's in him, is that he is ſtill in love. I am ſo, and ſhall be eternally
(ſaies <hi>Lyſis</hi> in a loud Tone) <hi>Charite</hi> is ſhe that I love; my Couſin hath ſeen her,
all the Shepherds know her, the Birds, the Trees, the Rocks and the Fountains
are not ignorant who ſhe is; for when I complain of my miſery, every thing, even
to that which hath no ſoul, aſſumes one to hearken to me. Provided your love
aims not but at a faithful marriage, ſaies the Hermit, I ſhall never be among thoſe
that will blame you; for marriage was inſtituted by our Saviour, who after the
creation of the world, beſtow'd <hi>Eve</hi> on <hi>Adam;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaies, <hi>It is better
to marry then to burn;</hi> but away with ſinful concupiſcence, if ſo be your ſoul be
ſtain'd with it. The waters of the cleareſt ſprings are not more pure then my deſires,
replies <hi>Lyſis;</hi> I know incontinence deſtroys both mens bodies, and their mindes,
and that it is like thoſe fruits that grow about the Lake <hi>Aſphalt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tes,</hi> which ſeem fair
and ripe, but within are nothing but aſhes. Ever from my infancy, I have known
what belong'd to the two ways which preſented themſelves to the great <hi>Alcides;</hi>
and two women made their orations to me, as they did to him, but I follow'd her
that led me into the rough way of vertue, though the other would have led me an
eaſier way. I now go upon thorns, whereas others tread upon roſes; but I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſure to come to that eternal glory which ſo many Heroes have ſought after. 'Tis
for that we muſt ſwear, 'tis for that we muſt go naked, having nothing but a club
to overcome monſters, the enemies of mankinde: And 'tis for that in brief, that
we muſt forſake the pleaſures of this life, and live upon earth, as if we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
of the other world; that is to ſay, have no other entertainment for the moſt
part then good meditations.</p>
            <p>The Hermit was extreamly pleas'd at this diſcourſe, for he interpreted all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
and imagin'd that <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſpoke of the glory of Paradice, and that he would
quell the Monſters which are our enemies; that is to ſay the Devils. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
turning to <hi>Adrian,</hi> ſaid to him, Do you not ſee your own happineſs in ſo
learned a Kinſman as you have? I have heard very few Preachers ſpeak better then
he does. What reputation would he in time come to, ſhould he enter into that
calling! I ſhould be very glad would he give himſelf thereto, replies <hi>Adrian;</hi> if
you had heard other diſcourſes of his, you would have been amaz'd. He will ſpeak
to you three hours together, without any trouble, and I know not whence he
hath what he ſaies: for the moſt part he is ſo deeply learned, that I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
one half. It muſt be conceiv'd he hath done nothing all his life time but
read. And it hath ſo happen'd, he hath taken a man, who is almoſt as great a
Schollar as himſelf. But I muſt tell you, that I think all their knowledge is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
or rather hurtful to them; for they employ it only in thoſe things
which I can by no means approve. Is this true? ſaies the Hermit to <hi>Lyſis;</hi> do
you abuſe the good gifts which God hath beſtow'd on you? My friend, will you
not obſerve all the articles of our faith? I obſerve my faith to <hi>Charite,</hi> replies <hi>Lyſis;
I</hi> have promis'd her before the throne of Love, to be eternally hers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How! what
impiety's this? cryes out the good Father; when you are ſpoken to concerning
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43725:198"/>
God, you ſpeak of his creatures, as if you would adore them inſtead of him. If you
will not addreſs yourſelf immediately to his infinite Majeſty, becauſe of the greatneſs
of your ſins, recommend your ſelf to ſome good Saint, that may deliver you from
the pains of hell. She is a fair <hi>Saint</hi> that I ſerve, ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> and 'tis certain ſhe can
deliver me from the pains of hell, ſince by her cruelty ſhe could condemn me to
them. Nay, ſhe can do greater things then that: All that are in this houſe can
aſſure you that this morning ſhe rais'd me from death to life. Inform your ſelf of
this miracle. My Couſin is a Heathen, cries out <hi>Adrian;</hi> alas! there's no queſtion
of it: He's worſe then a <hi>Mah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>metan:</hi> Ah! what curſed Books are theſe that
have thus deſtroy'd him!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> and the reſt of the Gentlemen came in at this noiſe. <hi>Clarimond</hi> having
underſtood the controverſie, perceiv'd the Hermite was not able enough to convert
the Shepherd. As for his own part, he thought now was the time to try whether
he might be more fortunate then another in the deſign he had to reſtore him to his
ſenſes, by the help of thoſe artifices which he had reſolved to make uſe of. There are
a many things which I muſt communicate to you before this honorable aſſembly,
ſays he to him. 'Tis now that I am to ſhew you that I am really your friend, as I
told you ſome dayes ſince: 'Tis <hi>Philiris</hi> and his companions that are your enemies,
though you have ever thought the contrary; they have hitherto promoted your
humours, and 'tis that hath put you into the way of deſtruction. Since your coming
to years of diſcretion you have read a many fabulous books, which you have taken
as true, for want of being acquainted with ſome one that could diſcreetly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
you of your erroneous opinions. I muſt not any longer conceal my thoughts
as I have heretofore, which I did only by degrees to inſinuate into your good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that I might be permitted one day to ſpeak freely to you. You have juſt now
diſcover'd the greateſt extravagance in the world; you have ſpoken of your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
as of ſomwhat divine, though you cannot but know ſhe is a mortal creature
that eats and drinks as any of us do. You ſaid you had no faith but for her; have
you quite forgotten the faith of your Fathers, and turn'd Idolater?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſeeing he was ſet upon more vehemently as to this point then ever he had
been before, was not ſo extravagant, but he call'd to mind the good precepts had
been infus'd into him in his infancie; ſo that at this very firſt aſſault of <hi>Clarimonds</hi>
he was almoſt chang'd into another man. He was therefore forc'd to anſwer, that
he acknowledged no other God then him that had created heaven and earth, and
that he had ever ador'd him in the ſame manner as his father had taught him. As
for <hi>Charite</hi> to whom he gave divine attributes, it was only to accommodate himſelf
to the ſtile of the <hi>Poets,</hi> whom he was reſolved to imitate. This is not all you have
done, there's much more, ſays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> you have ever talk'd of an infinity of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Gods, as if there were really any ſuch; and yet whoſoever adores this great
God who hath given us our beings, looks upon all thoſe little Gods as having no
ſubſiſtence but in fables, which men feign'd while they were yet in their firſt errors.
Have you not told us a hundred times, that there was a <hi>Diana</hi> in the woods with
her <hi>Nymphs,</hi> that there are <hi>Hamadryads</hi> and Gods of the River, and Nymphs of
Fountains? You have endeavoured to make all thoſe believe it that you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
with, or came neer you; and you once caſt yourſelf into the water to go and
viſit the <hi>aquatick</hi> Divinities. <hi>I</hi> know not whether your fellow-Shepherds were ſuch
fools as to believe there were any in the world. It need not ſeem ſo ſtrange that <hi>I</hi>
believe there are ſuch Divinities, replies <hi>Lyſis: I</hi> have not only read it in Books
which have been made by <hi>Pagans,</hi> but in ſuch as have been made by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who
are alive at this day. What you ſay may be true, replies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> but thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have writ that only as a fable; and if you doubt of it, be judg'd by <hi>Muſardan.</hi>
This Poet was ſtill in the place; ſo that he confeſs'd that it was not to be queſtion'd
but that himſelf and all thoſe that wrote books ſpoke of thoſe ancient Divinities as
a thing fained, only for the ornament of their Poeſies, though it had ſometime been
a main truth, and believ'd, and that very paſſionately, by a many nations. You ſee
what they think of it whom you have ever followed, ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> ſince you will
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43725:199"/>
needs embrace their doctrine, you muſt believe what they ſay, and you are not more
learned then your maſters in the lectures they read to you. You are moreover to
conſider, that ſince there is but one Almighty God, all your little Gods cannot
ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>Since you will have me follow the dictate of reaſon with you, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> I will
declare one thing to you, which I would not communicate to any other perſon
whatſoever; and that is, that I know very well that they are not really <hi>Divinities</hi>
which are conceived to be in the fields, but they are ſo called in a certain manner
of ſpeaking; They are only <hi>Spirits</hi> under divers forms. And to make it appear to
you that it is ſo, I have not only read in the <hi>Poets</hi> whom you tax with <hi>lying,</hi> but
alſo in Authors that pretend to be <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and ſuch as I dare ſay would be
<hi>Divines.</hi> Witneſs <hi>Agrippa</hi> in his <hi>Occult Philoſophy:</hi> 'Tis well known he ſpeaks
every where as a good Chriſtian, and quotes paſſages of the holy Scripture; but yet
having diſpoſed his Spirits through all the Elements, when he comes to thoſe he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
for the Earth and the Water, he calls them by all thoſe divers names we
find in the Poets: He grants there are <hi>Fawns, Dryads</hi> and <hi>Hamadryads</hi> in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
and <hi>Nayads</hi> in the Fountains; nay he denies not but <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and the
other Gods are each of them in his ſeveral heaven, exerciſing that power which the
Ancients attributed to them. He alſo tels you at large what names to call them by,
and in what manner they are to be invocated in his operations. Now we never uſe
invocation towards things that have no power. As for his part, he calls them the
Governours of the World: but it is my buſineſs only to tell you, that his meaning
was, that they are Spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrippa</hi> then it ſeems is one of your Authors, ſayes <hi>Clarimond:</hi> you have been
extremely reſerv'd, that we never knew you ſtudied his doctrine before. Know then
that it is as impertinent a Fellow as ever you met with; he mingles Divinity with
fables: And though he hath a mind to dreſs up a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>lawfull</hi> Magick,
yet he makes uſe of that of <hi>Hermes</hi> and other prophane Authors. Becauſe that in the
magick of the Ancients the Planets were invocated, as alſo the reſt of the inferior Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinities,
he hath ſpoken in the ſame manner, as if it could be done ſtill: But the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity
was ſo great, that he hath entreated all the world to pardon him, excuſing
it as an error of his youth. This I find in his book of the <hi>Vanity of the Sciences:</hi>
there he retracts all. <hi>Clarimond</hi> is in the right, ſayes <hi>Philiris,</hi> there's no anſwer to
be made to what he hath ſaid. But though <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſhould not believe there were
<hi>Dryads</hi> and <hi>Nayads,</hi> ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> it follows not I ſhould be of his opinion: Do I not
remember that I have ſeen ſo many rural Divinities, when I was chang'd into a
Tree? There was never any ſuch thing, ſayes <hi>Clarimond;</hi> and I tell you once more,
that there was never in this world any body ſo changed. Do you not remember
the reaſons I alleadg'd once againſt <hi>Metamorphoſes?</hi> I told you there was none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the heathens but the ſimple people, that believed any ſuch thing could be;
beſides that it was by accident that theſe opinions got any credit among them. I
gave you an account of divers perſons who were thought to have chang'd forms,
and more particularly that of the Robber, who was thought to be chang'd into a
Raven. I told you the Poets had brought thoſe things into reputation by their
Verſes; and if I am not deceiv'd, <hi>Philiris, Fontenay,</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
my reaſons: I know not whether they have been ſince poiſoned by your
errors.</p>
            <p>I remember all this, ſays <hi>Lyſis,</hi> but I value it not. We remember it very well,
ſays <hi>Fontenay,</hi> but we found a great deal of truth in it. You then believe impoſtures,
replies the Shepherd all in a heat. This is not the only point you will be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
in, ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> be not angry yet, ſtay a while, and you ſhall have much
more reaſon. I muſt tell you, that ſince all theſe Divinities you have talk'd of are
but fictions, you had no reaſon to make all theſe Gentlemen put on Shepherds
habit, making them believe that you would make them happy by that means, and
bring them into converſation with the immortals. As for your <hi>golden age,</hi> you know
what I ſaid to you of it; I told you plainly, that to make that return, we muſt put
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43725:199"/>
on as much ſavageneſs as thoſe of the new found world. There was never any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
that that kinde of life could be as delightful as ours.</p>
            <p>What hath <hi>Lyſis</hi> then deceiv'd us? cries out <hi>Philiris;</hi> I had little reaſon to come
ſo far to finde him. If he knows no more then I have yet ſeen, the Shepherds of our
Country know as much, I will return to them. And ſhall I, ſaies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> ſtay
here with an Impoſtor, who hath promis'd me ſuch wonders if I would continue
Shepherd? O! Couſin <hi>Hircan,</hi> give me my red ſuit again. <hi>Polidor</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi>
ſaid alſo, they would be no longer Shepherds; ſo that <hi>Hircan</hi> deſired them to be
quiet, and told them they ſhould all have what cloathes they had brought to his
houſe. <hi>Lyſis</hi> extreamly troubled at this revolt, told them they would at leiſure
repent their forſaking him: but <hi>Clarimond</hi> bid him not to be ſo perſwaded, and
told him he would make it appear to him, that he had never known the leaſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of condition, ſince he turned Shepherd, and that of all he had believed,
there had nothing happened to him; and to that purpoſe he thus continued the
diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>You are then to imagine, that I am better acquainted with your adventures then
your ſelf, for I have not only learn'd what you thought of them, but alſo what
others conceiv'd who have abus'd you.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, being come to St. <hi>Clou,</hi> where you put on your Paſtoral habit,
<hi>Anſelme</hi> having found you, as you admir'd your precious reliques, was ſo far from
blaming you for it, that he hearkned attentively to your extravagant hiſtory; but
what amazement muſt he have been in, to ſee you eſteem ſo highly the fouleſt things
in the world; and having promis'd you great aſſiſtance, ſuch as was that of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Charite's</hi> picture, you took him for the God <hi>Pan.</hi> The Poets never told you
that the <hi>Sylvane</hi> God pretended to any skill in painting, but you thought there
could be nothing impoſſible to a god. I will not mention the reaſons you alledg'd
to your Gardian, to perſwade him that you ought to be a Shepherd, and that he
ſhould be one too, if he had any deſign to be happy. There hath been laughing
enough at that impertinence already; I ſhall only mention that ſimplicity of yours
to go and ſpeak to a country Lobcock in <hi>Poetical</hi> and <hi>Romantick</hi> terms. The powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
you attributed to <hi>Charite,</hi> put him into ſuch a fright, that he and all his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
were alarm'd all that night, imagining the end of the world to be at hand;
I know not whether any dyed upon that fright. If any ſuch thing had happened,
you had been the cauſe of their death, and you would have been puniſh'd as a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer.
You would alſo needs interrogate the <hi>Eccho,</hi> but you were neatly cheated;
for whereas you imagin'd it was the Eccho of the Poets that had anſwered you, it
was this <hi>Anſelme</hi> whom you ſee, who cannot deny it. You might have perceiv'd
then, how much he ſlighted and laught at the extravagances of the Poets, by the
ſtories he told you about that repetition of the voyce, and concerning the three
Deſtinies. He alſo laugh'd at that opinion of yours about the Sun, taking what is
ſaid of it litterally. You are to know, there is but one, and if we finde it in the
morning in another quarter, though he hath been hidden from us, yet it did only
paſs under us, to enlighten the other Hemiſphere, and did not reſt in the ſea, as
your impertinent Authors tell you. Yet <hi>Anſelme</hi> comply'd with you ſo far, as to
make you another promiſe of <hi>Charites</hi> picture. I paſs by your extravagance in
the Inn, of not eating ought but what was red. This you would needs do, and
your humor was ſatisfied. You perceived well enough that you had already deceiv'd
your ſelf, when <hi>Anſelme</hi> told you that it was not handſome to play the <hi>Shepherd</hi> at
St. <hi>Clou,</hi> and it was a great argument he told you the truth, when ſuch a rout bore
you company with ſtones. You were alſo pittifully abus'd when you took a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
fellow for a <hi>Satyre;</hi> for who hath ever ſeen any in <hi>France,</hi> unleſs it be in
picture, or only by diſguiſe in Paſtorals and Masks? Nay, where were there ever
any ſeen in the world; There's mention only of two or three, but they were mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
things extraordinary in nature. As for the picture which <hi>Anſelme</hi> gave you,
do you not ſee he did it only to abuſe thoſe deſcriptions of beauty which are in the
Poets? Do you think your ſelf that the features of that <hi>Metaphorical</hi> face are like
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43725:200"/>
thoſe of the <hi>Natural</hi> face of your Miſtreſs? Though that were poſſible, amidſt ſo
many ſeveral colours, 'tis not <hi>Anſelme</hi> hath done it, for he is not ſo good a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as that there can any excellent things come from him, he can only ſhadow
Copper-pieces. I ſtick not to ſay this before him, becauſe his reputation lies ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. 'Twas alſo out of abuſe, that he permitted you to be Judge in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between him and <hi>Montenor;</hi> and though you had not given judgement on
his ſide, <hi>Geneura</hi> had nevertheleſs been fruſtated of her expectation. He ſeem'd
to attribute great authority to your words: your <hi>Serenade</hi> and your Love-letters
were in his opinion ridiculous enough, but you abus'd your ſelf more egregiouſly,
when you kiſs'd the clapper of <hi>Leonora's</hi> door, while you perceiv'd not you were
ſprinkled with Urine inſtead of Roſe-water. I omit many little particulars, as the
Garlands wherewith you would adorn the portalls of <hi>Charites</hi> pallace, and the
meeting with the Merchants of <hi>Paris,</hi> whom you took for <hi>Pirates.</hi> In all theſe
were you as ſtrangely deluded as could be imagin'd. When you were one evening at
<hi>Charite's,</hi> 'twas pleaſantly imagin'd of you that the candle could have been lighted
at her eyes: If the Poets finde out ſo many conceptions upon the flames which
iſſue out of their Miſtreſſes eyes, they muſt be eſteem'd no other then Poetical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences.
I cannot but laugh at your extravagant jealouſie the day following,
when you found <hi>Charite</hi> aſleep in the garden. You were jealous of your own ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
nay of the very Atoms, and therefore with much more reaſon of any thing
that touch'd her, as the graſs whereon ſhe lay. You imagin'd the Sun made a noiſe,
as he went through the heaven, and that the plants did the like in growing: You af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
committed a world of fooleries, and the perfection of your extravagance
was, that being near <hi>Charite</hi> in the Court, you believed the fire of her eyes had
burnt your hat, when it was one of <hi>Anſelmes</hi> Lacqueys had done it with a Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs:
In conſequence of this opinion, you imagin'd the next day that you were
all afire, and went and caſt your ſelf into a fountain, where you had been drown'd
had not ſudden relief come. Being after this at <hi>Paris,</hi> you went to <hi>Burgundy-houſe,</hi>
where you took the <hi>Comedy</hi> for a <hi>truth,</hi> making better ſport to all the world then
any play. 'Twas another good humor of yours, when you believed that the picture
of an imaginary Shepherd was your own, and when you aſtoniſh'd the Stationer
in St. <hi>James</hi> ſtreet with your words and actions. The diſcourſe you held with <hi>Cecilia</hi>
when you lay at her houſe were very pleaſant, and 'twas pretty to ſee you come
into this Country, when you thought you had gone into <hi>Forreſts.</hi> This cheat you
are convinc'd of, you can ſay nothing to it. Here's <hi>Anſelme</hi> preſent that can Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
it, and not only this, but all the reſt, in caſe you will deny them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> upon this advanc'd, and very ſeriouſly confirm'd all that <hi>Clarimond</hi>
had ſaid; whereat <hi>Lyſis</hi> was ſo daſh'd, that he ſuffered the other to proceed in his
reproaches.</p>
            <p>Do you not alſo remember, ſaies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that I began to diſcover you by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
error of yours at my houſe: You took my mother for the ſage <hi>Felicia;</hi> 'tis
true, ſhe is ſage, but not <hi>Felicia.</hi> You were afterward mightily deceived, when you
thought I would have taken your part; and again, when you gave your Miſtreſs a
<hi>Serenade,</hi> you thought it was an <hi>Hamadryad</hi> that anſwered you on the Lute, for it
was our friend <hi>Hircan,</hi> whom I had given notice to of your enterpriſe. The good
Hermit here preſent can alſo witneſs, that you ſpoke to him as if he had been a
<hi>Druid,</hi> or ſome <hi>Magician,</hi> becauſe you had read in your books, that the Hermites
did ſometimes practiſe Magick, and thought there was no ſin in it. The moſt match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
deluſion was, that when you afterwards met <hi>Hircan,</hi> you took him for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician,
and thought the Gentlewoman whom you called <hi>Synopa</hi> a Nymph of the
waters. 'Twas as good a trick when you imagined that this cunning man, had
changed you ſo perfectly into a maid, that you were taken for no other. Being a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
in that ſex at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, you were accuſed of incontinence; and for tryal, they
made you get up on a braſs plate, which could not hurt you, there being no fire
under; I came and proffered to dye for you; and when <hi>Leonora</hi> had commanded
you to be burnt, <hi>Hircan</hi> came and deliver'd you from the injuſtice of your enemies;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43725:200"/>
but all this was but a Comedy, for it was ſo well known that you were <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that
the very children knew it, and they had much ado to keep them from telling you
ſo. Being afterward come to my houſe with <hi>Carmelin,</hi> you did ſo many extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances
that my Mother was amaz'd at it; but I paſs by that, to come to your
<hi>Metamorphoſis.</hi> Having fallen by chance into a hollow Willow, you imagin'd
you were become a tree, though none elſe thought ſo. What confirm'd you in
this was, that <hi>Synopa</hi> came and viſited you that night with two maids, who called
themſelves <hi>Hamadryads:</hi> one of them is here yet. As for the God <hi>Morin,</hi> who
came after, it was <hi>Hircan,</hi> and <hi>Lucida</hi> was <hi>Amaryllis;</hi> and for the <hi>Cypreſs-tree,</hi>
it was a ſerving-man. The fables which were related to you, were purpoſely made
to abuſe you; and all the other particulars of that adventure were out of deſign.
The ſecond night <hi>Anſelme, Montenor</hi> and my ſelf clad our ſelves like Gods of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
to come and viſit you; and that we ſpoke not, was for fear we might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.
When we had ſufficiently made ſport with you and <hi>Carmelin, Hircan</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to you like a Magician. <hi>Anſelme</hi> and I acted the two winds which blew
down the Tree <hi>Lyſis,</hi> who afterwards thought he was become a man again: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was no hard matter to perſwade him to be one. If you will not credit this,
call to minde the falſe birds which you found in this houſe ſome days ſince, they
were the ſame we had on when we acted the Gods of the Rivers, and for the reſt
of our dreſſings, you ſhall be ſhewn them at any time. Since that, many things have
happened to you which were very remarkable; and above all, the diſcourſe which
paſt between you and me concerning the Poets was very excellent, which had this
effect, that you ſent a Bill to be poſted up in <hi>Paris.</hi> You receiv'd a <hi>Command with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Command</hi> from your Miſtreſs, and then you would needs be ſick, becauſe ſhe
was. But that which is moſt admirable, is the abuſe which <hi>Philiris, Polidor, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantes</hi>
and <hi>Fontenay</hi> put upon you. They made you believe they were turn'd Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
for your ſake, and that indeed you may make good, but if they did it, 'twas
to make ſport with you. <hi>Philiris</hi> is no Shepherd by birth, <hi>Fontenay</hi> never had any
minde to that condition of life; and as for <hi>Polidor</hi> and <hi>Meliantes,</hi> they are <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
as much as I am: All the ſtories they have related to you, have been forg'd
out of their own brains. As for <hi>Lucida</hi> and <hi>Synopa,</hi> you were very credulous when
you ſaw them, to imagine they were both Shepherdeſſes, and not the Nymphs
you had ſeen before. As for <hi>Synopa,</hi> ſhe is return'd to her own houſe, and was
not; as you conceive, chang'd into a Rock: The Country people hereabouts will
tell you, that the rock which you would have <hi>Carmelin</hi> love, hath been time out
of minde in the ſame place where you found it. The <hi>Hamadeyad</hi> you ſaw in the
day, was <hi>Liſetta</hi> cover'd over with <hi>bark.</hi> As for the Ambaſſadors from <hi>Paris</hi> who
came to you, they had only put on the names: And as for the enchanted Caſtle,
whither you were carried in a Coach, 'twas a houſe of <hi>Hircans,</hi> which you may
ſee when you pleaſe: we were the Gyants, and the hulch-back Souldiers, and you
were no more invulnerable then any other. You went not through the ayr, neither
coming nor going; for I aſſure you that <hi>Hircan</hi> never pretended to be a Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
When you thought to have carried away <hi>Charite,</hi> you only laid hold of a
Bug-bear, which <hi>Orontes</hi>'s Maids had dreſs'd on purpoſe for you. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
my diſcourſe, you have not taken any poiſon to make away your ſelf, and
conſequently <hi>Charites</hi> eyes have not rais'd you to life again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> having thus ended his diſcourſe, <hi>Lyſis</hi> was on the point to render
himſelf, and yet he made him this anſwer. What, wilt thou then deprive me of the
glory of ſo many noble actions? Can it be poſſible that ſo many honeſt people
have deceiv'd me? <hi>Anſelme</hi> hath already confeſs'd he hath done ſo, but may I
believe it for the reſt? Though we came to take our leaves of you, as pretending
to return into the Country whence we came<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> replies <hi>Philiris,</hi> yet muſt we confeſs
that it was to play the laſt of our pranks with you. And for my part, ſays <hi>Hircan,</hi>
I was never any Magician: I aſſure you that all that <hi>Clarimond</hi> hath ſaid is true,
and I will give you what proofs of it you pleaſe to deſire; I will ſhew you all the
dreſſes wherein we have been diſguis'd to bring about theſe notable adventures,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43725:201"/>
and will bring you all the Country hereabouts to tell you who I am, and who theſe
Gentlemen are that have plaid the Shepherds.</p>
            <p>All that were preſent having made <hi>Lyſis</hi> the like aſſurances of the truth, and that
very ſeriouſly, he was ſo touch'd with grief and indignation to have been ſo long
deceived, that notwithſtanding all his extravagance he fell a weeping, which with
an acceſſion of ſhame made him run away into a chamber where there was nobody.
<hi>Clarimond</hi> having followed him thither, he cries out as ſoon as he perceiv'd him,
O God! with what impoſtures hath my youth been abuſed? You would needs
make us believe you were a <hi>Tree,</hi> and many other ſuch things, ſayes <hi>Clarimond;</hi>
we could do no leſs then endeavour to abuſe you too. You have no reaſon to be
angry with any for deluding you, for we were all forc'd to it, ſince you were the
firſt deceiv'd your ſelf, and that to comply with you there was no other way but
by deceiving you. We muſt needs have given way to the firſt violence of your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
leſt by too great oppoſition they would have turn'd to fury. For my part
I am he hath with the firſt endeavoured to undeceive you, and you may have taken
notice of it; and 'tis in this caſe that you have had teſtimony of that friendſhip
which I have ſo often boaſted you. Let it appear that I have employ'd my time
well this day, and that you will no longer perſiſt in thoſe errors which have hitherto
troubled your brain.</p>
            <p>What muſt I then do? ſays <hi>Lyſis;</hi> adviſe me, that ſo I may not be deſtitute of
all things. I have erewhiles ſufficiently ſhewn you the impertinences of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
books, replies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> and through a fatal chance, all thoſe who have
entertain'd you hitherto have ſhewn you as much, though poſſibly without any
deſign of theirs. All the ſtories which were told you one night of the rural Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were ſo ridiculous, that you need no more to diſengage your faith from Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Transformations. As for the hiſtories of the four Shepherds, I have already
ſaid ſomwhat by way of example concerning the four kinds of <hi>Romances.</hi> Since
<hi>Synopa</hi> had before given you a Relation of <hi>Metamorphoſes,</hi> it was requiſite the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of <hi>Fontenay</hi> ſhould repreſent a <hi>Romance</hi> after the ancient mode, where they
talk of <hi>Nayads,</hi> men falling in love with themſelves as <hi>Narciſſus</hi> did, and the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of Magicians. As for the hiſtory of <hi>Philiris,</hi> it repreſented a Romance full of
ſympathie, ſweetneſs and paſſion, ſuch as might paſs in this age, giving only the
names of Shepherds to the perſons introduc'd. As for what paſs'd between <hi>Polidor</hi>
and <hi>Rhodogina,</hi> there's an example of thoſe tales that old wives tell children, and of
ſuch as I call <hi>Italian</hi> fables, becauſe the Italians were the firſt broachers of them.
<hi>Straparole</hi> hath made a ſort of them in his <hi>Merry-nights,</hi> and divers others have
imitated him. As for the adventures of <hi>Meliantes,</hi> they are according to the mode
of your military <hi>Romances;</hi> and it is not to be forgotten that even <hi>Carmelin</hi> in the
relation of his life hath given us an example of thoſe <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Romances, wherein
are repreſented the ſhifts and cheats of Beggers and Servants. It will be eaſily
granted that all theſe Narrations exceed thoſe I allow them for preſidents; for
though they are not ſo long, yet do they contain better things, and all through
diſcover both order and invention. However I muſt tell you they are ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant,
and worthy to be contemn'd: And upon this ground I am to perſwade
you not to give yourſelf any more to the reading of ſuch ſtories, ſince the beſt of
them are not worth any thing; and that if you read any, it may be to laugh at
them, or at the moſt for a tranſient pleaſure, without ever imagining that you
ſhould live like the perſons which are mentioned in them. Your deſire was to
imitate the Shepherds, though there be no pleaſure in that kind of life; a
man may live well enough in the Country, without carrying a ſheephook: See
how <hi>Hircan</hi> lives, ſee how <hi>Orontes,</hi> ſee how I live: We live always here, we go a
hunting, we go a fiſhing, we walk abroad, we do what we pleaſe; is not that all
you can deſire? Whereas if we were Shepherds, we muſt look after our Flocks,
which were a thing of too much trouble: one while a Sheep would be gone aſtray,
which muſt be found again; another while a Wolf would make bold with one,
and that muſt be purſu'd and recover'd; or it may be a Rot would ſeize all our
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43725:201"/>
flock, and it would be no ſmall employment to make them ſound again. What
means is there for men to enjoy themſelves, as you would deſire to do, amidſt
theſe ſeveral occupations which belong only to ſervants? you will tell me, that the
Shepherds mention'd in the books, were not ſo careful of their flocks, and that they
entruſted them to others; or it may be they had not any at all. You muſt then
grant me, that there is no neceſſity of keeping ſheep in point of happineſs; nor
conſequently to be clad in white, and carry a ſheephook: for the equipage of a
Shepherd, is not neceſſary to him that does not actually profeſs Shepherdry; and
when you ſhall quote me the examples of divers who have wore ſuch a habit as
yours, and yet kept no flocks, I ſhall confeſs that your Books are true; but if ever
any did wear ſuch a habit, they did it only out of conformity to ſome they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd
with, which cannot be ſaid of you, ſince you were for ought we know the
only <hi>Romantick</hi> Shepherd in <hi>France,</hi> when you began to be ſo firſt. Now do not
tell me, that you know well enough that there are not many of your quality, but
that your deſign is to bring Shepherdry into its former reputation; for to what
purpoſe ſhould you do ſo? I tell you once more, that without all that trouble you
may enjoy all the pleaſures in the world. Remember what <hi>Fontenay</hi> did one day
caſt in your teeth, when he compar'd you to <hi>Don Quixot;</hi> there will be many
who will not ſtick to believe you imitate him, and when your adventures ſhall tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
his, they will be look'd on no otherwiſe then greater arguments of your
madneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> was in a deep conſideration all the time of this diſcourſe, and his minde
being more clear'd up then ordinary, the admonitions of <hi>Clarimond</hi> were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
to him. Now that you have deprived me of my companions, ſaies he to
him, will you have me quit the Shepherds habit? I am ſo far from robbing you of
your Companions, replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that <hi>Philiris</hi> and the reſt will be more with
you then ever, and will be eternally your friends; but for the Shepherds habit, you
have no mans approbation to wear it any longer. If you only took that from me,
'twere no great matter, ſafes <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but you will alſo take away all teſtimonies of
the affection I deſire to bear <hi>Charite,</hi> and 'tis a great hazard you will not take away
that very <hi>Charite</hi> from me. The teſtimonies of your affection to your Miſtreſs
hitherto have been too extravagant, ſaies <hi>Clarimond.</hi> Thoſe must conſiſt in things
that ſpeak reaſon, and diſcretion, and you will finde, if you follow my directions,
that you ſhall obtain whatever you deſire of her, for I am very far from doing any
thing might hinder you to ſerve her. Beſides that, the more to induce you to quit
this Shepherds habit, I muſt tell you it is the onely thing wherein you diſpleaſe
her. I leave you here a while to conſider of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> having with theſe words left <hi>Lyſis,</hi> return'd to the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
He told them all how gently <hi>Lyſis</hi> had receiv'd his directions, and how ſtayed
and diſcreet his anſwers were, and what hopes there were that in a ſhort time he
might be brought into a fair way: whereupon <hi>Amaryllis</hi> asked, whether it were
not fit to ſend the <hi>Hermit</hi> to him, whoſe preſence might oblige him to ſome reſpect,
and put him the more in minde of his dutie; but it was not thought convenient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was more likely <hi>Clarimond</hi> ſhould better go through with the good deſign
he had undertaken; ſo that the Hermite was a while after diſpatched away. 'Twas
generally confeſt that the artifices which <hi>Clarimond</hi> had made uſe of to reſtore <hi>Lyſis</hi>
to himſelf, were ſo pleaſant, that all the extravagant ſallies of the Shepherd had
not given near ſo great ſatisfaction. <hi>Carmelin</hi> himſelf, who had heerd all, was
very glad his Maſter was convinced of ſo many truths, which he had ſometimes
taken great pains to perſwade him to, and though he knew not what kinde of life
they ſhould lead together for the future, yet was he never the ſadder, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
that thenceforward no man would abuſe them, nor would they ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be abuſed: For as for his part, to remedie all the deluſions and cheats
which might be put upon them, he reſolv'd, that if ever he were called to any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment
or Metamorphoſis, he would never give credit to any ſuch thing, no,
not though all the men in the world ſhould perſwade him to a thing contrary to his
opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:43725:202"/>
As for <hi>Adrian,</hi> he was ſo overjoi'd to ſee how <hi>Clarimond</hi> beſtirr'd himſelf to reſtore
his Couſin to his wits, and how far he had advanc'd, that he gave him all the thanks
imaginable. <hi>Clarimond</hi> not finding <hi>Muſardan,</hi> enquir'd where he was. They told him
he was gone away, intending to lie that night at <hi>Lagny,</hi> though <hi>Hircan</hi> would have
ſtaid him; &amp; that the cauſe of his departure was, that <hi>Adrian</hi> having underſtood at his
firſt coming in, that he was a maker of <hi>Romances,</hi> and that <hi>Lyſis</hi> had read his books,
bore him ſuch an inplacable grudg, that he ſet upon him aſſoon as he could poſſiby,
and rail'd at him he could, whereto the Author not knowing what to anſwer, and
withal, ſeeing his adverſarie back'd by ſo many, thought it his beſt courſe to diſlodge.
<hi>Clarimond</hi> was much vex'd that he had not ſeen the conteſt; but what he had done
in the mean time was of greater conſequence. He was ſatisfied with the particular
account which <hi>Adrian</hi> gave him of all that had been ſaid; and afterwards turning
to another diſcourſe, he told the good man that his Couſins firſt maladie was love,
and that the only deſire to ſerve a Miſtreſs perfectly, was that which had form'd
in his head the imaginations of ſo many adventures, which he grounded upon thoſe
of the Romances, as he had gather'd from all that had paſt, ſo that to perſwade
him that a woman may be pleas'd without all thoſe extravagances, muſt needs be the
only means to bring him perfectly to himſelf; but that it were dangerous to deceive
him in this caſe, unleſs there were a deſign to make him ſtark mad: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
if he be told that <hi>Charite</hi> would not be cruel to him, ſhe muſt not diſcover the
leaſt cruelty: Whereupon <hi>Hircan</hi> ſaid, it was no hard matter to make him a happy
man, and that was to work a marriage between him and that fair <hi>Charite. Adrian</hi> would know truly who ſhe was, to ſee if the match were any thing conſiderable.
<hi>Leonora</hi> told him, that ſhe was a near Kinſwoman of her laſt husbands, and that
ſhe had taken her into her ſervice, becauſe ſhe was not too forward in the world,
but that ſhe would give ſomewhat with her in marriage. They repreſented to <hi>Adrian</hi>
that though his Couſin had great wealth, yet could he not meet with a more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
match, becauſe he having the reputation of a hollow brain, there would be
no ſuch ſtriving for him. <hi>Adrian</hi> and his wife eſteeming an alliance with <hi>Leonora</hi>
very honorable, and conſidering other reaſons, ſaid that they thought very well of
<hi>Lyſis</hi>'s marriage with <hi>Charite,</hi> if ſo be the reſt of his friends would conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
They alſo remembred them, that they had ſeen that <hi>Charite</hi> in the morning,
and that ſhe ſeem'd to be of a good calm nature, ſo that they thought very well of
her.</p>
            <p>And thus were they very ſerious about the marrying of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> out of a confidence
he would be wiſer by it, as indeed there was much appearance. <hi>Leonora</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he was very rich, ſaw that at all adventure it would not be amiſs to beſtow <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
on him, by reaſon that though he ſhould continue in the ſame craſineſs, yet
his madneſs was harmleſs, and haply he had not been guilty of ſo many extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
had not others ſtarted the occaſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orontes</hi> upon this going home with all thoſe that had any relation to him, <hi>Adrian</hi>
took his leave of them, promiſing <hi>Leonora</hi> that he would treat with his friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the marriage of his Couſin, and that he would write to her what he ſhould
do in it. <hi>Clarimond</hi> went up into the chamber where <hi>Lyſis</hi> was, and ſaid to him.
You muſt needs confeſs that the moment wherein you began to contemn your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
opinion was very happy to you; for it was no ſooner heard that you would
hearken to reaſon, but all the world are perſwaded you will obtain your own wiſhes
of <hi>Charite: Leonora, Angelica, Adrian,</hi> and <hi>Pernella</hi> are of your ſide; who can
now do you any hurt? That very <hi>Charite,</hi> replies <hi>Lyſis.</hi> You will find the contrary,
ſays <hi>Clarimond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> fell afreſh to conſider of this, and yet he was extremely glad to underſtand
that thoſe who were moſt concern'd in his affairs were ſo favourable to him. When
ſupper-time came, he ſate down at table with the reſt: But the ſhame which ſeiz'd
him that he was ſo long abuſed by thoſe in whom he had plac'd the greateſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
had ſo caſt him down, that he durſt not ſpeak a word. <hi>Adrian</hi> and his wife
thought it a good ſign, and conceiv'd he would thenceforward be more diſcreet;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43725:202"/>
ſo that the next day they return'd to <hi>Paris</hi> very well ſatisfied, promiſing him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he deſired, on condition he would be no more a <hi>Shepherd.</hi> As for <hi>Clarimond,</hi>
he thought that ſilence no good preſage, and that it was to be fear'd he might fall
out of one misfortune into another, and that his extravagance would turn to ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.
To remedy this, he thought it neceſſary he were withdrawn from thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who oblig'd him to ſo much fear and baſhfulneſs. This deſign communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to <hi>Hircan,</hi> who thought it very convenient that <hi>Clarimond</hi> took <hi>Lyſis</hi> and
<hi>Carmelin</hi> to his own Caſtle.</p>
            <p>They were no ſooner gone, but <hi>Fontenay</hi> and his companions took their way for
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> whither ſome buſineſs call'd them. They gave infinite thanks to <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
not only for their entertainment ſo long, but alſo for the rare diverſions which
by his means they had had. In the mean time <hi>Angelica</hi> told <hi>Charite,</hi> that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
ſhe ſhould be married to <hi>Lyſis.</hi> Her anſwer was, that it was only to abuſe her,
to beſtow her on a man that was a laughing-ſtock where-ever he came. <hi>Angelica</hi>
aſſur'd her, that for the future he would be wiſer, and that nobody would perſwade
him to any further extravagances. She had no quarrel with his perſon, for his face
was not ſo deformed as to frighten; and if all were as well in his mind, ſhe would
not be long entreated to make good what was undertaken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> being at <hi>Clarimond's,</hi> found that <hi>Montenor</hi> had ſent from his houſe the
cloaths he was accuſtom'd to wear in the City, which <hi>Anſelme</hi> had not fogotten
to preſerve. <hi>Clarimond</hi> told him that he muſt put them on; and indeed they were
more convenient for the ſeaſon then the Shepherds habit. His Coat was all ſpotted
and all torn, it could not poſſibly hold out in ſo many adventures; and it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſo ill lined, that it could not defend him from the cold and rains which in the
Autumn were ſomwhat frequent. He therefore took the Cloaths, which it was a
long time ſince he had worn; but he was ſo long making himſelf ready, that it was
eaſily perceiv'd he was not perfectly reſolv'd to do what he did. I cannot diſſemble,
ſays he to <hi>Clarimond;</hi> it troubles me much to quit a garment that I was long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd
to: I thought that the only wearing of it was a powerfull means to make
me enjoy all the pleaſures of this life. Theſe opinions are hard to overcome. Are
you not then yet converted? ſays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> have you not been a <hi>Shepherd</hi> long
enough? I will bring one of the trueſt reaſons in the world to convince you. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
yourſelf, and you will find that in all your Books of <hi>Shepherdry,</hi> they only
that are in Love are clad like Shepherds: As for thoſe that are married, it is not
ſaid that they meddle with any Flocks. You muſt do ſo if you marry <hi>Charite,</hi> as I
hope you will. 'Tis true, you are not yet married; but what will you be the worſe
to quit the habit of a Batchelour a little before, ſince your friends adviſe you
to it?</p>
            <p>This was a huge ſubtilty of <hi>Clarimonds:</hi> He would bring <hi>Lyſis</hi> to reaſon by the
authority of thoſe ancient Authors, and bring him to wiſdome by the maxims of
folly. Yet <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſmillingly ſaid to him, Dear friend! you do not conſider, that when
it is not mention'd that thoſe that are not married kept Flocks, it is only that they
are not brought upon the ſtage ſo openly, in regard it is the Authors deſign to
write only the hiſtory of young Lovers that are to be married. And when you find
any fathers of families withdraw to their houſes, 'tis by reaſon of their old age, or
becauſe they have children big enough to look after their ſheep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> hearing this, was afraid <hi>Lyſis</hi> perſiſted ſtill in his former imaginations;
ſo that he roughly return'd him this anſwer. Whatever you can alleadge, it matters
not: So it is, that I muſt have you in good earneſt ſhake off this Shepherds habit.
Is there any neceſſity to wear it to charm a Miſtreſs? Conſider, I pray, who hath
been more fortunate in their Loves, you or <hi>Anſelme:</hi> Did <hi>Anſelme</hi> ever turn Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
to get <hi>Angelica?</hi> Had he done it, he had not obtain'd her yet; and for your
part, as long as you are one, you ſhall never obtain <hi>Charite.</hi> Have I not told you,
that the Maids in theſe times do not affect Shepherds? You that do all you can to
pleaſe your Miſtreſs, do you not perceive that you have done nothing but diſpleas'd
her hitherto?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:43725:203"/>
Theſe reaſons ſo ſeaſonably preſs'd, and ſo eaſie to be apprehended, finiſh'd the
work of <hi>Lyſis</hi> his converſion. And to make him yet conceive the truth more fully,
<hi>Clarimond</hi> ſeeing he ſaid not a word, continued his diſcourſe in this manner. What
could you hope to do by cloathing your ſelf thus like a Comedian, and living like
a <hi>Romantick</hi> perſon? I will rub over your memory with the misfortunes have
happen'd to you upon that occaſion. You could never bring about any one of your
Love-deſigns. When you deſired to ſpeak with your Miſtreſs, or at leaſt kiſs the
window whereon ſhe learn'd, you fell down the ladder, having your noſe bath'd in
blood, ſo that you were taken by the collar for a thief and a murtherer. As for your
diſguiſing yourſelf like a Maid, you were never the better for it, it came to nothing;
and ſo did your Metamorphoſis. If it were poſſible a man could be chang'd into a
Tree, what were he the better for it? You imagin'd it a matter of honour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
and 'tis true, the Poets bring examples of a many perſons favour'd by the
Gods, which have chang'd forms: but do you not find alſo in the ſame Authors,
that thoſe who had committed the greateſt crimes were in like manner transform'd?
'Tis therefore a queſtion whether the Metamorphoſis be a puniſhment or a reward;
and the true judgment that may be given of it, is, that it ought every way to be
taken as a moſt ridiculous abſurdity. As for the imaginary deliverance of <hi>Pamphilia,</hi>
wherein you thought you had done ſuch miracles of valour, and merited a name
and place amongſt the moſt famous Heroes, whoſe hath lived till now;
what wonders could you have done, had you been invuſnerable as you imagin'd?
'Twas only your confidence of being ſo, that made you go ſo cheerfully to fight.
It was the ſame caſe with <hi>Achilles</hi> and a many other Heroes, who could not be
wounded, whom you thought to imitate. Be their adventures either fabulous or
true, I ſhall laugh at all thoſe that take them for valiant Champions, and compare
to them all the Princes they would celebrate: For had they believ'd they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
wounds, it would have diſcovered ſome natural cowardiſe in them, and they
had never gone to the battel ſo reſolutely. I believe you do not intend to play the
<hi>Heros</hi> any more; but you will have me think that you cannot ſo eaſily take your
leave of the <hi>Shepherd,</hi> becauſe you would ſtill continue your extravagancies, which
you think are teſtimonies of your affection to <hi>Charite.</hi> What, will you ſtill obſerve
how many bits you eat, and how many times you drink; and that to honour <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite?</hi>
Would you alſo eat nought but <hi>red</hi> things, and will you never be at eaſe till
you are turn'd towards that quarter where you conceive your fair one to be? Will
you henceforth obſerve your amorous conformities? will you eat nothing but
what <hi>Charite</hi> likes? will you cough when ſhe coughs; and if ſhe have the eye bound
up, will you have yours too? What other end can there be of this, but to make you
be laugh'd at? A woman is never touch'd with any love for any of theſe fooleries:
this is not the way to render ſervices to a Miſtreſs. All your paſt actions can ſignifie
nothing to this purpoſe. And if it was your deſign to ſhew by that means how great
your compliance was, I tell you, you will diſcover it much more, if you quit the
Shepherds habit. That's the point I drive at, and I will make it cleerly appear to
you where your great error lies; and that is, that you have not labour'd at all the
principal conformity which is now required, ſince you are ſo much given to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities.
<hi>Charite</hi> is dreſs'd as an ordinary Maid of her condition, and you are clad
like a Shewer of Puppet-playes. Since ſhe is not clad like a Shepherdeſs, you ſhould
not go like a Shepherd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſis</hi> having heard all this, was aſham'd he had ſaid any thing that ſhould make
<hi>Clarimond</hi> believe he would contradict him. The reaſons that Gentleman had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadg'd,
wrought ſo powerfully on him, that he reſolv'd to follow them for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The fear he was in to diſpleaſe <hi>Charite,</hi> kept his mind within compaſs; ſo that
he ſuffer'd them to diſpoſe his Shepherds habit where they pleas'd, ſo it ſhould be
never ſeen again. Having found alſo among his tromperies the <hi>Metaphorical Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi>
and all thoſe things he had ſo carefully preſerv'd becauſe, they had come from
his Miſtreſs, he of his own accord gave them to <hi>Clarimond</hi> to, do what he pleas'd
with them. It was not fit he ſhould ſee any more the badges of his ancient follies,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43725:203"/>
and his hope was he ſhould ſhortly obtain of <hi>Charite</hi> favours of greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
then thoſe.</p>
            <p>Since the bare reading of <hi>Romances</hi> had been able to put ſo many ſeveral imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
into him, ſeconded by the cheats and abuſes had been put upon him, 'tis to
be conceiv'd he was of a tender perſwaſible compoſition of mind, and that it was as
eaſie to make him hate his extravagances, as it had been to bring him in love with
them. He accordingly confeſs'd to <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that he heartily repented him of all
he had done; but that it was impoſſible for him to refrain doing them, becauſe that
though he was not ignorant of the truth, yet he ſometimes would deceive himſelf
purpoſely to deceive others, ſo to make his adventures the more remarkable. As
for example, he was never half perſwaded that he was chang'd into a Tree, nor did
he believe thoſe other extraordinary things; but he pretended to believe them, that
others might believe them too, and that there might be made of him a <hi>Romance</hi> that
ſhould make him eternally famous. He at length came to an excellent good humour
and was more apprehenſive of reaſon then he had ever been, as it happens that mens
minds paſs from one extreme to another: which <hi>Clarimond</hi> obſerving, told him
that he was the moſt ſatisfied man in the world, to ſee him as other men. And
thereupon to make a final riddance of all thoſe corrupt imaginations, he made a
diſcourſe to him about the <hi>Divinity,</hi> repreſenting to him that we ſhould adore none
but God alone, and not idolize his Creatures, which we muſt only love in order to
him; whereas it ſeem'd he did not love God but for his Miſtreſſes ſake. He ſhew'd
him, that the Eyes of a Beauty are no Suns, that give us day, or could reduce to
aſhes thoſe things whereon they caſt their rayes. And thus he gave him cleerly to
ſee the errors he committed in relation to all Sciences, when he took the Poets for
warrant and authority for what he ſaid. For his further inſtructions, he permitted
him to go into his Study, and there chooſe out ſome good Books.</p>
            <p>They ſpent five or ſix dayes in ſuch entertainments, in which time <hi>Anſelme</hi> and
<hi>Hircan</hi> neglected not to ſend daily to know what they did. They were very glad to
hear that <hi>Lyſis</hi> began to hearken to Reaſon; for it would have been a huge bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſneſs,
if after they had made as much ſport with him as they could deſire, they
ſhould ſtill wiſh to ſee him in his extravagances. <hi>Clarimond</hi> being deſirous that all
might ſee what an excellent Phyſitian of the mind he was, would needs carry his
Gueſt abroad to viſit their common friends: but <hi>Lyſis</hi> told him that he had no great
deſire to go, becauſe he was ſenſible of the many follies he had committed before
them, and fear'd they might jeer him. <hi>Clarimond</hi> made great proteſtations to him,
to aſſure him there ſhould be no ſuch thing; and told him withall, that any one
might eaſily conceive that a perſon in Love is not himſelf, and that his paſt actions
were as much to be excus'd as the ravings of one in a burning feaver.</p>
            <p>They went therefore in the firſt place to <hi>Hircan's,</hi> and thence to <hi>Oroutes's,</hi>
where they were all amaz'd to ſee that <hi>Lyſis</hi> was not the ſame man who had plaid
ſo many ridiculous tricks before them. He was extreme ſad, according to his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
and he was now of the ſame humour he was of in his infancie. Yet he ſpake
when he was ſpoken to earneſtly, but it was without any laughing, how pleaſant
ſoever the occaſion might be. 'Tis the cuſtom of thoſe whoſe brains are too light,
whether they laugh, or whether they rejoice, they do it in the heat of their ſickneſs;
their joy is but an extravagance, and their laughing from the teeth outward; but
when their phrenſie is ſomwhat over, they make no noiſe, and whatever is ſaid is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to them. I wonder at nothing ſo much, as that <hi>Lyſis</hi> did not change his
Love with his humour: but it is to be conceived his paſſion proceeded from another
cauſe then that of his folly.</p>
            <p>He ſecretly learn'd out the place where his Miſtreſs was, and he was permitted
to viſit her. He demanded her pardon, if he had at other times importun'd her with
extraordinary diſcourſes, and that for the future the teſtimonies of his affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her ſhould be no other then what were according to the precepts of reaſon.
She, who had been commanded by <hi>Lenora</hi> to receive him courteouſly, anſwered
him, that ſhe thought herſelf much honour'd in his Love, if ſo be his affections did
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43725:204"/>
not exceed the limits of honeſty. This gave him ſuch ſatisfaction, that he imagined
there were no more miſeries ordain'd for him; nor indeed was he deceiv'd; for
about this time <hi>Anſelme</hi> received Letters from <hi>Adrian,</hi> by which he underſtood
that all <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s friends, whereof ſome by chance knew <hi>Charite,</hi> conſented he ſhould
marry her, provided he were fully delivered from his former imaginations. <hi>Anſelme</hi>
return'd him an anſwer to the great commeudation of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and deſired him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>Brie,</hi> and bring with him thoſe he thought convenient to his Couſins wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
The meſſenger departed immediately, and <hi>Lyſis</hi> aſſur'd of his happineſs, was
inexpreſsibly glad. Yet he ſaid not much of it, becauſe <hi>Clarimond</hi> had forbidden
him to engage into unprofitable diſcourſes when he were in company, leſt through
negligence he might ſlip into ſome of his ancient <hi>Romantick</hi> talk. He ſo extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lov'd this Gentleman, ſince he underſtood that he bore him ſuch a ſincere affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he was ever afraid to diſobey him, nay when he but ſaw him, he corrected
his behavior, and thought that all the imaginations came into his minde were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous;
ſo that he held his peace for a good while after.</p>
            <p>Two days after came <hi>Adrian,</hi> with two other of <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s Couſins. <hi>Lenoora</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
them very kindely at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s: When they ſaw their Kinſman, they thought
they had never ſeen a wiſer man; as indeed there was ſuch a difference between what
he had been, and what he was, that if he chanc'd to ſlip into ſome little imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
they were ſo dull, that they could not perceave it. The contract of his
marriage was paſs'd without his notice, all he troubled himſelf with was to ſign it.
<hi>Adrian</hi> had the care to ſee it in form, he himſelf being ſo tranſported in his loves,
that he could not deſcend to ſuch low thoughts as relate to the goods of fortune.
<hi>Charite</hi> had ſomewhat left her by her father, and beſides that, <hi>Leonora</hi> gave her
a houſe; which ſtood ſomewhat near that of <hi>Orontes.</hi> There it was reſolved the
new married couple ſhould keep houſe together; for though <hi>Lyſis</hi> would be no
longer a Shepherd, yet would he not leave the Country. There was a great feaſt at
their making ſure, and the next day they were married: Though the company was
not great, yet they were merry enough, but nothing all the while ſaid to <hi>Lyſis</hi> that
might offend him; it being but a little while ſince he began to follow the common
opinion of all other men, 'twould have been dangerous to put him into any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> ſeeing his <hi>Maſter</hi> married, wiſh'd himſelf the ſame happineſs. <hi>Lyſis</hi>
having given him a ſmall ſum of money for his good and faithful ſervice, <hi>Liſetta</hi>
continued no longer in rebellion, but ſubmitted. The next day they were married,
and though he was but ſimple, and no great Clerk, <hi>Orontes</hi> made him Bailiff with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Lordſhip, finding him able enough for that charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Lyſis</hi>'s friends returned to <hi>Paris</hi> with <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Anſelme,</hi>
who carried his wife with him. <hi>Orontes</hi> writ to them ſince, that the two lovers his
neighbors liv'd a very comfortable life together, and that there wanted nothing to
make them perfectly happy, but to finde <hi>Lyſis</hi> ſome little office, for to exempt him
of the taxes. When they had purchas'd him one, he thought himſelf in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
as might defie misfortune, ſeeing himſelf a Country Gentleman, and the
cloathes he wore of ſeveral colours pleas'd him no leſs then the Countrymans coat:
yet whenever he heard the bleating of ſheep, he could not but call to minde the
falſe pleaſure he once took to keep ſome. He ſometimes as he read a Book, ſtraid
into the woods; but he had quite ſhaken hands with all Love-books, he medled
now with none but Treatiſes of Moral Philoſophy. Yet <hi>Clarimond</hi> perceiving that
his minde receiv'd all impreſſions with too much vehemence, was afraid he would
fall into ſome other new folly, and more particularly become a <hi>Ssoick</hi> or <hi>Cinick</hi>
Philoſopher. He had already read in <hi>Charron</hi> and ſome other Authors, that a man
muſt take pains in the generation of children, and yet not give ones ſelf bruitally
over to it, and that there were ſome certain obſervations whereby to get fair chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
ſtrait and witty. He would obſerve with <hi>Charite</hi> the <hi>Dict preſcrib'd</hi> for that
purpoſe, and his careſſes and embraces were limited to the appointed time. But
<hi>Clarimond</hi> deſirous to keep him from being either ſuperſtitious or extravagant, rid
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43725:204"/>
him of thoſe fancies aſſoon as he perceiv'd him poſſes'd with them. He told him,
he ſhould laugh at thoſe Philoſophers, who though never married themſelves, yet
importune us with their fantaſtick notions of marriage; and moreover aſſur'd him,
that to get perfect children, it was enough to live temperately, referring the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to nature; and that when the children were born, good education perfected the
reſt.</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Orontes</hi> alwaies divert him from things that were not
commendable; and though a many came to ſee him out of deſign to put his follies
afreſh into his head, yet they prevailed nothing. I muſt needs confeſs that there
happened to him adventures pleaſant enough ſince his marriage, but his particular
friends were the only witneſſes of them, and it is not my deſign to make my hiſtory
any longer. I muſt leave that to ſome other that will take the pains, that when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
perſons have employed their endeavors on the ſame ſubject, it may be judg'd
who hath done beſt. All I have now to do, is to give you that account which is
ever requir'd at the end of all Love-ſtories, which is to let you know what became of
all the perſons therein mentioned. Know therefore, that <hi>Philiris</hi> and <hi>Fontenay</hi> are
married in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> that <hi>Polidor</hi> was kill'd in a duel, and that <hi>Meliantes</hi> is gone
to travel. <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> are ſtill Bachelors. <hi>Leonor a</hi> is dead; and as for
<hi>Hircan, Orontes</hi> and <hi>Anſelme,</hi> they keep good houſe with their wives, and ſo does
<hi>Carmelin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have now all; it was in my deſign to tell you of the divers fortunes of the
Shepherd <hi>Lyſis,</hi> according to the notes I had of them from <hi>Philiris</hi> and <hi>Clarimond,</hi>
who it ſeems had not the leiſure to put them into order. <hi>Lyſis</hi> having read ſome
part of this, was nothing troubled to ſee his adventures made publicke, becauſe he
believes ſuch as they are, they will be a teſtimony of the affection he ever bore
<hi>Charite;</hi> and that beſides, it will be an example for youth not to regulate their
lives according to thoſe impertinences, which are contrary to the order of the
world. But becauſe I ſpeak to you of him as one that is ſtill alive, I am in doubt
whether many who ſhall read his Hiſtory, may not be guilty of a curioſity to go
into <hi>Brie,</hi> to ſee if they can finde that ſo famous <hi>Lyſis:</hi> Wherefore I give them
notice, that henceforth they ſhall not need take the pains, and that poſſibly they
may not finde him, becauſe he is ſo chang'd, that he hath left off that very name
he was call'd by when he was a Shepherd. And beſides, why may they not diſtruſt
me? What know they whether I have not related a fable to them inſtead of a true
Hiſtory; or that I have not, to diſguiſe things, and not diſcover the perſons I have
ſpoken of, as indeed I have, call'd them by other then their ordinary names, and
miſtaken <hi>Brie</hi> for ſome other Province?</p>
