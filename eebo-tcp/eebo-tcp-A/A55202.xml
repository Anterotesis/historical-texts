            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as by Law eſtabliſh'd. This was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the preſence of both Kings, who were there with their particular Favourites, giving and receiving many Preſents: Here <hi>Gelon,</hi> one faithful to <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> taking <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> familiarly by the hand, preſented him with two pair of draught Oxen, theſe <hi>Myrtilus</hi> his Cup-bearer being then by, begg'd of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who not giving them to him, but another, <hi>Myrtilus</hi> extremely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it. which <hi>Gelon</hi> took notice of, and inviting him to a Treat (where as ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port he debauch'd him too after drinking, being in the Flower of his Youth) he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into diſcourſe, perſwading him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> and deſtroy <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> by Poyſon; <hi>Myrtilus</hi> receiv'd the Deſign, as praiſing and conſenting to it, but indeed privately diſcovered it to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> by whoſe Command he recommended <hi>Alexicrates</hi> his chief Cup-bearer to <hi>Gelon,</hi> as a fit Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their Deſign, becauſe <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> was very deſirous to have proof of the Plot by ſeveral Evidences; ſo <hi>Gelon</hi> being deceiv'd, <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> who was as much deceiv'd by him, and imagining the Deſign went proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly on, could not hold, but for Joy ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it among his Friends, and once at an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment at his Siſter <hi>Cadmia</hi>'s, ſpoke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frankly of it, thinking none heard but themſelves.

his that were <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and ſo withdrew to <hi>Cercyra,</hi> and deſiring to marry ſome King, invited <hi>Demetrius,</hi> knowing of all the Kings, he was moſt ready to entertain an offer of Marriage from fair Ladies; ſo he ſail'd thither, marry'd <hi>Lanaſſa,</hi> and plac'd a Garriſon in the City. The Kings having writ thus to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> did themſelves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe find <hi>Demetrius</hi> work, while he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying and making his preparations; <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mee</hi> ſetting out with a great Fleet, drew off many of the <hi>Greek</hi> Cities, <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> out of <hi>Thrace</hi> waſted the upper <hi>Macedon, Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> alſo taking Arms with theſe, march'd to <hi>Beraea,</hi> expecting, (as it fell out) that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> drawing his Forces againſt <hi>Lyſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> would leave the lower Country with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Supplies. That very Night he ſeem'd in his Sleep to be call'd by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and approaching ſaw him ſick a-bed; but was receiv'd with very kind Words and much Reſpect, and promis'd a ſuddain aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: He making bold to reply; How, Sir, can you being ſick aſſiſt me?

receiv'd Intelligence of this, and perceiv'd likewiſe the <hi>Macedonians</hi> ready to mutiny in the Army, he was afraid to advance farther, leſt coming near <hi>Lyſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> a <hi>Macedonian</hi> King, and of great Fame, they ſhould revolt to him. So returning, he march'd directly againſt <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> as a Stranger and hated by the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> while he lay encamp'd there by him, many coming out of <hi>Beraea</hi> infinitely prais'd <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> as one invincible in Arms, a very Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Prince, and treating thoſe he had taken kindly and obligingly; ſeveral of theſe <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> himſelf ſent privately, pretending themſelves <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and ſaying, now was the time to be deliver'd from the ſevere Government of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> by coming over to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> a gracious Prince, and a lover of Soldiers: By this Artifice a great part of the Army was mov'd, and looking eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">The Army of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts to <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi>

Some took the confidence to ſay to <hi>Demetrins</hi> himſelf, that he would be well
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35403:13"/>
advis'd to withdraw, and lay down the Government. And he indeed finding the Mutinous humour of the Army agreeable to that ſort of Diſcourſe, privately got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way diſguis'd in an old Hat, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<note place="margin">Himſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcapes with difficulty, in a mean diſguiſe.</note> red Coat. So <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Army without fighting, and was declar'd King of the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> But <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> now arriving, and affirming the defeat of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> was in common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by both, and that the Kingdom ought to be ſhar'd between them, <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> not extremely aſſur'd of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and in doubt of their Faith, conſented to the Propoſition of <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> and divided the Country and Cities between them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. This was for the preſent uſeful, and prevented a War; but ſhortly after they found the partition not ſo much an avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of diſſatisfactions, as an occaſion of more Complaint and Difference. For to<note place="margin">Ambitious Princes ill Neighbours.</note> ſuch whoſe Ambition neither Seas nor Mountains, nor the forſaken Deſerts can limit, nor the bounds dividing <hi>Europe</hi> from <hi>Aſia,</hi> confine their vaſt deſires; 'tis hard to ſay how they ſhould forbear injuring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when they touch, and are cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

In this Triumph was brought (as was reported) of Gold 3007 pound weight, of Silver Bullion 5775, of Money in Gold and Silver Coin 17028 Drachms. After the Solemnity, <hi>Marius</hi> called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Senate in the Capitol, and entred the Court inſolently, whether through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency, or too much puffed up with his good Fortune, in his Triumphal Habit; yet preſently obſerving the Senate offended at it, he went out, and putting on his ordinary Purple Robe, immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>

For that fierce humour of his in Authority and inexorableneſs in puniſhing, proved both juſt and advantageous to thoſe that did not uſe to do amiſs, and were not ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born in their faults; and his turbulent Spirit, ſtern Voice, and ſowre Aſpect, which were in a little while grown familiar to them, they eſteemed terrible not to themſelves, but only to their Enemies.

The Election coming on, and his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue being dead, he left the Command of the Army to <hi>Manius Aquilius,</hi> and haſtned to <hi>Rome,</hi> where ſeveral eminent Perſons being Candidates for the Conſulſhip, <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Saturninus</hi> (who more than any of the other Tribunes, ſwayed the Populace, and of whom <hi>Marius</hi> himſelf was very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant) made an Harangue to the People, adviſing them to chuſe <hi>Marius</hi> Conſul; but he ſeeming to decline the Office, as one pretending never to be ambitious of it, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turninus</hi> called him Traytor to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that in ſuch apparent danger would deſert the War.

The Carriage of Proviſion for the Army from the Sea, which was formerly long and chargeable, he made ſpeedy and eaſie; for the mouth of the <hi>Rhone,</hi> by the Reflux of the Sea, being barred and almoſt filled up with Sand and Dirt, the Paſſage there became narrow, difficult, and dangerous for thoſe Ships that brought their Proviſions.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35403:52"/>
                  <hi>Ambrones</hi> with all expedition paſſing over the interjacent Country, appeared to be an incredible number, and of a terrible Aſpect, much different from all others in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Speech, and Shoutings, they taking up a great part of the Plain with their Camp, challenged <hi>Marius</hi> to Battel; he ſeemed to take no notice of them, but kept his Soldiers within their Fortifications, and ſharply reprehended thoſe that were of too forward and eager a Courage, and who would needs be fighting, calling them Traytors to their Country; and telling them they were not now in purſuit of the Glory of Triumphs and Trophies, but how they might repel ſuch an impetuous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of War, and ſave <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. Thus he diſcourſed privately with<note place="margin">

Now this daily converſe did not only diminiſh ſome of the Soldiers fear, but their Indignation warmed and inflamed their Courage, when they heard the threats and inſupportable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of their Enemies; who not only plundered and depopulated all the Country round, but alſo with great Contempt and Reſolution threatned to ſtorm their Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>

                  <hi>What Effeminacy does</hi> Marius <hi>ſee in us, that he ſhould thus like Women lock us up from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering our Enemies? Come on, let us ſhew our ſelves men, and ask him if he expect any others that muſt fight for our Liberty: Shall he always employ us in ſervile Offices, when he would draw Trenches, cleanſe places of mud and dirt, and turn the courſe of Rivers? In ſuch Works as theſe, it ſeems, he will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe us; then return home, and brag of theſe great performances of his Conſulſhips to the People. Or does the defeat of</hi> Carbo <hi>and</hi> Caepio, <hi>who were vanquiſhed by the Enemy, affright him? Surely they were much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to</hi> Marius <hi>both in Glory and Valour, and commanded a much weaker Army; at the worſt it is better to be in Action, though we</hi>

She had formerly been driven away from the Senate; to whom ſhe addreſſed her ſelf, offering to inform them about theſe Affairs, and to foretel future Events, whereupon ſhe betook her ſelf to the Ladies, and gave ſome experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her skill, eſpecially to <hi>Marius</hi>'s Wife; who ſitting to ſee the Gladiators combat, ſhe foretold which of them ſhould overcome; and was for this and the like Predictings ſent by her to <hi>Marius,</hi> and the Army, where ſhe was very much admired, and for the moſt part carried about in a Litter; when ſhe went to Sacrifice ſhe wore a Purple Robe lined and buttoned up, and had in her Hand a little Spear trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Rubans and Garlands. This Farce made many queſtion, whether <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> did really give any credit to her him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or only play'd the Counterfeit when he

ſhewed her publickly to impoſe upon the Soldiers.</p>
               <p n="26">26. But what <hi>Alexander Mindius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates<note place="margin">Vultures appear.</note> about the Vultures, does really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve admiration; that always before his Victories there appeared two of them, and accompanied the Army; which were known by their brazen Collars (for the Soldiers, when they took them, put theſe about their Necks, and ſo let them go, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they in a manner knew and ſaluted the Soldiers) and whenſoever theſe appeared in their Marches, they very much rejoiced as at an Omen of good Succeſs in that Expedition. But of the many Prodigies,<note place="margin">Other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies.</note> that then were taken notice of, the reſt were but of the ordinary ſtamp; as, that it was reported at <hi>Ameria</hi> and <hi>Tudertum</hi> (two Cities in <hi>Italy</hi>) there were ſeen at Nights in the Sky, flaming Darts and Shields, now waved about, and then again claſhing againſt one another, reſembling thoſe poſtures and motions Soldiers uſe in their fighting; that at length one Party retreating, and the other purſuing, they all diſappearing Weſtward. Much about the ſame time came <hi>Batabaces</hi> one of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bele's</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Batabaces.</note> Prieſts from <hi>Peſſinunce,</hi> and reported how the Goddeſs had declared to him by her Oracle, That the <hi>Romans ſhould obtain the Victory,</hi> and no ſmall Glory in this

War. The Senate giving credit to him, and voting the Goddeſs a Temple to be built in hopes of a Victory; <hi>Aulus Pompei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> a Tribune prevented <hi>Batabaces,</hi> when he would have gone and told the People this ſame Story, calling him Impoſtor, and ignominiouſly pulling him out of the <hi>Roſtra;</hi> which Action chiefly got repute to the Fellow's report; for <hi>Aulus</hi> had ſcarce diſſolved the Aſſembly, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home, when ſo violent a Fever ſeized him, that it was notoriouſly known and in every bodies Mouth, that he died within a week after.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Now the <hi>Teutones,</hi> whilſt <hi>Marius</hi> lay quiet, ventured to attack his Camp; from whence, being encountered with ſhowers of Darts, and loſing ſeveral of their men, they determined to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, hoping to recover the other ſide of the <hi>Alps</hi> without oppoſition, and packing up their baggage, they paſſed ſecurely by the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, where the greatneſs of their number chiefly appeared by the long time they took in their March; for they were ſaid to be ſix days continually going on in paſſing <hi>Marius</hi>'s Fortifications; they marched pretty near, and revilingly asked the <hi>Romans,</hi> if they would ſend any recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations by them to their Wives? for they would ſhortly be with them. As ſoon
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35403:54"/>
as the Enemy was gone by, and continued their motion, <hi>Marius</hi> began to move, and follow them at his leiſure; always encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at ſome ſmall diſtance from them; chuſing alſo convenient places for his Camp, and ſtrongly fortifying it, that he might quarter with the greater ſafety. Thus they marched till they came to <hi>Aquae-Sextiliae,</hi> whence the <hi>Alps</hi> were but little diſtant, where <hi>Marius</hi> put himſelf in readineſs for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.</p>
               <p n="28">28. He choſe a place for his Camp of conſiderable ſtrength, but where was ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Water; deſigning (as was reported) by this means to put an edge on his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Courage, whereat when ſeveral were not a little grieved, and complained of thirſt; he pointing to a River that ran near the Enemy's Camp: <hi>There,</hi> ſays he, <hi>you may have drink, but at the expence of your Bloud. Why then,</hi> replyed they, <hi>do you not lead us to them, that we may have ſomething that is liquid though it be Bloud? But,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in a ſofter tone; Let's first fortifie our Camp; whereupon the Soldiers for all their repining durſt not but obey.</hi> Now as a great<note place="margin">The Battel begun by Slaves.</note> company of their Boys and Pedees having neither drink for themſelves nor Horſes, went down to that River, ſome taking Axes, others Halberts, and ſome two Swords and Darts with their Pitchers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35403:55"/>
to have water though they fought for it. Theſe were firſt encountred by a ſmall party of the Enemies; for moſt of them were after bathing at dinner, and ſeveral were then too bathing themſelves (for the Country thereabouts abounds very much with hot Springs) ſo that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> fell upon them whilſt they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying themſelves, and very much tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported with the wonderful pleaſantneſs of the place. Upon hearing their ſhouts (more ſtill coming in) it was not a little difficult for <hi>Marius</hi> to contain his Soldiers, ſo much concerned for their Servants, and the more warlike part of the Enemies, who had overthrown <hi>Mallius</hi> and <hi>Coepio</hi> (they were called <hi>Ambrones,</hi> and were in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber one with another above 30000) taking the Alarm, ſtood to their Arms.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Theſe, though they had ſufficiently filled their bellies, yet retained their minds undiſturbed; and though they indulged themſelves even to Intemperance, yet did they not ruſh on like mad-men diſorderly or ſending forth confuſed noiſes; but all of them dancing and claſhing their Arms, in a kind of Conſort, often repeated their name <hi>Ambrones;</hi> either the better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage one another, or to ſtrike the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter terrour into their Enemies. Of all the <hi>Italians</hi> in <hi>Marius</hi>'s Army, the <hi>Ligurians</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:35403:55"/>
were the firſt that charg'd; and when they underſtood that the Enemy's confuſed Shout, was calling themſelves <hi>Ambrones,</hi> they alſo echoed the ſame word, which was an Ancient Name of their Country. This Acclamation, bandied from one Army to the other before they joined, the more incenſed the <hi>Germans;</hi> ſo that their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers on either ſide encouraging them, they ſtrove with all poſſible vehemence the one to overſhout the other, taking it mutually for an <hi>Omen</hi> of Victory, and a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive of their Courage.</p>
               <p n="30">30. The River divided the <hi>Ambrones;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Fight.</note> and before they could draw up all their Army on the other ſide of it, the <hi>Liguri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> preſently fell upon the Van, and began to charge them Hand to Hand. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> too coming to their aſſiſtance, and from the higher Ground pouring upon the Enemy, forceably repelled them, the moſt of them (one thruſting another into the River) were there ſlain, and filled it with their Bloud and dead Bodies. Thoſe that got ſafe over not daring to make head, the <hi>Romans</hi> ſlew as they fled to their Camp and Carriages; where the Women meeting them with Swords and Halberts, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an hideous out-cry, ſet upon thoſe that fled as well as thoſe that purſued; the one as Traitors, the other as Enemies; and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35403:56"/>
mixing themſelves with the Soldiers, with their bare Arms pulling away the <hi>Romans</hi> Shields, and laying hold on their Swords, endured the wounds and ſlaſhing of their Bodies to the very laſt with undaunted Reſolution. Thus the Battel ſeems to have hapned at that River rather by accident than by the deſign of the General.</p>
               <p n="31">31. After the <hi>Romans</hi> were retreated from the great ſlaughter of the <hi>Ambrones,</hi> Night came on; but the Army was not careſſed as it uſed to be, with Songs of Victory, drinking in their Tents, and kind mutual Entertainments, and (what is moſt welcome to Soldiers after an happy Conqueſt) quiet ſleep: But they paſſed that Night chiefly in Fears and Tumults; for their <hi>Camp was without Fortifications and Trenches,</hi> and there remained ſeveral Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of their Enemies as yet unconquered; to whom were joined as many of the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brones</hi> as eſcaped. There were heard at Night ſad Mournings, nothing like the ſighs and Groans of Men; but a kind of ſalvage howling and roaring, joined with threats and Lamentations, proceeded from ſo great a multitude, which the neighbouring Hills and hollow Caves of the River echoed about and filled the whole Plain with an hideous Noiſe; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the <hi>Romans</hi> were not a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:35403:56"/>
and <hi>Marius</hi> himſelf was aſtoniſhed with apprehenſion of a confuſed tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Night-Engagement. But they did not ſtir this Night or the next Day, but were employed in conſultation how to diſpoſe and draw themſelves up to the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>

Of this occaſion <hi>Marius</hi> made good uſe: for there were beyond the Enemies ſome woody Cliffs and Vallies well ſhaded with Trees, whether he ſent <hi>Claudius Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> very ſecretly with 3000 Soldiers, giving him orders to poſt them in ambuſh there, and ſhew themſelves at the Rear of the Enemies, when the Fight was begun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the others whom he had refreſhed with Victuals and Sleep, as ſoon as it was day he drew up before the Camp, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Horſe to march into the Plain, which the <hi>Teutones</hi> perceiving, could not contain themſelves till the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould come down and fight them on equal terms; but haſtily arming themſelves, they incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately ran towards a Hill hard by, where the <hi>Romans</hi> were drawn up. <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſending Officers to all Parts, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his men to ſtand ſtill and keep their Ground: when they came within reach, to throw their Piles, then uſe their Swords, and joining their Shields, repel the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; for he ſhewed that the ſteepneſs of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35403:57"/>
the Ground rendred the Enemies Charge infirm, and abated the force of their blows; nor could their Shields be joined cloſe together, the inequality of the Ground hindering the ſtability of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p n="33">33. This Counſel he gave them, and<note place="margin">The ſecond Battel.</note> was obſerved to be the firſt that followed it; for he was inferiour to none in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his Body, and far excelled them all in reſolution. Wherefore the <hi>Romans</hi> vigorouſly oppoſed, and by that means for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to retreat from the Hill; the <hi>Ambrones,</hi> as ſoon as they had put their Van in a poſture of reſiſtance, found thoſe in the Rear very much diſordered: for <hi>Marcellus</hi> had not let ſlip the opportunity, but as ſoon as the Shout was raiſed among the <hi>Romans</hi> on the Hills, he encouraging his men, fell in upon the Enemy behind, and running and ſhouting routed thoſe nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt him; and they breaking the Ranks of thoſe that were before them, the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was immediately filled with confuſion; they made no long reſiſtance after they were thus broke in upon, but having loſt all Order, fled.</p>
               <p n="34">34. The <hi>Romans</hi> purſuing them, ſlew and took Priſoners above 100000, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing themſelves of their Spoil, Tent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Carriages, voted as many of them as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35403:57"/>
were not purloin'd, to <hi>Marius</hi>'s ſhare, which, though ſo Magnificent a Preſent, yet was generally thought leſs than his Conduct deſerved in ſo great a danger. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authors do not agree about the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Plunder and number of the ſlain. They ſay, the Inhabitants of <hi>Maſſilia</hi> hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in their Vineyards with the bones, and that the Ground enriched by the moiſture of the putrefied Bodies (which was ſoaked in with the rain of the following Winter) yielded at the ſeaſon a prodigious Crop, which ſeems to confirm <hi>Archilochus</hi>'s Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who ſaid, that <hi>the Fallows were fatted by them.</hi> Now it is an obſervation not improbable, that extraordinary Rains uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fall after great Battels; whether it be, that ſome Deity waſheth and cleanſeth the polluted Earth with ſhowers from above, or that bloud and corruption ſteaming forth a moiſt and groſs Vapour, thicken the Air, which by reaſon of its tenuity is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to alterations ariſing generally from the ſmalleſt cauſes.</p>
               <p n="35">35. After the Battel, <hi>Marius</hi> choſe out from amongſt the <hi>Barbarians</hi> Spoils and Arms, thoſe that were whole and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and that would make the greateſt ſhew in his Triumph; the reſt he heaped upon a large Pile, and offered a very ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Sacrifice. Whilſt the Army ſtood
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35403:58"/>
round about with their Arms and Garlands, himſelf attired (as the faſhion is on ſuch occaſions) in a Purple Robe, taking a lighted Torch, and with both Hands lifting it up towards Heaven, was then going to put it to the Pile, when ſome of his Friends were eſpied with all haſte coming towards him on Horſe-back; whereupon every one remained in great ſilence and expectation; when they came near, they alighting, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted <hi>Marius,</hi> and bringing him the News of his fifth Conſulſhip, delivered him Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marius</hi>'s Fifth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip.</note> to the ſame purpoſe. This gave the addition of no ſmall joy to the Solemnity. which the Army expreſſed in a Warlike kind of rejoycing and acclamations, and the Officers again crowning <hi>Marius</hi> with a Lawrel-wreath, he ſet fire to the Pile and finiſhed his Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="36">36. But whatever it be, which permits us not the enjoyment of Proſperity pure and ſincere, but ſtill interchanges humane Affairs with the mixture of good and bad, whether Fortune or Providence, or the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Nature of Things, within a few days <hi>Marius</hi> received an account of his Collegue <hi>Catulus,</hi> which as another Cloud in this Serenity and Calm terrified <hi>Rome</hi> with the apprehenſion of an imminent Storm. <hi>Catulus,</hi> who marched againſt the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> deſpairing of being able to defend
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35403:58"/>
the tops of the <hi>Alps;</hi> leſt, being compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to divide his Forces into ſeveral Parties, he ſhould very much weaken himſelf, with all expedition returned to <hi>Italy,</hi> and poſted his Army by the River <hi>Atheſis;</hi> where blocking up the Paſſages on both ſides the River with ſtrong Fortifications, he made a Bridge, that ſo he might go to their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that were on the other ſide, if ſo be the Enemy having forced the narrow Paſſages, ſhould ſtorm the Fortreſſes. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> came on with ſuch Inſolence and Contempt of their Enemies, that to ſhew their Strength and Courage, rather than out of any neceſſity, they went naked in the ſhowers of Snow, and through the Ice and deep Snow climbed up to the tops of the Hills, and from thence, placing their broad Shields under their bodies, let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſlide from the Precipices along their vaſt ſlippery Deſcents.</p>
               <p n="37">37. When they had pitched their Camp at a little diſtance from the River, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the Paſſage, they began to caſt up their Banks, Giant-like, tearing up the neighbouring Hills; and brought Trees pulled up by the roots, and heaps of Earth to the River, therewith damming up its courſe, and with great heavy Materials rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down the Stream and daſhed againſt the Bridge, they forced away the Planks
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35403:59"/>
which ſupported it; whereat the greateſt part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, left their Camp and fled. Here did <hi>Catulus</hi> ſhew himſelf a generous indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent General, in preferring the Glory of his People before his own: for when he could not prevail with his Soldiers to ſtand to their Colours, but ſaw how cowardly they all deſerted them; he commanded his own Standard to be taken up, and running to the foremoſt of thoſe that fled, he led them forward, chuſing rather that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace ſhould fall upon himſelf than his Country; and that they ſhould not ſeem to fly, but, following their Captain, to make a retreat. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> aſſaulted and took the Fortreſs on the other ſide <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis;</hi> where admiring at the few <hi>Romans</hi> there left; who had ſhewn themſelves of an extream great Courage, and had fought worthy their Country, they diſmiſſed them with an eaſie Compoſition, ſwearing them upon their Brazen Bull; which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taken in the Battel, and they ſay, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Catulus</hi>'s Houſe, as the chief Trophy of the Victory.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Thus falling in upon the Country, deſtitute of defence, they waſted it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, whereupon <hi>Marius</hi> was preſently ſent for to the City; where when he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, every one ſuppoſing he would Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35403:59"/>
the Senate too unanimouſly voting it, he himſelf did not think it convenient; whether that he were not willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive his Soldiers and Officers of their ſhare of the Glory; or that to encourage the People in this juncture, he would make the honour of his Victory give place to the preſent Fortune of the City; deferring it now to receive it afterwards with the greater Splendour. Having left ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as the occaſion required, he haſt'ned to <hi>Catulus,</hi> whoſe drooping Spirits he very much raiſed, and ſent for his Army from <hi>Gallia:</hi> as ſoon as it came, he paſſing the River <hi>Po,</hi> endeavoured to drive the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> out of that part of <hi>Italy</hi> which lies South of it.</p>
               <p n="39">39. But they pretending they were in expectation of the <hi>Teutones,</hi> and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were ſo long in coming, deferred the Battel; either that they were really ignorant of their Defeat, or at leaſt were willing to ſeem ſo (for they very much abuſed thoſe that brought them ſuch News) and ſending to <hi>Marius,</hi> required ſome part of the Country for them and their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Cities fit for them to inhabit. When <hi>Marius</hi> enquired of the Ambaſſadors who their Brethren were, and they calling them <hi>Teutones,</hi> all that were preſent fell out a laughing; but <hi>Marius</hi> ſcoffingly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:35403:60"/>
them, <hi>Do not trouble your ſelves for your Brethren, for we have already provided Lands for them, which they ſhall poſſeſs for ever.</hi> The Ambaſſadors perceiving the jeer, railed at him, and threatned that the <hi>Cimbri</hi> would make him ſmart for it, and the <hi>Teutones</hi> too when they came. <hi>And they are not far off, replied</hi> Marius, <hi>it will be very unkindly done of you to go away before you have taken leave of your Brethren;</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, he commanded the Kings of the <hi>Teutones</hi> to be brought out, as they were, in chains; for they were taken by the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quani</hi> before they could make their eſcape from the <hi>Alps.</hi> This was no ſooner made known to the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> but they with all expedition came againſt <hi>Marius,</hi> who then lay ſtill and guarded his Camp.</p>
               <p n="40">40. 'Tis ſaid, that againſt this Battel <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He allows the faſhion of the Piles.</note> firſt made their Javelins after a new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion; for before at the place where the Wood was joyned to the Iron, it was made faſt with two Iron-pins; now <hi>Marius</hi> let one of them alone as it was, and pulling out the other put a weak wooden peg in its place; contriving it ſo, that when it was ſtuck in the Enemy's Shield, it ſhould not ſtand right out; but the wooden peg break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Iron ſhould bend, and ſo the Pile ſticking faſt by its crooked point, ſhould weigh down the Shield. Now <hi>Baeorix,</hi> King<note place="margin">Baeorix.</note>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:35403:60"/>
of the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> came with a ſmall Party of Horſe to the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, and challenged <hi>Marius</hi> to appoint the time and place, where they might meet and fight for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. <hi>Marius</hi> anſwered, <hi>That the</hi> Romans <hi>never conſulted their Enemies when to fight, however he would gratifie the</hi> Cimbri <hi>ſo far;</hi> and ſo they pitched upon the third day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for the place, the Plain near <hi>Vercellae;</hi> which was convenient enough for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Horſe, and afforded room for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to diſplay their Numbers.</p>
               <p n="41">41. They obſerved the time appointed, and drew out their Forces againſt each other. <hi>Catulus</hi> commanded 20300, and <hi>Marius</hi> 32000, who were placed in the two Wings, leaving to <hi>Catulus</hi> the Main Battle. <hi>Sylla,</hi> who was preſent at the Fight, gives this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſaying withal, that <hi>Marius</hi> drew up his Army in this Order, out of malice to <hi>Catulus;</hi> for he hoped, with his Wings ſtretched out farther, to fall in upon the Body of the Enemies Army [it being cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary in that manner of embattelling, that the Army ſhould repreſent a Creſcent; the two extream Points much advancing, and the main Battel remaining behind] and to rout them before <hi>Catulus</hi> and his Army ſhould be able to charge them. They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve likewiſe, that <hi>Catulus</hi> himſelf alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this in vindication of his Honour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:35403:61"/>
this enviouſneſs of <hi>Marius.</hi> The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry of the <hi>Cimbri</hi> marched quietly out of their Trenches, having their Flanks e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to their Front; (every ſide of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my took up thirty (furlongs) their Horſe, that were in number 15000, made a very ſplendid appearance. They wore Helmets, whereon were the gapings of wild Beaſts, and other ſtrange ſhapes, which they height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with Plumes of Feathers, appeared greater than they were; they had on Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates of Iron, and white glittering Shields; and for their offenſive Arms, every one had two-edged Darts, and when they came hand to hand, they uſed great and heavy Swords.</p>
               <p n="42">42. They did not fall directly upon the Front of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but turning to the right, they endeavoured to encloſe them by little and little, getting the Enemy between them and their Infantry, who were placed in the left Wing. The <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders ſoon perceived the Deſign, but could not contain the Soldiers: for one happ'ning to ſhout out, that the Enemy fled, they all haſtned to purſue them; whereupon the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Foot came on moving like a great Ocean. Here <hi>Marius,</hi> having waſhed his hands, and lifting them up towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, vowed an <hi>Hecatomb</hi> to the Gods; and <hi>Catulus</hi> too in the ſame poſture ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed to conſecrate a Temple to the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35403:61"/>
Fortune of that day: they ſay that <hi>Marius</hi> having the Victim ſhewed to him, as he was ſacrificing, cried out with a loud voice, <hi>The Victory is mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="43">43. However in the Engagement, they that write <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Life, ſay, that <hi>Marius</hi> was very unfortunate; for a great duſt being raiſed, which (as it might very probably happen) almoſt covered both the Armies; he, as ſoon as he had charged them, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Forces to the purſuit, miſſed of the Enemy; and having paſſed by their Army, for a good ſpace wandered up and down the Field; mean while the Enemy by chance engaged with <hi>Catulus;</hi> and the heat of the Battel was chiefly with him and his men, among whom <hi>Sylla</hi> ſays he was. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had great advantage of the heat and Sun that ſhone in the faces of the <hi>Cimbri;</hi> for they, though very well able to endure cold, as having been bred up in cool and ſhady places, (as we obſerved before) were yet overcome with the exceſſive Heat: they ſweat extreamly, and were much out of breath, being forced to hold their Shields before their Faces; for this Battel was fought not long after the Summer Solſtice; or, as the <hi>Romans</hi> reckon, about the third of the Calends of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> then called <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis.</hi> The Duſt too gave no ſmall addition to their Courage, in as much as it hid the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:35403:62"/>
Enemy, for they could not afar off diſcover their number; but every one advancing to encounter thoſe that were neareſt to them, they were come to fight hand-to-hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſight of ſo vaſt a multitude had ſtruck terror into them.</p>
               <p n="44">44. The <hi>Romans</hi> were ſo much uſed to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,<note place="margin">The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> well exerciſed.</note> and ſo well exerciſed, that in all the heat and toil of the Encounter, not one of them was obſerved either to ſweat, or to be out of breath, inſomuch that they ſay <hi>Catu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> recorded it in commendation of his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Here the greateſt part and moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant of the Enemies were cut in pieces; for thoſe that fought in the Front, that they ſhould not break their Ranks, were faſt tied to one another with long Chains put through their Belts. As they purſued thoſe that fled to their Camp, they met with a moſt horrid Tragedy; the Women ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Mourning by their Carriages, ſlew<note place="margin">The <hi>Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> all that fled; ſome their Husbands, ſome their Brethren, others their Fathers; and ſtrangling their little Children with their own hands, threw them under the Wheels, and Horſes feet, and then killed themſelves. They tell of one that was hanging on the very top of a Waggon, with her Children tied dangling at her heels; the men for want of Trees, tied themſelves, ſome to the horns of the Oxen, the necks of others
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:35403:62"/>
were faſtned to their legs, that ſo pricking them on by the ſtarting and ſpringing of the Beaſts, they might be torn and troden to pieces. Yet for all they thus maſſacred themſelves, above 60000 were taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and thoſe that were ſlain were ſaid to be twice as many.</p>
               <p n="45">45. The ordinary plunder <hi>Marius</hi>'s Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers forcibly took away; but the other Spoils, as Enſigns, Trumpets, and the like they ſay, were brought to <hi>Catulus</hi>'s Camp, which he uſed for the beſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Victory was obtained by himſelf and his Army. Whereupon ſome Diſſentions ariſing (as it often happens) among the Soldiers, the Ambaſſadors from <hi>Parma</hi> being then preſent, were made Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Controverſie; whom <hi>Catulus</hi>'s men carried about among their ſlain Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and manifeſtly ſhewed them that they were ſlain by their <hi>Piles,</hi> which were known by the Inſcriptions, having <hi>Catu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>'s Name cut in the Wood: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the whole Glory of the Action was aſcribed to <hi>Marius,</hi> by reaſon of his former Victory and under colour of his preſent Authority. The Populace more eſpecially ſtiling him the <hi>third Founder of their City,</hi> as having diverted a danger no leſs threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning than was that when the <hi>Gauls</hi> ſacked <hi>Rome;</hi> and every one rejoicing at home
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:35403:63"/>
with his Wife and Children ſacrificed to the Gods and to <hi>Marius;</hi> and would have had<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Catulus</hi> Triumph.</note> him ſolely to have the honour of both the Triumphs. However he would not do ſo, but Triumphed together with <hi>Catulus;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to ſhew his Moderation even in ſo great Circumſtances of good Fortune; beſides, he was not a little afraid of the Soldiers in <hi>Catulus</hi>'s Army, leſt if he ſhould wholly bereave their General of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, they ſhould endeavour to hinder him of his Triumph.</p>
               <p n="46">46. <hi>Marius</hi> was now in his Fifth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip,<note place="margin">How <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> got his ſixth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhiy.</note> and he uſed for the Sixth in ſuch a manner as never any before him had done; he took the People by the hand, and ingratiated himſelf with the Multitude by his Complaiſance, thereby not only derogating from the Publick Grandeur and Majeſty of his Office, but acting alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his own inclination, that ſo he might ſeem popular and obliging, for which nature had never deſigned him. He was, they ſay, exceeding timorous through his Ambition in any buſineſs which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Government, or was handled in Publick Aſſemblies; and that undaunted preſence of Mind he always ſhewed in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel againſt the Enemy, forſook him when he was to Harangue the People; being one that was apt to ſhew very great Concern
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:35403:63"/>
either at their commendation or diſpraiſe. 'Tis reported, that having at one time made free of the City 1000 men of <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino,</hi> who had behaved themſelves valiantly in this War; and this ſeeming to be illegal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, ſome or other calling him to an account for it, he anſwered, that the Law ſpake too ſoftly to be heard in ſuch a noiſe of War: however he himſelf appeared to be more concerned and aſtoniſhed at that noiſe which was made by the Aſſemblies. The need they had of him in time of War pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him his Wealth and Dignity; but in Civil Affairs when he deſpaired of getting the firſt place, he was forced to betake himſelf to the favour of the People, never regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be a good man, ſo that he were but a great One.</p>
               <p n="47">47. Whereupon he became very odious to all the Nobility, and eſpecially fearing <hi>Metellus,</hi> who had been ſo ingratefully uſed by him; and who, being truly vertuous, was naturally an Enemy to thoſe that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the People, not for the publick good, but for their private pleaſure. <hi>Marius</hi> therefore endeavoured to baniſh him the City, and to this purpoſe he contracted a familiar Acquaintance with <hi>Glaucias</hi> and<note place="margin">His Faction with <hi>Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> and <hi>Saturni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>

                  <hi>Saturninus,</hi> a couple of daring reſolute Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, who had a great company of poor ſeditious People at their beck; by their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance

he enacted certain Laws, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering ſome Soldiers, he placed them in the Aſſembly, and by this Faction oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Metellus.</hi> And as <hi>Rutilius</hi> relates (in all other reſpects a faithful and authentick Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian, but indeed privately an Enemy to <hi>Marius</hi>) he obtained his Sixth Conſulſhip, by diſtributing vaſt Sums of Money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Tribes, and ſo too bought their Votes to put by <hi>Metellus</hi> from the Office, and to elect <hi>Valerius Flaccus</hi> his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument rather than his Collegue in the Conſulſhip. The People had never before beſtowed ſo many Conſulſhips on any one man, except on <hi>Valerius Corvinus</hi> only; and he too, they ſay, was forty five years between his firſt and laſt; but <hi>Marius</hi> from his firſt ran through five more with one puſh of his good Fortune.</p>
               <p n="48">48. In the laſt of which eſpecially he contracted a great deal of hatred, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſeveral groſs miſdemeanours in compliance with the irregular deſires of <hi>Saturninus;</hi> among which was the murther of <hi>Nonius,</hi>

Which accordingly ſucceeded to his wiſh; for as ſoon as <hi>Metellus</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he would not ſwear to it, the Senate adjourned.</p>

ſtepped forth, (whereupon was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſilence, and every one very intent upon him) and bidding farewel to thoſe fine ſmooth Speeches he had before made in the Senate, ſaid; That he was not grown ſo obſtinate as to do any thing to the prejudice of ſo good a deſign; but would willingly ſwear and ſubmit to the Law, if ſo be it were one (which Caution he added as a Pretext for his Impudence.) The People extreamly pleaſed at his taking the Oath, mightily extolled and applauded him, the Nobility were very much aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and vexed at <hi>Marius</hi>'s Inconſtancy; but they were forced, for fear of the People, to ſwear in order till it came to <hi>Metellus</hi>'s turn. But he, though his Friends follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and entreated him to take the Oath, and not to plunge himſelf irrecoverably into thoſe Penalties which <hi>Saturninus</hi> had provided for them that would not take it, would not flinch from his reſolution, nor ſwear; but according to his uſual cuſtom, being ready to ſuffer any thing rather than do a baſe unworthy Action, left the <hi>Forum</hi> telling them that were with him, <hi>That it was baſe to do any thing that is ill, and common to do well, where there is no danger; but where there is, even in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of that, to do well was the property of a good man.</hi>

Hereupon <hi>Saturninus</hi> put it to the Vote that the Conſuls ſhould declare <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi> baniſhed, and that none ſhould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him: there was enough too of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of People ready to kill him; and when many of the better ſort were extreamly concerned for, and gathered about <hi>Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> he would not ſuffer them to raiſe a Sedition upon his account; but more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly left the City, ſaying; <hi>Either when the poſture of affairs is mended, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple repent, I ſhall be recalled; or if things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the preſent poſture, it will be beſt to be abſent.</hi> But how great Favour and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Metellus</hi> received in his Baniſhment, and after what manner he ſpent his time at <hi>Rhodes</hi> in Philoſophy, we ſhall more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely ſhew you when we write his Life.</p>
               <p n="51">51. <hi>Marius,</hi> for this piece of Service done him, forced to connive at <hi>Saturninus,</hi> now arrived at the very height of Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Force, had unawares occaſioned ſuch a flame as could not now be eaſily quenched, but by Outrages and Maſſacres directly tending to Tyranny and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Government; for ſtanding in ſome awe of the Nobility, and withal flattering the Commonalty, he did a very<note place="margin">His double dealing with the Senate and Commons.</note> cowardly and diſhoneſt Action. When ſome of the great men came to him at night
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:35403:66"/>
to ſtir him up againſt <hi>Saturninus,</hi> he let him in unknown to them at the other door; then making the ſame pretences of doing his neceſſary occaſions to both, he ran from one Party to the other, and ſtaying one while with them and another with him, he inſtigated and exaſperated them one againſt another. At length, when both the Senate and Equeſtrian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Order, agreed together, and ſhewed their reſentment at it, he filled the Market-place with Soldiers; and by cutting off the <hi>Aqueducts,</hi> he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thoſe that retreated to the Capitol to ſurrender for want of Water: they in this diſtreſs ſubmitted themſelves upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, whom he endeavoured all ways imaginable to preſerve, but without Succeſs; for when they came into the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> they were all baſely murthered.

               <p n="52">52. There was now an edict preferring to recal <hi>Metellus</hi> from Baniſhment; this he

vigorouſly, but in vain, oppoſed both in his Diſcourſe and Actions: yet at length deſiſted; for the People unanimouſly vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for it, and he not able to endure the ſight of <hi>Metellus</hi>'s Return, made a Voyage to <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Galatia;</hi> giving out that he was to perform ſome Sacrifices, which he had vowed to <hi>Cybele;</hi> but had indeed another reaſon for his departure, which was not to be diſcovered to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He being one altogether ignorant of Civility and State-Affairs, had received all his advancement from the War; and then too ſuppoſing both his Power and Glory would by little and little decreaſe by his lying quiet and out of action, ſought by all means to lay the Foundation of ſome new Commotions, and hoped too that by ſetting at variance ſome of the neighbour Kings, and by ſtirring up and exaſperating <hi>Mithridates</hi> eſpecially, who was then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently making preparations for War, he himſelf ſhould be choſen General againſt him, and ſo furniſh the City with new matter of Triumph, and his own Houſe with the Plunder of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and the Riches of its King.

When <hi>Marius</hi> returned again to <hi>Rome,</hi> he built an Houſe cloſe by the Market-place, either (as he himſelf gave out) that he was not willing his Clients ſhould be tired with going far, or that he imagined it would cauſe the greater Concourſe at his Gates: yet this was not the true reaſon neither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but becauſe being inferiour to others in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging Converſation and the Arts of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, like a meer Tool and Implement of War, he was thrown aſide in time of Peace.

endeavoured forcibly to pull down theſe Preſents: <hi>Sylla</hi> on the other ſide as vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly reſiſted him, but the War of the Confederates then on a ſudden threatning the City, put a ſtop to this Sedition juſt<note place="margin">The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates War.</note> ready to break out.

               </p>
               <p n="54">54. This War ſo various as to its En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, and ſo uncertain as to its Succeſs, what Glory and Power it conferred upon <hi>Sylla,</hi> of ſo much it deprived <hi>Marius,</hi> who ſeeded not to be very brisk in his Charges, but was for the moſt part guilty of Delays, Retreats and almoſt Cowardice; whether it were, that his Age had quenched that heat and vigour he was formerly Maſter of (for he was now above ſixty five years old;) or that, as he himſelf ſaid, having ſome diſtemper in his Nerves, and his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy unfit for Action, he had for meer ſhame ventured upon ſome Expeditions above his ſtrength. Yet for all this he came off Victor in a conſiderable Battel, wherein he ſlew 6000 of the Enemies, and never gave
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:35403:68"/>
them any advantage over him. Nay, though he was once ſurrounded by the Works of the Enemy he contained himſelf; and though inſulted over, braved, and challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, yet he ſeemed not much concerned at it.

               <p n="55">55. At length pretending to be worn out with the Infirmity of his Body, he laid down his Command. Afterwards when the <hi>Italians</hi> were worſted, ſeveral at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Intereſt of thoſe that led the People, ſued for Employment in the War with <hi>Mithridates.

                  </hi> and jeeringly bad <hi>Marius</hi> go to his Baths at <hi>Baiae</hi> to cure his Body worn out, as himſelf confeſſed, with Age and Catarrhs. Now <hi>Marius</hi> had indeed there, about <hi>Miſenum,</hi> a <hi>Villa</hi> more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately and luxuriouſly furniſhed than became a man employed in ſo many and great Wars and Expeditions. This ſame Houſe <hi>Cornelia</hi> bought for 75000 <hi>Denarii,</hi> and not long after <hi>Lucius Lucullus</hi> for 250000: in ſo ſhort a time did the Luxury and Effeminacy of the <hi>Romans</hi> increaſe.

               <p n="56">56. Theſe Actions of his pleaſed ſome that went to ſee his vain-glory in thoſe Juſts and Exerciſes; but the better ſort that ſaw him, pitied his Avarice and Ambition, that from a begger growing ſo extreamly rich, and from nothing becoming ſo great, would know no bounds of his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, nor be content with being admired, and quietly enjoy what he had already got; but, as if he ſtill were in extream poverty,

This ſoon ruined the City, which had been a long time ſick of ſuch practices, when <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> had once found ſo opportune an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the publick deſtruction as <hi>Sulpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s Inſolence.</p>

At length, though late firſt, they light upon a few poor Shepherds, that had not any thing to relieve them; but knowing <hi>Marius,</hi> adviſed him to depart as ſoon as might be, for they had ſeen a little beyond that place a Party of Horſe that were gone in ſearch of him. Whereupon finding himſelf in a great ſtraight, eſpecially becauſe thoſe that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him were not able to go farther, being ſpent with their long faſting; he turned aſide out of the Road, and hid himſelf in a thick Wood, where he paſſed the Night in great diſtreſs. The next day pinched with hunger, and willing to make uſe of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtrength he had, before it were all exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, he travelled by the Sea-ſide, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging his Companions not to deſert him in the laſt of his hopes, for which he reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

Some are of Opinion that this really happ'ned to <hi>Marius</hi> after the ſame manner we have related it; others-ſay, that thoſe men who then and through the reſt of his Exile heard him tell theſe Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and believed him, have recorded a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation altogether fabulous; for an Eagle ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hatches more than two; beſides they give <hi>Muſaeus</hi> the Lye, who ſpeaking of the Eagle, ſay, <hi>That ſhe lays three Eggs, hatches two, and nouriſhes but one.</hi> Whatever this be, it is certain <hi>Marius</hi> in his Exile and greateſt Extremities would often ſay, that he had ſtill a proſpect of a Seventh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip.</p>
               <p n="62">62. When <hi>Marius</hi> and his company were now about twenty furlongs diſtant from <hi>Minturnae,</hi> a City in <hi>Italy,</hi> they eſpied a Troop of Horſe making up toward them
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:35403:71"/>
with all ſpeed, and by chance alſo at the ſame time two Ships under ſail; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ran every one with what ſpeed and ſtrength they could to the Sea, and plunging themſelves into it, ſwam to the Ships. Thoſe that were with <hi>Granius</hi> ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon one of them, and paſſed over to an oppoſite Iſland called <hi>Aenaria; Marius</hi> himſelf, whoſe Body was heavy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy, was with great pains and difficulty born above the Water by two Servants, and put into the other Ship. The Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were by this time come to the Sea-ſide, and from thence commanded the Sea-men to put to Shoar, or elſe to throw out <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and then they might go whither they would. <hi>Marius</hi> beſought them with tears to the contrary; and the Maſters of the Ship, after ſome conſultation, which incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned firſt to one then to the other ſide, reſolved at length to anſwer the Soldiers, that <hi>they would not throw out</hi> Marius. As ſoon as they were gone in a rage, the Sea-men immediately changing their reſolution, came to Land, and caſting Anchor at the mouth of the River <hi>Liris,</hi> where it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing makes a great Mariſh; they advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to Land, refreſh himſelf on Shore, and take ſome care of his diſcompoſed body, till the Wind came fairer, which, ſay they, will happen at ſuch an hour, when the

Wind from the Sea will calm, and that from the Mariſhes riſe. <hi>Marius</hi> following their advice, did ſo, and when the Sea-men had ſet him on Shore, he laid him down in an adjacent Field, ſuſpecting nothing leſs than what was to befall him. They, as ſoon as they had got into the Ship, weighed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor and departed, as thinking it neither honourable to deliver <hi>Marius</hi> into the hands of thoſe that ſought him, nor ſafe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him.</p>

In the interim, as by a certain turn of Fortune, there came News from all Parts, that <hi>Sylla</hi> having put an end to the War with <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and taken poſſeſſion of the Provinces, was returning into <hi>Italy</hi> with a great Army. This gave ſome ſmall reſpit and intermiſſion to theſe unſpeakable Calamities, when they thought that a War threatned them; whereupon <hi>Marius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marius</hi>'s Seventh Conſulſhip.</note> was choſen Conſul the Seventh time, and appearing on the very Calends of <hi>January,</hi> the beginning of the Year, he threw one <hi>Sextus Lucinus</hi> from the <hi>Tarpejan</hi> Precipice, which was no ſmall <hi>Omen</hi> of approaching miſeries both to their Party and the City. <hi>Marius</hi> himſelf now worn out with Labour and ſinking under the burthen of his Cares, could not bear up his Spirits flagging with the apprehenſion of a New War, and freſh En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters and Dangers, which he had by his own experience found formerly very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He conſidered too that he was not now to hazard the War with <hi>Octavius</hi> or <hi>Merula,</hi> commanding the unexperienced Multitude or ſeditious Rabble; but that <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> himſelf was approaching, the ſame who had formerly baniſhed him, and ſince that

driven <hi>Mithridates</hi> as far as the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p n="77">77. Perplexed with ſuch thoughts as<note place="margin">His diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and death.</note> theſe, and calling to mind his Baniſhment, the tedious wanderings and dangers he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent both by Sea and Land, he fell into great Troubles, nocturnal Frights and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet Sleep, ſtill fancying that he heard ſome telling him, <hi>That the Den, though of an abſent Lion; is dreadful;</hi> above all things fearing to lie awake, he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf over to drinking and ſotting at Nights very unagreeable to his Age; by all means provoking Sleep, as a diverſion to his Thoughts. At length there came an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Meſſenger from the Sea, giving him ſuch an account of Affairs as overcharged him with freſh Cares and Frights; ſo that what with his fear for the future, and what with the weight and tediouſneſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, having ſome ſmall diſpoſition to it, he fell into a Pluriſie, as <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher relates, who ſays he went to, and diſcourſed with him when he was ſick, about ſome buſineſs relating to his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. One <hi>Cajus Piſo</hi> an Hiſtorian tells us, that <hi>Marius</hi> walking after Supper with his Friends, when they fell into a diſcourſe about his concerns, and reckoned up the ſeveral changes of his Condition, that from the beginning had happ'ned to him, he ſaid,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:35403:80"/>
that it did not become a prudent man to truſt himſelf any longer with Fortune; and thereupon taking leave of thoſe that were with him, he kept his bed ſeven days, and then died.</p>
               <p n="78">78. Some ſay he very much betrayed his Ambition even in his Sickneſs, and fell into an extravagant frenzy, fancying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be General in the War againſt <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi> acting ſuch poſtures and motions of his body, as he uſed when he was in the Battel; with frequent Shouts and loud Acclamations, with ſo ſtrong and invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a deſire of being employed in that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as he poſſeſſed through his Pride and Emulation. He, though he had now lived threeſcore and ten Years, and was the firſt man that ever was choſen ſeven times Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, poſſeſſed of ſuch a Palace, and ſo great Riches as were ſufficient for many Kings, yet complained of his ill Fortune; that he muſt now die before he had attained what he deſired. Plato <hi>when he ſaw his death</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plato.</note> 
                  <hi>approaching, thanked his God and Fortune; Firſt, that he was born a man and a</hi> Grecian, <hi>not a</hi> Barbarian <hi>or a</hi> Brute, <hi>and next, that he happ'ned to live in</hi> Socrates's <hi>Age.</hi> And ſo indeed they ſay <hi>Antipater</hi> of <hi>Tarſus,</hi> in<note place="margin">Antipater.</note> like manner at his death recollecting what proſperity he had enjoyed, did not ſo much as omit his happy Voyage to <hi>Athens;</hi> thus
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:35403:81"/>
returning to every favour of his indulgent Fortune with the greateſt acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and retaining it to the very laſt in his memory, than which <hi>Man hath not a more ſecure Treaſure.</hi> But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Perſons fooliſh and ungrateful to God and Nature, loſe the enjoyment of their preſent proſperity by fanſying ſomething better to come; whereas by Fortune we may be prevented of this, but that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be taken from us. Yet they reject their preſent ſucceſs, as though it did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them, and do nothing but dream of future uncertainties; and in this they have but what they deſerve, for till they have by Learning and Education laid a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for external Superſtructures; in the ſeeking after and gathering them, they can never ſatisfie the unlimited deſires of their mind.</p>
               <p n="80">80. Thus died <hi>Marius</hi> on the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Day of his Seventh Conſulſhip, to the great Joy and content of <hi>Rome;</hi> which thereby was in good hopes to be delivered from the Calamity of an Inſolent, bloody and fatal Tyranny; but in a ſmall time they found, that they had only changed their old Maſter for another young and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous; ſo much cruelty and ſalvageneſs did his Son <hi>Marius</hi> ſhew in murthering the<note place="margin">Young <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi>

an early deſire of Glory, taught to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected under diſgrace, and rais'd by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. And he that was inſenſible of theſe, was look'd upon as one of a mean ſpirit, and uncapable of aſpiring to any thing that's great or manly. That emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then and thirſt after fame which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the whole courſe of <hi>Lyſander's</hi> Life we have no reaſon to blame him for; it came from his Country, and education; but another fault he had which was purely his own; He paid too ſervile a deference and more than became a <hi>Spartan,</hi> to great men; and where his intereſt was concern'd, bore the frowns of men in Authority ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too patiently. Which however by ſome is reckon'd no ſmall part of Policy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> where he obſerves that great wits are generally enclin'd to Melancholy (inſtanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Socrates, Plato</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi>) ſays too, that <hi>Lyſander,</hi> though not in his Youth, was in his declining Age ſubject to it. But that which peculiarly diſtinguiſh'd his Character, was the way he had of making poverty ſit well upon him, and of keeping his mind ſteady and untainted under the greateſt affluence. For he reſerv'd nothing for himſelf out of all thoſe ſpoils of Gold and Silver that he brought from the <hi>Attick</hi> War, but liberally diſpers'd 'em among his Country-men, who upon this increaſe of riches began to value
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:35403:84"/>
'em as much as they deſpis'd 'em before. Another inſtance of his generous diſpoſition was this, when <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant wou'd have preſented his Daughters with ſome Garments of a rich Embroidery, he refus'd 'em, with that handſome excuſe, That they were fit only to make unhappy faces more remarkable: But this temper wore off by degrees; for being ſent Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour ſome time after to the ſame Tyrant who offer'd him the choice of two Veſts, I like this beſt ſays he, and modeſtly took both.</p>
               <p>After a long continuance of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneſian</hi> War, when the <hi>Athenians</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a great blow in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and were under fearful apprehenſions of a total over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw both by Sea and Land, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> being recall'd from baniſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> manag'd the War with ſuch ſucceſs that he quickly chang'd the whole ſcene of Affairs, and after ſome engagements, made the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> equal in naval power to the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who now began to be ſenſible of their dangerous condition, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to exert themſelves more vigorouſly. They knew this deſign requir'd greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations and a bold Commander. After the ſtricteſt enquiry they found none of more ability for this ſervice than <hi>Lyſander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:35403:85"/>In diſcharge of this new Office he went to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and found that City particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well inclin'd to him, and withal wholly in the intereſt of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> though at that time in very mean circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and almoſt over-run with the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous <hi>Perſian</hi> cuſtoms, by reaſon of their frequent commerce with 'em, being ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted opportunely enough to invite the great Officers of that kingdom often to reſide there. This kind reception he met with from the <hi>Epheſians</hi> engag'd him to pitch his Tents among 'em. He commanded all Victuallers to be brought into their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and built a dock for his capital Ships, and by this means their ports were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by Merchants, their exchange was full of buſineſs, and their Shops had a plentiful Trade; ſo that this City is ſo far oblig'd to <hi>Lyſander</hi> that it ought to date from that time the hope and riſe of the greatneſs and ſplendor with which it now flouriſhes. But hearing that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was now at <hi>Sardis,</hi> he went thither chiefly to acquaint him with the treachery of <hi>Tiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes,</hi> who though he had a commiſſion to aſſiſt the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> againſt the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> upon ſome ſollicitation from <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> (as 'twas ſuſpected) acted remiſſly, and by neglecting to pay his Soldiers, had occaſion'd the ruine of his Fleet. <hi>Cyrus</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:35403:85"/>
was eaſily perſwaded to believe the truth of this accuſation, for he had before heard an ill character of <hi>Tiſſaphernes,</hi> and was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf particularly diſoblig'd by him. <hi>Lyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> by theſe means, and the opportunities he had of being familiar with the young Prince, entirely gain'd his affections, and by affable converſation, and due reſpect, engag'd him ſtrongly on his ſide. <hi>Cyrus</hi> to ſhew how great a kindneſs he had for <hi>Lyſander,</hi> after he had ſplendidly entertain'd him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd him to deal freely, and aſſured him whatſoever he ask'd ſhould be granted. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> was ſo modeſt as only to ask a ſmall addition to the Sea-men's pay. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was taken with his generous anſwer, and made him a preſent of ten thouſand pieces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>Lyſander</hi> manag'd this to the beſt advantage, and out of his own ſtock libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally encreaſed the Sea-men's pay; by this encouragement to his Soldiers, in a ſhort time he quite waſted the Enemies fleet, for many of the common Soldiers were glad to go over to that party where the moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was ſtirring. And thoſe few that ſtaid behind behav'd themſelves with a great deal of indifferency to their Officers, and often mutini'd. Though he had thus drain'd and weaken'd his adverſaries, he durſt not engage 'em, becauſe <hi>Alcibiades</hi> who was their admiral, had the advantage
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:35403:86"/>
of him in the number of Ships, and had been better experienc'd, and hitherto more ſucceſsful in whatever enterprize he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took either by Sea or Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcibiades</hi> having occaſion to go from <hi>Samos</hi> to <hi>Phocea,</hi> left <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Vice-Admiral, who to upbraid and provoke <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> ſail'd to the very mouth of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and impudently paſs'd by him with a great deal of noiſe and ſcorn. <hi>Lyſander</hi> who was too high ſpirited, not to reſent this open affront, with two or three Ships immediately purſu'd him, but when he ſaw freſh ſupplies come to the relief of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he call'd up more to his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and in a little while the whole Fleet was engag'd. <hi>Lyſander</hi> ſoon got the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, took fifteen of their Ships, and ſet up a Trophy. The people of <hi>Athens</hi> were highly diſpleas'd at <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and turn'd him out of their ſervice, who being now diſreſpected and ſlightly ſpoken of by the Soldiers in <hi>Samos,</hi> left the Army and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi> This fight was no farther conſiderable than as <hi>Alcibiades</hi>'s miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune made it ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſander</hi> while he had a little reſpite, ſent a choice number of bold and prudent men to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> with inſtructions, to form themſelves into Companies, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to Policy and buſineſs, upon
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:35403:86"/>
promiſe that aſſoon as the <hi>Athenians</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was broken, their Democracy ſhou'd be diſſolv'd, and they made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors in their reſpective Cities; by this contrivance, he ſecretly made way for the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> and all other innovations which afterwards ſucceeded in that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. For he kept his word with his Friends, and ſtill promoted thoſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted themſelves well in any Office, to higher honours and preferments, and to comply with their covetous humours, was himſelf or Accomplice in all their injuſtice and oppreſſion. So every body endeavour'd to ingratiate himſelf with <hi>Lyſander;</hi> to Him only people made their Court and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and promis'd themſelves all that was Great or Honourable, while the chief power of the Republick was lodg'd in him. Wherefore aſſoon as he left 'em they were very uneaſie under his Succeſſor <hi>Callicrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> whoſe Actions indeed ſhow'd him to be Great and Juſt, yet the people were all along diſcontented with his Conduct, which favour'd too much of <hi>Dorick</hi> plainneſs as they call'd it, that is, true Honeſty and Sincerity. 'Tis true, they admir'd his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as men do the Beauty of ſome Hero's ſtatue, but their deſires all this while were bent upon <hi>Lyſander,</hi> the loſs of whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and benevolence they were ſo ſenſible
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:35403:87"/>
of, that ſome of 'em expreſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern with Tears. Nay, he drew off their Affections yet more from <hi>Callicratidas,</hi> for he ſent back to <hi>Cyrus</hi> the reſidue of that money he had receiv'd from him for the Soldiers pay, and ſcornfully ſaid, <hi>Let's ſee now how you,</hi> Callicratidas, <hi>can ſupport the Charges of the Army. I have reſign'd that Fleet to you which Commands the whole Ocean.</hi> This emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and affected vanity, <hi>Callicratidas</hi> thus handſomely reprov'd. <hi>Firſt paſs the</hi> Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian <hi>Navy at</hi> Samos, <hi>after that reſign me your Command, and then I'll confeſs you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd up to me that Fleet which rides maſter of the Seas, for till it dares face the Enemy there, it can ſcarce, I think, claim that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi> No ſays <hi>Lyſander,</hi> I have done with it now, 'tis wholly under your conduct, ſo he ſail'd off for <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Callicratidas</hi> was left in great perplexity, for he had brought no money from home with him, neither cou'd he raiſe any, the People had been too much oppreſs'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure another Tax. The only refuge he had was to beg Supplies, as <hi>Lyſander</hi> had done, from ſome foreign Prince. And he was the moſt unqualified of any man for this employ, for he was of ſo Noble and generous a Spirit, that he cou'd ſooner brook Slavery under a <hi>Grecian</hi> Enemy, than bring himſelf to flatter and careſs a

                  <hi>Barbarian,</hi> who had nothing to value him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon but his Gold. However neceſſity forc'd him to <hi>Lydia,</hi> and when he came to <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Palace, he bid one of the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants tell him, <hi>Callicratidas</hi> was come to wait upon him. The Servant reply'd, <hi>The King is not at leiſure now, he's drinking.</hi> Well, ſays <hi>Callicratidas,</hi> (without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of an Affront) <hi>I'll ſtay till he has done.</hi> The <hi>Lydians</hi> upon this anſwer took him for ſome ill bred Clown. So when he ſaw himſelf laugh'd at, and ſlighted by the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> he withdrew a while, but upon his return not gaining admiſſion, he reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it ſo highly, that he went immediately to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> reflecting with indignation upon thoſe mean wretches, that firſt cring'd to <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and encourag'd 'em to be proud, only becauſe they were rich; he farther proteſted to ſome of his Friends, that aſſoon as he arriv'd at <hi>Sparta,</hi> he wou'd make it his buſineſs to reconcile the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and unite 'em againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> or at leaſt perſwade 'em ſo far, as never to accept aſſiſtance from their hands againſt one another. Theſe reſolutions indeed were worthy of <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratidas,</hi> whoſe virtue and bravery were not inferiour to the greateſt of the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians,</hi> but he was unhappily taken off, after he had loſt the victory at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginuſa,</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:35403:88"/>
before he cou'd put 'em in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The proſpect of affairs looking now very diſmally, the <hi>Confederates</hi> ſent an Ambaſſy to <hi>Sparta</hi> to deſire that <hi>Lyſander</hi> might be choſe Admiral, expreſſing very earneſtly the great confidence they had of ſucceſs under his Conduct. <hi>Cyrus</hi> too diſpatch'd Letters thither to the ſame effect. Now there was a Law among the <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that oblig'd 'em never to conferr that command twice upon the ſame perſon, yet they were deſirous to gratifie their Allies; ſo they gave one <hi>Acacus</hi> the Title, but Him the power. This news was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd with great ſatisfaction by the chief Magiſtrates of the Republique. For he had long ſince rais'd their expectations, and given 'em hopes, that the Democracy ſhou'd ſoon be put down, and the whole Government devolve upon them.</p>
               <p>Whoever takes an impartial view of theſe two Generals, will find in <hi>Callicratidas</hi> an open and ſincere carriage, in <hi>Lyſander</hi> craft and cunning, for he ow'd moſt of his ſucceſs in War to ſome under-hand trick, and never ſcrupl'd to preferr Intereſt to Honeſty; he thought nature had fix'd no difference between truth and falſhood, and ſo made advantage the meaſure of both. When he was told, 'twas below the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:35403:88"/>
of one deſcended from <hi>Hercules,</hi> to relie upon Stratagems in War, he turn'd it off with a Jeſt, and ſaid, <hi>When the Lions ſtrength fails, we muſt take in the Fox's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</hi> He gave a remarkable inſtance of his diſpoſition this way at <hi>Miletus.</hi> For when his Friends whom he had promis'd to help in ſubverting the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had chang'd their Opinions, and ſided with the contrary party, he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded openly to be much pleas'd with their proceedings, and to deſire a reconciliation, but ſecretly thus contriv'd their ruine. Firſt he provok'd 'em to ſet upon the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and aſſoon as they had rais'd a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult he himſelf came up to the head of 'em, and in the ears of the common people gave 'em a ſevere reprimand, but privately fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the diſturbance, and aſſur'd 'em of his aſſiſtance. This treacherous manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his encourag'd the Rebels to ſtay in the City where they were all kill'd juſt as he had deſign'd. <hi>Androclides</hi> takes notice that this deceitful temper ran through the whole courſe of his Life; for he ſays, <hi>he cheated Children with foul play, and men with perjury, and all along follow'd the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of</hi> Polycrates. Though 'tis inexcuſable in a General to imitate a Tyrant, and very diſagreable to the character of a <hi>Spartan</hi> to uſe his Gods more contemptibly than he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:35403:89"/>
does his Enemies, for he that over-reaches his Adverſary by a falſe Oath, declares he fears Him, and deſpiſes the Gods.</p>
               <p>Without any farther reflection upon <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander's</hi> vices, let us return to his Conduct. We left the Fleet under his Command, yet he thought he had too few Ships, to encounter the Enemy with, and too many to lie ſtill, ſo he cruis'd about ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Iſlands, and ſurpriz'd <hi>Aegina,</hi> and <hi>Salamis,</hi> from whence he ſteer'd his courſe to <hi>Attica,</hi> where he waited upon <hi>Agis,</hi> and with great Oſtentation, as if he had been Maſter of the Seas, drew out his Fleet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, but hearing that the <hi>Athenians</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd him, he made off, not without ſome confuſion, towards <hi>Aſia,</hi> and finding the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> open without any guard, he attack'd <hi>Lampſacus</hi> by Sea, whilſt <hi>Thorax</hi> at the ſame time beſieg'd it by Land, and aſſoon as the Town was ſtorm'd, he gave his Soldiers the plunder of it. In the mean while the <hi>Athenian</hi> Fleet conſiſting of an hundred and eighty Sail, were going for <hi>Elis,</hi> but having intelligence that <hi>Lampſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> was taken, they alter'd their meaſures and put in at <hi>Seſtos,</hi> whence after they had taken in Proviſions, they went to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Egus,</hi> where they were juſt oppoſite to the Enemy, which was ſtill cruiſing about <hi>Lampſacus.</hi> Amongſt the <hi>Athenian</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:35403:89"/>
Commanders <hi>Philocles</hi> was one, the ſame that formerly ſtir'd up the common People to a Rebellion, and mov'd once in Council to cut off the right Thumb of every Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that they might be diſabled from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging any Weapon, and yet be ſerviceable to 'em in handling the Oar. The two navies now were in ſight of one another, and every body expected an Engagement the next morning; but <hi>Lyſander</hi> had quite other deſigns; he commanded all the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on board, as if they were to fight by break of day, and gave 'em a ſtrict charge to be in readineſs upon the firſt ſign; he gave the ſame orders to the Infantry who lay upon the ſhore: About Sun-riſing the <hi>Athenian</hi> Fleet drew up in a line directly before the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and gave the challenge, but <hi>Lyſander</hi> wou'd not accept it, however he heart'ned his men, bid every one keep his poſt and be ſilent. So the <hi>Athenians</hi> at evening were forc'd to retire, and the ſame game was play'd over for three or four days together.</p>
               <p>Upon this news <hi>Alcibiades</hi> came up to 'em out of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> and finding ſome fault with the ſituation of the Camp, and the ill management of ſome things relating to the Fleet, met with a ſcornful rebuke from <hi>Tydeus</hi> that ſent him back again. When he was gone they offer'd Battle as
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:35403:90"/>
they had done ſeveral times to no purpoſe; <hi>Lyſander,</hi> when he ſaw 'em returning with diſdain and (as they thought) ſecurity to their Harbours, diſpatch'd ſome few light Veſſels to obſerve their motion, and bid the Captains, row back aſſoon as ever they ſaw the <hi>Athenians</hi> Land, and lift up the Golden Shield from the fore deck, upon which ſign he'd immediately make up to 'em. Afterwards he gave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> orders to the Officers in the Fleet diligently to look after the Soldiers and Mariners, and take care they ſhou'd be all ready to run in briskly upon the Enemy, at the firſt ſight of the Shield. By that time he had given his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, the ſign immediately appear'd, and the Trumpet from the Admiral ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Battel, the Ships ſet ſail, and the Land men marched up along the ſhore to the promontory. The diſtance between the two continents was fifteen Furlongs, but the Sea-men were ſo eager and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, that they ſoon reach'd the oppoſite ſhore; yet <hi>Conon</hi> the chief Captain of the <hi>Athenians</hi> had deſcry'd 'em, and made what haſte he cou'd, to get his Soldiers on board; ſome he commanded, ſome he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, and others he forc'd into the Ships; but all his endeavours were in vain, his men, not in the leaſt ſuſpecting any ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, were diſpers'd; one party was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:35403:90"/>
in the Fields, another ſlept in their Tents, a third was gone to Market. So <hi>Conon</hi> when the noiſe and Cries of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> drew very near him, made his eſcape with eight Ships to <hi>Evagoras</hi> King of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> The <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> fell upon thoſe that remain'd, and either took or diſabled 'em all. Thoſe Soldiers that came to the relief of the navy were ſlain in the attempt, thoſe that thought to make their eſcape by flight, were purſu'd and taken. <hi>Lyſander</hi> took three thouſand Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners with their Commanders, and ſeiz'd the whole Fleet, except thoſe few Ships that convey'd <hi>Conon</hi> to <hi>Evagoras.</hi> Thus after he had compleated this famous Victory by his own Counſel and Conduct, and in ſo little a time, with ſuch unexpected ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, put an end to that War which had been ſo long depending, and in which more <hi>Grecians</hi> loſt their Lives, than in all the former ones, he return'd in Triumph to <hi>Lampſacus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Action was ſo ſurprizing that 'twas thought a particular Providence was concern'd in it. Some ſay <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lux</hi> plac'd themſelves on each ſide <hi>Lyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's</hi> Ship, and attended this affair with extraordinary influence. Others fanſi'd a ſtone, that ſeem'd to fall from Heaven, to be an Omen of this overthrow. 'Twas of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:35403:91"/>
a vaſt bigneſs, and fell by the River <hi>Egus.</hi> The <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> eſteem it very much, and ſhow it among their Curioſities to this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> tells us that <hi>Lyſander,</hi> when the three Thouſand <hi>Athenians</hi> which he took priſoners were condemned by the Council, call'd <hi>Philocles</hi> and asked him What puniſhment he thought that man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, who advis'd the Citizens to proceed ſo ſeverely againſt the <hi>Grecians? Philocles</hi> not at all daunted in his Adverſity, reply'd, <hi>You are no judge in this Caſe, but do you uſe your Priſoners as I wou'd have us'd you, if you had been mine.</hi> After this bold anſwer, with all gayety and cheerfulneſs he led on his Country-men, as if he had been going rather to a Triumph, than his Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>When this Tragedy was over, <hi>Lyſander</hi> viſited all the neighbouring Cities, and Commanded all the <hi>Athenians</hi> he found, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of death, to repair to <hi>Athens.</hi> His deſign was this, That the City being thus throng'd might ſoon be reduc'd to Famine, and glad to ſurrender upon diſcretion, as ſoon as he open'd the Siege. Where-ever he came, he chang'd the preſent Government of the place, and put in a <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> as Chief with ten other Aſſiſtants. Thus he dealt not only with his Enemies, but his
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:35403:91"/>
Allies, and by this means had in a manner engroſs'd to himſelf the whole Empire of <hi>Greece.</hi> He did not employ the Nobility or the wealthy Citizens in any part of the Government, but put it into the hands either of private Friends, or ſtrangers, and entruſted 'em with full power of Life and Death. Many were executed whilſt he was preſent, and whoever expreſt any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of his Friends proceedings were ſure to meet with very hard uſage. This manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gave the <hi>Greeks</hi> an ill Opinion of the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Government. From hence <hi>Theopompus</hi> took occaſion by way of drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery to compare the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> with Vint'ners, who whilſt they pretend to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain us with ſweet Wine give it a daſh of Vinegar; for though <hi>Lyſander</hi> openly profeſs'd he allow'd 'em all their Freedom and privileges, yet he oppreſs'd 'em ſo much by his Ambitious and Tyrannical Officers that no Slavery cou'd be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to 'em than what he call'd Liberty.</p>
               <p>Having ſettled Affairs here according to his mind, and diſpatch'd Meſſengers to tell the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> that he ſhou'd return to them with two hundred Sail in a very ſhort time, he appear'd before <hi>Attica,</hi> with ſuch aſſurance, as if he thought of nothing leſs than the immediate ſurrender of the City. But when he found the <hi>Athenians</hi> made a
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:35403:92"/>
vigorous defence beyond his expectation, he retreated into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and made the ſame alteration in other Cities as he had done in thoſe we mentioned before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> putting ſome to death who did not ſubmit to his Tyranny, and forcing others to quit their Country. He utterly routed the <hi>Samians,</hi> and gave Fugitives the poſſeſſion of their Cities. He us'd the ſame Barbarity to the Inhabitants of <hi>Seſtos,</hi> which was then in the hands of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and divided it among his Sea-men. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> themſelves were diſpleas'd at theſe inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane proceedings, though againſt their Enemies, and re-eſtabliſh'd the <hi>Seſtians.</hi> The <hi>Greecians</hi> were well ſatisfi'd with <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander's</hi> Conduct, for by his means the <hi>Aeginites</hi> were reſtor'd to their own Cities, of which the <hi>Athenians</hi> had injuſtly poſſeſs'd themſelves. By this time <hi>Lyſander</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that there was a Famine in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> upon which he ſail'd to the <hi>Piraeum,</hi> and had no ſooner began his ſiege, but the City ſurrendred, ſubmitting to whatever Terms he demanded.</p>
               <p>'Tis reported among the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> that <hi>Lyſander</hi> wrote to the Magiſtrates thus, <hi>Athens is taken:</hi> To which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd this Anſwer in the ſame way; <hi>You ſay 'tis taken, we are ſatisfi'd.</hi> But this was recorded rather as <hi>Laconick</hi> than true,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:35403:92"/>
for they commanded him to obſerve theſe orders. They run thus: <hi>Know this is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the</hi> Lacedaemonians; <hi>Pull down the</hi> Piraeum, <hi>and the long Wall; Divide their Lands among the neighbouring Cities; Allow 'em what's neceſſary, and ſet the Captives at liberty. When you have perform'd this, enjoy that peace which you have ſo well deſerv'd: As for the number of Ships, uſe your own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in that matter.</hi> When theſe orders came to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> they took <hi>Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> his advice thereupon, whom <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> one of the young Councellors ask'd, why he acted contrary to the intention of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and gave thoſe Walls into the hands of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> which he built in defiance of 'em. <hi>Youth,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have my eye upon</hi> Themiſtocles <hi>his deſign. He rais'd theſe Walls for the preſervation of the City, and I for the very ſame reaſon wou'd have 'em deſtroy'd; and if Walls only ſecure a City,</hi> Sparta <hi>which has none is in a very ill condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſander</hi> as ſoon as the Ships and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of the <hi>Athenians</hi> were deliver'd into his hands, attempted the ſame altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among them, as he had made in the other parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> but finding 'em more ſtubborn than he expected, he complain'd to the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> that their orders were not obſerv'd by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:35403:93"/>
the Walls were yet ſtanding, after the time fix'd for their pulling down was expir'd, and now ſince they had broke their firſt Articles, he declar'd he wou'd not enter into new conditions with 'em. Some ſay he mov'd in Council that they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Slavery, when at the ſame time <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthus</hi> the <hi>Theban</hi> propos'd wholly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the City, and leave the Country de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate; but a little afterwards at an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the Captains, one of 'em repeated ſome verſes out of <hi>Eurypides's Electra:</hi> They begun thus,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Electra,</hi> O unhappy Queen,</l>
                  <l>Whither wou'd you fly! return;</l>
                  <l>Your abſence the forſaken Groves</l>
                  <l>And deſert Palace ſeem to mourn.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>This ſtruck 'em, and, gave 'em occaſion to reflect, how barbarous 'twou'd appear to lay that City in ruine, which had been renown'd for the birth and education of ſo many famous men. However <hi>Lyſander,</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> entirely ſubmitting to him, call'd a great conſort of <hi>Muſick,</hi> both out of the City and Camp, and whilſt he pull'd down the Walls and burn'd the Ships, his aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates dancing and Crown'd with Garlands, expreſs'd as much joy, as if the end of other men's happineſs, had been the beginning
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:35403:93"/>
of their own. After this, according to his uſual way of dealing with Conquer'd Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he alter'd their Government, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thirty Rulers over the City, and ten over the <hi>Piraeum,</hi> plac'd a ſtrong Garriſon in the Tower, and made <hi>Callibius</hi> a <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> the Governour, who upon ſome ſlight occaſion offer'd to ſtrike <hi>Autolycus</hi> (a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous wreſtler, the ſame whom <hi>Xenophon</hi> mentions in his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) but the young Gentleman avoided the blow, and gave <hi>Callibius</hi> a fall. <hi>Lyſander,</hi> though this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon one of his Officers, ſeem'd not to be much diſturb'd at it, he only mildly reprimanded <hi>Autolycus,</hi> and told him <hi>Callibius</hi> was unacquainted with the <hi>Athenian Polity,</hi> and did not know the diſtinction of his quality: But ſoon after the Governours to ingratiate themſelves with <hi>Callibius,</hi> kill'd <hi>Autolycus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſander</hi> when he had ſettled his Affairs, ſail'd to <hi>Thrace.</hi> All the money and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents which he had receiv'd (and in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability a man in his ſtation muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd many) he ſent to <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> by <hi>Gulippus,</hi> whom he had made Captain over the Troops in <hi>Sicily.</hi> This <hi>Gulippus</hi> ripp'd up every bag, and when he had taken out of each as much as he thought fit, ſow'd 'em up again; but this was not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd ſo cunningly as he imagin'd, for in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:35403:94"/>
every bag it ſeems there was a bill that gave a particular account of its ſumm, ſo that when he came to <hi>Sparta,</hi> having firſt ſecur'd, as he thought, under the tiles of his Houſe what he had taken for his own uſe, he deliver'd up his charge to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and with a good aſſurance ſhow'd 'em the Seals as a mark of his fidelity. But when they examin'd the money and found it fall ſhort of the Accounts expreſs'd in the Bills, not ſuſpecting any cheat in the Meſſenger they were ſomething ſurpriz'd at the difference, till <hi>Gulippus</hi> his Servant betray'd the Secret, and told 'em by way of Riddle, That he had obſerv'd a great many <hi>Owls</hi> lodg'd under his Maſters tiles: Now the <hi>Athenian</hi> money being generally ſtamp'd with the image of an <hi>Owl,</hi> this Myſtery was quicly underſtood, and <hi>Gulippus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtain'd his former reputation with this mean action, was aſham'd to appear any more at <hi>Lacedaemon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the wiſeſt among the <hi>Spartans,</hi> probably upon this occaſion, being ſenſible what an ill influence money had over moſt mens manners, and how eaſily the beſt were corrupted by it, were very warm in their reflections upon <hi>Lyſander,</hi> and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly preſs'd the Magiſtrates to ſend away all their treaſure of Gold and Silver. This debate was referr'd to a Council, where
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:35403:94"/>
as <hi>Theopompus</hi> ſays <hi>Scirophidas,</hi> as <hi>Ephorus</hi> will have it, <hi>Phlogidas,</hi> openly declar'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt receiving Gold or Silver into the City, and mov'd that no money might be us'd amongſt 'em, but their own, which was Iron dip'd in Vinegar whilſt it was Red-hot, to make it hard and unpliable, that it might not eaſily be cover'd with Counterfeit Braſs, this Coin of theirs made in the faſhion of a Pyramid, was heavy, and that which was much in weight, was but little in value, ſo that 'twas very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to carry any conſiderable Summ. This party that Voted againſt keeping the money was over-power'd by <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Friends, and at laſt 'twas decreed that it ſhou'd be employ'd upon Publick Occaſions, and that it ſhou'd be a Capital Crime to convert any of it to Private uſes; But this did not at all anſwer <hi>Lycurgus</hi> his deſign, who by a ſcarcity of money intended to prevent Covetouſneſs which is generally the ill Conſequence of Riches; now this was not ſo much prevented by forbidding the uſe of money in Private, as 'twas en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by allowing it in Publick, and it cou'd not be imagin'd that People who manag'd wealth to ſo General an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Republick, ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d think it of no concern to themſelves; nay 'tis much more reaſonable to conclude that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:35403:95"/>
Cuſtom of a Nation ſhou'd influence particular men, than that the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhou'd be corrupted by the Actions of ſome few, who upon any miſdemeanor may be call'd to account, and reduc'd to a better ſenſe of their duty, by ſound Laws and ſtrict Diſcipline. So that the order of State which we juſt now mentioned, was of no benefit to the Commonwealth, for though the fear of puniſhment was a pretty ſecure Guard upon men, not to hazard their Lives in Treaſuring up money, yet the prohibition only heighten'd their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and if their Actions did not break out, at laſt their affections were tainted. But I ſhall ſay no more of this matter here, becauſe I have reflected upon it in another place.</p>

                  <hi>Lyſander,</hi> as we obſerv'd before, being much enrich'd with plunder and preſents, rais'd his own and ſeveral of the chief Commanders ſtatues in Braſs at <hi>Delphos,</hi> and repreſented in Gold the Conſtellations of <hi>Caſtor,</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> which had ſhone ſo favourably upon him at the Battel of <hi>Leuctra.</hi> The great Ship that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſent him when he congratualted him upon his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he plac'd in the Treaſury of <hi>Braſidas,</hi> and the <hi>Acanthians,</hi> and <hi>Alexandrides</hi> in his Hiſtory names a very conſiderable Summ left there by <hi>Lyſander.</hi> But this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:35403:95"/>
is not agreeable to the latter circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Life.</p>
               <p>It muſt be own'd that never any <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> General had ſo abſolute an Authority as <hi>Lyſander,</hi> yet his Pride and Haughtineſs of Spirit ſtill carried him beyond it, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Douris</hi> ſays the <hi>Grecians</hi> rais'd Altars to his Honour and ſacrificed to him as a God. He was the firſt that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented with Songs of Triumph; one of which begun thus,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>To the brave Leader of our Bands,</l>
                  <l>Begin the Song, which Gods inſpire;</l>
                  <l>With Tuneful Voice, and Artful Hands:</l>
                  <l>Io Paean! touch the Lyre!</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And the <hi>Samians</hi> decreed that the Feaſts which were Celebrated in the Honour of <hi>Juno,</hi> ſhou'd now be transferr'd to <hi>Lyſander. Chaerilus</hi> a Poet was always one of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and ready upon all occaſions to Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate his Actions. <hi>Antilochus</hi> preſenting him with a Panegyrick which he was much pleas'd with, was very ſplendidly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. There was a great emulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Antimachus</hi> of <hi>Colophon</hi> and <hi>Nicera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> who ſhou'd write the beſt Poem in <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Praiſe. The Lawrel was given to <hi>Niceratus,</hi> which <hi>Antimachus</hi> taking ill, ſuppreſs'd his Verſes. <hi>Plato</hi> who
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:35403:96"/>
was then a young Man, and an admirer of <hi>Antimachus</hi> his Poetry, deſir'd him to bear this little misfortune with more Courage, telling him that ignorance affects only thoſe that are ignorant, as Blindneſs hurts thoſe alone that are Blind, and that this affront was not ſo much his own unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as theirs who were not able to judge of his excellencies. <hi>Ariſtonous</hi> the Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian who had ſix times won the prize of the <hi>Pythian</hi> games, openly declar'd, that if ever he had the fortune to be conquerour once more, he'd employ all his art in <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi>'s praiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Haughtineſs and Ambition was alike uneaſie to his Superiours and his equals; he had ſo many Creatures follow'd him, that he look'd upon every Body with careleſs diſdain, and was ſo regardleſs of other peoples Opinions, that he made his own humour the meaſure of all his Actions; to his Friends and thoſe ſtrangers that humbly attended him, and ſided with his party, he was too liberally grateful, and rewarded their ſervices with unlimited Commiſſions to govern Cities as abſolutely as they pleas'd: But an Enemy ſeldom eſcap'd his revenge, and that was never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd but with the death of the Offender. To compaſs this he ſtuck at nothing that was baſe or treacherous, as 'tis plain from
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:35403:96"/>
his dealing with the <hi>Mileſians.</hi> They had appear'd too forward in maintaining the right of the people, and when they found their deſigns diſcover'd, he was afraid they might ſecure themſelves by flight, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this he ſolemnly ſwore not a man of them ſhould ſuffer; Upon this they were all ſo credulous as to relie upon his word, nay many who upon apprehenſion of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment had before abſconded, appear'd abroad again, ſo when he had got 'em all in his power, he order'd 800 of 'em to be ſlain at one execution. In every City he exercis'd cruelties of this nature, and no man cou'd be ſafe who was ſuſpected of any inclinations to popular Government. He did not only ſacrifice men to his own private caprices, but with the ſame barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity gratifi'd either the malice or Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Friends. From whence <hi>Eteocles</hi> his ſaying became famous; that <hi>Greece</hi> cou'd never bear two <hi>Lyſanders. Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> ſays that <hi>Archiſtratus</hi> appli'd the ſame thing to <hi>Alcibiades.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> after he had been plundred and very ill us'd by him, ſent informers againſt him to <hi>Sparta.</hi> The Magiſtrates took this complaint into Conſideration, and put ſome of his Friends to death, amongſt which was his Fellow-Captain <hi>Thorax,</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the late Law was found with Silver in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:35403:97"/>
his poſſeſſion; neither did they ſtop here in puniſhing his accomplices, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him home by their <hi>Scytale.</hi> The nature and uſe of which was this. When the Magiſtrates gave their Commiſſion to any Admiral or General, they took two round pieces of Wood both eactly equal in breadth and thickneſs, one they kept themſelves, the other was deliver'd to their Officer, ſo when they had any thing of moment which they wou'd ſecretly convey to him; they cut a long narrow ſcrowl of Parchment, and rowling it about their own ſtaff one fold cloſe upon another, they wrote their buſineſs on it, when they had wrote what they had to ſay, they took off the Parchment and ſent it to the General, he appli'd it to his own ſtaff, which being juſt like that of the Magiſtrates, the folds fell in with one another, exactly as they did at the writing, and the Characters, which, before 'twas wrapt up, were confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly diſjoin'd, and altogether unintelligible, appear'd now very plainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſander</hi> was ſtartled at the <hi>Scytale,</hi> and being conſcious how ill he had us'd <hi>Pharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazus,</hi> thought this meſſage was chiefly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Account, ſo he took all the care imaginable to have a ſpeedy conference with him, and hop'd by a little diſcourſe to compoſe all differences between 'em. When
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:35403:97"/>
they met, he deſir'd him to give another information to the Senate, and to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict what his Meſſengers had told 'em be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> ſeem'd to comply with theſe propoſals, but, as 'tis in the Proverb, Put the cheat upon the deceiver; for he wrote a Letter in <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Preſence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his directions, but had contriv'd to have another by him, which was to a quite contrary effect; ſo when they came to Seal the Letter, he put that upon him which he had writ under-hand; <hi>Lyſander</hi> return'd boldly to <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> and attending the Magiſtrates, as 'tis their Cuſtom, at the Palace, he deliver'd <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> his Letter to 'em, which he was pretty confidently aſſur'd, wou'd take off his greateſt Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for he knew <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> was much valu'd by the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> as being an expert Soldier and a favourite of <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes.</hi> The Magiſtrates read the Letter, and ſhow'd it <hi>Lyſander,</hi> he was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to meet with what he had not in the leaſt ſuſpected, and in great confuſion left the Palace.</p>
               <p>Some days after when he was amongſt the Governors, he told 'em he was oblig'd to go to <hi>Ammon's</hi> Temple, and pay that Sacrifice which he had Vow'd to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Battel, and 'tis indeed reported that <hi>Ammon</hi> appear'd to him in a Dream,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:35403:98"/>
when he beſieg'd the <hi>Aphygaeans,</hi> upon which as the God had directed he rais'd the Siege, and bid the <hi>Aphygaeans</hi> Sacrifice to <hi>Ammon:</hi> But 'tis generally believ'd that this was only a pretence, and that the true occaſion of his retiring was a ſuſpicion that the Magiſtrates wou'd call him to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for having Rul'd ſo long without controul; his haughty Spirit cou'd not brook Submiſſion to any Body, like an Horſe that after he had been free a great while and rang'd in open Paſture, is very unwilling to be confin'd again to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſubmit to the manage of his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>Ephorus</hi> gives another Account of his retiring, which I ſhall mention by and by. Whatever the occaſion was, he found it very difficult to get the Magiſtrates leave, and when with much ado they had given their conſent to his Voyage, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that moſt of their Cities were in the poſſeſſion of his Friends, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently muſt needs have a great ſway among 'em, and be likely to be receiv'd by 'em with all the reſpect due to their great Commander and Patron, they took particular care to diſpoſſeſs 'em and put the Government into other hands.</p>
               <p>This Revolution rais'd every where new diſturbances, and firſt of all the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> attempted to ſeize upon their thirty
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:35403:98"/>
Governors, but <hi>Lyſander</hi> happen'd to come very opportunely to their relief, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> to join with the Rulers againſt the People, they did not only grant him this, but preſented the Governors too with an hundred Talents, and choſe him their Captain: Some of the Chief of the the <hi>Athenians</hi> were jealous of <hi>Lyſander,</hi> and fearing leaſt he ſhou'd take the City a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, reſolv'd one of 'em ſhou'd be deputed to diſcourſe with him. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> was the man. When he came to <hi>Lyſander,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he had been a great Friend to the Tyrants againſt the People, but his deſign was to break off the War, leaſt <hi>Lyſander</hi> ſhou'd again make himſelf Maſter of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi> This deſign he compaſs'd very eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for he reconcil'd the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and compos'd the Tumults, and ſo put a ſtop to <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Ambition. However the <hi>Athenians</hi> made another inſurrection, but <hi>Pauſanias</hi> made a plauſible excuſe for it, and ſaid that 'twas no ſtrange thing to ſee People that were juſt free from their uſual diſcipline, and left more to their own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, break out into inſolent Affronts; withal he gave <hi>Lyſander</hi> the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a generous man, who never em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd his Arms either for the gratification of Friends or his own fame, but purely for the Glory of <hi>Sparta.</hi> Thus he preſerv'd
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:35403:99"/>
the City a ſecond time from <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Courage and Spirit appear'd in his expreſſions, no leſs than it did in his Actions. Once when the <hi>Argives</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended about their bounds, and thought they cou'd make a better Plea than the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> he held out his Sword, and ſaid, <hi>He that's Maſter of this will beſt make out his Title.</hi> A <hi>Megarean</hi> uſing more freedom than ordinary with him, met with this reprimand, <hi>By your diſcourſe, Sir, a man may gueſs you are a ſtranger at Court.</hi> When the <hi>Boeotians</hi> ſtood wavering whether they ſhou'd engage on his ſide, or his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he told 'em they muſt fix their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, he wou'd be with 'em ſpeedily, and bad 'em conſider whether they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be viſited in a Friendly or hoſtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. After the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had revolted, and the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> ſeem'd backward in their Aſſault, an Hare by chance leaping over the Ditch, <hi>Are ye not aſham'd, ſaid he, to fear thoſe Enemies, whoſe lazineſs is ſuch that the Hares ſleep under their very Walls?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After <hi>Agis</hi> his death, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>Leotychides</hi> his ſuppos'd Son, were the only pretenders to the Crown, <hi>Lyſander</hi> who was <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> his particular Friend, perſwaded him to claim his Right
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:35403:99"/>
to the Kingdom, as being legitimately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Hercules,</hi> for 'twas very much ſuſpected that <hi>Leotychides</hi> was <hi>Alcibiades</hi> his Son, who had been obſerv'd to be fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with <hi>Agis</hi> his Wife <hi>Timaia,</hi> all the time he was a fugitive in <hi>Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Agis</hi> computing the time, concluded that he himſelf cou'd not be the Father, ſo openly diſown'd him and neglected him as a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard; yet afterwards when he fell ſick and was carri'd to <hi>Herea,</hi> by the importunity of the Youth himſelf, and his Friends, juſt before he died he declar'd before many witneſſes that <hi>Leotychides</hi> was his lawful Son, and deſired them to teſtify theſe his laſt words to the <hi>Lacedaemonians;</hi> which accordingly they did. Every body reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> as a very deſerving man, and his acquaintance with <hi>Lyſander</hi> was a farther recommendation of him, but he was abus'd by <hi>Diopithes</hi> a great dealer in Prophecies, who apply'd this Speech of the Oracle to <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> his lameneſs.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Proud as thou art, <hi>Sparta,</hi> beware</l>
                  <l>How thou obeyeſt a limping Heir!</l>
                  <l>War and diſcord without end,</l>
                  <l>Shall on that luckleſs Hour attend;</l>
                  <l>Every Labor, every Fate,</l>
                  <l>That can waſte, or ſink a ſtate.</l>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:35403:100"/>
               </lg>
               <p>Many believ'd the interpretation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to favour <hi>Leotychides</hi> his party. But <hi>Lyſander</hi> ſaid that <hi>Diopithes</hi> had miſtook the ſence of the Oracle, that 'twas not meant the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> would be unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py under a lame King, but that they'd be a lame people if they ſuffer'd the poſterity of <hi>Hercules</hi> to be govern'd by illegitimate princes. Having thus put a plauſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon the words of the Oracle, and being otherwiſe one that had got a great intereſt among the People he prevail'd with 'em to make choice of <hi>Ageſilaus;</hi> As ſoon as he was ſetled in his Kingdom, <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> preſs'd him very earneſtly to make War upon <hi>Aſia,</hi> putting him in hopes of raiſing to himſelf a great reputation by the Conqueſt of <hi>Perſia;</hi> to further this deſign he writ to his Friends in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and deſir'd 'em they wou'd Petition <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> to accept the Command of their Forces againſt the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> They comply'd with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and ſent Ambaſſadours to <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> thought himſelf no leſs oblig'd to <hi>Lyſander</hi> for this favour, than he had been before for his Kingdom. But ambitious Spirits however otherwiſe qualifi'd for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are hindred in their way to Glory by that Envy which they generally bear to their equals, and ſo make them the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:35403:100"/>
chief oppoſers whom they might make the greateſt promoters of their Heroick Actions. Thus <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> at firſt choſe <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> for his particular Favourite, made him one of his Cabinet Council, and conſulted him upon all Affairs of moment, but when they came into <hi>Aſia,</hi> having little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance there, the People ſeldom addreſt themſelves to him but made their greateſt Court to <hi>Lyſander,</hi> ſome upon the account of a former familiarity and Friendſhip, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of a ſervile Compliance. Thus as it often happens in Plays, a chief Actor repreſents one of a mean Character, yet is much taken notice of, while he that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonates the King has but a ſmall part, and is little regarded by the Spectators; ſo here the Councellour had all that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally valuable in Government, and left the King only the empty name of Power. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed both of 'em ought to have moderated their Ambition, <hi>Lyſander</hi> was too forward in accepting thoſe honours which ought firſt to have been paid <hi>Ageſilaus:</hi> On the other ſide <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> did ill, ſo unhandſomely to diſcard a Friend that he had been ſo much oblig'd to. For firſt of all he never gave him any opportunity of appearing with reputation, never put him in any poſt of Command; beſides whoever he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd for, was ſure to miſcarry, and to be
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:35403:101"/>
thought <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Friend was fault enough to deſerve the King's diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſander</hi> was ſo unſucceſsful in every thing he undertook, and found ſo often that what he deſign'd as a kindneſs was prejudicial to his Friends, that he deſir'd 'em to forbear their addreſſes, and take no publick notice of him, that they ſhou'd either ſpeak to the King himſelf, or to thoſe Favourites who had more intereſt than he at preſent to preferr 'em. Upon this many gave him no farther trouble with their concerns, but ſtill continu'd their reſpects to him, and waited upon him in all places of publick entertainment. This griev'd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſilaus</hi> yet more, when he ſaw all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to call off the Peoples Affections from <hi>Lyſander</hi> were in vain: So to ſhow his reſentment, when he made new Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in his Army, and Governours of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he affronted <hi>Lyſander</hi> ſo far as to make him overſeer of his Houſe-proviſions, and then by way of deriſion bid the <hi>Ioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> go and pay their complements to his <hi>Caterer. Lyſander</hi> cou'd brook this uſage no longer, and reſolv'd freely to tell the King his mind. Their diſcourſe was very ſhort and <hi>Laconick. Ageſilaus,</hi> ſays <hi>Lyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, you know very well how to deſpiſe your Friends; Yes,</hi> ſays he, <hi>when they affect to be greater than my ſelf, and 'tis juſt they ſhou'd</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:35403:101"/>
                  <hi>have the greateſt ſhare in my power who moſt endeavour to promote it.</hi> Lyſander reply'd very modeſtly, <hi>Sir, this is rather what you pleaſe to ſay, than what I ever did. I beg of you, ſince our Enemies have an eye upon our carriage to one another in hopes to make advantage of it, let me ſerve you in ſome Office where I may be leaſt ſuſpected, and moſt uſeful to you.</hi> This favour was granted him, and he was ſent Ambaſſador to the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and though he did bear ſome ſecret grudge to the King, yet that did not hinder him from a very faithful diſcharge of his duty. He perſwaded <hi>Mithridates</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> who had fallen out with <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> to revolt with all the Army under his Command, and brought him over to <hi>Ageſilaus:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was not employ'd upon any other ſervice, but return'd in diſgrace to <hi>Sparta,</hi> not only highly incens'd againſt <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> in particular, but diſpleas'd more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with the whole frame of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Things had been a great while ripe for change, and People were ready to break in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rebellion; he reſolv'd therefore not to miſs the opportunity but ſet it on foot aſſoon as poſſible. His ſtratagem was this. Some of the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> who came into <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> and mix'd with the <hi>Dorians,</hi> were now grown very numerous and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:35403:102"/>
powerful in <hi>Sparta.</hi> But two Families only cou'd claim any right to ſucceſſion in the Kingdom; thoſe were the <hi>Eurytiontidae</hi> and the <hi>Agiadae,</hi> others had no privilege in the Commonwealth by the Nobleneſs of their Birth, but thoſe who cou'd plead moſt merit had the beſt Titles to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rewards of Vertue. <hi>Lyſander</hi> was one of theſe, and when he had gain'd a great Reputation by his Actions, many Friends, and much Power, he was uneaſy to ſee that City which ow'd its encreaſe chiefly to him, rul'd by others no better deſcended than himſelf. So he contriv'd to alter the ſettlement which confin'd the Government to two Families, and gave all the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> an equal right to it; nay ſome ſay not the <hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae</hi> only, but all the <hi>Spartans,</hi> and make it a reward not ſo much of <hi>Hercules</hi> his poſterity, as of thoſe who bravely imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated that valour which gave him a place among the Gods. He had great hopes that when the Kingdom was thus to be diſpos'd of, no <hi>Spartan</hi> cou'd appear with thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that he cou'd. Upon which proſpect firſt he endeavour'd to inſinuate the reaſonableneſs of this change into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate People, and afterwards to the ſame purpoſe ſpoke an Oration which <hi>Cleon</hi> of <hi>Halicarnaſſus</hi> had made for him. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:35403:102"/>
that this new project was very extraordinary, and not to be brought about by common means, as in Tragedies, when any thing of great importance is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, the aſſiſtance of ſome God is made uſe of, ſo he to promote his deſigns with more colour of Authority counterfeited an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers from <hi>Delphos,</hi> preſuming he ſhou'd terrifie thoſe by <hi>Apollo's Oracles</hi> whom he cou'd not perſwade by <hi>Cleon's Eloquence. Ephorus</hi> ſays that after he had in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to pervert the <hi>Pythian</hi> Oracle, and as unſucceſsfully ſent <hi>Pericles</hi> to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt <hi>Dodona,</hi> he went himſelf to <hi>Ammon,</hi> and profer'd the Prieſts prodigious Summs of Gold, who with great indignation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected his Bribes and ſent people to accuſe him at <hi>Sparta.</hi> Where he met with ſuch favourable Judges that he was eaſily clear'd from their impeachments, upon which the <hi>Libyans</hi> took their leave of the <hi>Spartans</hi> in this manner, <hi>When you come to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us in</hi> Africa <hi>you'll find us more imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Judges.</hi> Now there was an ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy which foretold that the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> ſhou'd ſome time or other inhabit <hi>Africa. Lyſander</hi>'s deſigns in this matter were very ſubtile and intricate, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd by very great Politicians, ſo in order to clear the whole intrigue we muſt trace it as we do a Mathematical demonſtration,

up to its firſt principles; I ſhall therefore at large explain it as 'tis related by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Hiſtorian and Philoſopher.</p>
               <p>There was a Woman in <hi>Pontus</hi> who was ſaid to conceive by <hi>Apollo,</hi> many with a great deal of reaſon ſuſpected it, others were ſo credulous as to believe it. After ſhe was deliver'd of a Boy many People took peculiar care of its education, and for ſome reaſon or other gave it the Name of <hi>Silenus. Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> taking hold of this, made it the Ground of his whole ſtratagem, and choſe ſuch confidents to aſſiſt him in it, whoſe Character might bring the ſtory into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation without the leaſt ſuſpicion of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery. To make the beſt advantage of this they ſpread abroad another ſtory, that there were very ancient Oracles cloſely conceal'd in the cuſtody of the Prieſts, and 'twas upon record that they were not to be profan'd by vulgar hands, neither was it lawful for any man to read 'em, till in ſome future Age one ſhou'd ariſe who ſhou'd manifeſtly prove himſelf the Son of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and challenge to himſelf the Interpretation of theſe Myſteries. When the credit of this report was well eſtabliſhed among the People, <hi>Silenus</hi> was to come and demand the prerogative of his Birth. The Prieſts who were Confederates in this Plot, were ſtrictly to examine into every circumſtance
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:35403:103"/>
and particular of his Nativity, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being fully convinc'd that he was the true Son of <hi>Apollo,</hi> were to deliver up their charge to him: who when he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly open'd the <hi>Oracles</hi> before the People, was to declare ſeveral things concerning the Government, among which he was to tell 'em 'twou'd be more for their honour and intereſt to break the preſent ſucceſſion, and chooſe their Kings out of the moſt deſerving men in the Commonwealth. But when <hi>Silenus</hi> was grown up and every thing ready for Action, the whole buſineſs miſcarri'd by the Cowardice of one that was an agent in it, whoſe heart failed him juſt at the time of Execution. However nothing of this was diſcover'd while <hi>Lyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> liv'd, for he died, before <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from <hi>Aſia,</hi> in the <hi>Baeotian,</hi> or as ſome ſay the <hi>Grecian,</hi> War. For 'tis repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both ways. Some ſay he himſelf was the occaſion of his death, others blame the <hi>Thebans</hi> for it, others accuſe both. To the <hi>Thebans</hi> 'tis objected that they us'd the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice ſo irreverently, as to ſcatter it in pieces on the Ground; that ſuffering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be corrupted by the King about <hi>Androclides</hi> and <hi>Amphitheus,</hi> they engag'd the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> in the <hi>Grecian</hi> War, that they ſet upon the <hi>Phocians</hi> and laid waſte their Country. They ſay too <hi>Lyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:35403:104"/>
took it ill, that they alone, when the reſt of the Confederates were content, pretended to the privilege of aſſuming to themſelves the tenth part of the ſpoils; and that they complain'd of his ſending money to <hi>Sparta.</hi> But he was moſt of all diſpleas'd, becauſe they made way for the <hi>Athenians</hi> to free themſelves from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of that Government which he had eſtabliſh'd among 'em. To terrifie the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> from this revolt, the <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> decreed that thoſe who fled out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> ſhou'd be apprehended where-ever they ſhou'd be found, and that thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to reſcue 'em ſhou'd be treated as Enemies to the Government. The <hi>Thebans</hi> gave out a counter order which was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and becoming the poſterity of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> that every Houſe and City in <hi>Baeotia</hi> ſhou'd be open and free for any <hi>Athenian</hi> that deſir'd protection, and that whoever did not aſſiſt a fugitive that was in danger of being ſeiz'd, ſhou'd be fin'd a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, beſides if any one ſhou'd march Arm'd through <hi>Baeotia</hi> to the Relief of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> he ſhou'd find a ſafe paſſage without being taken notice of. Neither did they ſtop here, for as their decree was hoſpitable and friendly, ſo their Actions were agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it. For <hi>Thraſibulus</hi> with ſeveral other fugitives was ſo far aided by them ſecretly,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:35403:104"/>
with Money, and Arms, that he made an aſſault upon the <hi>Phile,</hi> and poſſeſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of it. <hi>Lyſander</hi> cou'd not but reſent theſe affronts, which the <hi>Thebans</hi> had ſo openly offer'd both to him and the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians.</hi> His Anger grew very fierce, and was encreas'd by a <hi>Splenetick</hi> humour which he was troubled with in his old Age. This urg'd him to importune the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to employ him once more in their Service, ſo he march'd out with the Army under his Command, and <hi>Pauſanias</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him with another. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> went round by <hi>Cythaeron</hi> with a deſign to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Baeotia; Lyſander</hi> paſs'd through <hi>Phocis</hi> in order to meet him. As he march'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long he took by ſurrender the City of the <hi>Orchomenians,</hi> and laid waſte <hi>Lebadia.</hi> From whence he ſent Letters to <hi>Pauſanias</hi> that he ſhou'd remove from <hi>Platea,</hi> and make haſte to join Forces with him at <hi>Haliartus,</hi> where he himſelf wou'd certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meet him by break of day. Theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fell into the hands of the Enemies Spies, and were brought to the <hi>Thebans.</hi> Upon the opening of 'em they entruſted their City with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and they ſallying out at the firſt Watch arriv'd at <hi>Haliartus,</hi> and put part of their Forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City a little before <hi>Lyſander</hi> came. <hi>Lyſander</hi> had at firſt reſolv'd to pitch his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:35403:105"/>
Tents upon the ſide of an Hill, and wait for <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> but day drawing on he grew impatient, and led his Soldiers out in a direct line along the Road to the Walls of the City.</p>
               <p>There is a Fountain call'd <hi>Ciſſeuſa</hi> in which they ſay <hi>Bacchus</hi> was waſh'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his birth, for the Water is like Wine, of a bright Colour, and a pleaſant taſte, not far off grows the <hi>Cretian Storax,</hi> by which the <hi>Haliartians</hi> gueſs <hi>Radaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> dwelt there, and the rather becauſe his Sepulchre too, which they call <hi>Alea,</hi> is ſeen in this place. The monument of <hi>Alcmena</hi> is hard by, where they pretend ſhe was buri'd, when after <hi>Amphitryo's</hi> death ſhe marri'd <hi>Radamanthus.</hi> 'Twas here about on the left ſide of <hi>Haliartus,</hi> that thoſe <hi>Thebans</hi> who had not entred the City were plac'd, from whence with great fierceneſs they fell upon the Enemies Rear. In the mean time thoſe within the City putting themſelves into one body with the <hi>Haliartians</hi> kept their order in quiet. But aſſoon as <hi>Lyſander</hi> appear'd with his Van-Guard before the Gates, they ruſh'd out, killed him and one of his Prieſts, with ſome few more, for the greater part made their eſcape to the main Army, but the <hi>Thebans</hi> purſu'd 'em ſo cloſely that they all ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd and fled to the Hills. A Thouſand of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:35403:105"/>
them were kill'd in this purſuit, and 300 of the <hi>Thebans</hi> fell by chaſing 'em too raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into craggy and dangerous places. Theſe 300 had been ſuſpected of correſpondence with the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> which made 'em ſo raſh and deſperate that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to wipe off this diſgrace though with the loſs of their Lives. The news of this defeat came to <hi>Pauſanias</hi> as he was going from <hi>Platea</hi> to <hi>Theſpias.</hi> He preſently put his Army in order and made towards <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liartus,</hi> where about the ſame time <hi>Thraſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> was arriv'd with a party of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> under his Command. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> wou'd have articled with 'em upon terms for the dead, but the <hi>Spartan</hi> Magiſtrates wou'd not conſent to it, and were angry with him for offering ſuch mean propoſals. They declar'd <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s body ſhou'd not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd by conditions, but if they fought it out, and Conquer'd they might carry it off honourably, if they happen'd to be overcome themſelves 'twou'd however be more glorious to die upon the ſpot with their Commander. The Magiſtrates carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it thus high with the uſual haughtineſs of <hi>Spartans, Pauſanias,</hi> who was more calm, ſaw 'twas too difficult a matter to think of routing the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who were juſt now fluſh'd with Victory; beſides if this cou'd have been done, the body lay ſo near the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:35403:106"/>
Walls, that it cou'd not eaſily be bore off without a truce, ſo he immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd an <hi>Herauld,</hi> obtain'd a Treaty; drew back his Forces, carri'd away <hi>Lyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and buri'd him in the Country of his Friends, the <hi>Panopeans.</hi> His Monument is ſtill to be ſeen in the Road from <hi>Delphos</hi> to <hi>Chaeronea,</hi> where the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> for ſome time took up their quarters, and while they ſtaid there, one of <hi>Phocis</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an account of the Battel to one of his Companions, ſaid, The Enemy fell upon 'em, after <hi>Lyſander</hi> had paſs'd <hi>Ophlites.</hi> A <hi>Spartan, Lyſander</hi>'s Friend that ſtood by, having not heard of that name, ask'd what <hi>Ophlites</hi> he meant, and yet ſays the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> that's the place where we loſt our braveſt men, 'tis the River that runs by the City. The <hi>Spartan</hi> immediately wept and broke out into this expreſſion, O how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable are the decrees of Fate! For it ſeems the Oracle had pronounced this to <hi>Lyſander.</hi>

               <p>Some indeed ſay <hi>Ophlites</hi> doth not run to <hi>Haliartus,</hi> but is a River near <hi>Coronea,</hi> which mix'd with the River <hi>Phliarus</hi> paſſes along to that City. 'Twas formerly call'd

               <p>'Tis reported there was an Oracle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Thebans</hi> in the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, which foretold the Battel at <hi>Delium,</hi> and this at <hi>Haliartus,</hi> though this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thirty years after.

               <p>The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> look'd upon <hi>Pauſani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> his proceedings as ſo diſhonourable to a <hi>Spartan</hi> General, that they wou'd have tri'd him for his Life, but he durſt not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to appear, ſo fled into <hi>Tegaea,</hi> where he devoted himſelf to a private Life in the Temple of <hi>Minerva.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s poverty which was diſcover'd at his death, made his virtue more admir'd, when it appear'd that from ſo much plenty
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:35403:107"/>
and power, ſuch rich preſents from ſo many Cities, which were under his Government, he had not at all encreas'd the wealth of his own private Family. This is obſerv'd by <hi>Theopompus,</hi> whom we may ſooner believe when he commends, than when he finds fault, for men are more apt to diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend than praiſe. <hi>Ephorus</hi> ſays that upon ſome diſpute between the Confederates with <hi>Sparta,</hi> when <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s writings were to be examin'd, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was order'd to make the ſearch, who finding a diſcourſe of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi>'s concerning the Government, where he endeavour'd to ſhow how advantageous 'twou'd be to the Commonwealth, if the right of ſucceſſion, which the Family of the <hi>Eureutiontidae</hi> and <hi>Agiadae</hi> pretended to, was broke, and the Kingdom made elective. This diſcourſe <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> deſign'd to publiſh, and diſcover by that means what ſort of a Friend <hi>Lyſander</hi> was to 'em in private. But <hi>Lacratidas</hi> a wiſe man, and at that time Preſident of the Council, wou'd not ſuffer him ſo baſely to abuſe a great General's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and told him that theſe papers which were ſo plauſibly and ingeniouſly writ, deſerv'd to reſt honourably with their Author, and that 'twas inhumane to dig <hi>Lyſander</hi> out of his Grave. The <hi>Spartans</hi> beſtow'd many honours on him after his death, amongſt which this was none of the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:35403:107"/>
leaſt; There were ſome who had engag'd themſelves to <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Daughters while every thing about him appear'd Rich and Splendid, but when they ſaw how poor and honeſt he died, they broke off their contract. Theſe in reſpect to <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s memory the <hi>Spartans</hi> ſeverely fin'd: For there was it ſeems in <hi>Sparta</hi> a Law which puniſh'd as well thoſe that broke off, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd a promis'd marriage, as thoſe who engag'd in an ill one, and this Law laid hold on thoſe chiefly who endeavour'd to marry into rich, rather than good Families. Thus we have faithfully related all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſages which we cou'd gather of <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Life.</p>

And as he was boaſting and magnifying himſelf for his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits in <hi>Libya,</hi> a Perſon of Worth and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity made anſwer; <hi>And how canſt Thou be an honeſt man, who ſince the death of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who left thee nothing, haſt purchaſed ſo much?</hi> The then preſent Age was not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely an Age of clean and upright manners, but was already declin'd and fallen in love with Riches and Luxury: however then, in this Gentleman's Opinion, they who had deſerted the Ancient Hereditary meanneſs of their Family, were as much to blame as thoſe who had run out a fair Eſtate. And after, when he had ſeized the Power into his hands and ſlew many, a Freeman of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being ſuſpected to have concealed one of the Proſcribed, and for that reaſon ſentenced to be caſt headlong down the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock, in a reproachful way, recounted, how that they had lived long together in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar converſe under the ſame Roof, himſelf for the upper Rooms paying two thouſand Seſterces, and <hi>Sylla</hi> for the lower three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; ſo as the difference between their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes then was no more but one thouſand Seſterces, which in <hi>Attick</hi> Coin give two

Hence, by report, he was ſurnamed <hi>Sylla,</hi> in alluſion to which an <hi>Athenian</hi> Droll caſt out this Scoff in Verſe,</p>

               <p>Nor is it improper to make uſe of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks as theſe, in the decyphering of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who by Nature was ſo addicted to rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, as in his youthful obſcurer years he would converſe freely with Mimicks and Jeſters, and accompany them in all their wild Fegaries. And, when Lord of All, he was often wont to muſter together the moſt impudent Stage-Players and merry Fellows of the Town, to drink with, and play Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes of Wit, without ſeaſonable regard had to his Age, or Dignity of his Place, and to the prejudice of other important Affairs. At hours of refreſhment it was not in <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s Nature to admit of any thing that was ſerious, and though at other times he was a man of buſineſs, and ſomewhat auſtere of

The cauſe of this looſe diſtemper in him, could be no other than Nature her ſelf, ever prone to love and violently breaking forth into all manner of voluptuouſneſs, from which in his old Age he could not refrain. He conſtantly from his youth affected <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crobius,</hi> the Player. In his firſt Amours it happ'ned, that he made court to a common but rich Lady, <hi>Nicopolis</hi> by Name, and what by the air of his Youth, and what by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable behaviour, won ſo far on her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in Quality of a Gallant, as dying ſhe bequeathed him her whole Subſtance; he likewiſe inherited the Eſtate of a Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law, who loved him as her own Son. By theſe means he had pretty well advanced his Fortunes.</p>

Robbers, he ſent them on their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with Preſents and a ſafe Convoy. As for <hi>Bocchus,</hi> he had long ſince hated and dreaded his Son-in-law, <hi>Jugurtha,</hi> who at that time had been worſted in the Field, and fled to him for ſhelter: Wherefore ſpying his opportunity, he called <hi>Sylla</hi> in, as chuſing by him, rather than by himſelf, to make ſeizure and delivery of <hi>Jugurtha. Sylla,</hi> when he had communicated the buſineſs to <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and received from him a ſmall Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, put himſelf on imminent danger; for confiding in a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> and one who had been unfaithful to his own Relations, out of deſire to apprehend another man's Perſon, he made ſurrender of his own. <hi>Bocchus,</hi> having both of them now in his power, was neceſſitated to betray one or other, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long debate with himſelf, at laſt reſolved on his firſt Deſign, and gave up <hi>Jugurtha</hi> into the hands of <hi>Sylla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this <hi>Marius</hi> Triumphed, but the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Enterprize, which the conſcious Envy of <hi>Marius</hi> thought due to <hi>Sylla,</hi> grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him inwardly. And the truth on it is, <hi>Sylla</hi> himſelf was by Nature vain-glorious, and this being the firſt time, that from a low and private condition he had riſen to Eſteem amongſt the Citizens, and taſted of Honour, his Ambition bore him up higher to ſuch a pitch of Oſtentation, as to cauſe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:35403:111"/>
the Figure of this Action to be engraved on a Signet, which he made uſe of ever after. The Impreſs was, Bocchus <hi>delivering and</hi> Sylla <hi>receiving of</hi> Jugurtha. This toucht <hi>Marius</hi> to the quick, however judging <hi>Sylla</hi> to be below a Rival, he made uſe of him as Lieutenant-General in his ſecond Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and in his third, as Tribune. And by his means were many conſiderable Services done. In his Lieutenant-Generalſhip he took <hi>Copillus,</hi> Chief of the <hi>Tectoſages,</hi> Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and compelled the <hi>Marſians,</hi> a great and populous Nation, to become Friends and Confederates of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From henceforward <hi>Sylla</hi> perceiving that <hi>Marius</hi> bore a jealous eye over him, and would no longer afford him opportunities of Action, but rather oppoſed his growth, he applied himſelf to <hi>Catulus, Marius</hi> his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue, a brave man, only ſomewhat unactive as to War. Under this General, who entruſted him with the chiefeſt and greateſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, it came to paſs, that, together with Glory, he arrived at Power. He ſubdued by Arms moſt part of the <hi>Alpine Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> There happ'ning a ſcarcity in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he took that care upon himſelf, and brought in ſuch ſtore of Proviſions, as not only to refreſh the Soldiers of <hi>Catulus</hi> with Plenty, but likewiſe to ſupply <hi>Marius.</hi> This, as he writes himſelf, ſtruck <hi>Marius</hi> to the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:35403:112"/>
very Heart. So ſlight and childiſh was the firſt beginning and riſe of that Enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, which nouriſhed with Civil Blood and endleſs Diviſions, grew up to Tyranny, and the Confuſion of the whole State. This argues <hi>Eurypides</hi> to be a wiſe Man, and well skilled in the Diſtempers of the Body Politick, in that he forewarned all Men to beware of <hi>Ambition,</hi> as the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and pernicious Goddeſs to thoſe who conſult her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> by this time thinking that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his Arms abroad was ſufficient to entitle him to part of the Civil Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, betook himſelf immediately from the Camp to the Aſſembly, and fell a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſing for a Pretorſhip, but loſt it. The fault of this diſappointment he wholly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to the People, who knowing his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with King <hi>Bocchus,</hi> and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon expecting, that if he was made <hi>Aedile</hi> before his Pretorſhip, that he would then ſhew them noble Game, and the Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Lybian</hi> Beaſts, choſe other Pretors, on purpoſe to force him on the <hi>Aedileſhip.</hi> The vanity of this Pretext was ſufficiently diſproved by matter of fact. For the year following, partly by ſtroaking the People with fair Words, and partly by Money, he got himſelf elected Pretor. Wherefore car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Place, and withal haſtily telling
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:35403:112"/>
                  <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that againſt him he ſhould make uſe of his <hi>Own</hi> Authority, <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſmilingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>You do well to call it your Own; for you have bought it.</hi> At the end of his Pretor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he was ſent over into <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> with a ſpecious pretence, to re-eſtabliſh <hi>Ariobar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanes</hi> in his Kingdom, but in reality to give check to the growing Power of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> a mighty ſtirring Prince, who had already inveſted himſelf in as vaſt a new-acquired Power and Dominion, as was that of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Inheritance. He carried over with him no great Forces of his own, but making uſe of the chearful ſupply of the Confederates, flung out <hi>Gordius,</hi> with huge Slaughter of the <hi>Cappadocians,</hi> more eſpecially of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi> Succours, and declared <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> King.</p>
               <p>During his ſtay on the Banks of <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.</hi>
                  </note> there came unto him <hi>Orabazus,</hi> a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi> in quality of Ambaſſador from King <hi>Arſaces,</hi> whereas yet there had been no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence between both Nations. And this we may lay to the account of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, that he ſhould be the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> to whom the <hi>Parthians</hi> made addreſs for Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Friendſhip. At the time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, having ordered three Chairs of State to be ſet, one for <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> one for <hi>Orobazus,</hi> and a third for himſelf, he placed himſelf in the midſt and gave Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:35403:113"/>
For which the King of <hi>Parthia</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put <hi>Orobazus</hi> to death. Some People commended <hi>Sylla</hi> for his lofty carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Barbarians:</hi> Others again accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him of Arrogance and unſeaſonable Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. It is reported, that a certain <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidian,</hi> of <hi>Orobazus</hi> his Retinue, looking <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> wiſtfully in the Face, and obſerving ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially the Motions of his Soul and Body, according to the Rules of Art, ſhould ſay, <hi>That it was impoſſible for him not to be the greateſt Man, or rather a wonder how he could eventhen abſtain from being Head of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At his return <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> impeach'd him of Extortion, for drawing a vaſt ſum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from a well affected and aſſociate King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. However <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> appeared not at the Tryal, but let fall his Accuſation. The quarrel between <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> began to break out afreſh, receiving new life from the Ambition of <hi>Bocchus,</hi> who to pleaſe the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> and gratifie <hi>Sylla,</hi> ſet up in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Capitolinus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Images of <hi>Victory,</hi> and withal a Golden <hi>Jugurtha,</hi> in poſture as he was delivered by him to <hi>Sylla:</hi> but as <hi>Marius</hi> attempted to pull them down in a rage, and others were aiding to <hi>Sylla,</hi> the City had like to have taken fire by that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Commotion, had not the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate-War, which lay long a ſmothering,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:35403:113"/>
blaz'd forth at laſt, and reſpited the Sedition.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of this War, which had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Revolutions, and which ſhockt the <hi>Romans</hi> moſt, and endangered the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commonwealth, <hi>Marius</hi> was not able to ſignalize his Valour in any action, but left behind him a clear proof, that a warlike Spirit ſtands in need of a ſtrong and vigorous Body. <hi>Sylla,</hi> on the other hand, by his extraordinary Deeds, got the name of a great Commander amongſt the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, of the greateſt amongſt his Friends, and the moſt fortunate amongſt his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Nor made this the like Impreſſion on him, as it made on the Spirits of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> the Son of <hi>Conon,</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> who, when his Adverſaries had pictured him aſleep, and <hi>Fortune</hi> by his ſide, caſting her nets over Cities, rag'd and ſtorm'd at thoſe who did it, as if by aſcribing his ſucceſſes to Fortune, they had rob'd him of his juſt honours, and to the People at his return from the Wars, ſaid, <hi>And in this, ye men of</hi> Athens, <hi>Fortune had no part.</hi> For this high preſumption of his, the Goddeſs grew ſo perverſely croſs, that from that time he was never able to compaſs any thing that was great, but proving altogether unfortunate in his attempts, and falling into diſcredit with the People, was at laſt baniſht the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:35403:114"/>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> on the contrary would not only having frankly acknowledged ſuch Divine Felicities and Favours, but withal magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and extolling what was done to the Skies, had plac'd it all to Fortune, whether out of haughty purpoſe, or a real ſenſe of the Deity. He remarks, in his Memoirs, that of all his well-adviſed Actions, none proved ſo lucky in the Execution, as what on a ſudden he had boldly enterprized. And in that Character which he gives of himſelf, <hi>That he was born for Fortune rather than War,</hi> he ſeems to attribute more to his Fortune than Valour. In ſhort, he makes himſelf entirely the creature of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, accounting even his unanimous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with <hi>Metellus,</hi> a man of equal Authority with himſelf, and his Father-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, as a bleſſing from Heaven. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to have met in him a turbulent, he found a quiet Collegue. Moreover, in thoſe Memoirs which he hath dedicated to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> he admoniſheth him to eſteem nothing more ſolid, than what the Gods ſhould adviſe him in a Viſion by Night. And when he was ſent forth with an Army to the Confederate-War, he relates, how that the Earth about <hi>Laverna</hi> opened wide, and from thence iſſued much fire, ſhooting forth a bright flame up to the Heavens. The Southſayers upon this foretold, that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:35403:114"/>
a valiant Perſon of rare and ſingular aſpect, ſhould take the Government in hand, and quiet the preſent troubles of the City. <hi>Sylla</hi> affirm'd, he was the man, for he had that about him which was extraordinary, <hi>a golden head of hair;</hi> nor was he aſham'd openly to atteſt his Valour, after ſo great and gallant performances. And thus much of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Gods.</p>
               <p>As to the reſt of his conditions, he was an irregular ſort of man, inconſiſtent with himſelf: much given to Rapine, to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality much more: in promoting or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing whom he pleaſed, alike unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: cringing to thoſe he ſtood in need of, and domineering over others who ſtood in need of him; ſo that it was hard to tell, whether his Nature had more in it of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain or flattery. As to his unequal diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of puniſhments, when upon ſlight grounds he would put to the torture, and again bear gently with the greateſt Crimes, and receive into grace the moſt hainous Tranſgreſſors upon eaſie terms, but ſmall and inconſiderable offences chaſtiſe with Death, and Confiſcation of Goods; one might from hence judge, that in himſelf he was really of a bitter revengeful Nature, which however he could qualifie, upon reaſon of Intereſt. In this very Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate-War, when the Soldiers with Stones
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:35403:115"/>
and Clubs, had killed a chief Commander, his own Legate, <hi>Albinus</hi> by name, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſuch horrid indignity without taking Cognizance, giving it out moreover in a boaſt, that hereafter he ſhould have the Soldiers more intent upon the War, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair their breach of Diſcipline, by ſome notable piece of ſervice; nor took he notice of the clamours of thoſe that cried for Juſtice, but caſting in mind, how to cruſh <hi>Marius,</hi> now that he ſaw the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate-War to be at an end, he made much of the Army, in hopes to get himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared General of the Forces againſt <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At his return to <hi>Rome</hi> he was choſen Conſul with <hi>Quintus Pompeius,</hi> in the fifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth year of his Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then he took to Wife, the Illuſtrious Lady <hi>Cecilia,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Metellus,</hi> the Chief Prieſt. The common People made Sonnets on the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and many of the Nobility were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted at it, eſteeming him, as <hi>Livy</hi> writes, unworthy of the Lady, whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they thought worthy of a Conſulſhip. This was not his only Wife, for firſt in his younger days he was joined to <hi>Ilia,</hi> by whom he had a Daughter; after her to <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and then to <hi>Caelia,</hi> whom he diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as Barren, but with reſpect and a good report, adding moreover Preſents. The
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:35403:115"/>
Match between him and <hi>Metella</hi> falling out a few days after, gave ſuſpicion that he had wrongfully accuſed <hi>Caelia:</hi> he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore indulgent to <hi>Metella,</hi> inſomuch as when he refuſed to recal the baniſht <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the People made their humble applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Metella.</hi> And the <hi>Athenians,</hi> it's thought, had harder meaſure, at the Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Town, becauſe in a jeering way, they had affronted <hi>Metella</hi> from off the Walls. But of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>At preſent eſteeming the Conſulſhip but ſmall in Compariſon of things to come, he was impatiently carried on in thought to the <hi>Mithridatick</hi> War. Here he was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>Marius,</hi> who out of mad affectation of Glory, and thirſt of Empire, thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dying Paſſions, though he were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Body, and inſufficient for the laſt ſervices, by reaſon of his Age, yet ſtill co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted after Foreign and Tranſmarine Wars; and whilſt <hi>Sylla</hi> was departed for the Camp, to order the reſt of his Affairs there, ſate brooding at home, and at laſt hatcht that execrable Sedition, which wrought <hi>Rome</hi> more miſchief, than all her Enemies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could have done, as was foretold by the Gods. For a flame broke forth of its own accord, from under the ſtaves of their Enſigns, and was hard to be extinguiſht. Three Ravens brought forth their young
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:35403:116"/>
and eat them, carrying the reliques into the Neſt again. Mice having gnawed the Conſecrated Gold of the Temple, the Aediles took one Female in a trap, but ſhe bringing forth five young ones in the very trap, devoured three of them. But what was greateſt of all, in a calm and clear sky there was heard the ſound of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, but with ſuch a ſtrong and diſmal blaſt, as ſtruck terror and amazement into the hearts of the People. The <hi>Hetruſcane</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges affirmed, that this Prodigy betok'ned the mutation of the Age, and revolution of the whole Univerſe. For according to them there be in all eight Ages, differing one from another in Lives and Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to each of theſe God has allotted a certain meaſure of times, determined by the Circuit of the great year; when one Age is run out, at the approach of another, there appears ſome wonderful ſign from Earth or Heaven, as is plain to thoſe who have made it their buſineſs to ſtudy ſuch things, that there has ſucceeded in the World a new race of Men, diſagreeing in Cuſtoms and Inſtitutes of Life, and more or leſs regarded by the Gods, than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Amongſt other mighty changes that happen, as they ſay, at the turn of Ages, even the Art of Divination grows into eſteem ſometimes, and predicts certainties
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:35403:116"/>
from clear and evident tokens, ſent from God: and then again, in another Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion waxes as low to a decline, as frivolous for the moſt part, taking in future events through weak and darkſome Organs. This was the Mythology of the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Sages, who were thought to be more knowing than other People. Whilſt the Senate ſate in Conſultation with the South-ſayers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe Prodigies, in the Temple of <hi>Bellona,</hi> Goddeſs of War, a Sparrow came flying in before them all, with a Graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the mouth; and part ſhe let fall, and part ſhe bore away. The Diviners doubted a Commotion and Diſſention to ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Country and City. For with them the clamorous Graſhopper ſignifies the Country, and Sparrow, the City.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Marius</hi> join'd to him <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> a Fellow ſecond to none for the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Villainies, ſo as we need not enquire wherein he excelled others, but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he excelled himſelf in Wickedneſs. He was cruel, bold, rapacious, openly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and throughout a Rogue, making ſale by out-cry of the <hi>Roman</hi> Freedom to <hi>Libertines</hi> and Strangers, and telling out the price on the publick Money-tables. He maintained three thouſand Sword-men, and had always about him a company of young Gentlemen ready on all occaſions,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:35403:117"/>
whom he ſtyled his <hi>Antiſenatarian-band;</hi> having cauſed a Law to be enacted, that no Senator ſhould contract a debt of above three thouſand Drachma's, he himſelf after Death, was found indebted three Millions. This was the man whom <hi>Marius</hi> let in upon the Commonwealth, and who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all things by Force and the Sword, made ſeveral Ordinances of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and amongſt the reſt, that ſame, which gave to <hi>Marius</hi> the Conduct of the <hi>Mithridatick</hi> War. Upon this the Conſuls proclaim a Publick Ceſſation of buſineſs, but as they were holding a Senate in the Temple of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> he let looſe the Rabble upon them, and amongſt many others ſlew <hi>Pompey,</hi> the Conſuls young Son, in the <hi>Forum, Pompey</hi> himſelf hardly eſcaping in the Crowd. But <hi>Sylla</hi> being cloſely purſued into the Houſe of <hi>Marius,</hi> was forc'd to come forth and diſſolve the Ceſſation; for this cauſe <hi>Sulpitius</hi> having depoſed <hi>Pompey,</hi> continu'd <hi>Sylla</hi> in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip, only the <hi>Mithridatick</hi> Expedition, that he conferred on <hi>Marius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were immediately diſpatcht to <hi>Nola,</hi> Tribunes, to receive the Army, and bring it to <hi>Marius;</hi> but ſeeing that <hi>Sylla</hi> was got before to the Camp, and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers upon hearing of the News had ſtoned the Tribunes, <hi>Marius</hi> in requital, put the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:35403:117"/>
Friends of <hi>Sylla</hi> in the City to the Sword, and rifled their Goods. The People were all up in a hurry, ſhifting and running to and fro, ſome from the Camp to the City, others from the City to the Camp. The Senate, then no more its own, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Governed by the Dictates of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> alarm'd at the report of <hi>Sylla's</hi> advancing his Troops towards the City, ſent forth two of the Pretors, <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Servilius,</hi> to forbid his nearer approach: The Soldiers would have ſlain theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in a fury, for their rough Language to <hi>Sylla;</hi> however, breaking their Rods aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and tearing off their Purple Robes, after much contumelious uſage, they ſent them back, to the ſad and ſudden dejection of thoſe that beheld their Magiſtrates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled of Pretorian Enſigns, and withal declaring, that things were now manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to a Rupture and paſt cure: <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> put himſelf in a readineſs, and <hi>Sylla</hi> with his Collegue moved from <hi>Nola,</hi> at the head of ſix compleat Legions, all whom he found willing to march up directly againſt the City; but he himſelf as yet was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in thought, and apprehenſive of the danger. As he was ſacrificing, <hi>Poſthumius</hi> the South-ſayer having inſpected the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails, ſtretching forth both hands to <hi>Sylla,</hi> required to be bound and kept in Cuſtody
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:35403:118"/>
till the Battel was over, as willing if they had not ſpeedy Succeſs, to ſuffer the utmoſt Puniſhment. It's ſaid, that there appeared to <hi>Sylla</hi> in a Dream a certain Goddeſs, whom the <hi>Romans</hi> learnt to worſhip from the <hi>Cappadoces,</hi> whether ſhe was the <hi>Moon,</hi> or <hi>Pallas,</hi> or <hi>Bellona:</hi> This ſame Goddeſs, to his thinking, ſtood by him, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Hand Thunder and Lightning, then naming his Enemies one by one, bad him diſcharge on them, who all of them dropt at the diſcharge, and diſappeared. Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by this Viſion, and relating the ſame to this Collegue, next day he led on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rome:</hi> About <hi>Picinae</hi> being met by an Embaſſy, beſeeching him not to fall on of a ſudden, in the heat of a March, (for the Senate had decreed to do him all the right imaginable) he conſented to lodge on the place, and ſent his Officers to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure out the Ground, (as is uſual) for a Camp; ſo as the Ambaſſadors believing it, returned. They were no ſooner gone, but he ſent a Party before, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Lucius Baſillus</hi> and <hi>C. Mommius,</hi> to ſecure the City-Gate and Wall on the ſide of the <hi>Aeſculine-hill;</hi> then at the Heels of theſe he himſelf followed with all ſpeed. <hi>Baſillus</hi> fell with ſucceſs into the City, but the unarmed Multitude pelting him with Stones and Tiles from off the Houſes, ſtopt
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:35403:118"/>
his further Progreſs, and beat him back to the Wall. <hi>Sylla</hi> by this time was come up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſeeing what was done, called aloud on his Men to ſet fire to the Houſes, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a flaming Torch, he himſelf led the way, and commanded the Archers to make uſe of their Fire-darts, letting fly at the tops of Houſes: This he did without the leaſt conſideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all enraged, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conduct of that days work to Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if all he ſaw were Enemies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect or pity either to Friends, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Acquaintance, he went on by Fire, which knows no diſtinction betwixt Friend or foe.</p>
               <p>In this diſpute <hi>Marius</hi> being driven into the Temple of <hi>Mother Earth,</hi> would from thence have drawn in the Bondmen by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of Freedom, but the Enemy coming on, he was overpowered and fled the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> having called a Senate, had Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death paſſed on <hi>Marius,</hi> and ſome few others, amongſt whom was <hi>Sulpitius</hi> Tribune of the People. <hi>Sulpitius</hi> was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, being betrayed by his Servant whom <hi>Sylla</hi> firſt made free, and then threw him head-long down the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock. As for <hi>Marius,</hi> he ſet a Price on his Life, by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation; but neither gratefully nor poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly, if we conſider into whoſe Houſe not
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:35403:119"/>
long before he put himſelf at Mercy, and was ſafely diſmiſſed. Albeit had <hi>Marius</hi> not let go <hi>Sylla,</hi> but ſuffered him to be ſlain by the Hands of <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> he might have been Lord of all; but he ſpared his Life, and a few days after, upon like occaſion, received not like meaſure.</p>
               <p>By theſe Proceedings <hi>Sylla</hi> gave ſecret diſtaſte to the Senate; but the diſpleaſure and free indignation of the Commonalty ſhewed it ſelf plainly by their Actions. For they ignominiouſly rejected <hi>Nonius</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, and <hi>Servius,</hi> who put in for Offices of State by his Intereſt, and choſe others for Magiſtrates, by honoring whom, they thought to have grieved him moſt. He made ſemblance of extreme ſatisfaction hereat, as if the People by his means had again enjoyed the Liberty of doing what ſeem'd beſt to them. And to pacifie the publick <hi>Odium,</hi> he created <hi>Lucius Cinna</hi> Conſul, one of the adverſe Party, having firſt bound him under Oaths and Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to be true to his Intereſt: For <hi>Cinna</hi> aſcending the Capitol with a Stone in his Hand, ſwore ſolemnly and with a direful Curſe, that he himſelf, if he kept not the Accord, might be caſt out of the City, as that Stone out of his Hand; he thereupon caſt the Stone to the Ground, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of many People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:35403:119"/>
                  <hi>Cinna</hi> had no ſooner entred on his charge, but fell to diſturb the Eſtabliſhment, and having prepared an information againſt <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> ſuborned <hi>Virginius,</hi> one of the Tribunes of the People, to be his accuſer; but <hi>Sylla</hi> leaving him and the Court of Judicature to themſelves, ſet forth againſt <hi>Mithridates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the time that <hi>Sylla</hi> was making ready, to put off with his Forces from <hi>Italy,</hi> beſides many other Divine <hi>Omens</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell <hi>Mithridates</hi> at <hi>Pergamos,</hi> there goes a Story, that the Statue of <hi>Victory,</hi> with a Crown in her hand, which the <hi>Pergameni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> by Engines from above let down on him, when ſhe had almoſt reach'd his head, fell aſunder, and the Crown tumbling down into the midſt of the Theatre, broke to pieces againſt the ground, ſo as this ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Vulgar, and hugely diſquieted the Mind of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> altho his Affairs hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had ſucceeded beyond expectation; for at preſent having wreſted from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Aſia,</hi> from the <note n="*" place="margin">Nicome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des <hi>and</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riobarza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> Kings <hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> he made <hi>Pergamus</hi> his Royal Seat, beſtowing on his Friends Riches, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, and Kingdoms. Of his Sons, the one (<hi>Arcathias</hi>) reſiding in <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,</hi> held his Ancient Realm as far as the Deſarts, above the Lake <hi>Maeotis,</hi> without moleſtation: <hi>Ariarathes</hi> (the other) was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout reducing <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Macedon,</hi> with a

great Army, to Obedience. His other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders with Forces under them, invaded other Quarters; eſpecially <hi>Archilaus,</hi> who by his Ships gave in a manner abſolute Law at Sea, had ſubjected the Iſles <hi>Cyclades,</hi> together with other ſituated within <hi>Malea,</hi> and had taken <hi>Aeubaea</hi> it ſelf. From <hi>Athens,</hi> his Seat of War, he made his Excurſions as far as <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and drew after him moſt of the States of <hi>Greece,</hi> without the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, ſave only at <hi>Chaeronea.</hi> For here <hi>Brutius Sura,</hi> Deputy of <hi>Sentius,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Macedon,</hi> a man excelling in Valour and Prudence, met with <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and though, like a Torrent, he came pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along <hi>Baeotia,</hi> made ſtout reſiſtance, and giving him thrice Battel, repulſed and forc'd him off again to Sea; however being Commanded by <hi>Lucius Lucullus</hi> to give place to his Succeſſor <hi>Sylla,</hi> and reſign the War to whom it was decreed, he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left <hi>Baeotia,</hi> and returned back to <hi>Sinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> although his Succeſs had out-gone all hopes, and <hi>Greece</hi> was well diſpoſed to a Revolt, upon account of his gallant beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> at his arrival received by their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors the Complements of all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Greece,</hi> except <hi>Athens,</hi> which being forc'd by the Tyrant <hi>Ariſtion</hi> within to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:35403:120"/>
hold for the King, he came againſt it with all his might, and inveſting the Haven <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus,</hi> laid formal Siege to it, erecting all manner of Batteries, and trying all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Aſſaults; whereas had he forborn never ſo little, he might without hazard have taken the Upper City by Famine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already reduc'd to extreamity, through want of Neceſſaries; but haſting to <hi>Rome,</hi> and fearing ſome Innovation there, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Adventures, many Fights, and vaſt Expence, he puſht on the War; for beſides other Equipage, the very Work about the Engines of Battery was ſupplied with no leſs than ten thouſand Yoak of Mules, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd daily in that Service; and when Timber grew ſcarce (for many of the Works fail'd, ſome quaſh'd to pieces by their own weight, others taking fire by the continual play of the Enemy) he made bold with the ſacred Groves, and cut down the ſtately Walks of the Academy, which ſtands in the Suburbs, and the <hi>Lyceum;</hi> and being there wanted a vaſt Summ of Money to carry on the War, he broke up the unvoidable Treaſures of <hi>Greece,</hi> that of <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> and that of <hi>Olympia,</hi> ſending for the faireſt and richeſt Offertories; he wrote likewiſe to the <hi>Amphyctiones</hi> at <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos.</hi> That it were better to remit the Wealth of the God to him, for that he
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:35403:121"/>
would keep it more ſecurely, or in caſe he made uſe of it, reſtore as much. And of his Friends he ſent <hi>Caphis</hi> the <hi>Phocean</hi> on this Meſſage, commanding him to receive each Particular by weight. <hi>Caphis</hi> came to <hi>Delphos,</hi> but was loth to touch holy things, and with many Tears in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the <hi>Amphyctiones,</hi> bewailed the Neceſſity: But ſome of them making as if they heard the ſound of a Harp from the innermoſt Shrine, he, whether himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it, or elſe was willing to ſtrike a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious awe into <hi>Sylla,</hi> ſent back an Expreſs. To which <hi>Sylla</hi> replied in a ſcoffing way, That it was matter of wonder to him, that <hi>Caphis</hi> underſtood Muſick to be a ſign of Joy, not Anger; and therefore wiſh'd him to go on boldly, and receive it from the hands of a Gracious and bountiful God.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the things that were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, eſcaped the memory of moſt <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> ſave the Silver Tun, that only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of Regal Donation, which for its weight and bulk the Carriages not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive, when the <hi>Amphyctiones</hi> were forced to cut in pieces, they preſently call'd to mind, now <hi>Titus Quinctius Flaminius,</hi> and <hi>Manius</hi>

                  <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kings, not only abſtained from the <hi>Grecian</hi> Temples, but added to them Gifts and Honour, and much Veneration.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:35403:122"/>
drawing ſome of the adverſe Party to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, and his own men to a diſſolute courſe, he came to be in want of a large Treaſury, eſpecially for that Siege.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> had a vehement and an implacable deſire to Conquer <hi>Athens,</hi> whether out of emulation, fighting as it were, againſt the ſhadow of that once Famous City, or out of anger, ſtomaching thoſe Flouts and Scurrillous jeſts, wherewith the Tyrant <hi>Ariſtion,</hi> fooling and skipping about daily, had provoked him and <hi>Metella</hi> from off the Walls.</p>
               <p>The Tyrant <hi>Ariſtion</hi> had his very Being compounded of Wantonneſs and Cruelty, receiving into himſelf as common Sewer the worſt of <hi>Mithridates</hi> his ill humours and vicious qualities, who like ſome ſatal diſeaſe, after its deliverance from innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Wars, many Tyrannies and Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, brought the City to the laſt extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. At the time when a <note n="*" place="margin">About ſix buſhel.</note> 
                  <hi>Medimnus</hi> of Wheat was to be ſold in the City for one Thouſand Drachma's, and men were forc'd to live on Feverfew, growing round the Cittadel, and eat ſhooes and Oyl-bags ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he daily carrouſing and feaſting it in the open face of Noon, then dancing in Armour, and ſporting at the Enemy, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the holy Lamp of the Goddeſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire for want of Oyl, and to the Chief-Prieſteſs,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:35403:122"/>
who demanded of him an <note n="*" place="margin">About a Pint.</note> Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na of Wheat, he ſent the like quantity of Pepper. The Senators and Prieſts, who came in humble guiſe, to beg of him to take Compaſſion of the City, and treat a Peace with <hi>Sylla,</hi> he drove at and diſperſed with a flight of Arrows. At laſt with much ado, he ſent forth two or three of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Companions to parley, whom <hi>Sylla,</hi> perceiving that they made no over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures towards an accommodation, but went on haranguing in praiſe of <hi>Theſeus, Eumolpus,</hi> and their <hi>Median Trophies,</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them thus, <hi>Happy men! ye may put up your Speeches and be gone, for I was ſent by the</hi> Romans <hi>to</hi> Athens, <hi>not to learn, but to reduce Rebels to obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time News came to <hi>Sylla,</hi> that ſome old men diſcourſing in the <hi>Cera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micum,</hi> were over-heard to blame the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, for not ſecuring the Paſſages and Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues on the ſide of the Gate <hi>Heptachalcos,</hi> where only the Enemy might eaſily get over. <hi>Sylla</hi> neglected not the report, but going in the Night, and diſcovering the place to be aſſaultable, ſet ſtreight to work: <hi>Sylla</hi> himſelf makes mention in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs, that <hi>Marcus Teius,</hi> the firſt man who ſcal'd the Wall, meeting with an Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſtriking him on the head-piece a home ſtroke, broke his Sword, however
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:35403:123"/>
ſhrunk not from his ground, but withſtood and held him faſt. The City was taken on that part, as 'tis recorded by the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they had thrown down the Wall, and made all level betwixt the <hi>Pyrean,</hi> and Sacred-Gate, about the dead of night, <hi>Sylla</hi> entred the breach in dreadful manner with many Trumpets and Cornets, with the row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſhout and cry of an Army, falling to the ſpoil and ſlaughter, and ſcouring through the ſtreets with Swords drawn, ſo as there was no numbring of the ſlain; only from the ſpace of ground overflowed with Blood, we may even now take a ſurvey of their Multitude, for to paſs by the execution done on other Quarters of the City, the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed about the Market place, took up the whole <hi>Ceramicum,</hi> within the Double gate, and according to moſt Writers, paſſing through both doors, overwhelmed the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs. Nor did the People which fell thus in ſuch vaſt heaps, excel the number of thoſe, who out of pity and love of their Country, then at point of deſtruction, ſlew themſelves; the beſt of them deſpairing and dreading to ſurvive; as not expecting either Humanity or Moderation in <hi>Sylla.</hi> At length, partly by the inſtance of <hi>Midias</hi> and <hi>Calliphon,</hi> two exil'd men, beſeeching and caſting themſelves at his feet, partly by the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:35403:123"/>
interceſſion of thoſe Senators who followed the Camp, having had his fill of Revenge, and making ſome honourable mention of the Ancient <hi>Athenians, I forgive</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the Many for the ſake of a Few, the Living for the Dead.</hi> He took <hi>Athens,</hi> according to his own Memoirs, on the Calends of <hi>March,</hi> which fall out exactly on the firſt of <hi>Autheſterion,</hi> on which day the <hi>Athenians</hi> keep a Solemn Commemoration of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ruins and Devaſtations, occaſioned by exceſſive rains, particularly of the <hi>Deluge</hi> which hap'ned about that time.</p>
               <p>At the taking of the Town, the Tyrant fled into the Cittadel, and was there beſieged by <hi>Curio,</hi> who had that charge under Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. He held out a conſiderable time, but for want of Water yielding up himſelf, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidenced the Divine Providence. For on the ſame day and minute that <hi>Curio</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him down, the Clouds gathering in a calm Heaven, there ſhowred down a great quantity of rain, and filled the Cittadel with Water.</p>
               <p>Not long after <hi>Sylla</hi> won the Haven <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus,</hi> and burnt moſt of it, amongſt the reſt <hi>Philo</hi>'s Arſenal, a ſtupendious Work.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Taxilles, Mithridates</hi> his General, coming down from <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Macedon,</hi> with an Army of one hundred thouſand Foot, ten thouſand Horſe, and

ninety Chariots, fang'd at <hi>Axles</hi> with Iron Sythes, would have joyn'd <hi>Archelaus,</hi> who lay hovering with a Navy on the Coaſt of <hi>Munichia,</hi> with intention, neither to quit the Sea, or engage the <hi>Romans</hi> in Fight, but to draw out the War in length, and cut off the Enemies Proviſion, which <hi>Sylla</hi> perceiving much better than himſelf, paſſed with his Forces into <hi>Baeotia,</hi> from out a region bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and unable to maintain a Camp in time of Peace. He was thought by ſome to have taken falſe meaſures, when leaving <hi>Attica,</hi> a rugged Country, and uneaſie for the Cavalry to move in, he put himſelf into the plain and open Fields of <hi>Baeotia,</hi> knowing the <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſtrength to conſiſt moſt in Horſe and Chariots. But as was ſaid before, to avoid Famine and Scarcity, he was forc'd to run the riſque of a Battel: Moreover he was troubled for <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> a man expert in War, and of a rough Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery Conſtitution, whom on his way to <hi>Sylla</hi> with Forces from <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> awaited in the <note n="*" place="margin">Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mopule.</note> Streights: For theſe reaſons <hi>Sylla</hi> drew off into <hi>Baeotia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Caphis</hi>

                  </note> our Country-man led <hi>Hortenſius</hi> another way unknown to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> by <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus</hi> juſt under <hi>Tithora,</hi> being then no ſuch great City as 'tis now, but a Garriſon built a round on a ſteep Precipice, which the <hi>Phocenſes,</hi> to eſcape the Invaſion of

                  <hi>Xerxes,</hi> put themſelves and goods into, and were ſaved. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> encamping here, kept off the Enemy by day, and at night deſcending by difficult paſſages into <hi>Patronis,</hi> join'd the Forces of <hi>Sylla,</hi> who came to meet him.

               <p>As they lay thus encamped, they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Enemy a contemptible number, for they were not above fifteen hundred Horſe, and leſs than fifteen thouſand Foot; wherefore, the reſt of the Commanders over-perſwading <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and drawing up the Army, covered the Field with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Chariots, Bucklers, Targets: The cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and hideous roar of ſo many Nations, ſtanding thick together in <hi>Battalia,</hi> tore the Sky; nor was the Pomp and Gallantry of their coſtly array, altogether idle and unſerviceable for terrour: For the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Armour, embelliſhed with Gold and Silver magnificently, and the luſtre of their <hi>Median</hi> and <hi>Scythian</hi> Coats, intermixt with Braſs and ſhining Steel, caſt forth a flaming and a dreadful ſight, by the waving and moving to and fro of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, inſomuch that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhrunk

of War proceeded rather from a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to labour, than any forwardneſs to fight; but if they were in good earneſt Martially given, he bad them with their Arms get up thither, pointing at the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Tower of the <hi>Parapotamians,</hi> whereof at preſent, the City being laid waſt, there remained only the Mountainous head, ſteep and craggy on all ſides, and ſevered from Mount <hi>Edulium,</hi> the breadth of the River <hi>Aſſus,</hi> which running betwixt, and at the bottom of the ſame Hill, falling into <hi>Cephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> with an impetuous Confluence, made that a ſafe Height to lodge on; wherefore beholding the Braſs Targettiers to make up haſtily, <hi>Sylla</hi> was willing to take prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and took it by the vigorous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of the Soldiers. <hi>Archelaus</hi> put back from hence, bent his Forces upon <hi>Chaero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea.</hi> The <hi>Chaeroneans,</hi> who bore Arms in the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, beſeeching <hi>Sylla</hi> not to abandon the City, he diſpatcht <hi>Geminius</hi> the Tribune with one Legion, and withal ſent out the <hi>Chaeroneans,</hi> endeavouring, but not able to get in before <hi>Geminius;</hi> ſo active<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was he, and more ſwift to relief, than they who prayed Relief. <hi>Juba</hi> writes, that <hi>Ericius</hi> was the man ſent, not <hi>Gemini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> Thus narrowly eſcaped <note n="*" place="margin">Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch'<hi>s.</hi>

                  <hi>Thurion,</hi> where the Enemy had poſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This is a craggy Heighth, running up gradually to a Point, which we call <hi>Orthopagon;</hi> at the foot of it, is the River <hi>Morius,</hi> and the Temple of <hi>Apollo Thurius:</hi> The God had his Surname from <hi>Thuro,</hi> Mother of <hi>Cheron,</hi> whom ancient Fame makes Founder of <hi>Chaeronea.</hi> Others aſſert, that the Cow, which <hi>Apollo</hi> gave to <hi>Cadmus</hi> for a Guide, appeared there, and that the Place took its Name from the Beaſt; for the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> call a Cow, <hi>Thor.</hi>

               <p>At <hi>Sylla</hi>'s approach to <hi>Chaeronea,</hi> the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune, who had been commanded out to guard the City, drew his Men into Arms, and meet him with a Garland of Laurel in his hand; which <hi>Sylla</hi> accepting of, and withal careſſing and animating the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Encounter, two Men of <hi>Chaero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea, Homoloichus</hi> and <hi>Anaxidamus,</hi> preſent themſelves before him, and proffer with a ſmall Party to diſlodge thoſe who were po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on <hi>Thurium;</hi> for that there lay a Path, unknown to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> from <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> along by the <hi>Muſaeum,</hi> leading over head upon <hi>Thurium;</hi> by this way it was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to fall on, and either ſtone them from above, or force them down into the Plain. <hi>Sylla</hi> aſſured of their Faith and Courage by <hi>Geminius,</hi> when he had exhorted them to go on with the Enterpriſe, Embattelled the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:35403:127"/>
Army, and diſpoſing of the Cavalry on both Wings, himſelf commanded the Right, and the left he committed to the direction of <hi>Muraena;</hi> in the Rear of all, <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> his Legates, had planted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the upper Grounds, with the Cohorts of Reſerve, to watch the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Enemy, who with infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Horſe, and expedite light-armed Foot, having made the Wing pliant, and ready to wind about at pleaſure gave ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that he intended to over-reach and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the <hi>Romans.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Chaeroneans,</hi> who had <hi>Ericus</hi> for Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by appointment of <hi>Sylla,</hi> covertly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding <hi>Thurium,</hi> and diſcovering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, there aroſe a great Confuſion and Rout, and mutual Slaughter amongſt the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> for they kept not their ſtand, but making down in that hurry, caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on their own Spears, and violently bore each other headlong, the Enemy from above preſſing on, and wounding them on the open ſide, inſomuch as there fell three thouſand about <hi>Thurium.</hi> Some of them who eſcaped being met by <hi>Muraena</hi> as he ſtood in Array, were cut off and deſtroy'd. Others breaking through to their Friends, and falling diſorderly into the Ranks, filled moſt part of the Army with fear and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, and put the Chief Officers to a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:35403:127"/>
ſtand, which was no ſmall diſadvantage. For immediately upon the Diſcompoſure, <hi>Sylla</hi> coming full ſpeed to the Charge, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed the Service of their Armed Chariots, which require a good ſpace of Ground to gather ſtrength and impetuoſity in the Career, whereas a ſhort drift proves weak and ineffectual, like that of Engines without a full ſwing. Thus it fared with the <hi>Barbarians</hi> at preſent, whoſe firſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, that ſet forth ſpurtingly, and made but a faint impreſſion when the <hi>Romans</hi> had repulſed, with a clattering din and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they called for more, as is uſual in the publick Cirque. By this time the Groſs of both Armies met. The <hi>Barbarians,</hi> on one ſide, charged their long Pikes, and with Shields lock'd cloſe together like a Roof o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver head, ſtrove what in them lay to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their <hi>Battalion</hi> entire: The <hi>Romans,</hi> on the other ſide, threw by their Piles, and with drawn Swords put by their Puſhes, the ſooner to mingle with them, in the rage they were then in: For in the Front of the Enemy they beheld fifteen thouſand Slaves, whom the Royal <note n="*" place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of King <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates.</hi>
                  </note> Commanders had ſet free by Proclamation, and rang'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Men of Arms.</hi> Whereupon a <hi>Roman</hi> Centurion is reported to ſay, That he never knew Servants allowed to play the Maſters, unleſs on the Holy-days of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:35403:128"/>
Theſe Men, by reaſon of their deep and thick Array, as well as for their da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Courage, yielded but ſlowly to the weighty Legions, till at laſt by ſlinging Engines and Darts, for which the <hi>Roman</hi> ſpar'd not from behind, they were forc'd to give way and ſcatter. And as <hi>Archelaus</hi> was extending the the Right Wing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs the Enemy, <hi>Hortenſius</hi> with his <hi>Cohorts</hi> came down amain, with intention to charge him in the Flank; but <hi>Achelaus</hi> wheeling about ſuddenly, with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> overlaid with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, withdrew himſelf to the upper Grounds, not far from the main Body, and was ſurrounded by the Enemy: When <hi>Sylla</hi> heard this, he came ſpeeding from the right to his ſuccour, before the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but <hi>Archelaus</hi> gueſſing the matter by the duſt of his Troops, turned to the right Wing, from whence <hi>Sylla</hi> came, in hopes to have ſurpriſed it without a Commander: At the ſame inſtant likewiſe <hi>Taxilles</hi> with his Braſs-Targetiers aſſailed <hi>Muraena,</hi> ſo as a Cry coming from both places, and the Hills repeating it around, <hi>Sylla</hi> ſtood in ſuſpence which way to move; it ſeeming beſt to reaſſume his own Station, he ſent in aid to <hi>Muraena</hi> four Cohorts, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fifth to follow him, returned on the ſpur to the right Wing, which then of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:35403:128"/>
it ſelf held <hi>Archelaus</hi> to equal play; at his appearance they gave one luſty puſh for all, and overcoming, followed them diſorderly flying to the River and Mount <hi>Acontium.</hi> Neither was <hi>Sylla</hi> unmindful of the danger <hi>Muraena</hi> was in; for haſting thither, and finding them Victorious, he help'd to purſue. Many <hi>Barbarians</hi> were ſlain on the ſpot, many more cut in pieces, as they were making to the Camp: Of ſuch infinite Multitudes, ten thouſand only got ſafe into <hi>Chalcis. Sylla</hi> writes, that there were but fourteen of his Soldiers wanting, and that two even of thoſe returned towards even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; wherefore he inſcribed on <hi>Trophies, Mars, Victory,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> as having won the Day no leſs by Good-fortune, than by true management and force of Arms. That <hi>Trophie</hi> of the Field-Battel ſtands on the Place where <hi>Archelaus</hi> firſt gave back, as far as the Streums of <hi>Molus:</hi> The other is erected high, on the top of <hi>Thurium,</hi> where the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were environ'd ſignifying in <hi>Greek</hi> Letters, That <hi>Homoloichus</hi> and <hi>Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus</hi> were the Chief Leaders. The Hymns of Victory for this Action were celebrated at <hi>Thebes,</hi> where <hi>Sylla</hi> built a Stage for Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, near <hi>Oedipus</hi>'s Well. As for the Judges of the Performance, they were <hi>Grecians</hi> choſen out of other Cities, becauſe he bore an implacable hatred to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:35403:129"/>
having cut off from them half their Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, he conſecrated the ſame to <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> commanding them, out of the Revenue, to make ſatisfaction to the Gods, for the Riches himſelf had taken from them.</p>
               <p>After this, hearing that <hi>Flaccus</hi> a Man of the contrary Faction, being choſen Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, had croſſed the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to act in ſhew againſt <hi>Mithridates,</hi> but in reality againſt himſelf, he took the way of <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> deſigning to meet him; but in his March, about <hi>Meleteia,</hi> received Adviſes from all Parts, That the Countries on his back were over ſpread and harraſed by no leſs a Camp-Royal than was the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: For <hi>Dorilaus</hi> arriving at <hi>Chalcis,</hi> with a mighty Fleet (on board of which he brought over with him Eighty Thouſand of the beſt-appointed and beſt diſciplin'd Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of <hi>Mithridates</hi> his Army) had made a ſudden Incurſion into <hi>Baeotia,</hi> and ſecured that Coaſt, in hopes to bring <hi>Sylla</hi> to a Battel, making no account of the diſſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> but giving it out, as to the laſt Fight, that without Treachery ſo many Thouſand Men could never have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. However, <hi>Sylla</hi> facing about ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditiouſly, made it appear to <hi>Dorilaus,</hi> that <hi>Archelaus</hi> was a wiſe Man, and had good skill in the <hi>Roman</hi> Valour; inſomuch
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:35403:129"/>
as <hi>Dorilaus</hi> himſelf, after ſome ſmall Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes with <hi>Sylla</hi> at <hi>Tilphoſſion,</hi> was the firſt of thoſe who thought it not adviſable to put things to the deciſion of the Sword, but rather by expence of Time and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to wear out the War; nevertheleſs the Field of <hi>Orchomenos,</hi> where they then lay encamped, gave no ſmall encouragement to <hi>Archelaus,</hi> as being moſt advantageous to thoſe who excel in Cavalry to engage in. For of the <hi>Baeotian</hi> Campagnes, that is the faireſt and largeſt, which confining on the Principal Seat of the <hi>Orchomenians,</hi> alone opens a clear Proſpect, void of Cover as far as the Fens, where the River <hi>Melas</hi> is ſwallowed up. Of all the <hi>Grecians</hi> Rivers, this only, which ariſeth from under the City <hi>Orchomenus,</hi> draws with it a deep and navigable Water from the very Head, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing about the Summer Solſtice like <hi>Nile,</hi> and bringing forth all things grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there; yet ſmall, and without Fruit. It runs not far, before the main Stream loſeth it ſelf among the blind and woody Marſh Grounds, a ſmall Branch whereof mingleth with <hi>Cephiſus,</hi> about that place eſpecially where the Lake is thought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the beſt Flute-reeds.</p>
               <p>Now that both Armies were poſted near each other, <hi>Archelaus</hi> lay ſtill, but <hi>Sylla</hi> fell to caſting up Ditches athwart from either
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:35403:130"/>
ſide, that, if poſſible, by cutting the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies from the firm and open Champagne, he might force them into the Fens. They on the other hand, not enduring this, but at the Word of Command, iſſuing out fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly in full Bodies, not only the Men at work were diſperſed, but moſt part of thoſe who ſtood in Arms to juſtifie the Work, caſt themſelves diſorderly into flight. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>Sylla</hi> leaps from his Horſe, and ſnatching hold of an Enſign, ruſht through the midſt of the Rout upon the Enemy, crying out aloud, <hi>To me,</hi> O Romans, <hi>it ſeems glorious to fall here: And as for you, when demanded where was it, you betrayed your General, remember you ſay, at</hi> Orcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menus. His men Rallying again at theſe words, and two Cohorts coming to his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour from the Right-Wing, he gave a fierce Onſet and turn'd the Day. Then retiring ſome few Paces back, and refreſhing his Men, he came on again to block up the Enemies Camp but they again ſallied out in better Order than before. Here <hi>Diogenes,</hi> Son in-law to <hi>Archelaus,</hi> having fought on the Right-Wing with much Gallantry, made an Honourable end. And the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, being preſſed on hard by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and wanting ſpace for a retreat, took their Arrows by handfuls, and ſtriking with thoſe as with Swords, beat them back. In
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:35403:130"/>
the end they were all ſhut up into the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment, and had a ſorrowful Night of it, by reaſon of their ſlain and wounded. The next day again <hi>Sylla</hi> leading forth his men up to their Quarters, went on finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Line, and as they were drawing out to give him Battel, fell on, and putting a large Party of them to the rout, in the fright they were in, none daring to abide, he took the Camp by force, whence the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes were filled with Bloud, and the Lake with dead Bodies, inſomuch as to this day there be found, of the <hi>Barbarian</hi> make, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bows, Helmets, pieces of Breaſt-plates, and Swords, buried deep in Mud, ſome two hundred years ſince the Fight. Thus much of the Action, of <hi>Chaeronea</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomenus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cinna</hi> and <hi>Narbo</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> uſing injuſtice and violence towards Perſons of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Eminency, many of them to avoid that Tyranny, repaired to <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Camp, as to a ſafe Harbour, where in a ſhort ſpace he had about him the Majeſtick face of a Senate. <hi>Metella</hi> likewiſe having with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty conveyed her ſelf and Children away by ſtealth, brought him word that his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Country houſes were ſet on fire by the Adverſary, and prayed his help at home. Whilſt he was in doubt what to do, being impatient to hear his Country abuſed,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:35403:131"/>
and not knowing how to leave ſo great a work, as the <hi>Mithridatick</hi>-War unfiniſhed, comes unto him <hi>Archelaus,</hi> a Merchant of <hi>Delos,</hi> with ſome hopes of an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and private inſtructions from <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> the King's General. <hi>Sylla</hi> lik'd the buſineſs ſo well as to deſire a ſpeedy confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with <hi>Archelaus</hi> in Perſon, and had a meeting at Sea on that ſide of <hi>Delos,</hi> where the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> ſtands. When <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> began to propoſe and demand of <hi>Sylla,</hi> that quitting his Pretenſions to <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Pontus,</hi> he ſhould ſet ſail for the War in <hi>Rome,</hi> receiving Money and Shipping, and ſuch Forces as he ſhould think fitting, from the King: <hi>Sylla</hi> interpoſing, bad him take no further care for <hi>Mithridates,</hi> but aſſume the Crown to himſelf, and become a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate of <hi>Rome,</hi> delivering up the Navy. Here <hi>Archelaus</hi> profeſſing his abhorrence of Treaſon, <hi>Sylla</hi> proceeded: <hi>Thou, O</hi> Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, Cappadocian <hi>as thou art, and Slave (on, if it ſo pleaſe thee, Friend) to a</hi> Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>King, doſt thou upon ſuch vaſt Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſcruple any thing of Baſeneſs? and to me</hi> Roman <hi>General and</hi> Sylla <hi>dar'ſt talk of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? as if thou wert not the ſelf ſame</hi> Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus <hi>who ran away at</hi> Chaeronea, <hi>with a few in Company, the Reliques of One hundred and twenty thouſand Men; who lay ſquat for two days in the Fens of</hi> Orchomenus, <hi>and left</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:35403:131"/>
Baeotia <hi>unpaſſable for heaps of dead Carcaſes. Archelaus,</hi> chang'd at this, in humble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fell at his Feet, beſeeching him to lay aſide the thoughts of War, and make Peace with <hi>Mithridates. Sylla</hi> conſenting to this Requeſt, Articles of Agreement were concluded on; That <hi>Mithridates</hi> ſhould quit <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> reſtore <hi>Bithynia</hi> to <hi>Nicomedes, Cappadocia</hi> to <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes,</hi> and pay the <hi>Romans</hi> two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Talents, and give him ſeventy Ships of War, with all their Furniture: On the other hand, That <hi>Sylla</hi> ſhould confirm to him his other Dominions, and declare him a <hi>Roman</hi> Confederate. On theſe terms he returned by the way of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for the <hi>Heleſpont,</hi> having <hi>Archelaus</hi> with him in great eſteem. For <hi>Archelaus</hi> being taken deſperately ill at <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> he ſtaid the March of the Army, and took care of him, as one of his own Captains, or Joynt Comander in Chief. This gave ſuſpicion of foul play in the Buſineſs of <hi>Chaeronea,</hi> as well as becauſe <hi>Sylla</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged all the Friends of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoners in War, ſave only <hi>Ariſtion</hi> the Tyrant, whom diſaffected to <hi>Archelaus,</hi> he made away by Poiſon; but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ten Thouſand Acres of <hi>Baeotian</hi> Land, given to a <hi>Cappadocian,</hi> and him ſtyled by <hi>Sylla,</hi> Friend and Allie of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:35403:132"/>
For all which, <hi>Sylla</hi> apologizeth in his Memoirs.</p>
               <p>The Embaſſadors of <hi>Mithridates</hi> arriving, and withal declaring, That they accepted of the Conditions, only <hi>Paphlagonia</hi> they could not part with, and as for the Ships, they knew of no ſuch Capitulation; <hi>Sylla</hi> in a rage anſwered, <hi>What ſay you; does</hi> Mithridates <hi>then with-hold</hi> Paphlagonia? <hi>and as to the Ships, denies he that Article? Whom I thought to have ſeen proſtrate at my foot, had I left him only that right hand of his, which cut off ſo many</hi> Romans. <hi>Sure he will ſhortly, at our coming over into</hi> Aſia, <hi>ſpeak another Language; in the mean time, let him at his eaſe in</hi> Pergamus, <hi>ſit manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a War which he never ſaw.</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors out of fear ſtood ſilent by, but <hi>Archelaus</hi> with humble ſupplication aſſwag'd his wrath, laying gentle hold on his right hand and weeping; in the concluſion he obtained to be ſent Embaſſador to <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates.</hi> For that he would either Mediate a Peace, to the ſatisfaction of <hi>Sylla</hi> or, if not, ſlay himſelf. <hi>Sylla</hi> having thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched him away, made an Inroad into <hi>Media,</hi> and after wide Depopulation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back again into <hi>Macedon,</hi> where he received <hi>Archelaus</hi> about <hi>Philippi,</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word that all things were well, and moreover that <hi>Mithridates</hi> earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:35403:132"/>
an interview. The chief cauſe of this meeting was <hi>Fimbria;</hi> for he having aſſaſſinated <hi>Flaccus</hi> the Conſul, one holding of the contrary Faction, and worſted the <hi>Mithridatick</hi> Commanders, was advancing againſt <hi>Mithridates</hi> himſelf, who fearing this, choſe rather to enter into Alliance with <hi>Sylla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There met at <hi>Dardanus</hi> of <hi>Troas,</hi> on one ſide <hi>Mithridates,</hi> attended with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ships compleatly equipped, and of Land forces twenty thouſand Men of Arms, two thouſand Horſe, and a large train of Sythed-Chariots: on the other, <hi>Sylla</hi> with only four Cohorts, and two hundred Horſe. As <hi>Mithridates</hi> drew near and put out his hand, <hi>Sylla</hi> demanded, Whether he was willing or no to end the War on what <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaus</hi> had agreed to? but ſeeing the King made no anſwer, <hi>Why then</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth the diſtreſſed to ſpeak firſt, and as for the Conquerors it is ſufficient to give audience.</hi> And when <hi>Mithridates,</hi> entering upon his Plea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> began ſlily to ſhift off the War, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Gods, and partly to blame the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, he took him up, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That he had heard indeed long ſince from others, and now knew it himſelf for truth, that <hi>Mithridates</hi> was a powerful ſpeaker, who to ſet off ſuch foul and unjuſt practices, wanted not for handſome preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:35403:133"/>
Then charging him with, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing bitterly againſt outrages by him committed, he askt again, Whether he was willing or no, to ratifie the Treaty of <hi>Archelaus? Mithridates</hi> anſwering in the affirmative, <hi>Sylla</hi> ran into and embracing kiſſed him. Not long after he introduced <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> the two Kings, and made them all Friends. Wherefore <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi> when he had furniſht <hi>Sylla</hi> with ſeventy Ships, and 500 Archers, ſet ſail for <hi>Pontus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> perceiving the Soldiers to be diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Peace, for the moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of Kings, and one who had cauſed one hundred and fifty thouſand <hi>Romans</hi> to be maſſacred in one day throughout <hi>Aſia;</hi> they thought it a heinous thing to behold him ſailing out with the Riches and Spoils of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which he had pillaged, and put under contribution for the ſpace of four years;) alledged, that he was not able to have made head againſt <hi>Fimbria</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi> had they both withſtood him in Conjunction. Thence he aroſe and went in ſearch of <hi>Fimbria,</hi> who lay with the Army about <hi>Thiatira,</hi> and pitching hard by, began to fortifie himſelf with a Trench. The Soldiers of <hi>Fimbria</hi> came out in their ſingle Coats, and ſaluting his men, lent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy aſſiſtance to the work, which change

                  <hi>Fimbria</hi> beholding, and withal apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sylla</hi> as irreconcileable, laid violent hands on himſelf in the Camp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> impos'd on <hi>Aſia</hi> in general a Tax of twenty thouſand Talents, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly waſted each Family by the licentious behaviour, and long reſidence of the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery in private Quarters. For he ordained, that every Hoſt ſhould allow himſelf four Tetradrachma's each day, and moreover entertain him, and as many Friends as he ſhould invite, with a Supper; that a Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion ſhould receive fifty Drachma's a day, together with one Sute of Clothes to wear within doors, and another when he went abroad.</p>
               <p>Having put off from <hi>Epheſus</hi> with the whole Navy, he came the third day to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in the <hi>Pirean</hi> Haven. Here he was initiated in the Myſteries of the Goddeſs <hi>Ceres,</hi> and ſeizing to his uſe the Library of <hi>Apellicon</hi> a <hi>Teian,</hi> in which were moſt of <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Works, then unknown to moſt, he tranſported the ſame to <hi>Rome.</hi> It's ſaid, That <hi>Turannion</hi> the <hi>Grammarian</hi> made his Collection chiefly from hence, and that <hi>Andronicus</hi> the <hi>Rhodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> having through his means the Command of divers Copies, put out thoſe Heads of Treatiſes which be common now in every Mans hands, under the Title of <hi>Tables.</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:35403:134"/>
The ancient <hi>Peripateticks</hi> were of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves indeed Men of Polite and Univerſal Learning; but of all the Writings of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> and <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> they had no exact knowledge; becauſe <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Study to the Heir of <hi>Neleus Sceptius,</hi> theſe happ'ned to fall into rude and illiterate Hands.</p>
               <p>During <hi>Sylla</hi>'s ſtays about <hi>Athens,</hi> there fell into his Feet a lumpiſh benuming Pain, which <hi>Strabo</hi> calls, <hi>the firſt fetterring on of the Gout.</hi> Wherefore taking a Voyage to <hi>Adipſus,</hi> he made uſe of the Hot Waters there, eaſing his thoughts of Care likewiſe, and merrily paſſing away the time with Drolls. As he was walking along the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, certain Fiſhermen brought him a lovely Preſent of Fiſh. Being taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and underſtanding that they were Men of <hi>Alaeae,</hi> What, ſaid he, be there any of <hi>Alaeae</hi> ſurviving? (For having won the Field at <hi>Archomenus,</hi> in the heat of a Purſuit he had deſtroyed three Cities of <hi>Baeotia, Anthedon, Larymna,</hi> and <hi>Alaeae.</hi>) The Men knowing not what to ſay for fear, <hi>Sylla</hi> with a ſmiling Countenance bad them cheer up and return in peace, as who had brought with them no ſmall or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Interceſſors. The <hi>Alaei</hi> from hence took Courage, and embodying, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entred the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:35403:134"/>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> having march'd through <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and <hi>Mecedon,</hi> down to the Sea-coaſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with twelve hundred Veſſels to croſs over from <hi>Dyrrachium</hi> to <hi>Brundiſium.</hi> Not far from hence is <hi>Appollonia,</hi> and near it a ſpot of Ground dedicated to the <hi>Nymphes,</hi> which from among flowry Dales and Meads diſcovers here and there ſprings of Fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſtreaming out. Here, they ſay, was a Satyr, ſuch as Statuaries and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters repreſent, found ſleeping, and brought before <hi>Sylla,</hi> where he was ask'd by ſeveral Interpreters who he was, when with much ado he ſent forth a harſh unintelligible Noiſe, like the Neighing of a Horſe, and crying of a Goat, in mixt Conſort: <hi>Sylla</hi> diſmay'd at it, turned aſide in deteſtation.</p>
               <p>At the point of Tranſportation, becauſe <hi>Sylla</hi> was concerned, leaſt at the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting foot upon <hi>Italy,</hi> the Army ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve of it ſelf one by one among the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they of their own accord firſt took an Oath to ſtand firm by him, and with good-will not to injure <hi>Italy;</hi> then ſeeing him ſtraitned for a round ſumm of Money, they readily offered their aſſiſtance, and contributed each Man according to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. However <hi>Sylla</hi> would not accept of the Benevolence, but praiſing their Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and withall rowzing up their Courage, he put over (as himſelf writes) againſt fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:35403:135"/>
Commanders, with four hundred and fifty Cohorts under them.</p>
               <p>The happy ſucceſs of Affairs was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foretold him by the Divine Power; for as he was ſacrificing at his firſt landing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Tarentum,</hi> the Liver ſeemed to have on it the figure of a Crown of Laurel, with two Labels pendant. And little while before his arrival, in <hi>Campania,</hi> about the Mountain <hi>Hephaeus,</hi> two ſtately Goats were ſeen, in a Rencounter by day, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming like Men in a Battel. This Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition riſing up gradually from the ground, diſperſed ſeveral through the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, like to fancied Repreſentations in the Clouds, and ſo vaniſh'd out of ſight. Not long after, in the ſelf-ſame place, when <hi>Martius</hi> the younger, and <hi>Norbanus</hi> the Conſul attack'd him with two great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, without preſcribing the Order of Battle, or ranging his Men according to their Diviſions, by the ſway only of one common Alacrity and Tranſport of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, he overturn'd the Enemy, and ſhut up <hi>Norbanus</hi> into the City of <hi>Capua,</hi> with the loſs of ſeven thouſand of his Men. This was the reaſon, ſays he, that the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers disbanded not throughout the Towns, but ſtuck cloſe together, and deſpiſed the Enemy, though infinitely more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:35403:135"/>At <hi>Silvium</hi> (as he himſelf relates it) there met him a Servant of <hi>Pontius,</hi> an <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> ſaying, That he brought him the power of the Sword and Victory from <hi>Bellona,</hi> the Goddeſs of War; and if he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted not, that the Capitol would be burnt; which fell out on the ſame day the Man foretold it, namely on the ſixth day of the Month <hi>Quintilis,</hi> which we now call <hi>July.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, at <hi>Fidentia, Marcus Lucullus,</hi> one of <hi>Sylla's</hi> Commanders, repoſed ſuch confidence in the ſprightly forwardneſs of the Soldiers, as to dare to face fifty Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts of the Enemy, with only ſixteen of his own; but becauſe many of them were unarmed, delayed the Onſet. As he ſtood thus in gaze, conſidering with himſelf, a gentle gale of Wind bearing along with it from the neighbouring Meadows, an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Flowers, threw them in ſcatteringly among the Army; which falling about caſually, and reſting upon the Shields and Helmets, ſhew'd them to the Enemy as crown'd with Chaplets. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this being further animated, they joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Battel, and victoriouſly ſlaying eight thouſand Men, took the Camp. This <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi> was Brother to that <hi>Lucullus</hi> who in after-times conquered <hi>Mithridates</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:35403:136"/>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> ſeeing himſelf ſurrounded with ſo many Armies, and ſuch mighty Powers, had recourſe to Art, inviting <hi>Scipio</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſul to a Treaty of Peace. The Motion was willingly embrac'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followed ſeveral Meetings and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, in all which <hi>Sylla</hi> interpoſing ſtill matter of delay and new Pretences, in the mean while debauched <hi>Scipio's</hi> Men by Under-inſtruments of his own, who in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til train and all the Methods of Inveigling, were as well practiſed as the General him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For entring into the Enemies Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and intermixing, they wrought off ſome by preſent Money, ſome by Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, others by fair Words and Perſwaſions; ſo as in the end, when <hi>Sylla</hi> with twenty Cohorts drew near, they came forth to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute him, leaving <hi>Scipio</hi> behind them in his Tent, where he was found all alone and diſmiſſed. Thus <hi>Sylla</hi> having uſed twenty Cohorts as Stales, to draw in forty more Cohorts of the Enemy, led them all back into the Camp. On this occaſion <hi>Carbo</hi> was heard to ſay, <hi>That having a Fox and a Lion in the Breaſt of</hi> Sylla <hi>to deal with, he was plagued moſt with the Fox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some time after, at <hi>Signium, Marius</hi> the younger, with eighty five Cohorts, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Battel to <hi>Sylla,</hi> who was extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to have it decided on that very day;
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:35403:136"/>
for the night before he had ſeen a Viſion, which to his thoughts repreſented <hi>Marius</hi> the Elder, who had been long ſince dead, adviſing his Son <hi>Marius</hi> to beware of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day, as of fatal conſequence to him. For this reaſon <hi>Sylla,</hi> longing to come to a Battel, ſent to the Camp afar off for <hi>Dola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella.</hi> But becauſe the Enemy had beſet and lock'd up the Paſſes, his Soldiers were exceedingly tired by Skirmiſhing and Marching at once. To theſe difficulties was added moreover tempeſtuous rainy Weather, which diſtreſſed them moſt of all; wherefore the Principal Leaders came to <hi>Sylla,</hi> and beſought him to defer the day, ſhewing him withall how the Soldiers lay all along on the Ground, caſt down with Toil, and leaning upon the Target. When with much difficulty he had yielded, and given order for the ſetling of the Camp, they had no ſooner begun to caſt up a Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and draw a Ditch acroſs, but <hi>Marius</hi> came riding up furiouſly at the Head of his Troops, in hopes to have ſcattered them in that diſorder and confuſion. Here the Gods fulfilled <hi>Sylla's</hi> Dream: For the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſtirred up with anger, left off to work, and ſticking their Piles on the Bank, with drawn Swords and a couragious Shout, came to handy blows with the Enemy, who made but ſmall reſiſtance, and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:35403:137"/>
were miſerably ſlain in the Flight. <hi>Marius</hi> fled to <hi>Praeneſte,</hi> but finding the Gates ſhut, tied himſelf round by a Rope, that was thrown down to him, and was taken up on the Walls. Some there are (as <hi>Feneſtella</hi> for one) who affirm that <hi>Marius</hi> knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Fight, but over-watch'd and ſpent with hard Duty, had repoſed himſelf, when the Signal was given, beneath ſome Shade, and was hardly to be awakned at the Flight of his Men. <hi>Sylla</hi> (according to his own account) loſt only three Men in this Bruſh, having killed of the Enemy, twenty thouſand, and taken alive eight thouſand.</p>
               <p>The like Succeſs had others of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, as <hi>Pompey, Craſſus, Metellus, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilius,</hi> who with little or no loſs cut off vaſt numbers of the Enemy, inſomuch as <hi>Carbo,</hi> the prime Supporter of the Cauſe, fled by night from his Charge of the Army, and ſailed over into <hi>Libya.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the laſt Encounter, the <hi>Samnite Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinus,</hi> like to ſome Champion whoſe lot it is to enter laſt of all into the Liſt, and take up the wearied Conqueror, came nigh to have foiled and overthrown <hi>Sylla</hi> before the Gates of <hi>Rome.</hi> For <hi>Teleſinus</hi> with his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Lamponius</hi> the <hi>Lucan,</hi> having drawn together huge Levies of Men, made all haſt toward <hi>Praeneſte,</hi> to free <hi>Marius</hi> from
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:35403:137"/>
the Siege; but perceiving <hi>Sylla</hi> at the Head of him, and <hi>Pompey</hi> in the Tail, both ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king violently at him, ſtreightned thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and behind, he, as a valiant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Soldier, aroſe by night, and marching directly with his whole Army, had like to have fallen unexpectedly into <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. He lay that night before the City, ſome ten Furlongs off from the Gate <hi>Collatina,</hi> all jocund and ſwoln with further Hopes, as having already bafled ſo many eminent Commanders by Stratagem: At break of day being charged by the Noble Youth of the City, among many others, he overthrew <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> a Perſon renowned for Nobleneſs of Blood and Valour. The City, as it is eaſie to imagine, was all in an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, the Women ſhrieking and running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, as if he had been entred forcibly by Aſſault, till at laſt <hi>Balbus</hi> advanced, with ſeven hundred Horſe on full ſpeed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome ſmall halt made for rubbing and bridling again, fell into skirmiſh with the Enemy. In the mean time <hi>Sylla</hi> appeared, and commanding the formoſt to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, drew into order. <hi>Dolabella</hi> and <hi>Torquatus</hi> were extreme earneſt with him to deſiſt a while, and not with ſpent Forces to hazard the whole ſum of Affairs, having before them in the Field not <hi>Carbo</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> but two warlike Nations, bearing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:35403:138"/>
hatred to <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Samnites</hi> and <hi>Lucans</hi> to grapple with; but he put them by, and commanded the Trumpets to ſound a Charge, about four a Clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon. In this Conflict, which was the ſharpeſt as ever was, the Right-wing, where <hi>Craſſus</hi> ſtood embattelled, had clearly the advantage; the Left was overcharged, and in a declining condition, when <hi>Sylla</hi> came to its ſuccour, mounted on a white Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, full of mettle, and exceeding ſwift of foot, which two of the Enemy knowing him by, had their Lances in a readineſs to caſt; but this Gentleman giving the Horſe a touch, he was, unknown to himſelf, ſo far advanced, as that the Points falling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Horſe-tail, ſtuck in the Ground. There goes a Story, That having a golden Image of <hi>Apollo</hi> from <hi>Delphos,</hi> he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wont in the day of Battel to carry it about him in his Boſom, and that then he kiſſed it, with theſe words: O Apollo Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius, <hi>the Fortunate</hi> Cornelius Sylla, <hi>whom in ſo many Battels thou haſt raiſed to Honour and Greatneſs, wilt thou now caſt down, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him before the Gate of his Country, to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ſhamefully with his Fellow Citizens?</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had thus addreſſed himſelf to the God, ſome of his Men he intreated, ſome he threatned, and others he laid hold on, till at length the left Wing being wholly ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:35403:138"/>
he was forc'd in Company of the Rout to betake himſelf to the Camp, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt many of his Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; many likewiſe of the City-ſpectators were trod to Death. So as Common Fame gave the City for taken, and had like to have raiſed the Siege of <hi>Praeneſte;</hi> many who eſcaped by Flight poſting thither, and adviſing <hi>Lucretius Offella</hi> (who was appointed to keep on the Siege) to riſe in all haſte, for that <hi>Sylla</hi> was defeated, and <hi>Rome</hi> fallen into the Hands of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>About Midnight there came into <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Camp Meſſengers from <hi>Craſſus,</hi> to fetch Proviſion for him and his Soldiers; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vanquiſh'd the Enemy, they purſu'd him to the Walls of <hi>Antemna,</hi> and had ſat down there. <hi>Sylla</hi> hearing this, and that moſt of the Enemy were deſtroyed, came to <hi>Antemna</hi> by break of day, where three Thouſand of the Beſieged having ſent forth a Herald, he promis'd to receive them to Mercy, on condition they did the Enemy miſchief in their coming over. Truſting to his Word, they fell foul on the reſt of their Companions, and made a great Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one of another; but however <hi>Sylla</hi> gathered together in the Cirque, as well thoſe as others of the remaining party, to the number of ſeven Thouſand, and as he
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:35403:139"/>
was ſpeaking to the Senate in the Temple of <hi>Bellona,</hi> cauſeth them all to be ſlain, by Men appointed for that Service. The cry, as muſt needs be, of ſo vaſt a multitude put to the Sword, in ſo narrow a ſpace, flying abroad and ſtartling the Senators; he, as he was ſpeaking, with a ſecure unconcern'd Countenance, bad them liſten to what he had to ſay, and not buſie themſelves with what was a doing without doors; for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had ordered the Chaſtiſement of a few naughty People. This gave the moſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid of the <hi>Romans</hi> to underſtand, that they had made an exchange only of Tyrannical Government, not a change. <hi>Marius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in himſelf auſtere, altered not, but confirmed Nature by Authority; whereas <hi>Sylla</hi> behaving himſelf moderately and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently at firſt, and giving good hopes of a true Patriot, firm to the Intereſts both of the Nobility and Commonalty, being moreover of a gay pleaſant humour from his youth, and of ſuch a melting compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate diſpoſition, as to weep eaſily, has perhaps deſervedly caſt a Blemiſh upon the higher Offices of State, as if theſe put us beſide our former courſe of Life, and were occaſion of Folly, Pride, Inhumanity. This whether it be real change, and new frame of Mind, ariſing from Fortune, or rather a malicious ſly Nature, diſcovering it ſelf in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:35403:139"/>
Authority, to decide were matter of another ſort of Diſquiſition.</p>
               <p>Now that <hi>Sylla</hi> was wholly bent upon, ſlaughter, and filled the Town inceſſantly with infinite Executions, (many diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed Perſons falling a Sacrifice to private Enmity, through his permiſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to a Party) <hi>Cajus Metellus,</hi> one of the Noble Youths, made bold in the Senate to ask him, what ends was there of thoſe Evils, and where he intended to ſtop? <hi>We pray thee not</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to pardon ſuch as thou haſt reſolved to deſtroy, but to free from doubt ſuch as it hath pleaſed thee to ſave. Sylla</hi> anſwering, That he knew not as yet whom to ſpare: <hi>Why then</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>tell us whom thou wilt puniſh.</hi> This <hi>Sylla</hi> ſaid he would do. Thoſe laſt Words, as ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors would have it, were ſpoken not by <hi>Metellus,</hi> but by <hi>Offidius,</hi> one of <hi>Sylla's</hi> faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Companions. Immediately upon this, without imparting the matter to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, <hi>Sylla</hi> proſcrib'd eighty Perſons, and notwithſtanding the generality of Men ſtomach'd it, after one days reſpite he poſted two hundred and twenty more, and on the third again as many. In an Harangue to the People on this occaſion, he told them he had put up as many Names as he could think of; and thoſe who had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his memory, he ſhould hereafter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:35403:140"/>
He publiſh'd an Edict likewiſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Death the Puniſhment of Humanity, to any one who ſhould dare to receive and cheriſh an Outlaw, without exception to Brother, Son, or Parents. And to him who ſhould ſlay any one proſcribed Perſon, he ordained two Talents, as a Reward of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide, whether it were a Slave, who had beat out the Brains of his Maſter, or a Son his Fathers. But what was moſt unjuſt of all, he cauſe'd the Attainder to paſs upon their Sons, and Sons Sons, and made open ſale of the Goods of them all; nor reign'd the Proſcription only at <hi>Rome,</hi> but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Blood was ſuch, as neither the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Gods, nor Sanctuaries, nor private Houſes, eſcaped clear; Men were butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Embraces of their Wives, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the Arms of their Mothers. They who fell thus through publick hatred, or private ſpleen, were nothing in compariſon of the numbers of thoſe who ſuffer'd for their Riches. The Aſſaſſin might ſafely ſay, <hi>A fair Houſe killed this Man, a Garden that, a third his Hot Baths. Quintus Aurelius,</hi> a quiet peaceable Man, and one who thought it his Duty to bear a part in the common Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, ſo far as to condole the Misfortunes of others, coming into the <hi>Forum,</hi> and finding himſelf among thoſe who were
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:35403:140"/>
ſet up, cried out, <hi>Woe's me, my</hi> Alban, <hi>Mannor has informed againſt me.</hi> He had not gone far, before he was diſpatched by a Ruffian ſent on that Errand.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Marius</hi> on the point of being taken, killed himſelf. <hi>Sylla</hi> at his firſt coming to <hi>Praeneſte,</hi> proceeded judicially againſt each particular Perſon, till at laſt, finding it a Work of too much time, he cooped them up cloſe together in one place, to the number of two and twenty thouſand Men, and gave order for the Execution of them all, his Hoaſt only excepted; but he brave Man, ſcorning the Obligation of Life it ſelf, from the Hands of one who had been the Ruine of his Country, plung'd into the Herd, and ſubmitted willingly to the Stroke. That of <hi>Lucius Catilina</hi> was a rare Contrivance: For before Matters came to an iſſue, having made away his Brother, he beſeeched <hi>Sylla</hi> to clap him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Liſt of Outlawry, as living, and was ſo; wherefore <hi>Catiline,</hi> to return the kind Office, aſſaſſinated <hi>Marius,</hi> one of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Party, and brought the Head to <hi>Sylla,</hi> as he was ſitting in the Court of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; then going to the Holy Water of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which was nigh, waſh'd his Hands.</p>
               <p>There were other things beſide matter of Tragedy, which gave offence: for <hi>Sylla</hi> had declared himſelf Dictator, whereas
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:35403:141"/>
that Form of Government had then been laid aſide for the ſpace of one hundred and twenty years. There was likewiſe an Act of Grace paſſed on his behalf, granting Impunity for what was paſt, and for the future entruſting him with the Power of the Sword, Confiſcations, Traſplanting of Colonies, erecting and demoliſhing of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, taking away of Kingdoms, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing them at pleaſure. He managed the Sale of Conficſated Goods after ſuch an arbitrary imperious way, ſeated on a Chair of State, amidſt beautiful Women, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks, Fidlers, and ſuch like raſcally Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, on whom he ſquandred away the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of whole Countries and Cities, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſome of them Ladies in Marriage againſt their will; ſo as his Gratuities were much more intolerable than his Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Having a mind to aſſure <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great by a nearer Tie of Bloud, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to make void the Nuptial Bed, and forcing <hi>Aemilia</hi> (the Daughter of <hi>Scau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and <hi>Metella,</hi> his own Wife) from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Glabrio,</hi> he beſtowed her, great with Child, on him; but ſhe died in Labour at <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Houſe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Lucretius Offella,</hi> the ſame who reduced <hi>Marius</hi> by Siege, put in and puſh'd his Fortune hard for the Conſulſhip, he firſt forbad him; then ſeeing he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:35403:141"/>
him from coming down into the <hi>Forum,</hi> with a numerous Train of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he commanded a Centurion of the Guards out and ſlew him, himſelf ſitting on the Bench in the Temple of <hi>Caſtor,</hi> and beholding the Murder from above. The Citizens apprehending the Centurion, and dragging him to the Tribunal, he bad them ceaſe tumultuous clamouring, and let go the Centurion, for he had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>His Triumph, tho' of it ſelf exceeding ſtately, and ſet off with the unuſual Pomp, and Magnificence of Royal Spoils, was yet further illuſtrated, and drew after it a goodly Spectacle, <hi>the Exiles.</hi> For in the Reer followed the moſt eminent and moſt potent of the Citizens, Crowned with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and calling <hi>Sylla, Saviour and Father,</hi> by whoſe means they were reſtored to their own Country, and again enjoyed their Wives and Children. When the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was over, and the time come to render an Account of his Actions, in a Publick Aſſembly, he was as punctual in innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the lucky hits of War, as any of his own Military Vertues. And from his <hi>Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity</hi> it was, that he made choice to be Surnamed <hi>Felix.</hi> In his Addreſſes and Anſwers to the <hi>Graecians,</hi> he ſtyled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> or <hi>Beloved of</hi> Venus.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:35403:142"/>
His Trophies which are ſtill extant with us, bear this Inſcription, <hi>Lucius Cornelius Sylla Epaphroditus.</hi> Moreover when his Wife had brought him forth twins, he named the Male <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> and the Female <hi>Fauſta;</hi> by which words the <hi>Romans</hi> underſtand <hi>Succeſs</hi> and <hi>Good Omen.</hi> The Confidence which he repoſed in his good <hi>Genius,</hi> rather than in any Abilities of his own, embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, though deeply engaged in Blood, after ſuch great Changes and Revolutions of State, to lay down his Authority, and ſettle the Right of Conſular Elections once more on the People. So that he not only came abroad, but on the <hi>Forum</hi> expoſed his Perſon publickly to the People, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down as a private Man. And whereas, contrary to his will, a certain bold Man, and his Enemy, <hi>Marcus Lepidus,</hi> was in Election to be Conſul, not by his own Intereſt, but by the Power and Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of <hi>Pompey,</hi> who was extream gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious with the People; when the buſineſs was over, ſeeing <hi>Pompey</hi> going home over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with the Succeſs, he called him to him, and ſaid, <hi>Was it not politickly done of you, Young man to paſs by</hi> Catulus <hi>the beſt of Men, and chuſe</hi> Lepidus <hi>the worſt? Take heed, and look to thy ſelf, or the Adverſary thou haſt raiſed will be too hard for thee. Sylla</hi> ſpoke this it may ſeem by Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:35403:142"/>
for not long after <hi>Lepidus</hi> grew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, and broke into open defiance with <hi>Pompey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> conſecrating the Tenth of his whole Subſtance unto <hi>Hercules,</hi> entertain'd the People with ſumptuous Feaſtings. The Proviſion was ſo much above what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as that they were forced daily to throw great quantities of it into the River, and drank Wine forty years old and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. In the midſt of the Jollity, which laſted many days, <hi>Metella</hi> died of a Diſeaſe. Now becauſe that the Prieſt forbad him to viſit the Sick, or ſuffer his Houſe to be polluted with Mourning, he ſent her a Bill of Divorce, and cauſed her to be removed into another Houſe, whilſt alive; in this he obſerved the Law to a Tittle, out of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Superſtition; but as for the Retrenching Act which himſelf made, himſelf break it, ſparing for no Funeral Coſt. He trangreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed likewiſe for his own Sumptuary Laws, thinking to allay his Grief by exceſſive Drinking and Revelling.</p>
               <p>Some few Months after, at a Prize of Gladiators, when Men and Women ſat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly in the Theatre, no diſtinct Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being as yet appointed, there ſat by <hi>Sylla</hi> a beautiful Lady of high Birth, by name <hi>Valeria,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Meſſala,</hi> and Siſter to <hi>Hortenſius</hi> the Orator. Now it
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:35403:143"/>
hapned that ſhe had been lately divorced from her Husband. The ſame came gently behind <hi>Sylla,</hi> and putting out her Hand, plucked a lock of his Garment, and then paſſed on to her Seat again. <hi>Sylla</hi> looking on and wondring what it ſhould mean; <hi>No harm, Mighty Sir,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>for that I alſo was deſirous to partake a little of your Felicity.</hi> It appeared ſtraight that <hi>Sylla</hi> was well pleaſed, and even tickled with the Fancy; for the ſent to enquire her Name, her Quality, and Behaviour of Life. From this time there paſſed between them many an amorous Glance, both of them at once oftentimes turning one on another, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanging Smiles. In the end Overtures were made, and a Match concluded on. All which was innocent perhaps on the Ladies ſides; but though the Lady was never ſo modeſt and Vertuous, it was no ſuch modeſt and ſeemly beginning of Love in <hi>Sylla,</hi> to take fire, as became Youth rather, at a Face, and buxom Humour, thoſe common Incentives to the moſt diſorderly and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Paſſions.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this Marriage, he kept company with Actors, Actreſſes, and Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels, drinking with them night and day. His chief Favourites were, <hi>Roſcius</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median, <hi>Sorex</hi> the Arch-Mimick, and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trobius</hi> the Woman Actor, for whom,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:35403:143"/>
though paſt his Prime, he ever retained a profeſt Kindneſs. He fell by theſe Courſes into a Diſeaſe, which grew ſo leaſurely upon him, as of a long time he perceived not his Bowels to feſter, till at length the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Fleſh broke all out into Lice. Many being employed Day and Night in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, the Work ſo multiplied under their hands, as not only his Cloaths, Baths, Baſons, but his very Meat was polluted with that Flux and Contagion, they came ſwarming out in ſuch numbers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went often by day into the Waters, to ſcowr and cleanſe his Body, but all in vain; the Courſe returned ſo quick, and with ſuch numerous Supplies, as overcame all manner of Riddance. There died of the Lowſie Diſeaſe, amongſt thoſe of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent note, <hi>Acaſtus</hi> the Son of <hi>Pelias;</hi> of later date, <hi>Alcman</hi> the Poet, <hi>Pherecides</hi> the Theologe, <hi>Calliſthenes</hi> the <hi>Olyntian</hi> in the time of his Impriſonment, as alſo <hi>Mutius</hi> the Lawyer; and if it be fit to bring in Men of infamous Memory, <hi>Eunus</hi> the Fugitive, who ſtirred up the Slaves of <hi>Sicily</hi> to rebel againſt their Maſters; after that, he was brought Captive to <hi>Rome,</hi> died of this creeping Sickneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> not only foreſaw his End, but alſo writ ſomewhat concerning it; for in the two and twentieth Book of his Memoirs,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:35403:144"/>
which he finiſhed ſome two days before his death, he writes, That the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told him, That after he had led a Life of Honour, he ſhould conclude the laſt Act in fulneſs of Proſperity. He declares moreover, That in a Viſion he had ſeen his Son, who had departed not long before <hi>Metella,</hi> to ſtand by in mournful Weeds, and beſeech his Father to caſt off further care, and come along with him to his Mother <hi>Metella,</hi> there to live at eaſe and quietneſs with her. However, he could not refrain intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Publick Affairs; for ten days before his deceaſe, he compoſed the Differences of the <hi>Puteolaxians,</hi> and preſcribed Laws for their better Government; and the very day before his End, it being told him that <hi>Cranius</hi> a Man in Authority, deferred the Payment of a Publick Debt, in expectation of his Death, he ſent for the Man to his Houſe, and calling his Servants about him, cauſed him to be ſtrangled; but through the ſtraining of his Voice and Body, the Impoſthume breaking, he caſt forth a great quantity of Bloud. Upon this his ſtrength failing him, after a troubleſome Night he died, leaving behind him two young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by <hi>Metella. Valeria</hi> was afterwards delivered of a Daughter, named <hi>Poſthuma;</hi> for ſo the <hi>Romans</hi> call thoſe who be born after the Fathers Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:35403:144"/>Many ran tumultuouſly together, and join'd with <hi>Lepidus,</hi> to deprive the Corps of the accuſtomed Solemnities; but <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> though offended at <hi>Sylla,</hi> (for he alone of all his Friends was left out of his Will) having kept off ſome by his Intereſt and Intreaty, others by Menaees, gave it a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and honourable Burial. It's ſaid, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies threw on ſuch vaſt heaps of Spices, as beſide what was brought in one hundred and ten Veſſels, ſufficed to raiſe a large Statue for <hi>Sylla,</hi> and another for his Lictor, out of the precious Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and Cinnamon. The day being Cloudy over head, they deferred carrying forth the Corps till about three in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, expecting it ſhould rain, but a ſtrong Wind blowing full againſt the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pile, and ſetting it all on a bright Flame, his Body was conſumed in a moment. As the Pile ſhrunk down and the Fire was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on expiring the Clouds ſhowr'd down, and continued raining till Night; ſo as his good Fortune was firm even to the laſt, and did as it were officiate at his Funeral. His Monument ſtands on <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> with an Epitaph of his own Writing. The Subſtance this, <hi>That neither Friend nor Foe had out-done him, either in good or bad turns.</hi>

               <head>The Compariſon of <hi>Lyſander</hi> with <hi>Sylla.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving in like manner run through this Life, come we now to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. That which was common to them both, was, that they were Founders of their own Greatneſs, with this difference, that <hi>Lyſander</hi> had the Conſent of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, in Times of right underſtanding, for the Honours he received; nor forc'd he any thing againſt their good will, or ſought to raiſe himſelf above the Laws; whereas, <hi>In Civil Broils the Slave himſelf gets Honour;</hi> as then at <hi>Rome,</hi> when the People were diſtempered, and the Government out of order, one or other was ſtill a getting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt; no wonder then if <hi>Sylla</hi> reign'd, when the <hi>Glauciae</hi> and <hi>Saturnini</hi> drove out the <hi>Metelli,</hi> when Sons of Conſuls were ſlain in the Aſſemblies, when others for Silver and Gold bought Men and Arms, and with Fire and Sword ſet up new Laws, in ſpite of all Lawful oppoſition; nor do I blame any one in ſuch Circumſtances, for working himſelf into Supream Power; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I would not have it thought a ſign of Sovereign Goodneſs, to be Head of a State ſo wretchedly diſcompoſed. But <hi>Lyſander</hi> being employed in the greateſt Commands
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:35403:145"/>
and Affairs of State, by a ſober and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplin'd City, was ever eſteemed the beſt and moſt Vertuous Man, in the beſt and moſt vertuous Commonwealth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Lyſander</hi> often returning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the hands of the Citizens, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it again as often; for the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his Vertues ever held the firſt place. <hi>Sylla</hi> on the other hand, when he had once made himſelf of the Army, kept up his Command for ten years together, creating himſelf ſometimes Conſul, ſometimes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul, and ſometimes Dictator, but was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Tyrant. It's true, <hi>Lyſander</hi> (as was ſaid) deſigned to introduce a new Form of Government, after a milder faſhion however, and more agreeable to Juſtice, than <hi>Sylla;</hi> not by force of Arms, but Perſwaſion; nor by ſubverting the whole State at once, but by more orderly direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Succeſſion of Kings. And by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſeems juſt, that the moſt deſerving ſhould rule, eſpecially in a City which it ſelf got the leading hand of <hi>Greece,</hi> upon the account of Vertue not Nobility. For as the Hunter conſiders the Whelp it ſelf, not the Bitch; and the Horſe-courſer the Foal, not the Mare, (for what if the Foal ſhould prove a Mule?) ſo likewiſe were that Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician extreamly out, who in the Choice of a Chief Magiſtrate ſhould enquire, not
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:35403:146"/>
what the Man is, but how deſcended. The very <hi>Spartans</hi> themſelves have depoſed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of their Kings, for want of Kingly Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as degenerated and good for nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A depraved Nature, though of an ancient Stock, is diſhonourable; whereas Vertue without Birth is honourable. Moreover, the one was injurious to many, upon the ſcore of his Friends; the other to his very Friends. It's confeſſed on all hands, that <hi>Lyſander</hi> offended moſt commonly for the ſake of his Companions, committing ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Slaughters to uphold their Power and Dominion; but as for <hi>Sylla,</hi> he out of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy would have diſcarded <hi>Pompey</hi> from Commanding by Land, and <hi>Dolabella</hi> by Sea, although himſelf had given them thoſe Places; he ordered <hi>Lucretius Offella,</hi> who ſued for the Conſulſhip, upon divers meritorious accounts, to be ſlain before his Eyes, raiſing thereby ſtrange Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Jealouſies in the Minds of all Men, for his Cruelty to his Deareſt Friends.</p>
               <p>The Buſineſs of Riches and Pleaſure do's further yet demonſtrate in one a Princely, in the other a Tyrannical Diſpoſition. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> did nothing that was intemperate or extravagant, in that full range of Power and Licence, but kept aloof as much as ever Man did, from that trite
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:35403:146"/>
Saying, <hi>Lion within, but Fox without,</hi> he ever maintained ſuch a ſober, Laconick, well tempered Converſation; whereas <hi>Sylla</hi> could never break his unruly Affections, either by Poverty, when young, or by a long run of Years, when grown old; but would be ſtill preſcribing of Laws to the Citizens, concerning Chaſtity and Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, himſelf living all that time (as <hi>Saluſt</hi> affirms) in open Lewdneſs and Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. By theſe ways he had ſo impoveriſhed and drained the City of her Treaſures, as to be forced to ſell her Liberties and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities to the aſſociated and well-affected Cities for Silver, although he had daily expoſed the wealthieſt and greateſt Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to publick Sale and Out-cry. There was no end of his Favours vainly ſpent and thrown away on Flatterers; for what mean, what likelihood of Parſimony in his more intimate Converſation, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments over Wine, when in the open face of the People, upon Auction of a large Eſtate, which he would have paſſed over to one of his Friends at a ſmall Price, becauſe another bidding higher, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer had made Proclamation of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, he broke out into a Paſſion, ſaying, <hi>What a ſtrange unjuſt thing is this, O Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, that I cannot diſpoſe of my own Booty as I pleaſe?</hi> But <hi>Lyſander,</hi> on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:35403:147"/>
with the reſt of the Spoil, ſent even the Preſents which were made him to the Citizens. Nor do I commend him for it, (for he perhaps by exceſſive Liberality did <hi>Sparta</hi> more harm, than ever the other did <hi>Rome</hi> by Rapine) only I make it an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his Contempt of Riches. They had a ſtrange peculiar influence each Man on his own City. <hi>Sylla,</hi> a profuſe Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee, brought in Sobriety however a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Citizens: <hi>Lyſander</hi> agen, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate as he was, filled the Town with Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury: So as they both were blame-worthy, the one for raiſing himſelf above his own Laws; the other for cauſing his Citizens to fall beneath his own Example, in that he taught <hi>Sparta</hi> to want thoſe things, which himſelf had learnt not to want. And thus much of their Civil Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>As for Feats of Arms, wiſe Conduct, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Victories, perillous Adventures, <hi>Sylla</hi> was beyond compare. <hi>Lyſander</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed came off twice victorious at two Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fights; I ſhall add to that the Siege of <hi>Athens,</hi> a Work of greater Fame than Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. For all this, the Buſineſs of <hi>Aliar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in <hi>Baeotia,</hi> altho perhaps it came about by ill Fortune, bears yet the ſemblance of ill Advice, when out of Ambition and Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs to fight, without further attending
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:35403:147"/>
the Kings Forces, which were then almoſt at hand from <hi>Plataeae,</hi> he unſeaſonbly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Walls, and was miſerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by a Sally of inconſiderable Men; he received his Death-wound, not as <hi>Cleom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotas</hi> at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> reſiſting manfully the impreſſion of a juſt Enemy; not as <hi>Cyrus</hi> or <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> preſſing hard on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Battel, and making ſure the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; who all of them died the Death of Kings and Generals: But he, like ſome Common Soldier, or one of the Forlorn Hope, caſt away his Life ingloriouſly, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving teſtimony to the ancient <hi>Spartans,</hi> that they did well to avoid ſtorming of Walls, in which the ſtouteſt Man may chance to fall by the Hand not only of an abject Fellow, but by that of a Boy or Woman, as they ſay, <hi>Achilles</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Paris</hi> in the Gates. As for <hi>Sylla,</hi> it was ſomewhat hard to reckon up how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſet Battels he won, or how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands he ſlew: He took <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf twice, and forc'd the <hi>Pyraean</hi> Haven, not by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, as <hi>Lyſander</hi> did, but by ſeveral ſharp Encounters, driving out <hi>Archelaus</hi> from Land to Sea. And what moſt importeth, there was a vaſt difference between the Commanders they they had to deal with; for I look upon it as an eaſie Task, or rather Sport, that ſame Overthrow of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:35403:148"/>
                  <hi>Antiochus, Alcibiades</hi> his Pilot, as likewiſe the Circumventing of <hi>Philocles</hi> the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Orator, <hi>Sharp only at inglorious point of Tongue:</hi> both whom <hi>Mithridates</hi> would have ſcorned to compare with the Maſter of his Horſe, or <hi>Marius</hi> with his Lictor. But of all the Grandees, Conſuls, Commanders, and Daemagogues, to paſs by others who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves to <hi>Sylla;</hi> who amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> ſo formidable as <hi>Marius?</hi> What King more powerfull than <hi>Mithridates?</hi> Who of the <hi>Italians</hi> ſturdier than <hi>Lamponius</hi> and <hi>Teleſinus?</hi> Yet of theſe, one he drove into Baniſhment, one he quelled, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he ſlew. Now the greateſt of all, which has been as yet related, in my judgment, was, That <hi>Lyſander</hi> had the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the State in all his Archieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; whereas <hi>Sylla,</hi> beſides that he was a Baniſh'd Perſon, and ſorely overcharged by a Faction, at what time his Wife was driven from home, his Houſes demoliſhed, and Adherents ſlain, himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then in <hi>Baeotia</hi> ſtood Embattelled againſt infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Enemy, and adventuring all for the ſake of his Country, erected a Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie: Nor, when <hi>Mithridates</hi> came with Propoſals of Alliance and Aid againſt his Enemies, would he ſhew any the leaſt Compliance, or ſo much as Civil Reſpect, either by greeting or vouchſafing him his
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:35403:148"/>
Hand, till ſuch time that he had it from the Kings own Mouth, that he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to quit <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſurrender the Navy, and reſtore <hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia</hi> to the two Kings; than which Action, <hi>Sylla</hi> never performed a braver, or with a Nobler Courage, when preferring the Publick Good to the Private, and, like a generous Dog, where he had once fix'd, never let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting go his hold, till he had conquered the Enemy, he then ſet himſelf to revenge his own private Quarrels. We may perhaps make a better eſtimate of their Manners, by weighing both their <hi>Athenian</hi> Actions in the Ballance. <hi>Sylla,</hi> when he had made himſelf Maſter of that City, which had upheld the Dominion and Power of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> in oppoſition to him reſtored her to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. and the free Exerciſe of her own Laws. <hi>Lyſander,</hi> on the contrary, when ſhe had fell from ſuch a vaſt height of Dignity and Rule, unmercifully took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Democracy, impoſing on her the moſt Cruel and Lawleſs Tyrants. It's now time to conſider, whether we ſhould ſwerve from the Truth or no, by declaring, that <hi>Sylla</hi> performed the more Glorious Deeds, but <hi>Lyſander</hi> committed the fewer Faults; as likewiſe by giving to one the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence for Moderation and Abſtinence, to the other for Conduct and Valour.</p>

               <p>There was left one Orphan of this Houſe, called <hi>Damon,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Peripoltas,</hi> for Beauty and greatneſs of Spirit ſurpaſſing all of his Age; but of Temper fierce and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable. A <hi>Roman</hi> Captain of a Foot-Company that Wintered in <hi>Chaeronea,</hi> fell in love with this Youth; but ſince he could not obtain his infamous Deſires, either by Gifts or Entreaties, 'twas much feared that he would proceed to Violence. The Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion was made more probable by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Chaeronea,</hi> which was then ſo weak, that it had not power either to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Attempt, or puniſh the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Crime. Of which <hi>Damon</hi> being ſenſible, and looking upon his Sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Injuries, reſolved to be revenged of him: Accordingly he and ſixteen of his Companions, conſpired againſt the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but that the Deſign might be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged without any danger of being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, they all daubed their Faces with Soot. Thus diſguiſed, and inflamed with Wine, they ſet upon him by break of day, as he was ſacrificing; and having killed him, and not a few of thoſe that were with them, they fled out of the City;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:35403:151"/>
which was extreamly alarmed and troubled at the Murder: The Council Aſſembled immediately, and pronounced Sentence of Death againſt <hi>Damon</hi> and all his Accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This they did to juſtifie the City to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But, that evening, as the Magiſtrates were at Supper together, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Cuſtom, <hi>Damon</hi> and his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates breaking into the Room, killed them all, and then again fled out of the Town. About this time, <hi>Lucius Lucullus</hi> paſſing that way with his Forces upon ſome Expedition, and this diſaſter having but newly hapned, he ſtaid to examine the matter. Upon enquiry he found the City was in no wiſe faulty, but rather that they themſelves had ſuffered; therefore he drew out the Soldiers, and carried them away with him. Yet <hi>Damon</hi> continuing to ravage the Country all about, the Citizens by Meſſages, and Decrees in appearance favourable, enticed him into the City, and upon his return made him <hi>Gymnaſiarque;</hi> but afterward as he was ſuppling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with Oyl in the <hi>Baigno,</hi> they ſet upon him and kill'd him. For a long while after Apparitions being ſeen, and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Groans heard in that place, (as our Fathers have told us,) they ordered the Gates of the <hi>Baigno</hi> to be made up: and even to this day thoſe who dwell about
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:35403:151"/>
that place affirm that they ſometimes ſee Spectres, and hear terrible Voices. The poſterity of <hi>Damon</hi> (of which ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Country of <hi>Phocide,</hi> near the City <hi>Stiris,</hi> living after the manner of the <hi>Aeolians</hi>) are called <hi>Asbolomenoi,</hi> that is, Men dawbed with Soot. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with that <hi>Damon</hi> was beſmeared when he committed this Murther.</p>
               <p>But there being a Quarrel betwixt thoſe of <hi>Chaeronea</hi> and the <hi>Orchomeniens,</hi> who bordered upon them; they hired an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, a <hi>Roman,</hi> to excuſe the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Chaeronea,</hi> as if it had been a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſon, of the Murther of the <hi>Romans,</hi> of which only <hi>Damon</hi> and his Ruffians were guilty; accordingly the proceſs was formed, and the cauſe pleaded before the <hi>Petor</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> for as yet, the <hi>Romans</hi> had not ſent Governours into <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Advocates who defended the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, appealed to the Teſtimony of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus,</hi> who in anſwer to a Letter the <hi>Pretor</hi> writ to him, returned a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the matter of Fact. By this means the Town gain'd their Cauſe, which otherwiſe they were in great danger of loſing. The Citizens thus preſerved, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a Statue to <hi>Lucullus</hi> in the <hi>Forum,</hi> next to that of the God <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:35403:152"/>We alſo have the ſame Impreſſions of Gratitude; and tho removed from them by the diſtance of ſo many Ages, yet we think our ſelves obliged by that Act. And as to draw the Genius and Noble Inclinations of a great Perſonage, is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſo more valuable, than to hit the Lines of his Face; we will put <hi>Lucullus</hi> his Life amongſt our Parallels of Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men. Wherein we will not uſe one ſtroke of Flattery, but keep cloſe to the Truth. It is ſufficient we ſhew how we preſerve a grateful Remembrance of his generous Kindneſs; and he himſelf would not expect, that in recompence of that Service, which conſiſted in ſpeaking the Truth, we ſhould abuſe his Memory with a falſe and counterfeit Narration. For as we would, that a Painter who is to draw a beautifull Face, in which there is yet ſome Imperfection, ſhould neither wholly leave out, nor entirely expreſs what is defective, becauſe this would deform it, and that ſpoil the Reſemblance; ſo ſince it is very hard, nay almoſt impoſſible, to ſhew the Life of a Man wholly free from Blemiſh, let us in the ſame manner follow Truth: But if any Lapſes occur, which have been occaſioned by the Emotions of a ſudden Paſſion, or the neceſſity of the Times, let us look upon them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:35403:152"/>
as Defects of Vertue, than as Vices; let us carry the Pencil gently over them, out of reſpect to Humane Nature, which never furniſhed any Man with ſo many good Inclinations to Vertue, but that there was ſomewhat ſtill wanting which rendred him Imperfect. Conſidering with my ſelf to whom I ſhould compare <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus,</hi> I find none ſo exactly his Parrallel as <hi>Cimon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were both valiant in War, and ſucceſsful againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> but affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and courteous to their Fellow-Citizens: Both extinguiſhed the Civil Broils at home, and gained ſignal Victories abroad. In ſhort, no <hi>Greek</hi> before <hi>Cimon,</hi> nor <hi>Roman</hi> before <hi>Lucullus,</hi> ever carried the Scene of War ſo far from their own Country, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we except the Exploits of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Perſeus</hi> againſt the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians, Medes,</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> and the Acts of <hi>Jaſon,</hi> (if of theſe any Monuments that deſerve Credit are derived down to our days.) Moreover in this they were alike, that they finiſhed not the Enterpriſes they undertook: They brought their Enemies near their Ruin, but never entirely defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. There was yet a greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in their Nature, for the Civility and generous Reception they ſhewed to all Strangers, and the ſplended Proviſions of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:35403:153"/>
their Tables. But we will omit thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good qualities, in which they were alike, for 'twill be eaſie to obſerve them in the following Relation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cimon</hi> was the Son of <hi>Miltiades</hi> and <hi>Hegeſipyle,</hi> who was by Birth a <hi>Thracian,</hi> and Daughter to the King <hi>Olorus;</hi> this appears from the Poems of <hi>Melanthius</hi> and <hi>Archelaus,</hi> which they both write in praiſe of <hi>Cimon.</hi> By this means the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian <hi>Thucidides</hi> was his Kinſman by the Mother's ſide; for his Father's name alſo was <hi>Olorus,</hi> and poſſeſſed Mines of Gold in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and was killed in <hi>Scap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tahyla,</hi> a Diſtrict of <hi>Thrace,</hi> ſo called from its being full of Ditches. His bones were afterward brought into <hi>Attica,</hi> and his Monument is ſhown amongſt thoſe of the Houſe of <hi>Cimon,</hi> near the Tomb of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinice Cimon</hi>'s Siſter. But <hi>Thucidides</hi> was of the Tribe of <hi>Alimus,</hi> and <hi>Miltiades</hi> of that of <hi>Lacia. Miltiades</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in a Fine of fifty Talents to the State, and unable to pay it, was caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Priſon, and there died. Thus <hi>Cimon</hi> was left an Orphan very young, with his Siſter <hi>Elpinice,</hi> who was alſo young and unmarried. At firſt he had no Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being looked upon Riotous, and one who lived a diſſolute Life, as in reality he did, therefore they ſaid, there was
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:35403:153"/>
an Agreement of Temper, as well as Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, betwixt him and his Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe name was <hi>Cimon</hi> too; but they Proverbially called him, for his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, <hi>Coalemos</hi> (the Ideot) <hi>Steſimbrotus</hi> of <hi>Thaſſus,</hi> who lived near about the ſame time with <hi>Cimon,</hi> reports of him; that he had little docility; that they could never teach him Muſick, nor the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of any other Science, which were ſo eaſily learned by the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Athens:</hi> That he wanted a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity of Parts requiſite for Converſation, was ungentile in his Carriage; neither had he any Capacity to manage ſerious Affairs: However, that there appeared in him ſomething that was great; and that he had ſuch a plain openneſs of Humour, that you would have taken him, rather for a Native of <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> than <hi>Athens.</hi> He being ſuch an one, as <hi>Euripides</hi> deſcribes <hi>Hercules.</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Accompliſhment of Carriage he did want,</l>
                  <l>But he was honeſt, tho not Elegant.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>For this Character may well agree with that which <hi>Steſimbrotus</hi> had given of him. They accuſed him in his younger years, that he inceſtuouſly careſſed his own Siſter <hi>Elpinice,</hi> who otherwiſe had no very great
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:35403:154"/>
Reputation for Chaſtity: However, if her Brother was not her Gallant, 'twas reported that <hi>Polynotus</hi> was. For when he painted the <hi>Trojan</hi> Dames in the Porch, then called <hi>Pleſinaction,</hi> now <hi>Paecile,</hi> he drew <hi>Laodice</hi> by her Face. He was not an ordinary <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick,</hi> to be payed for his Work: But ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying all ways to pleaſe tho <hi>Athenians,</hi> he beſtowed it freely on the Publick. This all the Hiſtorians report of him; and the Poet <hi>Malanthius</hi> particularly in theſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>This famous Painter at his own Expence,</l>
                  <l>Gave <hi>Athens</hi> Beauty and Magnificence:</l>
                  <l>New Life to all the <hi>Heroes</hi> did impart;</l>
                  <l>Embelliſh'd all the Temples with his Art:</l>
                  <l>The Splendour of the State reſtor'd again:</l>
                  <l>And ſo he did oblige both Gods and Men.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Some do affirm that <hi>Elpinice</hi> did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble her Familiarities with her Brother: But lived publickly with him, as if ſhe had been his Wife: For though ſhe was no Fortune, yet he could meet with none, that was an equal Match for her, by reaſon of the Quality of her Birth. But afterward, when <hi>Callias,</hi> one of the richeſt Men of <hi>Athens</hi> fell in Love with her and proffered to pay the Mulct the Father was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, if he could obtain the Daughter in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:35403:154"/>
Marriage: <hi>Cimon</hi> accepted the Condition, and betrothed her to <hi>Callias.</hi> There is no doubt to be made, but that <hi>Cimon</hi> was of an amorous Complexion. For <hi>Melanthius</hi> gives him hints of his Tendency that way, when in his Eulogies he facetiouſly rallies him for his Miſtreſſes: The one was called <hi>Mneſtra,</hi> and the other was <hi>Ariſteria</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamis;</hi> and theſe the Poet ſaith, he was very fond of. However this is certain, that he loved his Wife <hi>Iſodice</hi> very paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately; ſhe was the Daughter of <hi>Euryptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> the Son of <hi>Megacles.</hi> Her death he regretted even to impatience, as appears by thoſe Elegies of Condolance, addreſſed to him upon his loſs of Her. The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Panaetius</hi> is of Opinion, that <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> was the Author of thoſe Elegies; and indeed the time ſeems to favour that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. But take <hi>Cimon</hi> in all his other Capacities, you ſhall find nothing in him that is juſtly blameable, but rather all the Cuſtoms of his Life were very good. For as he was as daring as <hi>Miltiades,</hi> and not at all inferiour to <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> for Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo he was incomparably more juſt and honeſt then either of them. As he was equal to them in underſtanding, and in diſcharging all the Functions of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; ſo for the Political part of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he excelled them and every
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:35403:155"/>
one elſe: And this too when he was very young, his years not yet confirmed by any experience. For when <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> upon the <hi>Medes</hi> threatning them with an Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, adviſed the <hi>Athenians</hi> to forſake their Town and the Country about it, and to carry all their Arms on Ship board, and in the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Salamis</hi> diſpute the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Sea with their Enemies, When all the World ſtood amazed at the Confidence and Raſhneſs of this advice; <hi>Cimon</hi> only was not at all ſurpriſed, but chearfully paſſed through the Street of <hi>Cera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micon,</hi> accompanied with other young Men, toward the Caſtle, carrying a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in his hand to offer to the Goddeſs <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva;</hi> by this intimating, that there was no more need of Horſemen now, but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners. Thus after he had paid his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Goddeſs, and offer'd up the Bridle, he took down the Bucklers that hung upon the Walls of the Temple, and ſo went down to the Port. By this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample he encouraged the Citizens to follow him in order to their Embarking. Beſides, he was an handſome Perſon, of a juſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his Hair thick and curled. After he had acquitted himſelf gallantly in this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Salamis,</hi> he obtained a great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the <hi>Athenians;</hi> and they not only admired his Actions, but loved his
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:35403:155"/>
Perſon. So that they were continually, enflaming him with Emulation, to perform Deeds as Famous as that of <hi>Marathon;</hi> that entertaining great Conceptions of things, he might act ſutably thereunto. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were very glad, when they ſaw him applying himſelf to matters of State; for they were diſguſted with <hi>Themiſtocles:</hi> In oppoſition to whom, and becauſe of the Candor and Freeneſs of <hi>Cymon</hi>'s Temper, which was agreeable to every one, they advanced him to the higheſt Employments in the Government. The man that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed moſt to his Promotions was <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides,</hi> who ſtill cultivated that honeſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius he ſaw in him: And purpoſely raiſed him, that he might be a Counterpoiſe to the Craft, and repreſs the inſolence of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles.</hi> But when the <hi>Medes</hi> were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of <hi>Greece, Cimon</hi> being Admiral, though the <hi>Athenians</hi> had not yet attained the Chief Dominion, but ſtill followed <hi>Pauſanias</hi> and the <hi>Lacedaemonians;</hi> he kept his Citizens in Heart, and by the Goodneſs of their Order and Equipage, but chiefly by their Valour, they were diſtinguiſhed from the reſt. Beſides he perceiving, that <hi>Pauſanias</hi> managed an intelligence with the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to betray <hi>Greece</hi> to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and puft up with Arrogance and Succeſs, treated his Allies haughtily,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:35403:156"/>
and committed Inſolencies upon them; <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> taking this advantage, robbed him of the Eſteem and Command of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> before he was aware. This he did not by open Enmity, but by affable Diſcourſe and the Obligingneſs of his Converſation. So that the <hi>Allies</hi> no longer able to endure the Sourneſs and Pride of <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> revolted all from him to <hi>Cimon</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides:</hi> Who, having gain'd ſuch a Party from him, writ to the <hi>Ephori</hi> of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and ſent particular Meſſengers to complain of him, deſiring them to recall a Man who was a diſhonour to <hi>Sparta,</hi> and a trouble to <hi>Greece.</hi> They report of <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> that when he was in <hi>Byſantium,</hi> he ſollicited a young Lady of a noble Family in the City, whoſe name was <hi>Cleonice,</hi> to debauch her: Her Parents dreading the cruel Humour of the Man, were forced to conſent, and ſo abandon'd their Daughter to his Embraces. <hi>Cleonice</hi> commanded the Servants to put out all the Lights; So that approaching ſilently, and in the dark towards his Bed, ſhe ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled upon the Lamp, which ſhe overturned and ſpilled: <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> who was fallen aſleep, awaked, and ſtartled with the noiſe, thought an aſſaſſin had taken that dead time of the Night to murder him; ſo that haſtily ſnatching up his Poinard that lay by him, he wounded his ſuppoſed Enemy to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:35403:156"/>
Death. After this he never enjoyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but was diſturbed in his Thoughts. For his Dear Miſtreſs haunted his Bed, and would not let him Sleep, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted his repoſe with theſe Angry Words.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Villain, be juſt at laſt, and ſo repent;</l>
                  <l>Or ſee the hand that brings thy Puniſhment.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>This Tragical Accident gave the laſt ſtroke to his Ruin. For after this the Allies joyning their Reſentments and Forces with <hi>Cimon</hi>'s, beſieged him in <hi>Byzantium:</hi> but he eſcaped out of their Hands, and fled to <hi>Heraclea.</hi> Here coming to a place which might be called the Oracle of the Dead, where they raiſe up Spirits to know future Events, he ſolemnly invoked <hi>Cleonice,</hi> and intreated her Ghoſt to be reconciled: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſhe appeared to him, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him in theſe Words. <q>As ſoon as thou comeſt to <hi>Sparta</hi> thou ſhalt be freed from all the Misfortunes which now afflict thee.</q> Hereby obſcurely foretelling (in my opinion) that imminent Death he was to ſuffer. This is the Story that is told of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cimon</hi> ſtrengthned with this acceſſion of the Allies, went General into <hi>Thrace:</hi> For he was told that ſome great Men among
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:35403:157"/>
the <hi>Perſians,</hi> of the Kings Kindred, having poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Eione,</hi> a City ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated upon the River <hi>Strymon,</hi> infeſted the <hi>Greeks</hi> which confin'd upon them: Firſt, he defeated theſe <hi>Perſians,</hi> and ſhut them up within the Walls of their Town. Then he fell upon the <hi>Thracians</hi> themſelves, who were Borderers, becauſe they ſupply'd thoſe of <hi>Eione</hi> with Victuals; he drove them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely out of the Country, and took poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it as Conqueror: By this means he reduced the Beſieged to ſuch ſtraights, that <hi>Butes,</hi> who Commanded there for the King, in a deſperate reſolution ſet fire to the Town, and burned himſelf, his Goods, and all his Relations, in one common Flame. By this means <hi>Cimon</hi> got the Town, but no great Booty; for theſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> not only conſumed themſelves in the Fire, but the richeſt of their Movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. However, the Country about it he gave the <hi>Athenians,</hi> which was a pleaſant and fruitful Soil. For this Action the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple permitted him to erect Stone <hi>Mercuries;</hi> upon the Firſt of which was this Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  <l>From <hi>Athens,</hi> by whoſe Hands his Foes lay dead;</l>
                  <l>And as old <hi>Homer</hi> doth report the ſame,</l>
                  <l>All <hi>Troy</hi> did tremble at this Warriour's Name.</l>
                  <l>Then no one juſtly ought for to admire</l>
                  <l>That <hi>Athens</hi> to this Honour doth aſpire:</l>
                  <l>None are ſo Wiſe and Valiant as They,</l>
                  <l>As Chiefs to Lead, as Soldiers to Obey.</l>

               <p>Tho' the Name of <hi>Cimon</hi> is not mention'd in theſe Inſcriptions, yet his Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do aſſert them wholly as erected to his Honour; and being ſo, it was a peculiar one to him. For <hi>Miltiades</hi> and <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> could never obtain the like. And when <hi>Miltiades</hi> deſired a Crown of Olive, one <hi>Sochares,</hi> who was of the Tribe of <hi>Decelia,</hi> ſtood up in the midſt of the Aſſembly, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:35403:158"/>
ſpoke theſe words, which being agreeable to the Populace, were applauded by them, tho unjuſt, and very ungratefully ſpoken. <hi>When thou ſhall conquer alone,</hi> (Miltiades) <hi>thou ſhall triumph ſo too.</hi> What then induced them ſo particularly to honor <hi>Cimon?</hi> it was certainly this, that under other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders they ſtood upon the defenſive; but by his Conduct, they not only repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Enemies; but invaded them in their own Country.</p>
               <p>Thus they became Maſters of <hi>Eione</hi> and <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> where they planted Colonies: and afterwards took the Iſle of <hi>Scyros,</hi> which <hi>Cimon</hi> gained after this manner. The <hi>Dolopians</hi> were the Inhabitants of this Iſle, a People of a ſlothful diſpoſition, and who neglected all Husbandry, their only courſe of life was Piracy; this they practiſed to that degree of miſchief, that they rifled thoſe that brought Merchandiſe into their own Ports, and ſo violated all the Laws of Commerce. Some Merchants of <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> they not only ſpoil'd of their goods, but confined their Perſons. Who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards breaking out of Priſon, went and demanded juſtice of the <hi>Amphictyons,</hi> which is a general Aſſembly made up of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Greece.</hi> Theſe, maturely weighing the fact, condemned the Iſle in a great Pecuniary Mulct: but the People that
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:35403:158"/>
were enriched with the Plunder, began to apprehend that 'twas they particularly that muſt refund; therefore they writ to <hi>Cimon</hi> to ſuccour them with his Fleet, and they declared themſelves ready to deliver the Town into his hands. <hi>Cimon</hi> by theſe means got the Town, expelled thoſe <hi>Dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Pirates, and ſo opened the Traffick of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea. After this, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Theſeus</hi> the Son of <hi>Aegeus,</hi> when he fled from <hi>Athens,</hi> and took refuge in this Iſle, was here ſlain by King <hi>Lycomedes</hi> upon certain ſuſpitions; <hi>Cimon</hi> endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to find out where he was Buried: For the Oracle had commanded the <hi>Athenians</hi> to bring home his Aſhes and to honour him as an <hi>Hero. Cimon</hi> could not for a long time learn where he was interred; for thoſe of <hi>Scyros</hi> diſſembled the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, and were not willing he ſhould ſearch. But at length after diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry he found out the Tomb; and then carried the Reliques into his Admiral Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and with great Pomp and Show brought them into <hi>Athens,</hi> 400 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Theſeus</hi> firſt left that Country. This Act got <hi>Cimon</hi> the Hearts of the People, who received the Diſcovery with great Joy and abundance of Thanks. To ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize and perpetuate the Memory of this Deed, and their ſenſe of it, they appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:35403:159"/>
that memorable Deciſion of Victory betwixt the two <hi>Tragedians, Aeſchylus</hi> and <hi>Sophocles:</hi> For the latter having writ his firſt Play, being yet very young, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of the Theatre was divided, and the Spectators ſided into Parties: To deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this, <hi>Aphepſion,</hi> who was at that time <hi>Archon,</hi> would not caſt Lots who ſhould be Judges; but when <hi>Cimon</hi> and the other Commanders with him came into the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, to ſee the iſſue of the Contention, after they had performed the uſual Rites to the God of the Feſtival, the <hi>Archon,</hi> came to them, and made them ſwear (being ten in all) to ſpeak their Judgments in this Contention according to Equity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And ſo being ſworn Judges, he made them all ſit down to give a deceſive Sentence. The Contention for Victory grew warm, and both Sides ambitiouſly ſtrove who ſhould get the Suffrages of ſuch honourable Judges; but the Victory was at laſt adjudged to <hi>Sophocles;</hi> which <hi>Aeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chylus</hi> took ſo ill, that he left <hi>Athens,</hi> and went to <hi>Sicily,</hi> where he died of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and was buried near the City of <hi>Gela.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ion</hi> reports, that when he was a young Man, and newly returned from <hi>Chios</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> he chanced to ſup with <hi>Cimon</hi> at <hi>Laomedon</hi>'s Houſe: After Supper, when
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:35403:159"/>
they had (according to Cuſtom) poured out Wine to the Honour of the Gods, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was deſired by the Company to give them a Song; which he did with ſo good grace, that they were all charmed with his Voice, and extreamly pleaſed with his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, declaring that he was more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant than <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> who being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated upon ſuch an occaſion to play upon the Lute, anſwered, That he could not touch an Inſtrument, but give him a ſmall Village, and he would raiſe it into a ſtrong and wealthy City. After talking of many indifferent things incident to ſuch Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, they entred into the Particulars of thoſe ſeveral Actions for which <hi>Cimon</hi> had been Famous. And when they had run over the moſt ſignal, he told them they had omitted one, upon which he valued himſelf moſt for Addreſs and good contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. He gave this Account of it. When the <hi>Athenians</hi> and their Allies had taken a great number of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> Priſoners in <hi>Seſtos</hi> and <hi>Byzantium,</hi> giving him the preference to divide the Booty, he put the naked Priſoners in one Lot, and the Spoils of their rich Attire and Jewels in the other. This the Allies complained of, as an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Diviſion; therefore he gave them their choice to take which Lot they would, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſhould be content with
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:35403:160"/>
that which they refuſed. One <hi>Herophytus</hi> of <hi>Samos</hi> adviſed them to take the Ornaments for their Share, and leave the Slaves to the <hi>Athenians:</hi> Upon this <hi>Cimon</hi> was laugh'd at for his ridiculous Diviſion: For the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies carried away the Gold Chains and Purple Robes, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> had only the naked Bodies of the Captives, which they could make no advantage of, being unuſed to Labour. But a little while after, the Parents and Kinſmen of the Priſoners coming from <hi>Lydia</hi> and <hi>Phrygia,</hi> every one redeemed his Relations at a very high Ranſom. By this means <hi>Cimon</hi> got ſo much Treaſure, that he maintained his whole Fleet of Gallies with the Money for four Months; and yet there was ſome left to lay up in the Treaſury at <hi>Athens.</hi> Now <hi>Cimon</hi> growing rich, what he gain'd from the <hi>Barbarians</hi> with Honour, he ſpent hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitably upon the Citizens. For he pull'd down all the Enclouſures of his Gardens and Grounds, that all Travellers, but his Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens eſpecially, might gather of his Fruits freely and without danger. At home he kept a Table that was not furniſhed indeed with great Delicacies, but where was a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Competency of Proviſions, and all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, hear the poor Townſmen had a conſtant and eaſie Acceſs, ſo that their Care was employed in diſcharging this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:35403:160"/>
duties, from which otherwiſe they would have been diſtracted by ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Subſiſtence. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reports, That he was partial in this Reception, and that it did not extend to all the <hi>Athenians,</hi> but only to thoſe of the Tribe of <hi>Lacia.</hi> Beſides, he always went attended with a Train of young Gentlemen, who were his Domeſticks, and very well clad; and if he met with an elderly Citizen in a poor Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, he would ſtrip one of his Retinue, and cloath the decayed Citizen; and this was looked upon as very well done. He did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn them likewiſe to carry great Sums of Money about them; and if they met in the Streets any one that they either knew, or who looked as if he were in diſtreſs, they had order to relieve him, and convey ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing privately into his Hand. This <hi>Crati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Poet ſpeaks of, in one of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies called <hi>Archilocha,</hi> after this manner.</p>

                  <hi>Lichas,</hi> we know, became Famous in <hi>Greece,</hi> only becauſe on the days of the Sports, when the young Lads run naked, he uſed to entertain the Strangers that came to ſee theſe Diverſions. But <hi>Cimon</hi> ſurpaſſed all the ancient <hi>Athenians</hi> for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitality and good Nature: For tho thoſe taught the reſt of <hi>Greece</hi> to ſow Corn, and <hi>the uſe of Fire and Water:</hi> Yet <hi>Cimon</hi> by keeping open Houſe, and giving Travellers Liberty to eat all his Fruits, which the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Seaſons afforded, ſeemed to reſtore to the World that Community of Goods which the Poets fabulouſly tell us was in the Reign of <hi>Saturn.</hi> Thoſe who object to him, that he did this to be popular, and gain the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of the Vulgar, are confuted by the conſtant Tenour of the reſt of his Actions, which all tended to uphold the Intereſts of the Nobility againſt the Populace; of which he gave inſtances, when he together with <hi>Ariſtides</hi> oppoſed <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> who was for
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:35403:161"/>
advancing the Authority of the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its juſt Limits; and down right quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> who, to ingratiate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the Multitude, was for aboliſhing the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Areopagites.</hi> And when all of his time, except <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> took Preſents, he ſtill kept his hands clean and untainted, and never acted nor Counſell'd any thing but what was juſt and innocent. They report that <hi>Raeſaces</hi> a <hi>Perſian,</hi> who had Traiterouſly revolted from the King his Maſter, fled to <hi>Athens,</hi> and there being haraſs'd by Sycophants, who were ſtill accuſing him to the People, he applyed himſelf to <hi>Cimon,</hi> for redreſs; to gain his Favour he brought him two Cups, the one full of <note n="*" place="margin">Pieces of Money.</note> Dariuſſes of Gold, and the other of Silver: <hi>Cimon</hi> would not receive them, but asked him ſmilingly whether he would have him to be his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary, or his Friend; he replyed, his Friend: If ſo (ſaid he) take away theſe pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for being your Friend, I preſume they are at my Service, when I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for them, and when I have I'll ſend to you.</p>
               <p>The Allies of the <hi>Athenians</hi> began now to be very weary of the War, and were willing to have ſome intervals of repoſe, that they might look after their Husbandry and Traffick. For they ſaw their Enemies
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:35403:162"/>
driven out of the Country, and did not fear any new Incurſions: Yet they ſtill paid the Taxes they were aſſeſs'd at, but would not ſend men and Gallies, as they had done before. This the other <hi>Athenian</hi> Generals would conſtrain them to by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of proceſs, till at laſt by fining them ſo grievouſly they did render the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uneaſie to them, and even odious. But <hi>Cimon</hi> practiſed a contrary Method, he forced no man to go that was not willing, but of thoſe that deſired to be excuſed from Service, he took Money, and Veſſels un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man'd: And permitted the men to ſtay at home and follow what gainful Vocations they liked beſt, whether of Husbandry or Merchandiſe. By this means they grew Luxurious, and enervated all their Courage by living at eaſe. But the <hi>Athenians</hi> he took into his Gallies, and by employing them in all his Naval expeditions, inured them to ſuffer Hardſhip: So that being ſeverely Diſciplined, and continually bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arms, the Allies began to dread, and then flatter them who were grown thus dreadful at their coſt; till they fell to that degree of Subjection, as of Allies they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt became Tributaries and Slaves. No man ever checked the growth of the <hi>Perſians</hi> Ambition ſo much as <hi>Cimon;</hi> for he not only beat them out of <hi>Greece,</hi>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:35403:162"/>
but cloſely purſuing them, would not let them take Breath, nor put their Affairs in any poſture; but either took their Towns by open force, or made them revolt, by managing Intelligence within their Walls. So that in all <hi>Aſia,</hi> even from <hi>Ionia</hi> to <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylia</hi> there was not one Soldier that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When word was brought that ſome <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Commanders were upon the Coaſts of <hi>Pamphylia</hi> with a Land Army, and a great Fleet of Gallies; <hi>Cimon,</hi> that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept them before they ſhould come into the Sea that lies betwixt the <hi>Chelidonian</hi> Iſles, ſet forth from <hi>Triopium</hi> and <hi>Gnidos</hi> with two hundred Gallies, very fleet, and that could eaſily tack about. They were firſt contrived and built by <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> but <hi>Cimon</hi> enlarged them, that when they came to grapple, there might be a greater number of Combatants to oppoſe the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The firſt place he ſhaped his Courſe to was <hi>Phaſelis,</hi> which tho 'twas inhabited by <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet they would not quit the Intereſts of <hi>Perſia,</hi> but denied his Gallies entrance into their Port: Whereupon he waſted the Country, and drew up his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to their very Walls; but ſome Soldiers of <hi>Chios,</hi> which were then liſted under <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> being ancient Friends to the <hi>Phaſelites,</hi> endeavour'd to mitigate the General in their
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:35403:163"/>
behalf; and in the mean time ſhot Arrows into the Town, to which were faſtened Letters of Intelligence, which gave them account of the ſtate of Affairs: At length Peace was concluded upon theſe Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, That they ſhould pay down ten Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and join their Forces with <hi>Cimon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Barbarians. Ephorus</hi> ſaith, the Admiral of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Fleet was <hi>Tithrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes,</hi> and the General of the Land Army <hi>Pherendates:</hi> But <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> is poſitive, that <hi>Argomandes</hi> the Son of <hi>Gobrias</hi> had the ſupream Command of all the Forces. The whole Fleet Anchored at the Mouth of the River <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> but with no Deſign to fight, becauſe they expected a re-inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Phaenician</hi> Sail, which were to come from <hi>Cyprus;</hi> but <hi>Cimon,</hi> being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to prevent their joining, ranged his Gallies in ſuch a poſture, that if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined fighting he might force them to it. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſeeing this, retired within the mouth of the River, to prevent their being attacked; but when they ſaw the <hi>Athenians</hi> come upon them notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their retreat, they met them with ſix hundred Sail, as <hi>Phaenodemus</hi> relates, but according to <hi>Ephorus</hi> only with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty. Yet notwithſtanding this odds of number, they did nothing worthy ſuch mighty Forces; for they preſently
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:35403:163"/>
turned the Prows of their Gallies toward the ſhore, where thoſe that came firſt threw themſelves upon Land, and fled to their Army drawn up thereabout, but the reſt periſh'd with their Veſſels, or were taken; by this you may gueſs at their number; for though a great many eſcaped out of the Fight, and a great many others were ſunk, yet two hundred Gallies were taken by the <hi>Athenians.</hi> When their Land-Army drew toward the Sea-ſide, <hi>Cimon</hi> was in ſuſpence whether he ſhould make a deſcent: For thereby he ſhould expoſe his <hi>Greeks,</hi> weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Slaughter in the firſt Engagement, to the Swords of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who were all freſh Men, and Superiour to them in number: But ſeeing his men reſolute, and fluſh'd with Victory, he made them land, tho they had not yet wiped off the Sweat and Bloud of the firſt Battel. As ſoon as they touched Ground, they ſet up a ſhout, and ran furiouſly upon the Enemy, who ſtood firm and ſuſtained the firſt ſhock with great obſtinacy; ſo that the fight began to be very doubtful; the principal men of the <hi>Athenians</hi> for Quality and Courage, were ſlain; at length, tho with much ado, they routed the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> ſome they took Priſoners, and plundered all their Tents and Pavillions, which were full of very rich Spoil. <hi>Cimon</hi> being thus a perfect
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:35403:164"/>
Conqueror, having in one day gained two Victories, wherein he ſurpaſſed that of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamis</hi> by Sea, and that of <hi>Platea</hi> by Land, was encouraged to purſue his Succeſs: So<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that News being brought that the <hi>Phaenician</hi> Succours, in number eighty Sail, were at the Gulf of <hi>Hidram,</hi> he bended his Courſe toward them, and encompaſſed them about. They had not received any certain account of the former defeat, and now were in great doubt what to think: ſo that thus ſurprized they loſt their Veſſels, and all the men were either Slain or Drowned. This ſucceſs of <hi>Cimon</hi> ſo daunted the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that he preſently made that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Peace, whereby he engaged that his Armies ſhould come no nearer the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Sea than the length of a Horſe-race: And that none of his Gallies or Veſſels of War ſhould appear between the <hi>Cyanean</hi> and <hi>Chelidonian</hi> Iſles. <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> ſays, that he agreed not to any Articles, but that upon the fear this Victory gave him, he prudently kept off ſo far from <hi>Greece,</hi> that when <hi>Pericles</hi> with fifty, and <hi>Ephialtes</hi> with thirty Gallies, cruiſed beyond the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidonian</hi> Iſles, they could not diſcover one <hi>Perſian</hi> Sail. But in the Collection which <hi>Craterus</hi> made of the publick Acts of the People, there is an Original draught of this Treaty, as following upon that defeat. And
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:35403:164"/>
'tis reported, that at <hi>Athens</hi> they erected the Altar of Peace upon this occaſion; and decreed particular Honours to <hi>Callias,</hi> who was employed as Ambaſſador to manage the Treaty.</p>
               <p>The People of <hi>Athens</hi> raiſed ſo much Money from the Spoils of this War, which were ſold by publick Out-cry, that beſides other Expences, and raiſing the South Wall of the Cittadel, they laid the Foundation of thoſe Walls (afterwards finiſhed) which they called <hi>Skele, i e, Long Shanks,</hi> that join the City to the Port; but the place where they built them being a Mooriſh Ground, they were forced to ſink great Weights of Stone to ſecure the Foundation; and all this they did out of the Money <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſupplied them with. It was he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that adorned <hi>Athens</hi> with thoſe Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Places of Exerciſe, which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſo much frequented and delighted in: He ſet the <hi>Forum</hi> with Plain-trees: The Academy, which was before open, and expoſed to the Weather, he fenced with Trees, and beautified with Fountains; he made covered Alleys to walk in, and ſet out Ground for Foot and Horſe-races. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward being informed that ſome <hi>Perſians,</hi> who had made themſelves Maſters of the <hi>Cherſoneſe,</hi> were ſo peremptory in not quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, that they called in the People <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

the higher <hi>Thrace</hi> to help them againſt <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> whom they deſpiſed for the ſmallneſs of his Forces; he ſet upon them with only four Gallies, and took thirteen of theirs. Then having drove out the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and ſubdued the <hi>Thracians,</hi> he made the whole <hi>Cherſoneſe</hi> ſubject to the Commonwealth of <hi>Athens.</hi> From hence he went againſt the People of <hi>Thaſos,</hi> who had revolted from the <hi>Athenians;</hi> and having defeated them in a Fight at Sea, where he took thirty three of their Veſſels, he ſtormed their Town, ſeized for the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> all the Mines of Gold on the other ſide of it, and all the Country dependant of it. This opened him a fair Paſſage into <hi>Macedon,</hi> ſo that he might have Conquered the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of it.

Before the Judges he pleaded, <q>That he never made an Intereſt with the Rich <hi>Ionians</hi> nor <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> as others have, from whence they drew both Honour and Profit; but that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways embraced the Friendſhip of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians;</hi> for as he admired, ſo he wiſhed to imitate the Sedateneſs of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, their Temperance and Simplicity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

As for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour at home, he always reſtrained the Common People, who would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached upon the Nobility, and affected the Supream Power over them. But when he afterward was called out to War, the Multitude broke looſe as it were, reverſed all the ancient Laws and Cuſtoms they had hitherto obſerved; this they did chiefly at the inſtigation of <hi>Ephialtes;</hi> they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew likewiſe the Cogniſance of almoſt all Cauſes from the <hi>Areopagus;</hi> ſo that all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals being made to them, the Government was reduced to a perfect Democracy; and this by the help of <hi>Pericles,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in favour of the Common People. But <hi>Cimon,</hi> when he returned, ſeeing the Authority of this Great Council ſo eclipſed,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:35403:166"/>
was exceedingly troubled, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remedy theſe Diſorders, by bringing things to their former ſtate, and reſtoring the Nobility to thoſe Degrees of Command they had in the time of <hi>Caliſthenes:</hi> This the others declaimed againſt, with all the vehemence poſſible, and began to revive thoſe Stories concerning him and his Siſter, and cried out againſt him as addicted to the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi> Conſonant to theſe Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are the famous Verſes of <hi>Eupolis</hi> the Poet upon <hi>Cimon.</hi>

                  <l>He goes to <hi>Sparta,</hi> and is ſo unkind,</l>
                  <l>He leaves poor <hi>Elpinice</hi> in Bed behind.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But if when Slothful and a Drunkard he could ſtorm ſo many Towns, and gain ſo many Victories; certainly if he had been ſober, and minded his Buſineſs with the leaſt application, there had been no <hi>Grecian</hi> Commander, either before or after him, that could have ſurpaſſed him for Exploits of War. He was indeed a Favourer of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> even from his Youth; and <hi>Steſimbrotus</hi> reports, That of two Sons (Twins) that he had by a Woman of <hi>Clito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> he named one <hi>Lacedemonius,</hi> and the other <hi>Eleus:</hi> Whence <hi>Pericles</hi> often up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:35403:166"/>
them with the Race of their Mother. But <hi>Diodorus</hi> the Geographer doth aſſert, That both theſe, and another Son of <hi>Cimon</hi>'s, whoſe Name was <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> were born of <hi>Iſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Euryptolemus</hi> the Son of <hi>Megacles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However this is certain, that <hi>Cimon</hi> was countenanced by the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> whom they hated; and while he was yet very young, they endeavoured to raiſe and encreaſe his Credit in <hi>Athens:</hi> This the <hi>Athenians</hi> perceived, but diſſembled their knowledge of it; for the Favour of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> ſhewed him was at that time advantageous to them and their Affairs; who were then Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the <hi>Allies</hi> to win them over to their ſide: So they ſeemed not at all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Honour and kindneſs ſhewed to <hi>Cimon,</hi> for he then bore the greateſt ſway in the Affairs of <hi>Greeee,</hi> was kind to the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and Courteous to the <hi>Allies.</hi> But afterwards the <hi>Athenians</hi> grown more powerful, when they ſaw <hi>Cimon</hi> ſo entirely devoted to the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> they began to be angry, for he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in his Speeches preferr them to the <hi>Athenians;</hi> and upon every occaſion, when he would reprimand theſe for a Fault, or incite them to Emulation, he would Cry, <q>The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> would not do thus.</q>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:35403:167"/>
This raiſed the diſcontent, and got him the hatred of the Gitizens; But that which miniſtred chiefly to the accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt him fell out upon this Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>In the fourth year of the Reign of <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus</hi> the Son of <hi>Zeuxidamus</hi> King of <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> there hapned in the City of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> the moſt dreadful Earthquake that ever was known in the Memory of Man; the Earth opened into moſt frightful Abyſſes; and the top of the Mountain <hi>Taygetus</hi> was ſo ſhaken, that the hanging Rocks and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt prominent Parts of it fell down; and except five Houſes, all the Town was ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to pieces. They ſay, That a little before any Motion was perceived, as ſome young Men were exerciſing themſelves in the middle <hi>Portico,</hi> an Hare of a ſudden ſtarted out juſt by them, which ſome of them, tho all naked, and daubed with Oyl, run after ſhouting; no ſooner were they gone from the place, but the <hi>Gymna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium</hi> fell down upon them that were left, and killed them all. In memory of this fatal Accident, the Monument where they were afterwards interred is to this day cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Siſmatias,</hi> (that is,) <hi>The Tomb of thoſe who were killed by the Earthquake.</hi>) <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus,</hi> by the preſent danger, made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of what might follow; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Citizens intent upon removing the richeſt of their Goods he commanded an Alarm to be ſounded, as if their Enemies were comming upon them, that they ſhould preſently with Arms reſort to him. 'Twas this alone that ſaved <hi>Sparta</hi> at that time: For the <hi>Helotes</hi> were got together from the Country about, with deſign to ſurpriſe the <hi>Spartans,</hi> and ſpoil thoſe whom the Earthquake had ſpared: But finding them Armed, and well prepared, they ſtole away into their Towns, and openly made War with them, having drawn into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy not a few of their Neighbours; and together with them, the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> fell upon the <hi>Spartans,</hi> who therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch'd <hi>Periclidas</hi> to <hi>Athens</hi> to ſollicite for Succours; of whom <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> mocking, ſaid,</p>

               <p>This <hi>Ephialtes</hi> oppoſed, proteſting that they ought not to raiſe up or aſſiſt a City that was Rival to <hi>Athens;</hi> but that being down, it were beſt to keep her ſo, and break the Pride and Arrogance of <hi>Sparta.</hi> But <hi>Cimon</hi> (as <hi>Critias</hi> relates) preferring the Safety of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> to the Grandeur of his own Country, ſo perſwaded the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:35403:168"/>
that he ſoon marched out with a great Army to their Relief. <hi>Ion</hi> reports the Speech he uſed to move the <hi>Athenians,</hi> 
                  <q>That they ſhould not ſuffer <hi>Greece</hi> to be maimed by the loſs of ſo conſiderable a Member, nor their own City to be deprived of her Companion.</q> In his return from aiding the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> he paſſed with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my through the Territory of <hi>Corinth:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Lachartus</hi> reproached him for bringing his Army into the Country, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt asking leave of the People: For he that knocks at another Man's Door, ought not to enter the Houſe without the Maſter's leave. But you, <hi>Lachartus,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Cimon</hi>) did not knock at the Gates of the <hi>Cleonians</hi> and <hi>Megarians,</hi> but broke them down, and entred by force, thinking that all ſhould be open to the Powerful. And having thus rallied the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> he paſſed on with his Army. Some time after this the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians</hi> ſent a ſecond time to deſire Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> againſt the <hi>Meſſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Helotes,</hi> who had ſeized upon <hi>Itho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne:</hi> But when they came, the <hi>Spartans</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Courage and Reſolution, of all that came to their Aſſiſtance they ſent them only back, alledging they were turbulent and ſeditious. The <hi>Athenians</hi> returned home, enraged at this Uſage, and vented their Anger upon all thoſe who were Favourers
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:35403:168"/>
of the <hi>Lacedaemonians;</hi> therefore upon ſome ſlight occaſion they baniſhed <hi>Cimon</hi> for ten years, which is the time preſcribed to thoſe that are baniſhed by the <hi>Oſtraciſm.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> intending to free <hi>Delphos</hi> from the <hi>Phoceans,</hi> brought an Army to <hi>Tanagra,</hi> whither the <hi>Athenians</hi> preſently marched with deſign to fight them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cimon</hi> alſo came thither armed, and ranged himſelf amongſt thoſe of his own Tribe, which was that of <hi>Aeneide;</hi> but the Council of five hundred being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of this, and frighted at it, (his Adverſaries crying out he would diſorder the Army, and bring the <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to <hi>Athens</hi>) Commanded the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers not to receive him; wherefore <hi>Cimon</hi> left the Army, conjuring <hi>Euthippus</hi> the <hi>Anaphlyſtian,</hi> and the reſt of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who were alſo ſuſpected as favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bravely againſt their Enemies, and by their Actions make their innocence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to their Country-men. Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all an hundred, took the <hi>Arms</hi> of <hi>Cimon,</hi> and followed his advice: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Body by themſelves, they charged ſo deſperately upon the Enemy, that they were all cut off, leaving to the <hi>Athenians</hi> a deep regret, for the loſs of ſuch brave Men,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:35403:169"/>
and repentance for having ſo unjuſtly ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Whereupon they did not long retain their ſeverity toward <hi>Cimon,</hi> partly upon remembrance of his former ſervices, and partly conſtrained by the juncture of the times: For being defeated at <hi>Tanagra</hi> in a great Battle, and fearing the <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſians</hi> would come upon them, at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the Spring; they recalled <hi>Cimon</hi> by a decree, of which <hi>Pericles</hi> himſelf was Author: ſo reaſonable were Mens reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in thoſe times, and ſo moderate their Anger, that it always gave way to the publick good; even Ambition, the moſt ungovernable of all humane Paſſions, could then yield to the neceſſities of the State.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cimon</hi> as ſoon as he returned, put an end to the War, and reconciled the two Cities. Peace thus eſtabliſh'd, ſeeing the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> impatient of being Idle, and eager after the Honour and Spoils of War; leſt they ſhould ſet upon the <hi>Grecians</hi> themſelves, or with ſo many Ships cruiſing about the <hi>Iſles</hi> and <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> they ſhould give Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to inteſtine Wars, or Complaints of their Allies againſt them; He equipped two hundred Galleys, with deſign to make an attempt upon <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Cyprus;</hi> by this means to uſe the <hi>Athenians</hi> to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:35403:169"/>
by ſpoiling thoſe who are by nature Enemies to <hi>Greece.</hi> But when all things were prepared, and the Army ready to imbark, <hi>Cimon</hi> had this Dream: It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him an angry Bitch bark'd at him, and a kind of humane voice mixt with bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uttered theſe Words.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Go on, for ſhortly thou ſhalt be,</l>
                  <l>A Friend to my young Whelps and me.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>This Dream was hard to interpret; yet <hi>Aſtyphylus</hi> of <hi>Poſidonium,</hi> a man skilled in Divinations, and intimate with <hi>Cimon,</hi> told him, that his Death was preſaged by this Viſion, which he thus explained. A Dog is Enemy to him he barks at, and one is always moſt a friend to ones Enemies, when one is dead; that mixture of humane Voice with barking ſignifies the <hi>Modes,</hi> for the Army of the <hi>Medes</hi> is mixt of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians.</hi> But after this Dream, as he was ſacrificing to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and the Prieſt cutting up the Victim, a great number of Emmets, taking up the little congealed particles of the blood, laid them about <hi>Cimon</hi>'s great Toe: This was not obſerved a good while; but as ſoon as <hi>Cimon</hi> ſpied it, the Prieſt came and ſhewed him the Liver of the Sacrifice imperfect, wanting that part of it, which they called
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:35403:170"/>
the head of the Entrail. But he could not then recede from the Enterprize, ſo he ſet ſail; ſixty of his Ships he ſent toward <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> with the reſt he went and fought the King of <hi>Perſia</hi>'s Fleet compoſed of <hi>Phaenician</hi> and <hi>Cilician</hi> Sail: ſubdued all the Cities thereabout, and threatned <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> deſigning no leſs than the entire Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire; And the rather for that he was informed <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was in great repute among the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and had promiſed the King to lead his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, whenever he ſhould make War upon <hi>Greece;</hi> but they ſay <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> loſing all hopes of compaſſing his deſigns, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing to equal the Vertue and good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>Cimon,</hi> dyed a voluntary Death. <hi>Cimon</hi> ſtill framing great deſigns, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Navy about the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> ſent Meſſengers to Conſult the Oracle of <hi>Jupiter Hammon</hi> upon ſome ſecret matter; for 'tis not known about what they were ſent; the God would give them no Anſwer, but commanded them to return again, for that <hi>Cimon</hi> was already with him. Hearing this they returned to Sea, and as ſoon as they came to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army, which was then about <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they underſtood that <hi>Cimon</hi> was dead; and computing the time of the Oracle, they found that his Death was meant by it, as being then with the Gods.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:35403:170"/>
Some ſay he died of Sickneſs at <hi>Citium</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and others of a wound he received in a Skirmiſh with the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> when he perceived he ſhould dye, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe under his charge to return to their Country, and by no means to ſpread the news of his Death by the way; this they did with ſuch ſecrecy, that they all came home ſafe, and neither their Enemies nor Allies knew what had hapned. Thus, as <hi>Phaenodemus</hi> relates, the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army was, as it were, conducted by <hi>Cimon</hi> thirty days after he was dead. But with him periſhed all the good fortune of <hi>Greece;</hi> for after his Death there was not a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander that did any thing conſiderable, or which might deſerve the name of a great action, and inſtead of uniting againſt their common Enemies, they who bore ſway in the Principal Cities, animated them againſt one another to that degree, that none durſt or would interpoſe their good Offices to reconcile them. Thus by mutual diſcord ruining themſelves, the <hi>Perſians</hi> had time to recover Breath, and repair all their loſſes. 'Tis true indeed <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> made ſome ſhew of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Forces in <hi>Aſia,</hi> but 'twas a long time after; he ſeemed to revive ſome little appearances of a War againſt the Kings Lieutenants in the Provinces, but they all quickly vaniſht; for before he
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:35403:171"/>
could perform any thing of moment, he was recalled by civil Diſſentions at home: So that he was forced to leave the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings Officers to impoſe what Tribute they pleaſed on the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities in <hi>Aſia,</hi> tho under the Dominion of the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> Whereas in the time of <hi>Cimon,</hi> no Officer of What Quality or Character ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever could Command there, nor durſt any Souldier in Arms come within four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred furlongs of the Sea.</p>
               <p>The Monuments called <hi>Cimonian,</hi> to this day in <hi>Athens,</hi> ſhew that to be the place of his Burial; yet the Inhabitants of the City <hi>Citium,</hi> pay particular honour to a certain Tomb, which they call the Tomb of <hi>Cimon,</hi> according to <hi>Nauſicrates</hi> the <hi>Rhetorician;</hi> who alſo reports, that in a Famine, when there neceſſities were very great, they ſent to the Oracle, which commanded them to honour <hi>Cimon</hi> as a God.</p>
               <p>Thus have I drawn the Life of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Captain, and by theſe Proportions judge of him.</p>

Beſides what hath been ſaid of his great Learning already, one Inſtance more was, That in his Youth, upon a Propoſal of writing the <hi>Marſican</hi> War in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Verſe and Proſe, after ſome witty Rallery upon the Occaſion, he ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly proteſted to <hi>Hortenſius</hi> the Lawyer, and <hi>Siſenna</hi> the Hiſtorian, that hewould take his Lot for it; and very probable it is, that the Lot directed him to the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, for the <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtory of that War is ſtill extant among us. Many are the Signs of the great Love which he bore to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mark,</hi> the earlieſt whereof the <hi>Romans</hi> at this day commemorate: Tho he was el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother, he would not ſtep into Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority without him, but deferred his own Advance, until his Brother was fitly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to bear a ſhare with him, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſo won upon the People, as when ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,<note place="margin">Clark of the Market.</note> to be choſen <hi>Aedyle</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>Many and early were the Proofs of his Valour and Conduct in the <hi>Marſican</hi> War, being admir'd by <hi>Sylla</hi> for his Conſtancy and Mildneſs, and always employ'd in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatching affairs where Induſtry and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were required; eſpecially in the Mint, moſt of the Money for carrying on the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:35403:174"/>
                  <hi>Mithridatick</hi> War, being Coyned by him. Which being ſoon exchanged for neceſſaries in the Camp, was for a long time Current in the Army, and from thence called <hi>Luculleian Coyn.</hi> After this, when <hi>Sylla</hi> conquered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> and neceſſaries for his Army were cut off by reaſon the Enemy was Maſter at Sea: <hi>Lucullus</hi> was the man whom he ſent into <hi>Libya</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to procure him ſhipping. It was then the depth of Winter, when he ventured but with three ſmall <hi>Greek</hi> Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and as many <hi>Rhodian</hi> Galleys, not only into the main Sea, but alſo among multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the Enemies ſhipping, even there where they were abſolute Maſters. Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at <hi>Crete,</hi> he gained it: and finding the <hi>Cyrenians</hi> haraſſed by long Tyranny and War, he took Care of their publick Affairs, and ſettled them: Putting their City in mind of that ſaying which <hi>Plato</hi> had Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely uttered of them: who being reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to preſcribe Laws to them, and mould them into ſome ſound form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made anſwer, That it was a hard thing to give Laws to the <hi>Cyrenians,</hi> abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſo much Wealth and Plenty. For nothing renders a man more intractable than Felicity, nor more gentle than the ſhock of Fortune. This made the <hi>Cyreni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſo willingly ſubmit to the Laws which <hi>Lucullus</hi> impoſed upon them. From thence
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:35403:174"/>
ſailing into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and preſſed by Pyrates, he loſt the beſt part of his Navy: but he himſelf narrowly eſcaping was brought in State to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The whole Fleet (a Complement due only to his Majeſty) met him, and young <hi>Ptolomy</hi> ſhewed won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful kindneſs to him, allowing him Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Diet in the Palace, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as no Stranger before him had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in. Beſides, he gave him Gratuities and Preſents, not only ſuch as were uſually given to men of his Condition, but four times as much; but he received nothing more than ſerved his neceſſity, and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of no Gift, tho one worth Eighty Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents was offered him. 'Tis reported he neither went to ſee <hi>Memphis,</hi> nor any of the celebrated Wonders of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> It was<note place="margin">Metropolis of Aegypt.</note> for a man of no Buſineſs, and much Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to ſee ſuch things, not for him who had left his Commander in the Trenches, ſtorming the Walls of his Enemies. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> fearing the Effect of that War, deſerted the Confederacy; but nevertheleſs ſent a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy with him as far as <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with much Ceremony wiſhing him a good Voyage, gave him a very precious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merauld ſet in Gold: <hi>Lucullus</hi> at firſt refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, but when the King ſhewed him his own Image graven thereon, 'twas too late for a Denial; for had he ſhewed any diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:35403:175"/>
at parting, it might have endanger'd his Paſſage. Drawing his Squadron toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he had ſummoned out of all the maritime Towns, except of thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of Pyracy, he ſailed for <hi>Cyprus;</hi> and there underſtanding that the Enemy lay in wait under the Promontories for him, he laid up his Fleet; and ſent to the Cities to ſend in Proviſions for his winte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring among them: But when Tide and Time ſerved, he Rigg'd them out and went off, and Hoiſing up his Sails in the Night which he let down in the Day, came ſafe to <hi>Rhodes.</hi> Being furniſhed with Ships at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> he ſoon prevailed upon the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Chios,</hi> and <hi>Knidia</hi> to leave the King's ſide, and joyn with him againſt the <hi>Samians.</hi> Out of <hi>Chios</hi> he drove the King's Party, and ſet the <hi>Colophonians</hi> at Liberty having ſeized <hi>Epigonus</hi> the Tyrant who oppreſſed them.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Mithridates</hi> left <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and retired to <hi>Pitane,</hi> where being cloſely beſieged by <hi>Fimbria,</hi> and not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to engage with ſo bold and Victorious a man as <hi>Fimbria,</hi> he contrived his Eſcape by Sea, and ſent for all his Fleet to attend him. Which when <hi>Fimbria</hi> perceived, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Ships of his own, he ſent to <hi>Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> entreating him to aſſiſt him with his in ſubduing the moſt Odious and Warlike
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:35403:175"/>
of Kings, leſt the opportunity of humbling <hi>Mithridates,</hi> an enterprize which coſt the <hi>Romans</hi> ſo much Blood and Trouble, ſhould now at laſt be loſt, when he was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in reach, and ſo eaſily to be taken; who being caught, no one would be more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended than he, who ſtopt his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and ſeized him in his flight. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drove from the Land by the one, and ſtopt in the Sea by the other, would be matter of Renown and Glory to them both. As for the great Actions of <hi>Sylla</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Orchomenians</hi> about <hi>Choeronea,</hi> they were little valued by the <hi>Romans.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal was no unlikely thing, it being obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all Men, that if <hi>Lucullus</hi> had heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Fimbria,</hi> and with his Navy, which was then near at hand, had block'd up the Haven the War ſoon had been brought to an end, and infinite Numbers of miſchiefs prevented thereby.

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:35403:176"/>
ſuffered <hi>Mithridates</hi> to eſcape, and laugh at the attempts of <hi>Fimbria,</hi> he himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone firſt, near <hi>Lectos</hi> of <hi>Troas</hi> in a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fight overcame the King's Forces; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> came upon him with a greater Fleet, he went aboard a <hi>Rhodian Quinquereme Galley,</hi> commanded by <hi>Demagoras,</hi> a Man very expert in Sea Affairs, and altogether as Friendly to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſailed before the reſt. <hi>Neopto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemus</hi> made up furiouſly at him, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Maſter with all imaginable might to bear up to him, but <hi>Demagoras</hi> fearing the Bulk and Maſſy ſtem of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, thought it dangerous to meet him ahead, but Tacking about received him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, in which place though violently bore upon, he received no manner of harm, the blow being defeated by falling on thoſe parts of the Ship which lay under Water. At which time the reſt of the Fleet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to him, he Tack'd about, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly falling upon the Enemy, put them to flight, and purſued <hi>Neoptolemus.</hi> After this he came to <hi>Sylla</hi> in <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> as he was paſſing the <hi>Strait,</hi> and brought time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſtance for the ſafe Tranſportation of the Army.</p>
               <p>Peace being now made, <hi>Mithridates</hi> ſailed off to the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, but <hi>Sylla</hi> Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Inhabitants of <hi>Aſia</hi> two thouſand
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:35403:176"/>
Talents, and ordered <hi>Lucullus</hi> to gather and Coyn the Money: And it was no ſmall Comfort to the Cities under <hi>Sylla</hi>'s ſeverity that not only a Man of ſpotleſs Life and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but alſo of Moderation, ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſo heavy and diſguſtful an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. The <hi>Mytilenians</hi> who deſerted him, he was willing ſhould return to their Duty, and to be moderately fin'd for the offence they had given in the Caſe of <hi>Marius.</hi> But upon their obſtinacy, he came up to them, overcame them at Sea, block'd them up in their City and beſieged them; then Sailing off from them openly in the Day to <hi>Elea,</hi> he returned privately; and an Ambuſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid round the City, lay quiet himſelf. Whereupon the <hi>Mytilenians</hi> diſorderly and eagerly plundering the deſerted Camp, in the very fact he fell upon them, took many of them, and ſlew five hundred, who ſtood upon their defence; he gained ſix thouſand Slaves and a very rich Booty.</p>
               <p>He was no way engaged in the Great and General Troubles of <hi>Italy,</hi> which <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> had cauſed, Providence at that time detaining him in <hi>Aſia</hi> about bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. He was as much in <hi>Sylla</hi>'s favour as any of his other Friends, to whom (as is ſaid before) he dedicated his Memoirs as a Token of his kindneſs, and at his Death paſſing by <hi>Pompey,</hi> made him Guardian to
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:35403:177"/>
his Son, which ſeems to be the riſe of the Quarrel between them two, both young Men, equally contending for Honour. A little after <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Death he was made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul with <hi>M. Cotta,</hi> about the one hundred ſeventy ſixth Olympiad. The <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> War being then under debate, <hi>Marcus</hi> reported that it was not finiſhed, but only reſpited for a time: Wherefore upon choice of Provinces, the Lot falling to <hi>Lucullus</hi> to have that part of <hi>Gaul</hi> that was within the <hi>Alpes,</hi> a Province where no great Action was to be done, nor Glory to be obtained, he was exceedingly troubled: But chiefly, the Succeſs of <hi>Pompey</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> fretted him moſt, being a man highly Renowned, and after the Completion of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> War, the onely one likely to be choſen General againſt <hi>Mithridates.</hi> So that when <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> ſent for Money, and ſignified by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that unleſs it were ſent him, he would leave the Country, and <hi>Sertorius,</hi> and bring his Forces home to <hi>Italy; Lucullus</hi> moſt readily eſpouſed his Cauſe, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney might be ſent him, to prevent any pretence of his returning home during his Conſulſhip; for all things would have been at his Diſpoſal at the Head of ſo great An Army. <hi>Cethegus</hi> a very popular Man both for Words and Actions, the Chief manager of Affairs in <hi>Rome,</hi> had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:35403:177"/>
a mortal hatred againſt him, for declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt his Debaucht, Inſolent, and lewd Life, <hi>Lucullus</hi> therefore openly ſet himſelf againſt him. But <hi>Lucius Quintus,</hi> another Demagogue, inveighing againſt <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Adminiſtration, and endeavouring to put things out of Order, by private Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations and Publick Admonitions, he hindred his Deſign, and ſuppreſſed his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, wiſely and ſafely encountring ſo great an Evil in the very Bud. At this time, News came that <hi>Octavius</hi> the Provincial of <hi>Cilicia</hi> was Dead, and many appeared for the place, courting <hi>Cethegus,</hi> as the man beſt able to ſerve them. <hi>Lucullus</hi> ſet little value upon <hi>Cilicia</hi> it ſelf, no otherwiſe than as he thought by his acceptance of it, no other man beſides himſelf might be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the War againſt <hi>Mithridates,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its nearneſs to <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> This made him uſe all his Intereſt that that Province might be allotted to himſelf, and to none other; which put him upon a Project, not ſo Honeſt and Commendable, as expedient for compaſſing his Deſign, ſubmitting to neceſſity againſt his own Inclination. There was one <hi>Proecia,</hi> a moſt celebrated Wit and Beauty, but in other things nothing better than an impudent Harlot: Who to the Charms of her Perſon, adding the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of one that loved and ſerved her
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:35403:178"/>
Friend, by making thoſe who came to her, as they diſcourſed of the Deſigns and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of their Friends, had got a great Intereſt. She had ſeduced <hi>Cethegus;</hi> the Chiefeſt Man in eſteem and Authority of all the City, and enticed him to her Love, and ſo made all Authority follow her. For nothing of moment was done, wherein <hi>Cethegus</hi> was not concern'd, nothing by <hi>Cethegus</hi> without <hi>Praecia.</hi> This Woman <hi>Lucullus</hi> gain'd to his ſide by Gifts and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery (and great coſt it was to procure ſo ſtately and famous a Dame, to be earneſtly concern'd for <hi>Lucullus</hi>) and preſently found <hi>Cethegus</hi> his Friend, uſing his utmoſt Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to procure <hi>Silicia</hi> for him: Which when once obtained, there was no more need of applying himſelf, either to <hi>Praecia,</hi> or <hi>Cethegus;</hi> for all unanimouſly voted him to the <hi>Mithridatick</hi> War, by no hands likely to be ſo ſucceſsfully managed as his. <hi>Pompey</hi> was ſtill contending with <hi>Sertorius,</hi> and <hi>Metellus</hi> by Age unfit for Service; which two alone were the only Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who could ſtand equal with <hi>Lucullus</hi> for that Command. <hi>Cotta</hi> his Collegue, after much ado in the Senate, was ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the Fleet to guard the <hi>Propontis,</hi> and defend the <hi>Bithynians. Lucullus</hi> liſted his Forces and carried them over into <hi>Aſia,</hi> where he collected ſome freſh ones, the old
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:35403:178"/>
ones being utterly diſabled by diſſoluteneſs and rapine. The <hi>Fimbrians,</hi> as they were called, being utterly unmanageable by their long miſ-uſe, and unfit for ſervice. For theſe were they that had ſlain <hi>Flaccus</hi> the Conſul and General, under <hi>Fimbria,</hi> and theſe were they who afterward betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Fimbria</hi> to <hi>Sylla;</hi> a bold, and barbarous People, warlike, expert and hardy in the field. <hi>Lucullus</hi> in a ſhort time took down the Courage of theſe, and diſciplin'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who then firſt (in all probability) knew what a true Commander, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour was, who in former times had been courted to ſervice, and took up Arms at no bodies Command, but their own Wills.</p>
               <p>The Enemies proviſions for War ſtood thus. <hi>Mithridates,</hi> like many of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters, very proud, and haughty at firſt, ſet upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> with a very unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Army, ſuch indeed as made a good ſhew but was nothing for ſervice; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhamefully routed, and better inſtructed againſt a ſecond Engagement, he formed his Forces into a juſt, and well martiall'd Army. And removing the Dangers, and Inconvenience which might happen among Men of different Nations, and Tongues, and no leſs from gilt and rich Armour, a greater Temptation to the Victors, than
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:35403:179"/>
ſecurity to the Bearers, gave them broad Swords like the <hi>Romans,</hi> and Maſſy Shields; choſe Horſes better for Service than Shape, drew up an hundred and twenty Thouſand Foot in the figure of the <hi>Roman Phalanx;</hi> had ſixteen Thouſand Horſe, beſides Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots Arm'd with Scyths no leſs than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Beſides which he ſet out a Fleet not at all cumbred with Golden Cabins, laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Baths, and Womens furniture, but ſtored with Weapons and Darts and other neceſſaries, and made a deſcent upon <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynia.</hi> Not only theſe parts willingly received him again, but almoſt all <hi>Aſia,</hi> grievouſly oppreſſed before by the <hi>Roman</hi> Extortioners and Publicans, ſeemed to be recovered of their former Diſtemper. Theſe afterwards, who like Harpies ſtole away their very Nouriſhment, <hi>Lucullus</hi> drove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and by reproving them, did what he could to make them more moderate, and thereby prevented a general Sedition, then breaking out in all parts. While <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi> was detained in rectifying this, <hi>Cotta</hi> finding Affairs ripe for Action prepared himſelf for the War with <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and News coming from all hands, that <hi>Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> was then Marching into <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and he thinking Victory juſt almoſt in his hands, leſt his Collegue ſhould ſhare in the Glory of it, haſted to Battel without him. But
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:35403:179"/>
being routed both by Sea and Land, he loſt ſixty Ships with their Men, and four Thouſand Foot: he himſelf was forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and beſieged in <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> there waiting for relief from <hi>Lucullus.</hi> There were thoſe about <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who would have had him leave <hi>Cotta,</hi> and go forward, being then in a ready way to ſurpriſe the defenceleſs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Mithridates.</hi> And it was highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Soldiers, that <hi>Cotta</hi> ſhould not only loſe his own Army, but hinder them alſo from Conqueſt, which at that time without the hazard of a Battel, they might ſo eaſily have obtained. But <hi>Lucullus</hi> in a Solemn Speech declared unto them, That he would rather ſave one Citizen from the Enemy, than be Maſter of all that they had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archelaus</hi> Governor of <hi>Baeotia</hi> under <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi> revolting from him and ſiding with the <hi>Romans,</hi> demonſtrated to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> that upon his bare coming, he might eaſily ſurpriſe all the Country of <hi>Pontus;</hi> but he anſwered, that it did not become him to be more fearful than Huntſmen, to leave the chaſe of the wild Beaſts abroad, and ſeek after ſport in their deſerted Lodges. Having ſo ſaid he made towards <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> with thirty Thouſand foot, and two Thouſand five hundred Horſe. But being come in ſight of his Enemies, he was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:35403:180"/>
at their Numbers, and reſolved to forbear fighting, and wear out time. But <hi>Marius,</hi> whom <hi>Sertorius</hi> had ſent out of <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Mithridates</hi> with Forces under him, ſtepping out and challenging him, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Battel. In the very inſtant of joining no manifeſt alteration preceeding, of a ſudden the Sky opened, and a great Body of light fell down in the midſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Armies, in ſhape like a Hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, but in Colour like melted Silver, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that both Armies being ſurpriſed ſtood off. This wonderful Prodigy hap'ned in <hi>Phrygia</hi> near <hi>Otryae. Lucullus</hi> after this began to think with himſelf, that no Man could have Power and Wealth enough, to ſuſtain ſo great Numbers as <hi>Mithridates</hi> had, for any long time in the face of an Enemy, Commanded one of the Captives to be brought before him, and firſt of all asked him how many Companions were quartered with him, and how much provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he had left behind him? and when he had anſwer'd him, Commanded him to ſtand aſide; then asked a ſecond and a third the ſame queſtion, after which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the quantity of proviſion, with the Men, he found that in three or four days time, his Enemies would be brought to want. As for himſelf he was able to ſubſiſt longer, having ſtor'd his Camp with all
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:35403:180"/>
ſorts of proviſion, and living in plenty, was better able to beſet his hungry Enemy. Which made <hi>Mithridates</hi> ſet forward againſt the <hi>Cyzicenians,</hi> miſerably ſhattered in the fight at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> where they loſt no leſs than three thouſand Citizens, and ten Ships. And that he might the ſafer ſteal away from <hi>Lucullus,</hi> immediately after Supper by the help of a dark, and gloomy Night, he went off, and by the Morning gained the City oppoſite to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſat down with his Forces upon the <hi>Adraſtian</hi> Mount. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi> ſaw his Motion, and purſued him, but daring not to fall upon him with diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Forces, ſate down alſo near the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage called <hi>Thracia,</hi> a convenient paſs, and plentiful place, from whence, and through which all the proviſions for <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Camp muſt of neceſſity come. Whereupon judging of the event, he kept not his mind from his Soldiers, but when the Camp was fortified, and the Works finiſhed, called them together, and with great aſſurance told them, that in few days, without the expence of Bloud, he would bring Victory to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates</hi> beſieged the <hi>Cyzicenians</hi> with ten Camps by Land, and with his Ships blockt up the Strait that was betwixt their City and the Continent, and ſtormed them on all ſides, who were fully prepared ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:35403:181"/>
to receive him, and reſolved to endure the utmoſt extreamity, rather than forſake the <hi>Romans.</hi> That which troubled them moſt was, that they knew not where <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi> was, and heard nothing of him, though at that time his Army was viſible before them. But they were impoſed upon, by the <hi>Mithridatians;</hi> who ſhewing them the <hi>Romans</hi> Encamped on the Hills, Do ye ſee thoſe, ſaid they? thoſe are the Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates,</hi> through the knavery of his Officers, not knowing the want of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in his Camp, was troubled in mind, that the <hi>Cyzicenians</hi> ſhould hold out Siege againſt him: But his Ambition and anger fell, when he ſaw his Soldiers in want, and feeding on Mans fleſh; <hi>Lucullus</hi> being no airy vain-glorious Enemy, but one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Proverb, who made the ſeat of War in their Bellies, by ſeizing on the food, which ſhould ſuſtain them. <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> therefore took advantage of the time, while he was ſtorming a Fort, and ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way almoſt all his Horſe to <hi>Bithynia,</hi> with the Sumpters, and as many of the Foot as were unfit for ſervice. Which <hi>Lucullus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, came to his Camp; and in the Morning during the ſtorm, took ten bands of Foot, and the Horſe with him, and purſued them through Tempeſt and Cold, though the ſeverity of the Weather forc'd ſome of his Soldiers back, who were ready to periſh under it; and with the reſt coming upon the Enemy, near the River <hi>Ryndacus,</hi> overthrew them with ſo great an Overthrow, that the very Women of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:35403:182"/>
                  <hi>Apollonia</hi> came out to ſeize on the Booty, and rob the Slain. Great numbers, as we may ſuppoſe, were ſlain, ſix Thouſand Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes taken, with an infinite number of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Cattel, and no leſs than fifteen Thouſand Men; all which he led along by the Enemies Camp. And here I cannot but wonder at <hi>Saluſt,</hi> who ſays, That this was the firſt time Camels were ſeen by the <hi>Romans;</hi> as if he thought thoſe who fought under <hi>Scipio</hi> againſt <hi>Antiochus</hi> before, or thoſe lately under the Command of <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> againſt the <hi>Orchomenians</hi> about <hi>Chaero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> had not known what a Camel was. But however, 'tis well known, that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi> ſoon fled, and contrived Delays and Diverſions for <hi>Lucullus,</hi> while he ſent his Admiral <hi>Ariſtonicus</hi> to the <hi>Greek</hi> Sea; who was betray'd in the very inſtant of going off, and <hi>Lucullus</hi> became Maſter of him, and ten Thouſand pieces of Gold, which he was carrying with him, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſome of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army. After which, <hi>Mithridates</hi> himſelf made for the Sea, leaving the Foot-Officers to conduct the Army; upon whom <hi>Lucullus</hi> fell about the River <hi>Granicus,</hi> where he took a vaſt number alive, and ſlew 15000. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that the number of fighting Men, and others who followed the Camp, deſtroy'd, amounted to thirty Myriads.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:35403:183"/>
                  <hi>Lucullus</hi> firſt went into <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> and then fitting his Navy, ſail'd away into the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and arriving at <hi>Troas,</hi> he lodg'd in the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> where in the night he thought he ſaw the Goddeſs coming to him, and ſaying, <hi>Why ſleepeſt thou, great Lion, when the Fawns are nigh?</hi> Riſing up hereupon, he called his Friends to him, and told them his Viſion; at which inſtant ſome <hi>Ilians</hi> being preſent, acquainted him, that thirteen of the King's <hi>Quinqueremes</hi> were ſeen off of the <hi>Achean</hi> Haven, ſailing for <hi>Lemnos.</hi> He took theſe, and ſlew their Admiral <hi>Iſidorus;</hi> and then made after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Squadron, who were in Harbour, with their Veſſels aſhoar, but fought from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-deck, and ſorely gall'd <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s Men; there being neither room to ſail round them, nor to bear upon them for any damage, while they ſtood ſecure, and fix'd on the Sand. After much ado, at the only Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place of all the Iſland, he Landed the Choiceſt of his Men, who falling upon the Enemy behind, kill'd ſome, and forced others to cut their Cables, who making from the Shoar, fell foul upon one another, or came within reach of <hi>Lucullus</hi> his Fleet. Many were kill'd in the Action. Among the Captives was <hi>Marius</hi> the Commander, ſent by <hi>Sertorius,</hi> a Man who had but one Eye: And it was <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s ſtrict Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:35403:183"/>
to his Men before the Engagement, that they ſhould kill no Man who had but one Eye, that he might rather die under diſgrace and reproach. This being over, he haſtned his Purſuit after <hi>Mithridates,</hi> whom he hoped to find at <hi>Bithynia,</hi> block'd up by <hi>Voconius,</hi> whom he ſent out before to <hi>Nicomedia</hi> with part of the Fleet, to ſtop his Flight: But <hi>Voconius,</hi> by his mirth and jollity in <hi>Samothracia,</hi> ſlipt out his opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Mithridates</hi> being paſs'd by with all his Fleet; who haſtning into <hi>Pontus</hi> before <hi>Lucullus</hi> came up to him, was nevertheleſs catch'd in a Storm, which diſperſed his Fleet, and ſunk ſeveral Ships. The Wreck floated on all the neighbouring Shoar for many days after. The Ship wherein he himſelf was, uncapable of being brought aſhoar by the Maſters for its bigneſs, rolling up and down in the Flood, being heavy with Water and ready to ſink, he left, and went aboard a Pyratical Veſſel, delivering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the hands of Pyrats, and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly and wonderfully came ſafe to <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi> in <hi>Pontus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There hapned a generous Emulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Lucullus</hi> and the Senate: For they having decreed him 3000 Talents to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh out a Navy, he himſelf was againſt it, and ſent them word, that without ſo great Supplies, by the Confederate Shipping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:35403:184"/>
he did not in the leaſt doubt but to rout <hi>Mithridates</hi> from the Sea. And ſo he did, by Aſſiſtance from above; for 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that <hi>Diana Priapina</hi> ſent the great Tempeſt upon the People of <hi>Pontus,</hi> becauſe they had robbed her Temple, and removed her Image. When many were perſwading <hi>Lucullus</hi> to go directly on, he rejected their Counſel, and march'd through <hi>Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> to the King's Country; in ſo great ſcarcity of Proviſion at firſt, that thirty Thouſand <hi>Galatians</hi> followed, every Man carrying a Buſhel of Wheat at his Back. But he ſubduing all in his Progreſs before him, at laſt arrived at ſo great Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that an Ox was ſold in the Camp for a ſingle Groat, and a Slave for four. The other Booty they made no account of, but took and deſtroyed as they pleaſed; there being no Conteſt among them, where all were ſatisfied. But inaſmuch as they had made frequent Incurſions and Advances, as far as <hi>Themiſcyra</hi> and the inner <hi>Thermodon,</hi> and had laid waſte the Country before them, they began to diſcourſe with <hi>Lucullus</hi> in good earneſt, <q>Why he took ſo many Towns by Surrender, and never an one by Storm, which might enrich them with the Plunder. And now, forſooth leaving <hi>Amiſus</hi> behind, a rich and wealthy City, of eaſie Conqueſt (if cloſely beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:35403:184"/>
to carry us into the <hi>Tibarenian</hi> and <hi>Chaldean</hi> Wilderneſs, to fight with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>Lucullus</hi> little thinking this would be of ſo dangerous conſequence as it afterwards prov'd, took no notice of it, but ſlighted it, and chooſe rather to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thoſe who blamed his Tardineſs, in loſing time about ſmall pitiful Places, not worth the while, and allowing <hi>Mithridates</hi> time to recruit. <q>That is what I deſign, ſaid he, and am contriving by my delay, that he may grow great again, and gather a conſiderable Army, which may induce him to ſtand, and not fly away before us, for do ye not ſee the vaſt and boundleſs Wilderneſs behind? <hi>Caucaſus</hi> is not far off, and the ſteep and craggy Mountains, enough to conceal numbers of Kings in their flight from Battel. Beſides, 'tis a Journey but of few days from <hi>Cabira</hi> to <hi>Armenia,</hi> where <hi>Tigranes</hi> Reigns, King of Kings, who by his Power diſſolved the <hi>Parthian</hi> Empire in <hi>Aſia,</hi> brought ſeveral <hi>Greek</hi> Towns under the <hi>Median</hi> Yoke, Conquered <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Palaeſtine;</hi> extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the Royal Line of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and carried away their Wives and Daughters by violence. This ſame is Relation and Son-in-Law to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and cannot but receive him upon entreaty, and enter into War with us to defend him; ſo that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:35403:185"/>
while we endeavour to depoſe <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> we ſhall endanger the bringing in of <hi>Tigranes</hi> againſt us, who already hath ſought occaſion to fall out with us, but can never find one ſo juſtifiable as the Succour of a Friend and neceſſitous Prince. Why therefore ſhould we put <hi>Mithridates</hi> upon this ſtrait, who as yet knows not how he may beſt fight with us, and utterly diſdains to ſtoop to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes;</hi> and not rather allow him time to gather a new Army and grow inſolent, that we our ſelves might fight with the <hi>Colchians</hi> and <hi>Tibarenians,</hi> whom we have often defeated already, and not with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> and <hi>Armenians.</hi>
                  </q> Upon theſe Motives <hi>Lucullus</hi> ſat down before <hi>Amiſus,</hi> and ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried on the Siege; but the Winter being well ſpent, he left <hi>Murena</hi> in charge with it, and went himſelf againſt <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi> then Rendezvouzing at <hi>Cabira,</hi> and reſolving to wait for the <hi>Romans</hi> with forty Thouſand Foot about him, and thirteen Thouſand Horſe, wherein he chiefly confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But paſſing the River <hi>Lycus,</hi> he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged the <hi>Romans</hi> into the Plains, where the Cavalry engaged, and the <hi>Romans</hi> were beaten. <hi>Pomponius,</hi> a Man of good note, was taken, wounded, and ſore, and in pain as he was, was carried before <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and asked by the King, If by ſaving his
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:35403:185"/>
Life, he would become his Friend, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Yes, if thou, O King, wilt be reconciled to the <hi>Romans;</hi> if not, thy Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. <hi>Mithridates</hi> wondred at him, and did him no hurt. The Enemy being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Plains, <hi>Lucullus</hi> was ſomething afraid and delayed getting to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, being very large, woody, and almoſt inacceſſible; when by good luck ſome <hi>Greeks,</hi> who had fled into a Cave, were taken, the eldeſt of whom, <hi>Artemidorus</hi> by name, promiſed to bring <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and ſeat him in a place of ſafety for his Army, and a Fort that overlook'd <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bira. Lucullus</hi> believing him, lighted his Fires, and marched in the Night, and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſing the Strait, gained the Port, and in the Morning was ſeen above the Enemy, pitching his Camp in a place advantageous to deſcend upon them, if he deſired to fight; and ſecure from being forced, if to lie ſtill. Neither ſide was willing to engage at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but 'tis reported that ſome of the King's Party being hunting a Stag, ſome <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> quartered upon them and met them. Whereupon they Skirmiſhed, more ſtill drawing together to each ſide. In ſhort, the King's Party prevailed, where, upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> from their Camp ſeeing their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions fly, were enraged, ran to <hi>Lucullus</hi> with Intreaties to lead them out, preſſing
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:35403:186"/>
that Sign might be given for Battel. But he, that they might know of what conſequence the Preſence and Appearance of a wiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour is in time of Conflict and Danger, commanded them to ſtand ſtill; but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf went down into the Plains, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the foremoſt that fled, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to ſtand, and turn back with him. Theſe obeying, the reſt followed, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up a Body, with no great difficulty drove back the Enemies, and purſued them to their Camp. After his return, <hi>Lucullus</hi> inflicted a juſt puniſhment upon the Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and made them dig a Trench naked, of twelve Foot, while the reſt ſtood by and look'd on.</p>
               <p>There was in <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Camp one <hi>Olthacus,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Dardarians,</hi> a Barbarous People, living near the Lake <hi>Maeotis,</hi> a Man remarkable for Strength and Courage in Fight, Wiſe in Council, and Pleaſant and Free in Converſation. He, out of Emulation and Glory, outvying the reſt of the Lords, promiſed a great piece of Service to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> no leſs than the Death of <hi>Lucullus.</hi> The King commended his Reſolution, and according to agreement counterfeited Anger, and ſlighted him; whereupon he took Horſe and fled to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus,</hi> who kindly received him, being a Man of great Credit in the Army. After
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:35403:186"/>
ſome ſhort trial of his Sagacity and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he found way to <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s Board and Council. The <hi>Dardarian</hi> thinking he had a fair opportunity, commanded his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to lead his Horſe out of the Camp, while he himſelf, as the Soldiers were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and eaſing themſelves in the Shade, it being then High-noon, went to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's Tent, not at all ſuſpecting that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance would be denied him, who was ſo familiar with the General, and came under pretence of extraordinary Buſineſs with him. He had certainly been admitted, had not Sleep, which hath deſtroyed many Captains, ſaved <hi>Lucullus.</hi> For ſo it was, that <hi>Menedemus,</hi> one of the Bed chamber, was ſtanding at the Door, who told <hi>Oltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> that it was altogether unſeaſonable to ſee him, ſince after long Watching and hard Labour, he was but juſt before laid down to compoſe him. <hi>Olthacus</hi> would not go away upon this Denial, but ſtill perſiſted, ſaying, that he muſt go in to diſcourſe of ſome neceſſary Affairs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Menedemus</hi> grew angry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, That nothing was more neceſſary than the ſafety of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and forced him away with both hands. Whereupon, out of ſear, he ſtraightway left the Camp, took Horſe, and without Effect returned to <hi>Mithridates. Thus in Time, as in Phyſick,</hi>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:35403:187"/>
                  <hi>there are Moments of Life and Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Somatius</hi> being ſent out with ten Companies for Forage, and purſued by <hi>Menander,</hi> one of <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, ſtood his Ground, and after a ſharp Engagement ſlew and deſtroyed the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. <hi>Adrianus</hi> being ſent afterward with other Forces, to procure Food enough and to ſpare for the Camp, <hi>Mithridates</hi> would by no means ſuffer him, but diſpatch'd <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remachus</hi> and <hi>Myro</hi> with a great Force, both Horſe and Foot, againſt him; all which, except two, (as is reported) were cut off by the <hi>Romans. Mithridates</hi> concealed the Loſs, giving it out, that it was a ſmall Defeat, nothing near ſo great as reported, and occaſioned chiefly by the unskilfulneſs of the Leaders. But <hi>Adrianus</hi> in great Pomp paſſed by his Camp, having many Waggons full of Corn, and other Booty; which brought Deſpair upon himſelf, and Confuſion and a horrible Conſternation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Army. 'Twas reſolv'd therefore no longer to ſtay. But when the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſent away their own Goods in quiet, and hindred others from doing ſo too, in great fury they thronged and crowded to the Gates, ſeized on the Guards and kill'd them; where <hi>Dorylaus</hi> the Captain, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing elſe beſides his Purple Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, loſt his Life for the ſame; and <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moeus</hi>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:35403:187"/>
the Prieſt was trod under foot in the Gate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates</hi> having none of his Guards or Attendance with him, got out of the Camp in the Throng, but had none of his Horſes with him; but <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the Eunuch looking back, and ſeeing him flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the others, diſmounted, and gave his Horſe to the King. The <hi>Romans,</hi> as they preſſed on, were juſt ready to take him, the cloſe Purſuit which they made, reaching up juſt to him: But Greedineſs and Avarice hindred the <hi>Romans</hi> from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring that Booty, which in ſo many Fights and Hazards they had ſought after, and hindred <hi>Lucullus</hi> from the Glory of Conqueſt: For the Horſe which carried the King was juſt ready to be ſeized; but one of the Mules that carried the Sumpter, either by accident ſteping in, or by order of the King ſo appointed to go between him and the Purſuers, they ſeized and pilfered the Gold, and falling out among themſelves about, the prey let ſlip the great Prize. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was their Greedineſs prejudicial to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi> in this only, but alſo they ſlew <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtratus</hi> the King's Secretary, under ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of having five hundred pieces of Gold quilred up in his Clothes, whom he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be conveyed ſafe into the Camp; notwithſtanding all which, he gave them
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:35403:188"/>
leave to plunder the Camp. After this, in <hi>Cabira,</hi> and other ſtrong Holds which he took, he found great Treaſures, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Priſons, wherein many <hi>Greeks,</hi> and many of the Kings Relations had of old been confin'd: who counting themſelves no other than dead Men, by the Favour of <hi>Lucullus</hi> met not only with Relief, but a new Life and Reſurrection: <hi>Nyſſa</hi> Siſter of <hi>Mithridates</hi> was made Captive by a bleſſed Captivity: but thoſe who ſeemed to be moſt out of danger, Wives and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at <hi>Pharnacia,</hi> placed in ſafety as they thought, all miſerably periſhed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming back of <hi>Bacchides</hi> the Eunuch from <hi>Mithridates</hi> to them. Among others, there were two Siſters of the King, <hi>Roxana</hi> and <hi>Statira,</hi> Virgins of forty years old, and two <hi>Ionian</hi> Wives, <hi>Bernice</hi> of <hi>Chios,</hi> and <hi>Monime</hi> of <hi>Mileſium.</hi> This latter was the moſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> becauſe ſhe ſo long withſtood the King in his Courtſhip to her, when he preſented her with fifteen thouſand Pieces of Gold, until ſuch time as the Marriage was conſummate, the Crown was ſent her, and ſhe was ſaluted Queen. She had been a ſorrowful Woman before, and often bewailed her Beauty, that had procured her a Keeper in ſtead of a Husband, and Watch of <hi>Barbarians</hi> in ſtead of a Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Houſe and Attendance. Being removed
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:35403:188"/>
from <hi>Greece,</hi> ſhe enjoyed the Pleaſure, which ſhe propoſed to her ſelf, only in a Dream, being in the mean time robb'd of that which is real. <hi>Bacchides</hi> came and bid them prepare for Death, as every one thought moſt agreeable and eaſie. She took the Diadem from her Head, and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the String to her Neck, ſuſpended her ſelf therewith: Which being ſoon broke, <q>O curſed Head-band, ſaid ſhe, not at all able to help me in this ſmall thing!</q> And throwing it away, ſhe ſpat on it, and gave her Neck to <hi>Bacchides. Bernice</hi> had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Potion for her ſelf, but at her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's intreaty, who ſtood by, ſhe gave her part of it: Both drank of the Potion, which prevailed over the weaker Body; but <hi>Bernice</hi> having drank too little, was nothing changed, but being ſomething indiſpoſed, was ſtrangled by <hi>Bacchides</hi> for haſte. 'Tis ſaid that one of the unmarried Siſters, with bitter Execrations and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, drank the Poiſon; but <hi>Statira</hi> uttered nothing ungentile or reproachful, but, on the contrary, commended her Brother, who in his own Danger neglected not theirs, but carefully provided, that without ſhame or diſgrace they might go out of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucullus,</hi> being a tender and good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd Man, was concerned at theſe things;
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:35403:189"/>
but however going on, he came to <hi>Talau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> from whence, four days before his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, <hi>Mithridates</hi> fled, and was got to <hi>Tigranes</hi> in <hi>Armenia.</hi> Whereupon he took in the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Tibarenians,</hi> with the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> and having placed Garriſons in their Cities, he ſent <hi>Appius</hi> to <hi>Tigranes</hi> to demand <hi>Mithridates.</hi> He himſelf went to <hi>Amiſus,</hi> which ſtill held out Siege under the Command of <hi>Callimachus,</hi> who by his great Skill and no leſs Experiencein Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticks, as much as could be ſhown in a Siege, incommoded the <hi>Romans;</hi> for which after he paid dear enough: For <hi>Lucullus</hi> unexpectedly coming upon him at the ſame time of the Day when the Soldiers uſed to lie quiet and ſtill, gained part of the Wall, and forced him to leave the City, which he fired, either envying the <hi>Romans</hi> the Booty, or at leaſt contriving his own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the better thereby. No Man look'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe who went off, but as ſoon as the Fire had ſeized on moſt part of the Wall, the Soldiers prepared themſelves for Plunder; where <hi>Lucullus</hi> pitying the Ruins of the City, brought Aſſiſtance from without, and encourag'd his Men to extinguiſh the Flames. But all Men being intent upon the Prey, and giving no heed to him, with great ſhoutings brandiſhed their Weapons in the Air; whereupon he was compelled
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:35403:189"/>
to let them plunder, that by that means at leaſt he might ſave the City from Fire. But they did quite contrary; for in ſearching the Houſes with Lights and Torches, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where with them they increas'd the flames; inſomuch that <hi>Lucullus</hi> the next day went in, and weeping, ſaid to his Friends, that he had often before bleſſed the Fortune of <hi>Sylla,</hi> but never ſo much admir'd it as then, becauſe when he was willing, he was alſo able to ſave <hi>Athens;</hi> but my infelicity is ſuch, that while I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to imitate him, I become like <hi>Mommius.</hi> Nevertheleſs he endeavoured to ſave as much of the City as he could; and at the ſame time alſo, by a lucky Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the Rain concurred to extinguiſh the Fire. He himſelf, while preſent, repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Ruins as much as he could, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Inhabitants who fled, and ſetling as many <hi>Greeks</hi> as were willing to live there adding a hundred and twenty Furlongs of Ground to the Place.</p>
               <p>This City was a Colony of <hi>Athens,</hi> built at that time when ſhe flouriſhed, and was powerfull at Sea; upon which account thoſe who fled from <hi>Ariſto</hi>'s Tyranny, ſetled here and, were made free; but had the ill luck to fly from Evils at home, intogreater abroad. As many of theſe as ſurvived, <hi>Lucullus</hi> furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every one with Clothes, and two hundred
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:35403:190"/>
Groats, and ſent them away into their own Country; at which time <hi>Tyrannio</hi> the <hi>Grammarian</hi> was taken. <hi>Murena</hi> begg'd him of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and took him, and ſet him free; but he abuſed <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s Favour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; for he by no means liked that a Man of Learning ſhould be firſt made a Slave, then Free; for Freedom thus ſpeciouſly granted again, was a real deprivation of what he had before. But not in this Caſe alone <hi>Murena</hi> ſhew'd himſelf far inferiour in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity to the General: <hi>Lucullus</hi> was now buſie in looking after the Affairs of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and having no War to divert his time, ſpent it in the diſtribution of Juſtice, which by the continuance of diſmal Troubles and Revolutions, had been for a long time a ſtranger in the Province; which was then alſo miſerably oppreſſed and enſlaved by Publicans and Uſurpers, inſomuch that they were forced privately to ſell their Sons in the flower of their Youth, and their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their Virginity, and their Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gifts, Pictures, and holy Images in the open Market, and in the end to yield up themſelves Slaves to their Creditors; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which worſer troubles lay upon them, which were Tortures, Impriſonments, Racks, ſtanding abroad to be ſcorched when the Sun was near, and confin'd to ſtand in ice and clay in the cold; inſomuch that
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:35403:190"/>
flavery was no leſs than redemption, and joy to them. <hi>Lucullus</hi> in a ſhort time freed the Cities from all theſe evils and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; for firſt of all, he ordered there ſhould be no more taken than One <hi>per Cent.</hi> Secondly, where the uſe was greater than the Principal, it ſhould wholly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed: the Third, and moſt conſiderable Order was, that the Creditor ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the fourth part of the Debtors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; but if mens perſons were engaged, it was utterly diſallowed; inſomuch that in the ſpace of four years all debts were paid, and lands return'd to their right Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The publick debt was contracted when <hi>Aſia</hi> was fin'd twenty thouſand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents by <hi>Sylla,</hi> but twice as much was paid to the Collectors, who by Uſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt had at laſt advanced it to a hundred and twenty thouſand Talents. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they inveighed againſt <hi>Lucullus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> as injured by him, and by their Wealth, and Credit, which they had over many of the Principal Officers, they ſtirr'd up ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral leading Men againſt him. But <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi> was not only beloved by thoſe People whom he obliged, but was alſo wiſhed for by other Provinces, who bleſſed the good luck of thoſe, who had ſuch a Governour over them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Appius Clodius,</hi> who was ſent to <hi>Tigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:35403:191"/>
(the ſame <hi>Clodius,</hi> was Brother to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi>'s Wife) being led by the Kings guides in an unneceſſary, and tedious way, over the Mountains, through many Windings, and Turnings, being better informed by his Free-man, a <hi>Syrian</hi> by Nation, of the direct rode, left that long and fallacious one; and kindly bidding the <hi>Barbarians</hi> his Guides adieu, in a few days paſſed over <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and came to <hi>Antiochia</hi> upon <hi>Daphne.</hi> There being commanded to wait for <hi>Tigranes,</hi> (who at that time was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of <hi>Phoenicia</hi>) he brought over many great Men to his ſide, who unwillingly had ſubmitted to the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> (among whom was <hi>Zarbienus</hi> King of the <hi>Gordyeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>) where alſo many of the Conquered Cities Correſponded privately with him, whom he aſſured of relief from <hi>Lucullus,</hi> but ordered them to lie ſtill at preſent. The <hi>Armenian</hi> Government was very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and intolerable to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of the preſent King, who growing inſolent and proud with his Succeſs, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all things valuable and eſteem'd among men, that had been already in his power and purpoſely created for him alone. From a ſmall, and inconſiderable riſe, he had Conquered many Nations, broke the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Power (more than any before him) and filled <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> with <hi>Greeks,</hi> whom
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:35403:191"/>
he carried out of <hi>Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> He tranſplanted the Wild <hi>Arabs</hi> from their Country, and manner of living, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them near him for improvement of Trade.</p>
               <p>Many Kings ſerv'd at his Table, but four he always carried with him as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Guards, who ran by his Horſe ſide in poor habit, and with folded hands at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him, when ſitting on his Throne, and publiſhing his Decrees to the People: Which poſture of all others was that which moſt expreſſed ſlavery, it being of Men, who had bid adieu to Liberty, and had prepar'd their Bodies more for the Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than ſervice of their Maſters. <hi>Appi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> being nothing diſmayed, or ſurprized at ſo Tragical a ſight, ſo ſoon as audience was granted him, ſaid, he came to demand <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi> due to <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s triumph, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to denounce War againſt <hi>Tigranes:</hi> Inſomuch that tho <hi>Tigranes</hi> endeavoured to receive him with a pleaſing Countenance and a compoſed Smile, he could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his concern to them who ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, at the frank humour of the young Man; for it was the firſt time in twenty five years any free Speech had been uttered to him, ſo many years had he then Reigned. But however he made anſwer to <hi>Appius,</hi> That he would not deſert <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:35403:192"/>
but would make the <hi>Romans</hi> pay dear enough for beginning the War. That he was angry with <hi>Lucullus</hi> for calling him only King in his Letter, and not King of kings, and therefore in his Anſwer he would not call him <hi>Imperator.</hi> Great Gifts were ſent to <hi>Appius,</hi> which he refuſed; but they being augmented, that he might not ſeem to go away in Anger, he took one Goblet, and ſent the reſt back, and went off to the General. <hi>Tigranes</hi> before this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vouchſafed to ſee nor ſpeak with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi> tho a near Kinſman, and forced out of ſo conſiderable a Kingdom; but proudly and ſcornfully at a diſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd him, and in a manner ſecured him in Mooriſh and unhealthy Places; but then with reſpect and kindneſs ſent for him, and at a private conference between them in the Palace, they healed up all private jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies between them, puniſhing their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, who bore all the blame: Among whom <hi>Metrodorus Scepſius</hi> was one, a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and learned Man, and a boſom Friend, vulgarly called the King's Father. <hi>This Man as it hapned, being employed in an Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy by</hi> Mithridates <hi>to ſollicite help againſt the</hi> Romans, Tigranes <hi>ask'd him, What would you,</hi> Metrodorus, <hi>adviſe me to in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair? In return to which, either out of good Will to</hi> Tigranes, <hi>or of deſire to have</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:35403:192"/>
                  <hi>taken off, made Anſwer, That as Embaſſador he counſell'd him to it, but as a Friend diſſwaded him from it.</hi> This <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi> reported, and affirmed to <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi> thinking that no harm would come of it to <hi>Metrodorus.</hi> But upon this he was preſently taken off, for which <hi>Tigranes</hi> was ſorry, being not indeed the principal cauſe of <hi>Metrodorus</hi>'s death, but no ſmall additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the anger of <hi>Mithridates</hi> againſt him; for he privately hated him before, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Cabinet-Papers when taken, wherein it was ordered that <hi>Metrodorus</hi> ſhould die; <hi>Tigranes</hi> buried him ſplendidly, ſparing no coſt to his dead Body, whom he betrayed when alive. In <hi>Tigranes</hi>'s Court died alſo <hi>Amphicrates</hi> the Orator, (if at leaſt for <hi>Athens</hi> ſake, we may remember him,) for 'tis reported that he fled to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucia,</hi> upon the River <hi>Tygris,</hi> and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to teach Philoſophy among them, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogantly reply'd, that the Diſh was too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to hold a Dolphin. Wherefore he came to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and Queen to <hi>Tigranes,</hi> but being accuſed of high Miſdemeanors, and prohibited all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with his Country-men, ſoon ended his Days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucullus,</hi> when he had eſtabliſhed whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws, and a laſting Peace in <hi>Aſia,</hi> did not altogether baniſh Pleaſure, and Mirth;
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:35403:193"/>
but during his reſidence at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Country with Sports, Feſtival Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, Wreſtling Games, and Prizes. And they in requital, inſtituted others, called <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullian</hi> Games, in honour to him, thereby manifeſting their real love to him, which was of more value to him, than all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the World. But when <hi>Appius</hi> came to him, and told him he muſt prepare for War, he went again into <hi>Pontus,</hi> and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together his Army, beſieged <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nope,</hi> or rather thoſe of the Kings ſide who held it; who thereupon killed moſt of the <hi>Synopeans,</hi> and ſet the City on fire, and by night endeavoured to eſcape: Which when <hi>Lucullus</hi> perceived, he came upon the City, and killed Eight thouſand of thoſe who were left behind; but to the others he reſtored what was their own, and took ſpecial care for the Welfare of the City. To which he was chiefly prompted by this Viſion. One ſeemed to come to him in his ſleep, and ſay, Go on a little further <hi>Lucullus:</hi> for <hi>Autoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> is coming to ſee Thee. When he aroſe, he could not imagine what the Viſion meant. The ſame day he took the City, and as he was purſuing the <hi>Cilicians,</hi> who were fled, he ſaw a Statue lying on the Shoar, which the <hi>Cilicians</hi> carried ſo far, but had not time to carry it aboard. It was one of the Maſter-pieces of <hi>Sthenis:</hi> And one
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:35403:193"/>
told him, that it was the Statue of <hi>Autoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> the Founder of the City. Which ſame <hi>Autolicus</hi> is reported to be Son to <hi>Dima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and one of thoſe who under <hi>Hercules</hi> went in the Expedition out of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Amazons;</hi> from whence, in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with <hi>Demoleon,</hi> and <hi>Phlogius,</hi> he loſt his Veſſel on a point of the <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pedalion.</hi> He himſelf, with his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and their Weapons, being ſaved, came to <hi>Synope,</hi> and diſpoſſeſt the <hi>Syrians</hi> there. The <hi>Syrians</hi> held it, deſcended from <hi>Syrus,</hi> (as is reported) the Son of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nope,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Aſopis.</hi> Which as ſoon as <hi>Lucullus</hi> heard, he remembred the ſaying of <hi>Sylla,</hi> who poſitively affirms in his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs,</hi> That nothing is ſo credible, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond diſpute, as what is revealed in Dreams.</p>
               <p>But as ſoon as it was told him that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi> and <hi>Tigranes</hi> were juſt ready to tranſport their Forces into <hi>Lycaonia</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,</hi> he much wondred why the <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> if he had any real intention to fight with the <hi>Romans,</hi> did not aſſiſt <hi>Mithridates</hi> in his flouriſhing condition, and joyn For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces when he was fit for ſervice; but ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be vanquiſht, and broken in pieces, ſhould now, at laſt, upon ſlender hopes, begin the War, and throw himſelf down headlong with them, who were irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably fal'n already. But when <hi>Macares</hi>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:35403:194"/>
the Son of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and Governour of the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> ſent him a Crown valued at a thouſand pieces of Gold, and deſired to be liſted a Friend, and Confederate of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he juſtly reputed that War at an end, and left <hi>Sornatius</hi> his Deputy, with Six thouſand Souldiers to take care of the Province. He himſelf, with Twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and little leſs than Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, advanced to the ſecond War. But it was very plain, that with two great, and ill-adviſed ſpeed, he Marched againſt Warlike Nations, many Thouſands of Horſe, into a vaſt Champaign, every way encloſed with deep Rivers, and Snowy Mountains. Which made the Souldiers, beſides the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their ranks, with great unwillingneſs, and reluctancy, follow him. When as at the ſame time alſo the Tribunes at home pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly inveighed, and declared againſt him, as one that raiſed up War after War, not ſo much for the Intereſt of the Republick, as that he himſelf, being ſtill in Commiſſion, might not lay down Arms, but go on en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching himſelf by the Publick loſs. Theſe Men, at laſt, were even with him. But <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus,</hi> by long journeys, came to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where finding the Waters out, and rough, by reaſon of the late Winter, was much troubled for fear of a delay, where danger might come on him, while he procured
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:35403:194"/>
Boats, and made a Bridge of them. But in the evening the flood giving, and decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing more in the night, the next day they ſaw the River within his Banks: Inſomuch that the Inhabitants diſcovering the little Iſlands in the River, and the Water ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting round them, a thing which had rarely hapned before, worſhipped <hi>Lucullus,</hi> before whom the very River was humble and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive, and yielded an eaſie and ſwift paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Making uſe of the opportunity, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried over his Army, and met with a lucky ſign at landing. Holy Heifers are preſerved on purpoſe for <hi>Diana Perſica,</hi> whom of all the Gods, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> beyond <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> chiefly adore. They uſe only Heifers for her Sacrifices. Which, at other times, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up and down undiſturbed, with the Mark of the Goddeſs upon them, <hi>ſhining</hi>

                  <hi>brightneſs;</hi> and it is no ſmall, nor eaſie thing, when occaſion requires to ſeize one of them. But one of theſe, when the Army had paſſed <hi>Euphrates,</hi> coming to a Rock Conſecrated to the Goddeſs, ſtood upon it, and then laying down her Neck, like others that are forc'd down with a Rope, offered her ſelf to <hi>Lucullus</hi> for Sacrifice: Beſides which, he offered alſo a Congratulatory Bull to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> for his ſafe paſſage. All that day he tarried there, but on the next, and thoſe that followed, he travelled
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:35403:195"/>
through <hi>Sophene,</hi> uſing no manner of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to thoſe who came to him, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly received his Army. But when the Soldiers were deſirous to plunder a Caſtle, that ſeemed to be well ſtored within. <q>That is the Caſtle, ſaid he, that we muſt ſtorm, ſhewing them <hi>Taurus</hi> at a diſtance; there are the rewards of Triumph:</q> Wherefore haſtning his March, and paſſing the <hi>Tigris,</hi> he came over into <hi>Armenia;</hi> The firſt Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger that gave notice of <hi>Lucullus</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was ſo far from pleaſing <hi>Tigranes,</hi> that he had his Head cut off for his pains; and no Man daring to bring farther Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; without any Intelligence at all, <hi>Tigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> ſate fuming with Hoſtility and Wrath, giving ear only to thoſe who flattered him, by ſaying, That <hi>Lucullus</hi> would ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a greater Commander, by ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Tigranes</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> than by his run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> frighted with the many Thouſands that come againſt him. <q>He is a Man of a ſtrong Body that can carry off a load of Wine, and of a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Conſtitution that can digeſt Felicity.</q> 
                  <hi>Mithrobarzanes,</hi> one of his chief Favorites, firſt dar'd to tell him the truth: But had no more thanks for his pains, than to be immediately ſent out againſt <hi>Lucullus</hi> with Three thouſand Horſe, and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Foot, with peremptory Commands
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:35403:195"/>
to bring him alive, and trample down his Army. Some of <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s Men were then pitching their Camp, and the reſt were coming up to them, when the Scouts gave notice that the Enemy was approaching, whereupon he was in fear leſt they ſhould fall upon him, while his Men were at a diſtance, and not come up into a Body: Which made him ſtay for ſetling the Camp himſelf; and ſend out <hi>Sextilius</hi> the Legate with Sixteen hundred Horſe, and almoſt as many heavy and light Arms, with Orders to advance upon the Enemy, and keep their ground, until Intelligence came to him that the Camp was finiſhed. <hi>Sextilius</hi> deſigned to have kept this Order: But <hi>Mithrobarzanes</hi> himſelf coming furiouſly upon him, he was forced to fight. In the Engagement <hi>Mithrobarzanes</hi> himſelf fighting, was ſlain, and all his Men, except a few who run away, were deſtroyed. After which <hi>Tigranes</hi> left <hi>Tigranocerta,</hi> a great City built by himſelf, and retired to <hi>Taurus,</hi> and called all his Forces about him.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Lucullus</hi> giving him no time to Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous, ſent out <hi>Murena</hi> to hinder, and cut off thoſe who Marched to <hi>Tigranes,</hi> and <hi>Sextilius</hi> alſo to diſperſe a great Company of <hi>Arabians</hi> then going to the King; both <hi>Sextilius</hi> fell upon the <hi>Arabians</hi> in their Camp, and deſtroyed moſt of them; and alſo <hi>Murena,</hi> in his purſuit after <hi>Tigranes</hi>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:35403:196"/>
through a Craggy and Narrow way, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely fell upon him: Upon which <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi> throwing away all cumbrances, fled; many of the <hi>Armenians</hi> were killed, and more taken. After this Succeſs <hi>Lucullus</hi> went to <hi>Tigranocerta,</hi> and ſitting down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the City, beſieged it. In it were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Greeks</hi> carried away out of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and many <hi>Barbarians</hi> in like circumſtances with the <hi>Greeks, Arraberrians, Aſſyrians, Gordye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and <hi>Cappadocians,</hi> whoſe Countries he had deſtroyed, and forced away the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to ſettle here. It was a rich and beautiful City; every Nobleman, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner, in imitation of the King, ſtudied to enlarge and adorn it. Which made <hi>Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> more vigorouſly aſſault it, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that <hi>Tigranes</hi> would by no means ſuffer him, but even againſt his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come down in anger to force him away; Wherein he rightly Judged. <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> earneſtly diſſwaded him from it, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meſſengers to him not to engage, but rather with his Horſe to hinder him from forraging. <hi>Taxiles</hi> alſo the Meſſenger, then in his Army, very much intreated the King to forbear and avoid the <hi>Roman</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as a Buſineſs not to be medled with at that time. To this he hearkened at firſt, but when the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and <hi>Gordyenians</hi> in a full Body, and the joint-Forces of <hi>Medes</hi>

and <hi>Adiabenians</hi> under their reſpective Kings, came up to him: When many <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> came up the River from <hi>Babylon,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, <hi>Albanians, Ibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> and their Neighbours, and not a few of the ungovernable People near <hi>Araxe</hi> by intreaty and hire, came together up to him; all the Kings Tables and Councils rung of nothing but Expectations, Boaſtings, and Barbarick Threatnings. <hi>Taxiles</hi> went in danger of his Life for giving Counſel againſt fighting, and it was imputed to Envy in <hi>Mithridates,</hi> to divert him from ſo Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an Enterprize: Whereupon <hi>Tigranes</hi> would by no means tarry for him, for fear he ſhould ſhare in the Glory; but march'd on with all his Army, lamenting to his Friend, (as is ſaid) that he ſhould fight with <hi>Lucullus</hi> alone, and not with all the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals together. Neither was his Boldneſs to be accounted frantick or raſh, when he had ſo many Nations and Kings attending him, with ſo many Thouſand of well-armed Foot and Horſe about him. He had Twenty thouſand Archers, and Slin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Fifty five thouſand Horſe (whereof Fifteen thouſand were all in Armour, as <hi>Lucullus</hi> wrote to the Senate) a Hundred and fifty thouſand heavy Arms drawn up partly into Companies, partly into <hi>Phalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;</hi> beſides others appointed to open the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:35403:197"/>
ways, and lay Bridges to drein the Waters, and prepare Fuel, with other neceſſary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, to the number of Thirty five thouſand: Who being quartered behind the Army, made it the more formidable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. As ſoon as he had paſſed <hi>Taurus,</hi> and appeared with his Forces, and ſaw the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> beleaguering <hi>Tigranocerta,</hi> the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous People within with ſhoutings and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations received the ſight, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Romans</hi> from the Wall, pointed to the <hi>Armenians.</hi> In a Council of War, ſome adviſed <hi>Lucullus</hi> to leave the Siege, and march up to <hi>Tigranes,</hi> others, that it would not be ſafe to leave the Siege, and ſo many Enemies behind. He himſelf anſwered, that neither ſide rightly, but both together gave ſound advice; whereupon he divided his Army, and left <hi>Murena</hi> with Six thouſand Foot, the Charge of the ſiege, he himſelf went out with Twenty four Bands, in which were no leſs than Ten thouſand men at Arms, all the Horſe, and about a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Slingers and Archers, and ſitting down by a River in a large Plain, appeared very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable to <hi>Tigranes,</hi> and a fit Subject for the flattering Wits about him. Some where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of jeared, others caſt Lots for the ſpoil, every one of the Kings and Commanders came, and deſir'd the Engagement alone, and that he would be pleaſed to ſit ſtill and behold.
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:35403:197"/>
                  <hi>Tigranes</hi> himſelf ſomething Witty and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant upon the occaſion, made uſe of the old ſaying, That they were too many for Ambaſſadors, and too few for Soldiers. Thus they continu'd laughing and ſcoffing. As ſoon as day came, <hi>Lucullus</hi> brought out his Forces in their Arms. The <hi>Barbarian</hi> Army ſtood at the Eaſtern part of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but <hi>Lucullus</hi> at the Weſt, and at a turn of the River where it was beſt paſſable, while he led his Army in haſte, ſeemed to <hi>Tigranes</hi> to fly. Who thereupon called <hi>Taxiles,</hi> and in deriſion ſaid, <q>Do you not ſee this invincible Army of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> flying? But <hi>Taxiles</hi> reply'd, I would to God, O King, ſome ſuch Fortune may attend your Soul! But ſurely Travellers never put on their beſt Cloths, nor uſe bright Shields and naked Head-pieces, and unſheathed Weapons, as now you ſee; but this is a preparation for War, and of Men juſt ready to engage with their Enemies.</q> While <hi>Taxiles</hi> was thus ſpeaking, as <hi>Lucullus</hi> wheeled about, the firſt Eagle appeared, and the Bands, according to their Diviſions and Companies, were juſt ready to paſs over, when, with much ado, and like a Man in a Debauch, <hi>Tigranes</hi> cryed out twice or thrice, What are you coming upon us, Sirs? In great haſt therefore he put his Army in Array, keeping the main Body to
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:35403:198"/>
himſelf, the Left Wing was given in Charge to the <hi>Adiabenian,</hi> and the Right to the <hi>Mede,</hi> in the Front whereof were moſt of the Armed Men placed. Some Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers adviſed <hi>Lucullus</hi> to lie ſtill that day, being one of thoſe unfortunate ones, whom they call Black-days, for therein the Army under <hi>Scipio,</hi> engaging with the <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> was deſtroyed: But he, by a very memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Saying, replyed, <hi>I will make this a happy day to the</hi> Romans. It was the day before the <hi>Nones</hi> of <hi>October.</hi> Having ſo ſaid, he bad them Courage, paſſed over the River, and himſelf firſt of all led them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Enemy. A Coat of Mail with ſhining Scales he had on, and a fringed Mantle; and drew out his naked Sword, as if they had been to engage with Men that uſed to fight at a diſtance, and by a ſudden falling in, he ſtraitned the open pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were neceſſary for the Archers. But when he ſaw the armed Horſe, the Flower of the Army, drawn up under a Hill, on the top whereof was a broad and open Plain, about four Furlongs high, and of no difficult or troubleſome acceſs, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Thracian</hi> and <hi>Gallogrecian</hi> Horſe to fall upon their Flanck, and beat down their Lances with their Swords. (The only Defence of the Men in Arms are their Lances, they have nothing elſe to defend
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:35403:198"/>
themſelves, or annoy their Enemy, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the weight and hardneſs of their Armour, in which they are encloſed.) He himſelf, with two Bands, made to the Mountain, the Souldiers briskly following on, when they ſaw him in Arms, afoot, firſt toiling and climbing up. Being on the top, and ſtanding in an open place, with a loud Voice he cried out, <hi>We have overcome, we have overcome, O my Fellow-Soldiers!</hi> And having ſo ſaid, he marched againſt the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Horſemen, commanding his Men not to throw their Piles, but coming up hand to hand with the Enemy, to hack their Shins and Thighs, which Parts alone are unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in armed men. But there was no need of this way of fighting, for they ſtood not to receive the <hi>Romans,</hi> but with great cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and worſe Fiight, they and their heavy Horſes broke the Ranks of the Foot before ever the Fight began; inſomuch that without a Wound, or Blood-ſhed, ſo many thouſands were overthrown. The greateſt Slaughter was made in the Flight, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in endeavouring to fly away, which they could not well do by reaſon of the depth and cloſeneſs of the Ranks, which hindred them. <hi>Tigranes</hi> at firſt fled with a few, but ſeeing his Son in the ſame mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, he took the Crown from his Head, and with Tears gave it him, bidding him
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:35403:199"/>
ſave himſelf in ſome other way if he could. But the Prince daring not to put it on, gave it to one of his truſtieſt Servants to keep for him. This Man, as it hapned, being taken, was brought to <hi>Lucullus;</hi> ſo among the Captives the Crown alſo of <hi>Tigranes</hi> was taken. 'Tis reported, that above a hundred thouſand Foot were loſt, and few of the Horſe eſcaped. Of the <hi>Romans</hi> a hundred were wounded, and five kill'd. <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Philoſopher making mention of this Fight, in his Book about the Gods, ſays, That the Sun never ſaw the like. <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo,</hi> another Philoſopher, in his Hiſtorical Collection, ſays, That the <hi>Romans</hi> could not but bluſh and deride themſelves, for putting on Armour againſt ſuch pitiful Slaves. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> alſo ſays, That the <hi>Romans</hi> never fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Enemy with ſo unequal Force; for by more than a twentieth part the Conquerors were leſs than the Conquered.</p>
               <p>The moſt underſtanding <hi>Roman</hi> Captains, and expert in War, have chiefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>Lucullus</hi> for conquering two great and potent Kings, by two different ways, Haſte and Delay. For he broke the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Power of <hi>Mithridates</hi> by Delay and Time, and that of <hi>Tigranes</hi> by Haſte; being one of thoſe rare Generals who made uſe of Delay for advantage, and Speed for ſecurity. Whereupon it was,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:35403:199"/>
that <hi>Mithridates</hi> made no haſte to come up to fight, imagining <hi>Lucullus</hi> would, as he had done before, uſe Caution and Delay, which made him march the ſlower to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes:</hi> And as he met ſome ſtragling <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi> in the way, running in great fear and conſternation, he ſuſpected the worſt, and when greater numbers of naked and wounded Men aſſured him of the Defeat, he ſought for <hi>Tigranes;</hi> and finding him naked and deſtitute, he by no means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited him with Inſolence, but lighting off his Horſe, and condoling the Publick Loſs, gave him a Princely Guard to attend him, and animated him for the future; and they together gathered freſh Forces about them. In the City <hi>Tigranocerta</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> divided from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and delivered it up to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> which he came and took. He ſeized on the Treaſury himſelf, but gave the City to be plunder'd by the Soldiers, wherein were found eight thouſand Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of coined Money: Beſides which alſo he diſtributed eight hundred Groats <hi>per</hi> Man, out of the Spoils. When he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that many Players were taken in the City, which <hi>Tigranes</hi> invited from all Parts, for opening the Theatre which he had built he made uſe of them for celebrating his Triumphal Games and Spectacles. The <hi>Greeks</hi> he ſent home, allowing them Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:35403:200"/>
for their Journey; the <hi>Barbarians</hi> alſo, as many as had been forced away from their own dwelling; inſomuch that this one City being diſſolved, many were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by the reſtitution of their former Inhabitants. By all which <hi>Lucullus</hi> was belov'd, as a Benefactor and Founder. Other things alſo proſpered under him, as deſerved, being more deſirous of praiſe for Juſtice and Clemency, than for Feats in War; for theſe are due partly to the Soldiers, moſt of all to <hi>Fortune;</hi> but thoſe are a demonſtration of a gentle and liberal Soul, whereby <hi>Lucullus</hi> at that time, even without the help of Arms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> For the Kings of <hi>Arabia</hi> came to him tendring what they had; and with them the <hi>Sophenians</hi> alſo ſubmitted. But he dealt ſo with the <hi>Gordye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> that they were willing to leave their own Habitations, and were ready to follow him with their Wives and Children; which was for this Cauſe: <hi>Zarbienus</hi> King of the <hi>Gordyenians</hi> (as is ſaid) being grieved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tyranny of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> by <hi>Appius</hi> had ſecretly made Overtures of Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with <hi>Lucullus;</hi> but being diſcover'd, was executed and his Wife and Children periſhed with him, before ever the <hi>Romans</hi> had invaded <hi>Armenia. Lucullus</hi> forgot not this, but coming to the <hi>Gordyenians,</hi> made
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:35403:200"/>
a ſolemn Enterment for <hi>Zarbienus,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning the Funeral Pile with a Royal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy, and Gold and Spoils of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> he himſelf being preſent, kindled the Fire, and poured in perfumes, with the Friends and Domeſticks of the Deceaſed, calling him his Companion, and Friend of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ordered a ſtately Monument for him. There was a large Treaſury of Gold and Silver found in <hi>Zarbienus</hi> his Palace, and<note place="margin">300000. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>more than a Buſhel.</hi>
                  </note> no leſs than three hundred Myriads of Meaſures of Corn; inſomuch that the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were provided for, and <hi>Lucullus</hi> was highly commended for maintaining the War at his own Charge without receiving one Groat from the Publick Treaſury.</p>
               <p>After this came an Embaſſage from the King of <hi>Parthia</hi> to him deſiring Amity and Confederacy; which being readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by <hi>Lucullus,</hi> he diſpatch'd another to the <hi>Parthian,</hi> which diſcovered him to be a double minded Man, and dealing pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately with <hi>Tigranes</hi> to take part with him, upon Condition <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> were delivered up to him. Which as ſoon as <hi>Lucullus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, he reſolved to paſs by <hi>Tigranes</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> as Enemies well nigh ſubdued, and try the Power of <hi>Parthia,</hi> by leading his Army againſt them. He eſteemed it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned act, like a Wreſtler, to throw down three Kings one after another, and like an
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:35403:201"/>
invincible Conquerour, ſucceſſively to deal with three of the greateſt Commanders un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cope of Heaven. He ſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore into <hi>Pontus,</hi> to the Officers with <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> writing to them to bring the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my thence, and joyn with him in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition out of <hi>Gordyene.</hi> They found the Soldiers reſty and ſtubborn before, but now plainly diſcovered their unrulineſs, by no manner of Intreaty or Force to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd; for they proteſted and cried out, That they would ſtay no longer there, but go away and deſert <hi>Pontus.</hi> Which being reported to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> did no ſmall harm to the Soldiers about him, who were corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Wealth and Plenty, and deſirous of Eaſe; and hearing the boldneſs of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, called them Men, and ſuch as they ought to imitate; for the Actions which they had done, did now well deſerve reſt and quiet. Upon theſe and worſe Words, <hi>Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> left off the thoughts of invading <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi> and in the midſt of Summer went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Tigranes;</hi> where paſſing over <hi>Taurus,</hi> he was aſtoniſh'd at the green Fields before him, ſo much the Seaſon by reaſon of the cold Air is deferred. But however he went down, and putting to flight the <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who dared to come out againſt him, he plundered and burnt their Villages, and ſeizing on the Proviſion deſigned for <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes,</hi>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:35403:201"/>
who was afraid of the ſame, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Enemies to great neceſſity. But when he provok'd the Enemy to fight, by marching round their Camp, and burning the Country before them, he could by no means bring them out after their frequent Defeats before, he roſe up and marched to <hi>Artaxata,</hi> the Royal City of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> where his Wives and Children were kept: judging that <hi>Tigranes</hi> would never ſuffer that to go without the hazard of a Battel. It is reported, that <hi>Annibal</hi> the famous <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian,</hi> after the Defeat of <hi>Antiochus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Romans,</hi> coming to <hi>Artaxas</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> inſtructed him in ſeveral neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and uſeful things; who being taken with the pleaſant and delightful Situation of that Place, then uncultivated and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, drew a Model of a City for the ſame; and bringing <hi>Artaxas</hi> thither, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the ſame, and encouraged him to build: At which the King being pleaſed, and deſiring him to overſee the Work, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a large and ſtately City, called af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own Name, and made it <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Armenia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tigranes</hi> would by no means ſuffer <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi> to come upon this City, but came with his Army, and on the fourth day ſate down by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the River <hi>Arſania</hi> lying between them, which of neceſſity
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:35403:202"/>
                  <hi>Lucullus</hi> muſt paſs in his March to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxata. Lucullus,</hi> after Sacrifice to the Gods, as if Victory were already obtained, carried over his Army, having Twelve Bands in Front, the reſt being diſpoſed to prevent the Enemies encloſing them: For there were many choice Horſe drawn up againſt him: In the Front ſtood the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> Horſe-Archers, and <hi>Iberians</hi> with long Spears, who being the moſt Warlike, <hi>Tigranes</hi> more confided in than any other Strangers; but nothing of moment was done by them; for though they skirmiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe at a diſtance, they were not able to ſtand when the Foot came up to them; but being broken and divided on both ſides, drew the Horſe in purſuit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. Though theſe were routed, yet <hi>Lucullus</hi> was afraid when he ſaw the Horſe about <hi>Tigranes</hi> in good Order, and great Numbers coming upon him: Whereupon he recalled his Horſe from purſuing, he himſelf firſt of all withſtood the Nobles, and engaged with the beſt of them, as they came upon him, and before ever they came to cloſe Fight, with the very Terror over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw them. Of three Kings in Battel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, <hi>Mithridates</hi> of <hi>Pontus</hi> fled away the moſt ſhamefully, being not ſo much as able to endure the Noiſe of the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Purſuit reach'd a long way, wherein the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:35403:202"/>
                  <hi>Romans</hi> not only ſlew them all night, but took many alive, ſeized and carried away great Riches, with other Booty, till they were weary and left off. <hi>Livy</hi> ſays, There were more taken and deſtroyed in the firſt Battel; but in the ſecond, thoſe of better note. <hi>Lucullus</hi> being fluſh'd and animated hereby, determined to march into the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> and there compleat his Conqueſts over the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> but the Winter-ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon coming on, contrary to his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, brought ſevere Weather, and frequent Snows, and even in the moſt clear Days, hard Froſt and Ice; which made the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſcarce drinkable for the Horſes, by exceeding Cold; and ſcarce paſſable, for the breaking of the Ice, and cutting the Horſes Sinews. The Country, for the moſt part, being Foreſt, Incloſed and Woody, made them continually wet, being cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Snow as they Marched in the day, and ſitting down in Mooriſh places at Night. After the Battel they followed not <hi>Lucullus</hi> many days, before they began to be unruly; firſt of all intreating, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tribunes to him; but afterwards tumultuouſly gathered together, and made a noiſe all night long, which was a plain ſign of a mutinous Army. But <hi>Lucullus</hi> as earneſtly entreated them, deſiring them to have patience but till they took the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:35403:203"/>
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi> and overturn'd the Work of that curſed Man <hi>Annibal.</hi> But when he could not prevail, he led them back, and by another Road over <hi>Taurus,</hi> came into the fruitful and pleaſant Country of <hi>Myg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> where was a great and populous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the <hi>Barbarians</hi> called <hi>Niſibis;</hi> by the <hi>Greeks, Antioch</hi> of <hi>Mygdonia. Gaurus,</hi> Brother of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> was the Governour, <hi>Callimachus</hi> Overſeer of the Works and Fortifications, the ſame who ſo much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed the <hi>Romans</hi> at <hi>Amiſus.</hi> He brought his Army to it, and laying cloſe Siege, in a ſhort time took it by Storm: He kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed <hi>Gaurus,</hi> as he ſurrendred himſelf; but by no means hearkened to <hi>Callima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> though he offered to make diſcovery of hidden Treaſures; commanding him to be kept in Chains, to be puniſhed for firing the City of <hi>Amiſus,</hi> which hindred him from ſhewing Favour and Kindneſs unto the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as he intended.</p>
               <p>Hitherto one would imagine Fortune attended and fought for <hi>Lucullus;</hi> but afterward, as if the Wind had fail'd of a ſudden, he did all things by force, and as it were againſt the Grain; wherein he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Conduct and Patience of a wiſe Captain; but his Actions met with no Honour or Reputation: For by bad Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and Diviſions in his Army, he came
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:35403:203"/>
within a Hairs-breadth of loſing what what he had before. Himſelf was not the leaſt cauſe of all this, being no ways indulgent to his Soldiers, but one who thought all Favour ſhewn to them, to be a beginning of Diſobedience, and Diſſolution of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But what was worſt of all, he was naturally unſociable to his Great Officers in Commiſſion with him, deſpiſing others, and thinking them worthy of nothing in compariſon with himſelf. Theſe were the Evils attending <hi>Lucullus</hi> his other Vertues; for he is ſaid to have been a luſty, goodly, and eloquent Man, Wiſe both in Court and Camp. <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſays, The Soldiers were ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to him from the beginning of the War, for being forced to keep the Field two Winters at <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſus.</hi> There were other Winter-quarters that vexed, beſides theſe; for they either were in an Enemies Country, or elſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their Tents in the open Fields, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Confederates; for <hi>Lucullus</hi> not ſo much as once went into a <hi>Greek</hi> Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Town with his Army. To this ill affection abroad, the Tribunes contributed at home, invidiouſly accuſing <hi>Lucullus,</hi> as one who for Empire and Riches delayed the War, and under his ſole Power had then got <hi>Cilicia, Aſia, Bythinia, Paphlago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Pontus, Armenia,</hi> as far as the River

               <p>By ſuch Practices the Army of <hi>Lucullus</hi> being corrupted, neither followed him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Tigranes,</hi> nor againſt <hi>Mithridates,</hi> when he returned into <hi>Pontus</hi> out of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> and reſumed his Kingdom; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Winter coming on, ſate idle in <hi>Gordyene,</hi> every minute expecting ſome other General to ſucceed <hi>Lucullus.</hi> But when News came that <hi>Mithridates</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated <hi>Fabius,</hi> and was Marching againſt <hi>Sernatius</hi> and <hi>Triarius,</hi> out of ſhame they followed <hi>Lucullus. Triarius</hi> ambitiouſly aiming at Victory, before ever <hi>Lucullus</hi> came to him, though he was then very near, was overthrown after a bloody Fight, wherein it is reported, that above Seven thouſand <hi>Romans</hi> fell, among whom were
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:35403:205"/>
a Hundred and fifty Centurions, and Four and twenty Tribunes, and even the Camp it ſelf taken. <hi>Lucullus</hi> coming up a few days after, concealed <hi>Triarius</hi> from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Soldiers: But when <hi>Mithridates</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined Battel, and waited for the coming of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> who was then on his March with great Forces, he reſolved before both joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, once more to meet and engage with <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes.</hi> But in the way the mutinous <hi>Fim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians</hi> deſerted their Colours, as Men dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded by Decree of Senate, and would no longer obey <hi>Lucullus,</hi> the Provinces being then allotted to others. There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beneath the Dignity of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> which he was not forc'd to bear, entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, one by one, from Tent to Tent, going up and down dejected and ſorrowful, and ſubmitting to ſhake ſome by the Hands. But they turned away from his Salutes, and threw down their empty Knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks, bidding him alone engage with the Enemy, who alone made advantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. At length, by the intreaty of the other Soldiers, the <hi>Fimbrians</hi> being prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conſented to tarry that Summer under him; but even during that time, if no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy came to fight them, to be free. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi> of neceſſity was forc'd to comply with this, or elſe to leave the deſerted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> He kept them
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:35403:205"/>
indeed with him, but without any Power over them: Nor did he lead them out to Battel, being contented that they would ſtay with him, though he then ſaw <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia</hi> waſted by <hi>Tigranes,</hi> and <hi>Mithridates</hi> again doing miſchief, whom not long before he reported to the Senate to be wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued: whereupon Legats were arrived to ſettle the Affairs of <hi>Pontus,</hi> as if all had been quiet there. But when they came they found him not ſo much as Maſter of himſelf but contemned and derided by the Common Soldiers; who arrived at that height of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence againſt their General, that at the end of Summer they put on their Armour, and drew their Swords, and defied their Enemies then abſent, and gone off a long while before, with great Outcries and Aiery Skirmiſhes, going round the Camp, and proclaiming that the time was expired which they promiſed to ſtay with <hi>Lucullus. Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> had drawn many to his ſide by Letters; by the Favour of the People, and his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt with the Tribunes, being then choſen General of the Army againſt <hi>Mithridates</hi> and <hi>Tigranes.</hi> But it then appeared to the Senate, and all unbiaſſed Men, that <hi>Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> was injured, having thoſe put over his Head, who ſucceeded rather to his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, than the War; being not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Command, but the Glory which

But Friends on both ſides thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to bring them together, who met in a certain Village of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and friendly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted each other. <hi>Lucullus</hi> was the Elder, but <hi>Pompey</hi> the more Honourable, for his oftner Command, and two Triumphs. Both had Rods of Laurel carried before them for their Victories; and when <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s Laurels were withered, by paſſing through hot and droughty places, <hi>Lucullus</hi> his Viergers friendly gave them ſome of the freſh and green ones which they had; which <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Friends counted a good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for the others Actions were they which truly adorned his Empire. At the interview they came to no amicable Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but went off more diſatisfied. <hi>Pompey</hi> repealed all the Acts of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> drew off his Soldiers, and left him no more then ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred for Triumph, and even thoſe
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:35403:206"/>
unwilling to go with him. So unqualified was <hi>Lucullus,</hi> either by Nature or Miſ-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, for the chiefeſt thing in a General, which had he added to his other ſingular Virtues (his Fortiude, Vigilance, Wiſdom, Juſtice) the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had not had <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> for its Boundary in <hi>Aſia,</hi> but the uttermoſt parts of the Earth, and the <hi>Hyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canian</hi> Sea. Other Nations being then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by the late Conqueſts of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> the Power of <hi>Parthia</hi> could not be ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble againſt <hi>Lucullus,</hi> as it afterwards appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt <hi>Craſſus,</hi> being then alſo divided at home by Domeſtick and inteſtine War, and utterly unable to keep off the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Armenia,</hi> But <hi>Lucullus</hi> ſeems more to have injured his Country by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, than he profited it by himſelf. For the Trophies in <hi>Armenia</hi> ſtand near the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Tigranocerta,</hi> and <hi>Niſibis,</hi> and the great Wealth brought from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Captive Crown of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi> carried in Triumph, did all puff up <hi>Craſſus,</hi> as if the <hi>Barbarians</hi> had been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Spoils and Booty: Who fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling among the <hi>Parthian</hi> Archers ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated that <hi>Lucullus</hi> his Triumphs were not beholden to the Inadvertency and Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy of his Enemies, but to his own Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Conduct. But of this afterwards. <hi>Lucullus,</hi> upon his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> found
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:35403:207"/>
his Brother <hi>Mark</hi> accuſed by <hi>C. Memmius,</hi> for what he did when Treaſurer, by the Command of <hi>Sylla;</hi> who being fled, <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> changed the Scene, and animated the People againſt him, and perſwaded them to deny him a Triumph, for ſuppreſſing the Spoils, and prolonging the War. <hi>Lucullus</hi> his Caſe being much diſputed, the Nobility and Chief Men mixed themſelves among the Tribes, and with much Entreaty and Labour ſcarce at length prevailed upon them to conſent to his Triumph. The Pomp of his Triumph was not amazing and tedious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as others had been, with along Train, and number of things carried there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but conſiſted chiefly in vaſt quantities of Armour, and Machins of the King's, placed in the <hi>Flaminian Cirque.</hi> A Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle nothing deſpicable. In his Progreſs paſſed by a few Horſmen in Armour, ten Chariots armed with Scythes, ſixty Friends and officers of the King's, and a hundred and ten long-beak'd Ships were carried along with them. The Golden Image of <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi> ſix Foot high, and rich Head pieces, twenty Loads of Silver Veſſels, and thirty two of Golden Cups. Armour, and Money all carried by Men. Beſide which, eight Mules were laden with Golden Beds, fifty ſix with Bullion, and a hundred and ſeven
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:35403:207"/>
with Coined Money and Silver, little Leſs<note place="margin">2700000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> than two hundred and ſeventy Myriads. In Publick Tables were written what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys he gave <hi>Pompey</hi> for proſecuting the Pyratick War, what he delivered into the Treaſury, and what beſide he gave to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soldier, which was nine hundred and fifty Drachma's <hi>per</hi> Man: After all which, he nobly feaſted the City and Suburbs. Being divorc'd from <hi>Clodia,</hi> a diſſolute and and wicked Woman, he married <hi>Servilia</hi> Siſter to <hi>Cato:</hi> It proved an unfortunate Match, for ſhe was guilty of all <hi>Clodia</hi>'s vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces but one, and that was Inceſt with her Brothers. Out of reverence to <hi>Cato,</hi> he for a while connived at her Impurity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſty, but at length diſmiſſed her. When the Senate expected great things from him as one that would be a Check to the Uſurpation of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and by the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Station and Credit would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Nobility, he retired from Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and left the Republick; either becauſe he ſaw her in a languiſhing condition, and irrecoverable, or, as others ſay, becauſe he was as great as he could well be, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to a quiet and eaſie Life, after thoſe Labours and Toils, which had not ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under him. There are thoſe who high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend his change of Life, avoiding thereby that Rock whereon <hi>Marius</hi> ſplit:
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:35403:208"/>
For he, after his <hi>Cimbrian</hi> Conqueſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he did Noble and Great things, would by no means be contented with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thereof, but out of an infatiable deſire of Glory and Power, even in his old Age, managed a Faction in the Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Youth, and became Guilty of horrid crimes, and worſe Murthers. Better had it been for <hi>Cicero,</hi> after <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, to have retired in his Age; and for <hi>Scipio,</hi> after his <hi>Numantine</hi> and <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> Conqueſts, to have ſate down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.

                  <hi>Lucullus</hi> his Entertainments were every new, and extravagent, not only with Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Carpets, and Plate adorned with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, and Dancings, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, but for all manner of Dainties, and Sweetmeats pil'd up, which made the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple admire him. It was a happy thought of <hi>Pompey</hi> in his Sickneſs, when his Phyſician preſcribed a Thruſh for his dinner, and his Servants told him, That in Summer time Thruſhes where no where but in <hi>Lucullus</hi> his Penns, would not ſuffer them to fetch one thence, but told his Phyſician, Had not <hi>Lucullus</hi> fed on Thruſhes, <hi>Pompey</hi> had not liv'd, and thereupon ordered ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing at hand to be made ready for him. <hi>Cato</hi> was his Friend and Companion, but nevertheleſs ſo hated his Life, and Diet, that when a young Man in the Senate, made a long and tedious ſpeech in praiſe of Frugality and Temperance, <hi>Cato</hi> ſtanding up replyed, Will you never have done? You who are as Rich as <hi>Creſſus,</hi> live like <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and ſpeak like <hi>Cato.</hi> It is plain from his own Mouth, that <hi>Lucullus</hi> was not only pleaſed with, but gloried in his way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, for he is ſaid to have feaſted ſeveral <hi>Greeks</hi> upon their coming to <hi>Rome</hi> day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day; who out of a true <hi>Grecian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal being aſhamed, and refuſing the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, where ſo great an expence was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

day cauſed for them, he with a pleaſing Countenance told them, Some of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, my <hi>Grecian</hi> Friends, is for your ſakes, but more for <hi>Lucullus</hi> his own. Once, when he ſupped alone, there being only one table, and that but moderately furniſht, he called his Steward and reproved him; who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that there would be no need of any great Entertainment, when no Body was invited, was anſwered; <hi>What do you not know, that to day</hi> Lucullus <hi>is to eat with</hi> Lucullus? Which being noiſed about the City, <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> one day met him loitering in the Market-place; one a principal Friend and Acquaintance; but there had been ſome falling out between <hi>Pompey</hi> and him, about the Command of the Army, but however they uſed civilly to diſcourſe, and talk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaluted him, and asked him, How he ſtood affected to diſputing? Who anſwering, Very well; and inviting them to it, We, ſaid he, will eat with you, to day, if there ſhall be no more than what is already provided. <hi>Lucullus</hi> being ſurpriſed, and requeſted a days time, they refuſed to grant it, neither ſuffered him to talk with his Servants, for fear he ſhould give order for more than what was appointed before. But thus much they conſented to, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Faces he might tell his Servant, That to day he would ſup in the <hi>Apollo</hi> (for
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:35403:210"/>
ſo one of his beſt dining Rooms was called) and, by this evaſion, impos'd upon his Gueſts. To every Room (as it ſeems) was allotted a proportion of Diet, having its proper Coſts and Furniture belonging to it; ſo that the Servants knowing where he would dine, knew alſo how much was to be expended, and how the Supper was to be prepared. The expence for the <hi>Apollo</hi> was fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pence, which being that day conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the greatneſs thereof did not ſo much amaze <hi>Pompey,</hi> as the haſte in dreſſing. He inſulted over Money, as Captive and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian;</hi> as indeed it was. But however his furniſhing a Library, deſerved praiſe and thanks, for he collected very many, and choice Manuſcripts; but the uſe they were put to, was more commendable than the purchaſe. The Library being always open, and the Walks and Schools about it free to all <hi>Greeks,</hi> who, from buſineſs, came thither as to the habitation of the Muſes, walking about, and diverting one another. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf often ſtudied there, diſputing with the learned in the Walks, and giving his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to States-Men who required it, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that his Houſe was altogether a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle, and a <hi>Greek Prytaneum</hi> to all that came to <hi>Rome.</hi> He underſtood all ſorts of Philoſophy, and was well read, and expert in them all. But he always favoured, and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:35403:210"/>
valued the Academy from the beginning. Not the new one (which at that time under <hi>Philo</hi> flouriſh'd with the Precept of <hi>Carnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>) but the old one, then under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Aſcalonites Antiochus,</hi> a learned and eloquent Man: <hi>Lucullus,</hi> with great labour, made him his Friend and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and ſet him up on purpoſe againſt <hi>Philo</hi>'s Auditors, among whom <hi>Cicero</hi> was one, who Wrote an excellent Book in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Sect, wherein he hath made a diſcourſe for <hi>Lucullus,</hi> about apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion contrary to his own opinion. The Book is called <hi>Lucullus.</hi> For, as 'tis ſaid, they were good Friends, and acted jointly in the publick Concern. For <hi>Lucullus</hi> did not wholly retire from the Republick, but from Ambition, and deſire of Superiority, and Greatneſs equally dangerous and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, which he left to <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and <hi>Cato.</hi> To whom the Senate, who ſuſpected <hi>Pompey's</hi> greatneſs, joined themſelves, when <hi>Lucullus</hi> refuſed to head them. For his Friends he came into the <hi>Forum,</hi> and into the Senate to curb the Ambition and Pride of <hi>Pompey;</hi> whoſe orders, after his Conqueſts over the King's, he annull'd, and by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Cato</hi> hindred a diviſion of Lands to the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which he propoſed. Which made <hi>Pompey</hi> go over to <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and <hi>Caeſars</hi> Friendſhip, or rather Conſpiracy, and then
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:35403:211"/>
by filling the City with Armed Men, to eſtabliſh his Decrees by force, and drive <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Lucullus</hi> away. Which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Nobility, <hi>Pompey</hi>'s party pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd one <hi>Vectius,</hi> pretending they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended him in a deſign againſt <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Life. Who, in the Senate-houſe, accuſed others, but among the People named <hi>Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> as if he had been ſuborned by him to kill <hi>Pompey.</hi> No Body gave heed to what he ſaid, and it ſoon appeared that they had produced a Man with a falſe charge, and accuſation. After a few days the whole Intrigue was diſcover'd, the Carcaſe of the accuſer being thrown out of Priſon, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted indeed to have died a natural Death, but carrying marks of a Halter, and blows about him; and ſeeming rather to have been taken off by thoſe who ſuborned him. Theſe things kept <hi>Lucullus</hi> at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Republick.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Cicero</hi> left the City, and <hi>Cato</hi> was baniſhed to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> he became altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſottiſh; it is reported, that before his Death, his parts fail'd him by degrees. But <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> denies that either Age or Sickneſs impair'd his Mind, which was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doz'd by a Potion given him by <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſthenes</hi> his Freeman. The Potion given him by <hi>Calliſthenes,</hi> was to endear him to him, being ſo prepared; but it acted quite
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:35403:211"/>
otherwiſe, and ſo diſabled and intoxicated his Mind, that even while he was alive, his Brother ordered his Affairs. At his Death, which was the Death of one taken off in the very flower of Martial and Civil Diſcipline, the People were much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and flockt together, and even by force would have taken his Corps, as it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the Market-place, by young Men of the beſt Quality, and have Buried it in the <hi>Martian</hi> field, where they buried <hi>Sylla.</hi> Which being altogether unexpected, and Neceſſaries not eaſily to be procured on a ſudden, his Brother, after much intreaty and ſollicitation, prevailed upon them to ſuffer him to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the <hi>Tuſculan</hi> field, as was appointed. He himſelf ſurviv'd him but a ſmall time, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not far behind in Death, as he did in Age and Renown, being a moſt loving Brother.</p>

               <p>ONe might bleſs the End of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who died before the great Alteration of Affairs, which Fate by inteſtine Wars was bringing, on, and left this Life in a free, though troubled State, wherein, above all other things, <hi>Cimon</hi> and he agreed. For
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:35403:212"/>
he died alſo when the ſtate of <hi>Greece</hi> was free, and flouriſhed; though in the Field, at the Head of his Army, not recalled, nor diſgraced, nor ſullying the Glory of his Wars, Engagements, and Conqueſts, with Feaſtings and Debauches: As <hi>Plato</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <hi>Orpheus</hi> for ſaying, <hi>That an eternal Debauch hereafter, was the Reward of thoſe who lived well here.</hi> Indeed eaſe and Quiet, and the Study of pleaſant and ſpeculative Learning, to an old Man, unfit for War or State, is a moſt ornamental and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thing; but to miſguide vertuous Actions to Pleaſure, as their utmoſt End, and to leave the Wars for the Sports and Delights of <hi>Venus,</hi> did not become the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Academy, and a Follower of <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> but one that rather inclined to <hi>Epicurus.</hi> But the greateſt wonder of all is, their Youthful days were flat oppoſite; the ones being infamous and vicious, the others well diſciplin'd and ſober; yet better is the Change for Good, for it argues a more ingenuous Mind, where Vice decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and Vertue increaſeth. Though both had great Wealth, they differently employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; and there is no Compariſon between the South-wall of the Tower built by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and the ſtately Manſions and watry Proſpects at <hi>Neapolis,</hi> built by <hi>Lucullus,</hi> out of the Spoils of the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:35403:212"/>
can we compare <hi>Cimon</hi>'s popular and numerous Table, to the Noble and Royal one of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> that receiving a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gueſts every day at ſmall Expence, this being richly ſpread for a few <hi>Good-Fellows:</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> unleſs you will ſay that different times made the alteration. For who can tell, but that <hi>Cimon,</hi> if he had retired in his old age from Buſineſs and War, to Quiet and Solitude, might have liv'd a more lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious and debauch'd Life, who was a Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow, a pleaſant Companion, and (as is ſaid) a Lover of Women? But brave and generous Actions, tranſported with other Delights than ariſe from the lower Appetite, make active and heroick Men neglect and forget theſe. Had but <hi>Lucullus</hi> ended his days in the Field, Envy itſelf and Detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could never have accuſed him. So much for their manner of Life.</p>
               <p>In War it is plain they were both Men of excellent Conduct, both at Land and Sea. And as they honoured thoſe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, who on the ſame day, in the ſame Games, were Crowned for their Maſtery in all, by calling their Actions, <hi>Wonderful Victories;</hi> ſo likewiſe <hi>Cimon,</hi> honouring <hi>Greece</hi> with a Sea and Land-Victory on the ſame day, is worthy to be placed in the firſt Rank of Commanders. <hi>Lucullus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Command from his Country, but
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:35403:213"/>
                  <hi>Cimon</hi> brought it to his. He united the Lands of his Enemies to her, who ruled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Confederates before; but this Man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Power out of other Hands, made his Country both rule over Confederates, and Conquer Enemies too; forcing the <hi>Perſians</hi> to relinquiſh the Sea, and the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians</hi> to ſubmit. But if it be the chiefeſt thing in a General to win his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to Obedience by Gentleneſs; <hi>Lucullus</hi> was deſpiſed by his own Army, but <hi>Cimon</hi> was obeyed by others. Thoſe deſerted the one, theſe fled for Protection to the other. He came home without thoſe Forces he led out; this Man ſent out at firſt under the Command of others, returned home with Authority even over them alſo, having ſerved his City in three difficult Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eſtabliſhing Peace with the Enemy, Dominion over Confederates, and Unity with <hi>Lacedaemon.</hi> Both aiming to deſtroy great Kingdoms, and ſubdue all <hi>Aſia,</hi> fail'd in their Enterpriſe. <hi>Cimon</hi> very unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately; for he died when General, in the height of Felicity: But <hi>Lucullus,</hi> no Man can excuſe from a Fault to his Soldiers, whether he knew not, or would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Diſtaſte and Complaints of his Army, which brought him into ſo great hatred among them. But did not <hi>Cimon</hi> alſo ſuffer like him in this? For the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:35403:213"/>
Citizens arraigned him, and never left till they had baniſhed him; that, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, They might not hear him for the ſpace of ten Years. For Heroick Minds ſeldom pleaſe the Vulgar, or are acceptable to them; for by puniſhing their Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, they oftentimes pinch to the quick, like Chirurgeons bands, reducing diſlocated Bones to their natural poſition. But both of them perhaps may be cleared of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucullus</hi> very much out-went him in War, being the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> who carried an Army over <hi>Taurus,</hi> paſſed the <hi>Tigris,</hi> took and burnt the Royal Palaces of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in the ſight of the Kings, <hi>Tigranocerta, Cabira, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nope,</hi> and <hi>Niſibis,</hi> ſubduing the North Parts as far as <hi>Phacis,</hi> the Eaſt as far as <hi>Media,</hi> and the South and Red Sea, through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Arabia;</hi> broke the Power of Kings, and narrowly miſſed their Perſons, who fled away like Wild Beaſts into the Deſarts, the thick and unpaſſable Woods. A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of which was, That the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as if no great harm had befel them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Cimon,</hi> ſoon after appeared in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and overcame and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed a great Army of theirs in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> But after <hi>Lucullus, Tigranes</hi> and <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> were able to do nothing: The latter being diſabled and broken in the former Wars, never dared to ſhew his Army to
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:35403:214"/>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> without the Camp, but fled away to <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> and there died. <hi>Tigranes</hi> threw himſelf naked and unarmed down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pompey,</hi> and taking his Crown from his Head, laid it at his Feet, complement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pompey</hi> with what was not his own, but that which <hi>Lucullus</hi> had triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before; and when he received the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Majeſty again, he was well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe deprived before. Greater is that Commander, who, like a Wreſtler, leaves an Adverſary almoſt Conquered for his Succeſſor; and therefore <hi>Cimon,</hi> at his Arrival, finding the Forces of the King diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and the Minds of the <hi>Perſians</hi> down, by their continual Overthrows and Flights under <hi>Themiſtocles, Pauſanias,</hi> and <hi>Leoty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chides,</hi> eaſily overcame their Bodies, whoſe Souls were diſ-ſpirited and faint before. But <hi>Tigranes,</hi> never yet baffled in Fight, but fluſh'd with Succeſs, engaged againſt <hi>Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> There is no compariſon between thoſe Numbers which came againſt <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and thoſe ſubdued by <hi>Cimon.</hi> All which things being rightly conſidered, it is a hard matter to give judgment: For the Gods were favourable to both Parties, directing the one what to act, and the other what to avoid; and they have thereby declared them both brave Men, and of Heavenly Extract.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This ſort of contention, and vying with others in matter of Style, in my mind, at the beſt, looks very little, and ſhows the certain Spirit of a <hi>Pedant;</hi> but in things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable is intolerable.</p>
               <p>Such actions therefore as <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Philiſtius</hi> have related, ſeeing they are not to be paſt by, eſpecially thoſe that diſcover the Genius of the Man, and his diſpoſition, which under his many and great troubles lay concealed, thoſe I ſay, that I may not ſeem altogether negligent, I ſhall briefly run over; and ſuch things as are not vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly known, and lie ſcattered here and there, in other Mens Writings, or are found amongſt the old Monuments and Archieves, I ſhall endeavour to bring together; not huddling up an impertinent Story, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering what may make his diſpoſition and temper underſtood.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, I would premiſe what <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> has written concerning <hi>Nicias, That there had been three good Citizens eminent</hi>

                  <hi>above the reſt for their Fatherly Affection and love to the People,</hi> Nicias <hi>the Son of</hi> Nicera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Thucidides <hi>the Son of</hi> Mileſius, <hi>and</hi> Theramenes <hi>the Son of</hi> Agnon; but the laſt leſs than the others; for his mean extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was caſt in his Teeth, as a Forreigner from <hi>Ceos,</hi> and his unconſtancy, ſiding ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with one Party, ſometimes with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Commonwealth, made him be Nick-named the <note n="*" place="margin">Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurnus.</note>

                  <hi>Thucydides</hi> was the foremoſt in time, he on the behalf of the Nobility, ſtiffly oppoſed <hi>Pericles,</hi> who cajol'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicias</hi> came after, yet was in ſome repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation even whilſt <hi>Pericles</hi> lived; inſomuch as to be in joint-Commiſſion with him, and many times to be General alone; but <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cles</hi> dying, he preſently roſe to the higheſt preferments, chiefly by the favour of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> who ſet him for their Bulwark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Preſumption and Inſolence of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> yet withal, he held the good Will of the <hi>Commons,</hi> who likewiſe contributed to his advancement. For tho <hi>Cleons</hi> intereſt ran very high by his careſſing the Old Men, and by his frequent Dole to the Poor; yet even they, whom he practiſed upon for their Favour, beholding the Avarice, the Arrogance, and the Preſumption of the Man, ſtood many of 'um for <hi>Nicias.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="415" facs="tcp:35403:217"/>For his was not that ſort of Gravity, which is over harſh or odious, but temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a certain awful Reſpect and Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, winning upon the People, by ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affraid of them. And being naturally Diffident and Timorous, in feats of War, his good Fortune ſupplied his want of Courage, and kept it from being detected, his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes proving always ſucceſsful. But his Timerouſneſs, in point of Government, and his huge dread of Informers, tended very much to conciliate the good will of the People; and gave him no ſmall Power over them: They being fearful of one that deſpiſes them, but promoting him that pays them Reverence; for their greateſt Honour, from their Betters, is not to be Contemned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pericles,</hi> who by ſolid Virtue, and the pure dint of Eloquence ruled the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, ſtood in need of no diſguiſe, nor wheadling with the People; which Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents <hi>Nicias</hi> wanting, but abounding in Riches, with theſe he was faint to truck for Popularity.</p>
               <p>Neither was he made with the Nimble Wit of <hi>Cleon,</hi> ſo as by breaking Jeſts, and playing the Droll to tickle the <hi>Athenians;</hi> therefore being unprovided of ſuch like Qualities, he treated the People with Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Games, and other publick Shows,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:35403:218"/>
more Sumptuous and more Splendid, than had been ever known in his, or in former Ages.</p>
               <p>Amongſt his Works of <hi>Devotion</hi> there was Extant, even in our days, a Shrine of <hi>Minerva</hi> in the Cittadel, having loſt the Gold that covered it: And a Temple in that of <hi>Bacchus</hi> under the <hi>Tripods,</hi> that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by thoſe at the publick Games, who won the Prize: For at theſe Games he had often carried off the Prize, and never once failed.</p>
               <p>'Tis reported, that at one of theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks Shows, a Slave of his paſt along in Maſquerade, perſonating <hi>Bacchus,</hi> Fair and Goodly to behold, nor yet any Beard upon his Chin; The <hi>Athenians</hi> pleaſed with the ſight, and hopping a long time, <hi>Nicias</hi>

                     <hi>Nicias</hi>'s Acts of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</note> ſtood up, and ſaid, <hi>He held it impious to keep any Body for a Slave, who had publickly been likened to a God.</hi> And forthwith he ſet the young Man free.</p>
               <p>His performances at <hi>Delos</hi> are remembred, as Noble and Magnificent Works of <hi>Devotion.</hi> For whereas the <hi>Choras</hi> which the Cities had ſent to ſing Anthems to the God, were wont to arrive all in Confuſion; the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble coming preſently to meet the Ship, and crying to 'um to ſing: And they out of haſte, debarking in diſorder, and making a Clutter, ſome for their Garlands, ſome
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:35403:218"/>
for their Surplices. Now he being to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy the <hi>Chorus,</hi> ſhipt them over to <hi>Rhenia,</hi> together with the Sacrifice, and other Holy Appurtenances. And moreover, took along with him from <hi>Athens,</hi> a Bridge ready fitted for the purpoſe, and Curiouſly ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Manufactures of Gold, and with Pictures and Garlands, and Tapeſtries; this he joyned together in the Night over the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, betwixt <hi>Rhenia</hi> and <hi>Delos,</hi> being no great diſtance: And preſently by break of day he marcht forth with all the Proviſion to the God, and led the <hi>Chorus</hi> with all their Ornaments in exquiſite Order, ſinging all along over the Bridge.</p>
               <p>The Sacrifices, the Games, and the Feaſt being over, he ſet up a Palm-Tree of Braſs for a preſent to the God, and bought a parcel of Land with ten thouſand Drach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's, which he Conſecrated; with the Revenue the Inhabitants of <hi>Delos</hi> were to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and to Feaſt, and to pray the Gods for <hi>many good Things</hi> to <hi>Nicias.</hi> This he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved on a Pillar, which he left in <hi>Delos</hi> to be a Record of his Requeſt. This ſame Palm-tree, afterwards broken down by the Wind, fell on the huge Statue which the Men of <hi>Naxus</hi> had preſented, and beat it to the Ground.</p>
               <p>'Tis very plain, that much of this looks like Vain-glory, and ſhews a ſtrong affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:35403:219"/>
of Popularity and Applauſe: Yet from other Qualities and Carriage of the Man, one might believe all this Coſt and Magnificence to be purely the Effect of his Devotion: For he was one of thoſe who dreaded the Divine Powers extreamly, and (as <hi>Thucydides</hi> informs us) <hi>was moap'd with Godlineſs.</hi> In one of <hi>Paſiphon</hi>'s Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues 'tis written, That <hi>he daily ſacrificed to the Gods, and keeping a Divine at his Houſe, he pretended to be conſulting always about the Commonwealth; whereas for the moſt part he enquired only of his private Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, more eſpecially concerning his Silver Mines:</hi> For he poſſeſs'd many, and of great avail, in the <hi>Lauriotick</hi> Ground; but wrought them not without hazard. He maintained there a multitude of Slaves, and his Wealth conſiſted chiefly in Silver; whereby he had many Retainers, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hangers-on about him, craving and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; for he gave to them who could do him miſchief, no leſs than to thoſe who deſerved well of him. In ſhort, his Fear made a Rent-charge for the Rogues, and<note place="margin">His Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs.</note> his Humanity for Honeſt Men. Of theſe things we have Teſtimony, even in our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; for <hi>Teleclides</hi> brings in an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſaying thus:</p>

Nor indeed had he any leiſure for thoſe Diverſions. When he was <hi>Archon,</hi> he ſtaid in Court till night, was the firſt upon the Bench, and the laſt that left it. And if no Publick Buſineſs took up his time, yet was it very hard to have Acceſs, or to ſpeak with him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retir'd at home, and lock'd up.

               </p>
               <p>Who principally acted this Part for him, and contributed moſtwhat to his Pride and Vanity in this matter, was <hi>Hieron,</hi> a Man educated in <hi>Nicias</hi>'s Family, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by him in Letters and Muſick: He pretended to be the Son of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Chalcus,</hi> whoſe Poems are yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Hieron</hi> alſo tranſacted all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets for <hi>Nicias</hi> with the Divines; and gave out in Speeches to the People, <hi>What a toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and miſerable Life he led, for the ſake of the Commonwealth.

               <p>He obſerved, That the People, in a Man of Eloquence, or of eminent Parts and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, made uſe of his Talent to ſerve their Occaſions; but were always jealous, and
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:35403:221"/>
held a watchful Eye upon his Power, curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and breaking it, and taking down his Authority and Reputation. This was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in their Condemnation of <hi>Pericles,</hi> their Baniſhment of <hi>Damon,</hi> their Diſtruſt of <hi>Antiphon</hi> the <hi>Rhamnuſian,</hi> but eſpecially in the Caſe of <hi>Laches,</hi> that took <hi>Lesbos,</hi> who giving an Account of his Conduct, in the very Court of Juſtice unſheathed his Sword, and ſlew himſelf.</p>
               <p>On theſe Conſiderations <hi>Nicias</hi> declined<note place="margin">His cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> all difficult, and all little Enterpriſes: Or if he took a Command, he was for doing what was ſafe. Thus, 'tis likely, he had for the moſt part Succeſs; which he did not attribute to any Wiſdom, Conduct, or Courage of his own, but (to avoid Envy) he thank'd Fortune for all, and gave God the Glory. This the Actions themſelves teſtifie; for at that time there hapned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and terrible Shocks to the City of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> yet had not he a hand in any of them. The <hi>Athenians</hi> were routed in <hi>Thrace</hi> by the <hi>Chalcedonians, Calliades,</hi> and <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> Commanding in Chief: <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was the General when they received the Blow in <hi>Aetolia:</hi> At <hi>Delos</hi> they loſt a Thouſand Citizens, under the Conduct of <hi>Hippocrates:</hi> The Plague was principally laid to the charge of <hi>Pericles,</hi> he having ſhut up cloſe together in the Town, a Crowd

of Country-Fellows for the War, who, by the change of Place, and their unuſual Courſe of Living, bred the Peſtilence.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There it hapned that two of his Men were left, by an overſight, when they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off the Dead; which when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, he made an Halt, and ſent an Herald to the Enemy for leave to carry off the Dead; though by a certain Law and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, he that by a Truce craved leave to carry off the Dead, ſeemed to quit the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory: Nor was it lawful for him that did this, to erect a Trophy; for his is the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, who is Maſter of the Field, and he is not Maſter who asks leave, as wanting Power to take. But he choſe rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Victory and his Glory, than to let two Citizens lie unburied.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:35403:222"/>He ſcowred the Coaſt of <hi>Laconia</hi> all along, and beat the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> that made Head againſt him. He took <hi>Thyraea,</hi> Garriſon'd by the <hi>Arginetans,</hi> and carried the Priſoners to <hi>Athens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had fortified <hi>Pylos,</hi> and the <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> brought together all, both their Sea and Land Forces, before it, after the Fight, about the number of Four hundred Native <hi>Spartans</hi> were left aſhore in the Iſle <hi>Sphacteria:</hi> Now the <hi>Athenians</hi> thought it a brave Exploit (as indeed it was) to take theſe Men Priſoners. But the Siege, in places that wanted Water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very difficult and untoward; and to convoy the vaſt neceſſaries about by Sea, in Summer, tedious and vaſtly chargeable, in Winter doubtful, or plainly impoſſible; this grieved them, and they repented their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rejected the Ambaſſy of the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> that had been ſent to treat a Peace and League with them: Which was done at the Importunity of <hi>Cleon,</hi> who oppoſed<note place="margin">Cleon.</note> it, chiefly out of a Pique to <hi>Nicias:</hi> For, being his Enemy, and obſerving him to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour a Complyance with the <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> he perſwaded the People to break off the Treaty.</p>
               <p>Now therefore that the Siege held long, and they heard of the diſmal Extremities that preſs'd their Army, they grew inraged
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:35403:222"/>
againſt <hi>Cleon;</hi> but he turns all the blame upon <hi>Nicias,</hi> charging it on his Softneſs and Cowardice, that the beſieged Eſcap'd: <hi>Were I the General</hi> (quoth he) <hi>they ſhould not hold out ſo long.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently replyed, <hi>Why then do not you go with a Squadron againſt them?</hi> And <hi>Nicias</hi> ſtanding up reſigned his Command at <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> to him, and bids him <hi>take what Forces he pleaſed along with him,</hi> and <hi>not ſwagger with VVords, out of harms way, but go forth and perform ſome memorable Service for the Common-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cleon,</hi> at the firſt ſhrunk back, ſtartled with the ſurprize, but the <hi>Athenians</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, and <hi>Nicias</hi> lowdly upbraiding him, he, ſo provoked, and fired with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, took upon him the Charge; and ſaid farther, That <hi>once within Twenty days after he embarqu'd, he would either kill the Enemy upon the place, or bring them alive to</hi> Athens. This the <hi>Athenians</hi> were readier to laugh at, than to believe, for on other occaſions, his Flaſhes and Extravagances uſed to make them ſport, and were pleaſant enough.</p>
               <p>As for Inſtance, 'tis reported that once when the People were aſſembled, and had waited his coming a long time, at laſt he enters with a Garland on his Head, and prays them to Adjourn to the next day, <hi>For</hi>

(quoth he) <hi>I am not at leiſure to day, I have Sacrificed to the Gods, and am to Feaſt my Strangers.</hi> Whereat the <hi>Athenians</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, roſe up, and diſſolved the Aſſembly: However, at this time he had the lucky hit, and Commanded ſo Gallantly, in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> that within the time he had limited, he carried Captive to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> all the <hi>Spartans</hi> that had not fall'n in Battel.</p>
               <p>This brought an horrible Diſgrace on <hi>Nicias;</hi> for this was not to <hi>throw away his Shield,</hi> but ſomething more foul and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious, to quit his Charge voluntarily out of Cowardice, and by yielding up his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, of his own accord, to put into his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies hand the opportunity of Atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo brave an Action.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>Beſides all this, he did a vaſt prejudice to the City, by ſuffering the Acceſſion of ſo great Reputation and Power to <hi>Cleon;</hi> whereby he aſſumed that Turbulent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and unbridled Impudence, and opened the Door for greater Miſchief to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; whereof a ſufficient part fell to his own ſhare: For now <hi>Cleon</hi> baniſht away all Decorum from the Pulpit, and firſt of all broke out into Exclamations, flung open his Cloak, ſmote his Thigh, and ran up and down whilſt he was ſpeaking, which ſoon after introduced amongſt thoſe who managed the Affairs of State, ſuch Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and Contempt of decency, as brought all into Confuſion.</p>
               <p>Now alſo grew up at <hi>Athens, Alcibiades,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades.</note> ſuch another Common-wealth-Man, tho not altogether ſo unruly. But as the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which through the Richneſs of the Soyl, is ſaid,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Great Plenty to produce,</l>
                  <l>Both wholeſome Herbs, and Drugs of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Juyce.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>So the Nature of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> was ſtrong and luxuriant in both kinds; and made way for
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:35403:224"/>
a great many Innovations. Whereby it fell out, that after <hi>Nicias</hi> had got his hands clear of <hi>Cleon,</hi> yet had he not opportunity to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the City perfectly in quietneſs. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought Matters to a pretty fair paſs, all was daſh'd and plung'd again into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion by <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> through the Wildneſs and Extravagance of his Ambition; and he embroyled again in War worſe than ever. Which ſell out thus.</p>
               <p>They who principally hindred the Peace, were <hi>Cleon</hi> and <hi>Craſidas;</hi> War ſetting off the Vertue of the one, and hiding the Villainy of the other; it gave to the one occaſions of Atchieving brave Actions, to the other of Committing enormous Crimes. Now when theſe two were in one Battel both ſlain near <hi>Amphipolis; Nicias</hi> having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the <hi>Spartans</hi> had long been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of a Peace, and that the <hi>Athenians</hi> had no great Stomach to the War; both being alike tyred, and (as it were by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) laying down their Arms: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this nick of time, employs all his Might to make a Friendſhip betwixt theſe two Cities, and to deliver the other States of <hi>Greece</hi> from the Evils and Calamities they laboured under, and ſo eſtabliſh their Happineſs to after Ages. He found the Men of Subſtance, the Aged Men, and the Husbandmen generally all inclined to
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:35403:224"/>
Peace; beſides many others, by diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in private, and by Informing them, he brought over, to be not ſo very Keen for a War. Whereupon he now encouraged the Hopes of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> counſelled them, and put them upon it to ſeek Peace. They confided in him, as being on other Occaſions, a moderate Man; and becauſe of his Kindneſs and tender Care over the Priſoners, taken at <hi>Pylos,</hi> and in Chains, making their Misfortune the more eaſie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> and the <hi>Spartans</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, concluded amongſt themſelves, a Ceſſation for a Year, whereby conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with one another, they taſted again the ſweetneſs of Peace and Security; and mingling together Familiars and Strangers, they wiſht an end of that fighting and Blood-ſhed. And with delight heard the <hi>Chorus</hi> ſing ſuch as this,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Reſt my Launce, and no man mind thee,</l>
                  <l>Till around the Cobwebs bind thee.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And with joy remembred that ſaying, <hi>They who ſleep in peace, are awaked by the Cocks-Crow, not by the Trumpet.</hi> And on the ſame ſcore they curſt and kickt them out of Company, who ſaid that the <hi>Fates</hi>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:35403:225"/>
                  <hi>decreed this to be a War of thrice nine Years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It followed afterwards, that all points ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been debated, they made a Peace. And moſt People thought, now, indeed they had got an end of all their Evils: And <hi>Nicias</hi> was in every Man's mouth, as one eſpecially beloved of the Gods, who for his Piety and Devotion, had given him to bear the ſame Name with the faireſt and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all Bleſſings; For in Truth, they called the Peace <hi>Nicias</hi>'s <hi>work,</hi> as the War <hi>the Work of</hi> Pericles: Becauſe on very light occaſions he ſeemed to have plunged the <hi>Grecians</hi> into very great Calamities: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Nicias</hi> perſwaded them to forget the higheſt injuries, that they might be Friends: Wherefore they call that to this day <hi>the Nician Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Articles being, that the Garriſons and Towns, taken on either ſide, and the Priſoners ſhould be reſtored, and they to reſtore the firſt to whom it ſhould fall by Lot; now (as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> tells us) <hi>Nicias</hi> ſecretly purchas'd with Money the Lot for the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> to deliver the firſt.</p>
               <p>Afterwards when the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and the <hi>Boeotians</hi> ſhewed their diſlike of what was done, and by their Complaints and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations well nigh brought back again the War upon them, <hi>Nicias perſwaded the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:35403:225"/>
and the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> beſides the Peace, to make a League offenſive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, which would <hi>be ſuch a tye and ſtrength to them, as ſhould make them more Terrible to thoſe that held out, and be the firmer to each other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe matters were on Foot, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades,</hi> who was not of an Humour to be quiet, and who hated the <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> becauſe of their Applications to <hi>Nici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> and that they attended him, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt and deſpiſed <hi>Alcibiades.</hi> Yet from firſt to laſt, he heartily oppoſed the Peace, tho' all in vain. Till ſome time afterwards, finding that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together come up to pleaſe the <hi>Athenians,</hi> but ſeemed to do them Injuſtice in having made a League offenſive and defenſive with the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> and had not obſerved the Agreement ſo fully in the delivery of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nactus,</hi> nor yet of <hi>Anthipolis,</hi> he laid hold on theſe Occaſions for his purpoſe, and from every trifle inſtigated the People. At the length taking aſide the Ambaſſadours of the <hi>Argives,</hi> he endeavoured to bring them over into a Confederacy with the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But afterwards when the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Ambaſſadours were come with <hi>full Powers,</hi> and at their firſt Audience by the <hi>Council,</hi> they ſeemed to come in all Points,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:35403:226"/>
with juſt Propoſals: He, fearing that the People would be drawn to be of their Mind, Circumvented the Ambaſſadours, topping upon them, and ſwearing that he was ready to aſſiſt them in all things, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they would not confeſs that they came with <hi>full Powers,</hi> that being the only way for them to attain their Deſires.</p>
               <p>They being over-perſwaded, and decoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Nicias,</hi> to follow him, he Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and asked them preſently whether or no they came in all Points with <hi>full Powers,</hi> which when they denyed, he, contrary to their Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, changing his Countenance, called the Council to witneſs their Words and now bids the People, <hi>Beware how they truſt, or tranſact any thing with ſuch manifeſt Lyars: Who now affirm this, now the quite contrary of the very ſame thing.</hi> Theſe <hi>Plenipotenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries</hi> (as well-they might) being aſtoniſht at this, and <hi>Nicias</hi> at a loſs what to ſay being ſtruck with Amazement and Wonder, the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> reſolved to ſend away immediately for the <hi>Argives,</hi> to ſtrike up a League with them. But an Earth-quake, which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and brake the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> made for <hi>Nicias</hi>'s advantage: For the next day the People being again aſſembled, after, many Speeches, and great Canvaſſing and Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing, with much ado he brought it about
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:35403:226"/>
that the Treaty with the <hi>Argives,</hi> ſhould be deferred, and he be ſent to the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> he promiſing that ſo all would go well.</p>
               <p>When he arrived at <hi>Sparta,</hi> they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<note place="margin">Ambaſſy to <hi>Sparta.</hi>
                  </note> him there as a good Man, and one well-inclined towards them; yet he effected nothing, but overcome by them that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> he returned home, not only Diſhonoured, and hardly ſpoken of, but likewiſe in fear of the <hi>Athenians:</hi> who were vext and enraged, that through his Perſwaſions they had let go ſo many, and ſo conſiderable Perſons; for they who had been brought from <hi>Pylos,</hi> were of the chiefeſt Families of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and had the higheſt there in Place and Power, for their Friends and Kindred.</p>
               <p>Yet did they not in their heat proceed againſt him, otherwiſe than that they choſe <hi>Alcibiades</hi> their General, and took the <hi>Mantineans</hi> and <hi>Eleans</hi> (who had revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi>) into the League, together with the <hi>Argives:</hi> And ſent to <hi>Pylos Free-Booters</hi> to infeſt <hi>Laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> whereby the War began to break out afreſh.</p>
               <p>But the Enmity betwixt <hi>Nicias</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades,</hi> running higher and higher, and the time at hand for decreeing the <hi>Oſtraciſm</hi> (or<note place="margin">Oſtraciſm.</note> Baniſhment for ten Years, which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:35403:227"/>
putting the Name in a <hi>Shell,</hi> were wont to inflict at certain times, on ſome Perſon ſuſpected, or otherwiſe envied for his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity or Wealth) on which occaſion very much Trouble and Danger attended them both, one of them (in all likelihood) being to undergo this <hi>Oſtraciſm,</hi> for the People did abominate the Life of <hi>Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> but ſtood in fear of his Boldneſs and Reſolution; as is ſhewn particularly in the Hiſtory of him.</p>
               <p>Then for <hi>Nicias,</hi> his Riches made him envied, and beſides more eſpecially, his courſe of Life ſeemed neither Popular nor Civil, but reſerved, unſociable, and auſtere. And now becauſe he ſtrongly (againſt the Grain) oppoſed their Inclinations, forcing them againſt their Intereſt, they hated him.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak plainly, it was a Conteſt of the young Men and Soldiers of Fortune, againſt the men of Years, and Lovers of Peace, they turning the <hi>Oſtraciſm</hi> upon the one, theſe upon the other.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Into Diviſions when the People fall,</l>
                  <l>The choice oft lights on the worſt Man of all.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>As now it happened, that the City diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into two Factions, preferred the moſt impudent and profligate Perſons: Amongſt
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:35403:227"/>
whom was <hi>Hyperbolus</hi> of <hi>Perithus.</hi> A fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low<note place="margin">Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</note> not preſuming from any Power, but from his Preſumption riſing into Power; and by the Honour he found in the City, becoming the Scandal of it.</p>
               <p>He at this time thought himſelf far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from the <hi>Oſtraciſm,</hi> as more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerving the Gallows, and made account that one of theſe men being diſpatched out of the way, he might be able to Bandy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other that ſhould be left; he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly ſhew'd himſelf to rejoyce at the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention, and ſtirred the People againſt both of them. <hi>Nicias</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> perceiving his Malice, did ſecretly combine together, and ſetting both Intereſts jointly at work, did prevail that neither of them both, but even <hi>Hyperbolus</hi> ſhould undergo the <hi>Oſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed at the firſt made ſport, and raiſed Laughter amongſt the People, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they took it in great Indignation, as having injured the thing by ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a Fellow, there being a kind of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in this Puniſhment; looking upon the <hi>Oſtraciſm</hi> as a Puniſhment rather for <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles, Ariſtides,</hi> and ſuch like Perſons. But for <hi>Hyperbolus</hi> 'twas a Glory, and a fair Pretence for him to boaſt, when for his Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy he ſuffered the ſame with the beſt Men: As <hi>Plato</hi> the Comick Poet ſaid of him,</p>
               <lg>
                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:35403:228"/>
                  <l>He ſuffers what was for ill manners fit,</l>
                  <l>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfit for him, unfit for branded Villains,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Oſtraciſm</hi> was not meant for ſuch as he.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And in Fact, none ever afterwards ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered this ſort of Baniſhment, but <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus</hi> was the laſt. <hi>Hipparchus</hi> the <hi>Cholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> (who was of kin to the Tyrant) was the firſt.</p>
               <p>There is no judgment to be made of Fortune; 'tis not to be comprehended by reaſon: For if <hi>Nicias</hi> had run the risk with <hi>Alcibiades</hi> whether of the two ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the <hi>Oſtraciſm,</hi> he had either prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and (his Rival expelled the City) he had remained ſecure; or being overcome, he had avoided the utmoſt Diſaſters, and preſerved the Reputation of a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Commander.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> ſays, <hi>Hyperbolus</hi> was baniſh'd; <hi>Phaeax,</hi> not <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias,</hi> conteſting it with <hi>Alcibiades;</hi> but moſt Authors differ from him.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Egeſtan</hi> and <hi>Leontin</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors arrived, and perſwaded the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to make War upon <hi>Sicily, Nicias</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them, but was run down by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions and Ambition of <hi>Alcibiades;</hi> who even before the People could be aſſembled, entertained and corrupted them with Hopes
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:35403:228"/>
and with Speeches; inſomuch that the young Men at their Sports, and the old Men in their Porches, and ſitting together on the Benches, would be drawing Maps of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and making Charts, deſcribing the Seas, the Harbors, and Places that this Iſle ſhews oppoſite to the <hi>African</hi> Shore: For they made not <hi>Sicily</hi> the end of the War, but the Magazine from whence they might carry it to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and be Maſters of <hi>Africk,</hi> and of all the Seas, even to <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Pillars.</p>
               <p>Now therefore the Bulk of the People preſſing this way, <hi>Nicias</hi>'s Party, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them, was neither many, nor of much Intereſt; for the Men of Subſtance (fearing leſt they ſhould ſeem to decline the Publick Charges, and Ship money) were quiet, againſt their Inclination, yet was not he tired, nor gave off; but when the <hi>Athenians</hi> decreed a War, and choſe him in the firſt place General, together with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi> and <hi>Lamachus,</hi> when they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain aſſembled, he ſtood up, diſſwaded<note place="margin">

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:35403:229"/>
for the Employment; his Warineſs, with the Bravery of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and the mildneſs of <hi>Lamachus,</hi> all mix'd together, promis'd great Security, and very much promoted the Suffrages: So that <hi>Demoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> (who, of the leading Men, chiefly preſs'd the <hi>Athenians</hi> to the Expedition) ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>He would ſtop the Mouth of</hi> Nicias <hi>from urging any more Excuſes;</hi> and thereupon mov'd that the Generals might <hi>have abſolute Power, both at home and abroad, to Order and to Act what they liſt.</hi> And this he got paſs'd into a Law.</p>
               <p>However, the Prieſts are ſaid to have very earneſtly oppoſed this Enterprize. But <hi>Alcibiades</hi> had his <hi>Divines</hi> of another Cut, who from ſome old Prophecies foretold <hi>the</hi> Athenians <hi>to get great renown from</hi> Sicily. And certain Pilgrims came back to him from <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> with Oracles impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that <hi>the</hi> Athenians <hi>ſhould take all the</hi> Syracuſians.</p>
               <p>They who knew any thing that boded<note place="margin">Prodigies.</note> ill, concealed it, leſt they might ſeem to foreſpeak ill Luck; for even Prodigies that were obvious and plain, would not deterr them; nor the defacing of the <hi>Hermae,</hi> all in one Night maimed, ſave only that one, called the <hi>Herma</hi> of <hi>Andocides,</hi> erected by the <hi>Aegean</hi> Tribe, placed then directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Houſe of <hi>Andocides,</hi> nor what was
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:35403:229"/>
perpetrated on the Altar of the <hi>twelve Gods,</hi> where a certain man leapt ſuddenly upon the Altar, and then turning round, with a ſtone cut off his Privities. Likewiſe at <hi>Delphos</hi> there ſtood a Golden Image of <hi>Minerva</hi> in a Palm-tree of Braſs, erected by the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> for the Spoils they won from the <hi>Medes;</hi> this was peckt at ſeveral days together by Crows flying upon it, and they pluckt off the Fruit of the Palm-tree, which was Gold, and threw it down. But the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſaid, <hi>theſe were all but Tricks of the</hi> Delphians, <hi>corrupted by the Men of</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe.</p>
               <p>And a certain Oracle requiring them to bring from <hi>Clazomene</hi> a She-prieſt of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi>(whom they now ſent for) named <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſychia,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Quietneſs,</hi> hereby, 'tis likely, the Divine Powers adviſed the City at this time to be quiet.</p>
               <p>Whether therefore the Aſtrologer <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Meton.</note> feared theſe Preſages, or that from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon he doubted the Succeſs (for he was appointed a Commander) he feigning himſelf mad, ſet his houſe on fire. Others ſay, he did not counterfeit himſelf mad, but ſet his houſe on fire in the Night, and the next Morning went into the Court in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful plight, and beſeeched the People in Conſideration of the ſad Diſaſter, to releaſe his Son from the Service, who was about
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:35403:230"/>
to go Captain of a Gally for <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Wiſe <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Socrates</hi> his genius.</note> by the uſual Tokens, revealed all this to him, and that this Expedition would prove the Ruin of the Common-wealth; the which he imparted again to his Friends and Familiars, and afterwards it ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout amongſt the People.</p>
               <p>And not a few were troubled, becauſe of the days on which the Fleet ſet Sail, it hapning to be at that time when the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men celebrated the Funeral of <hi>Adonis;</hi> there being every where then expoſed to view Images of dead Men, carried about with Mourning and Lamentation, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men beating their Breaſts: So that ſuch as lay any ſtreſs on theſe Matters, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly troubled; and feared leſt that all theſe Warlike Preparations, ſo Splendid and ſo Glorious, ſhould ſuddenly, in a little time be blaſted, and come to nothing.</p>
               <p>Now for <hi>Nicias,</hi> in that he oppoſed the Voting of this Expedition, and neither was puft up with Hopes, nor tranſported with the Honour of his high Command, he ſhow'd himſelf Wiſe, and a man of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: But when his endeavours could not divert the People from the War, nor get leave himſelf to be diſcharged of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but the People, as it were, violently forced him againſt his Will, to be their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:35403:230"/>
this was no longer now a time for his mighty Caution, and his Delays, or for him (even like a Child) to look back from the Ship, often repeating, and reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over and over again, how that <hi>he had not been over-ruled by Reaſons,</hi> thereby blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Courage of his Fellow-Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and loſing the nick of time for Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. VVhereas he ought preſently to have ruſht upon the Enemy, brought the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to an iſſue, and thrown all upon For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune immediately.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Lamachus</hi> had counſell'd to Sail directly to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and give the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Battel under their City-Walls: And <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi> adviſed to cut off their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the other Towns, and then to march againſt them; <hi>Nicias</hi> diſſented from them both, and ſtiffly inſiſted that they ſhould Cruiſe around the Iſland, and alarm the Coaſts, and having Landed a ſmall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of men for the <hi>Egeſteans,</hi> return to <hi>Athens.</hi> Thus he diſtracted their Counſels, and caſt down the Spirits of the men.</p>
               <p>And a little while after, (the <hi>Athenians</hi> having called home <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in Order to his Tryal) he being, though joyned with another in Commiſſion, in effect the only General, made now no end of Loytering, of Cruiſing, and Conſidering, till their hopes were grown ſtale, and all the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:35403:231"/>
and Conſternation which the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and view of their Forces had caſt amongſt the Enemy was worn off, and had left them.</p>
               <p>VVhilſt yet <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was with the Fleet, they went before <hi>Syracuſe</hi> with a ſquadron of ſixty Gallies, fifty of them were kept in Battalia without the Haven, the other ten forced their way in to make diſcovery. And by an Herald they demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Leontins</hi> to be ſent home.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſcouts took a Gally of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, wherein they found certain Tablets, on which was ſet down a Liſt of all the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> according to their Tribes. Theſe were wont to be laid up remote from the City, in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> but were now brought forth to furniſh a Muſter-Roll of young Men for the War. Theſe being ſo taken by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and carried to the Officers, and the multitude of Names appearing, the Divines put an ill Conſtruction upon't, as if hereby were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd the Old Prophecy, <hi>That the</hi> Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>ſhall take all the</hi> Syracuſians. Yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this was ſaid to be accompliſht by the <hi>Athenians</hi> at another bout, that time when <hi>Callipus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> having ſlain <hi>Dion,</hi> held <hi>Syrucuſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when <hi>Alcibiades</hi> and a few with him were ſhipt off from <hi>Sicily,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:35403:231"/>
fell wholly to <hi>Nicias;</hi> for <hi>Lamachus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lamachus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> handled his Weapon in fight with great Dexterity, was ſtout, and very honeſt, yet ſo extremely Poor and Low, that as often as the <hi>Athenians</hi> beſtowed on him a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he would always to their Account, bring ſome little reckoning or other of Money for his very Cloaths, and Shooes to his Feet. On the Contrary, <hi>Nicias,</hi> as in other matters, in Riches and Oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on carried it high.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid, that once upon a time, the chief Magiſtrates being in Conſultation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he bid <hi>Sophocles</hi> the Poet ſpeak his Opinion firſt, as the Ancienteſt Magiſtrate. <hi>I</hi> (quoth he) <hi>am indeed before you in Years, but you are the firſt in Authority and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So here having <hi>Lamachus,</hi> that better underſtood Military Affairs, at under; and evermore delaying and dodging, and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employing his Forces: Firſt, his Sailing about <hi>Sicily,</hi> at the greateſt diſtance, aloof from the Enemy; then afterwards beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hyble,</hi> a ſmall pitiful Town, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off before he could take it, rendered him extremely deſpicable; at the length he retreats to <hi>Catana,</hi> without having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved any thing, ſave that he demoliſh't <hi>Hyccara,</hi> a little poor quarter of the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> where 'tis reported that <hi>Lais</hi> the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,

whilſt yet a Maiden, was ſold amongſt the other Slaves, and carried thence away to <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when the Summer was ſpent, after that it was noiſed about that the <hi>Syracuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were grown ſo Cock-a-hoop, that they would come, and firſt attack him: And the Troopers skirmiſhing to the very Camp, twitted them, asking, <hi>Whether they came to Penſion with the</hi> Cataneans? <hi>Or they came to put again the</hi> Leontins <hi>in Poſſeſſion of their Houſes?</hi> Now it was, that with much ado <hi>Nicias</hi> reſolved to ſit down before <hi>Syracuſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to the end he might ſafely and without Moleſtation form his Camp, he ſent a Man, as a Renegade from <hi>Catana,</hi> with Intelligence to the <hi>Syracuſians, That they might ſeize the</hi> Athenian <hi>Camp void of Men, and all their Arms, if they on ſuch a day march with all their Forces to</hi> Catana: And, <hi>That the</hi> Athenians <hi>living moſtwhat in the Town, the Friends of the</hi> Syracuſians <hi>had contrived, ſo ſoon as they ſhould perceive them coming, to poſſeſs themſelves of one of the Gates, and to fire the Navy; that many now were in the Conſpiracy, and waited their Arrival.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicias</hi> ſhow'd good Conduct in this only Inſtance of all the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Expedition; for having drawn away all the ſtrength of

the Enemy, and made the City quite deſtitute of Men, he ſet out from <hi>Catana,</hi> he entred the Haven, and he choſe a fit place for his Camp, where the Enemy could nor incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode him, with that wherein lay their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; but in thoſe things wherein he had the Advantage, he might expect to maul them without impediment.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> returned from <hi>Catana,</hi> and ſtood in Battle-Array before the City-Gates, he on the ſudden drawing forth the <hi>Athenians,</hi> fell on them and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated them; yet he ſlew not many, the Horſe hindering their purſuit. But his cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and breaking down the Bridges that lay over the River, gave <hi>Hermocrates</hi> (heartning the <hi>Syracuſians</hi>) occaſion to ſay, That, Nicias <hi>was ridiculous, whoſe great Conduct is to avoid fighting, as if fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were not the thing he came for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However he caſt the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> into a grievous Fright and Conſternation, ſo that in the ſtead of Fifteen Generals then in Service, they choſe Three others to whom the People engaged by Oath to let them Command abſolute.</p>
               <p>There was nigh them a Temple of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Olympius,</hi> which the <hi>Athenians</hi> (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it many Conſecrated things of Gold and Silver) had a great mind to take, which <hi>Nicias</hi> induſtriouſly delaying, loſt the
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:35403:233"/>
Opportunity, and let a Garriſon of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſians</hi> enter it, he judging that if the Soldiers ſhould make Booty of that wealth, 'twou'd be no manner of advantage to the Publick, and he ſhould bear the Infamy of the impiety.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Nicias,</hi> not improving in the leaſt his Victory, that had made ſo much noiſe every where, after a few days ſtay, whip away goes he to <hi>Naxus,</hi> there Winters with ſuch an Army upon exceſſive Charges, and performs little of moment with ſome <hi>Sicili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> revolted to him.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch that the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> took Heart again, made Excurſions to <hi>Catana,</hi> waſted the Country, and fired the Camp of the <hi>Athenians.</hi> Now every Body blam'd <hi>Nicias</hi> as who with his Argumentations, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, and his mighty Cautions had let ſlip the time for Action. None ever found fault with the Man when once ſet a going, for in the brunt he was brisk and active, but was ſlow, and wanted aſſurance to engage. When therefore he brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Army to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> ſuch was his Conduct, and with ſuch both celerity and ſafety, he came upon them, that no Body knew of his Arrival with the Gallies at <hi>Thap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> of his Deſcent, nor his Surpriſal of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipolae:</hi> Then beat he the choiceſt Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, took three hundred Priſoners, and
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:35403:233"/>
routed the Cavalry of the Enemy, which were thought invincible.</p>
               <p>But that which chiefly aſtoniſh'd the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſians,</hi> and ſeemed incredible to the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> was, in ſo little time the walling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> a Town not leſs than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> but far more difficult, by the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venneſs of the Ground, the nearneſs of the Sea, and the Mariſhes adjacent, to have ſuch a Wall drawn in a Circle round it. Yet this, all within a very little, finiſh'd by a Man that had not his Health competent for ſo weighty Cares, but lay all ill of the Stone; Which may juſtly be blam'd for what was left undone. I admire the Toyl of the General, and the Bravery of the Soldiers, for what they performed. <hi>Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides</hi> after their Rout and Diſaſter, writing their Funeral Elegy, thus Sang,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Theſe did eight times the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> Foyl,</l>
                  <l>But then the Gods ſtood Neuter all the while.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And in truth one ſhall not find eight, but many more Victories won by theſe Men againſt the <hi>Syracuſians;</hi> till the Gods or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune plainly gave a Check to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> when lifted to the top of their Power and Greatneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicias</hi> therefore doing violence to his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, was preſent in moſt Actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:35403:234"/>But when his Diſeaſe was the ſharpeſt upon him, he lay in the Camp, with ſome few Servants to attend him. And <hi>Lama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> having the Command, fought the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſians</hi> (who were bringing a Croſs-Wall from the <hi>City,</hi> along to that of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to hinder them from carrying it round) and in the Victory, the <hi>Athenians</hi> hurrying in ſome Diſorder to the purſuit, <hi>Lamachus,</hi> left alone, withſtood the <hi>Syracuſian</hi> Horſe that came upon him; before the reſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced <hi>Callicrates,</hi> a man of good Courage and Mettle, <hi>Lamachus</hi> upon the Challenge engaged with him in ſingle Combat, who received the firſt wound, yet returned it ſo home to <hi>Callicrates,</hi> that they both fell down and died together.</p>
               <p>And now the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> took away the Body and Arms of <hi>Lamachus,</hi> and in great haſt marcht to the Wall of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> where <hi>Nicias</hi> lay without any Guards; yet rouzed by this neceſſity, and beholding the Danger, he bid thoſe about him go and ſet on Fire all the Wood, and Materials that lay provided before the Wall for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, and the Engines themſelves; this put a ſtop to the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> ſaved <hi>Nicias,</hi> ſaved the Walls, and all the Money of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> For when the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> ſaw ſo much Fire flaming in the middle of them, they wheeled off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:35403:234"/>Now whilſt theſe things were Atchieved, <hi>Nicias</hi> only was left of all the Generals, and he began to conceive great Hopes, for the Cities revolted to him, and Ships laden with Corn from Coaſt every came to the Camp, every one favouring when Matters went well. And now ſome Diſcourſes paſt amongſt the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> (deſparing to defend the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) about a Treaty with him.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Gylippus</hi> who came with a Squadron to their aid from <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> heard on board of the Wall ſurrounding them, and of their Streights, he ſo ſteered for the reſt, as that giving <hi>Sicily</hi> for loſt, he might now if poſſible ſecure the <hi>Italians</hi> their Cities. For a ſtrong report was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ſpread about, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> carried all before them; and had now a General for Conduct, and for Fortune in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Nicias</hi> himſelf now againſt his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, grown Preſumptuous in his preſent Strength and Succeſs (eſpecially from the Intelligence he received under-hand of the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> believing they would ſurrender the Town upon Terms) had no manner of regard to <hi>Gylippus</hi> coming to their Aſſiſtance,<note place="margin">Gylippus.</note> nor ſet out any Scouts to purpoſe; ſo that neglected altogether, and deſpiſed, <hi>Gylippus</hi> went in a long Boat aſhore, without the knowledge of <hi>Nicias;</hi> and having Landed
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:35403:235"/>
in the remoteſt parts from <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> he muſtered up a great Army, the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> neither knowing of his Arrival, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting him: So that an Aſſembly was ſummoned in Order to a Parley with <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias,</hi> and ſome were haſty to have all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, before the Town ſhould be quite walled round, for now remained very little to be done, and the Materials lay all ready on the place.</p>
               <p>In this very nick of Time and Danger, arriv'd <hi>Gongylus</hi> in one Gally from <hi>Corinth,</hi> and every one (as you may imagine) flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about him, he told them that <hi>Gylippus</hi> would be with them ſpeedily, and other Ships to relieve them. Now, e're they could perfectly believe <hi>Gongylus,</hi> an expreſs was brought from <hi>Gylippus,</hi> to bid them go forth to meet him: So now, plucking up a good Heart, they took Arms; and <hi>Glyippus</hi> was preſently upon the March, and by the way ranged them in Battel-array againſt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> as <hi>Nicias</hi> alſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battelled theſe. And <hi>Gylippus</hi> in view of the <hi>Athenians</hi> laying down his Arms, ſent an Herald to tell them, <hi>He would give them leave with Bag and Baggage to depart quietly from</hi> Sicily. To this <hi>Nicias</hi> would not vouchſafe any Anſwer, but ſome of his Soldiers laughing, askt <hi>if with the ſight of one Cloak and</hi> Laconian <hi>Staff, the</hi> Syracuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:35403:235"/>
                  <hi>Matters were ſo well hop'd up, in the turn of an hand to deſpiſe the</hi> Athenians, <hi>who had releaſed to the</hi> Lacedaemonians <hi>three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, whom they held in Chains, Goodlier men than</hi> Gylippus, <hi>and with longer Locks? Timaeus</hi> alſo writes, That even the <hi>Syracuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> made no Account of <hi>Gylippus,</hi> at the firſt ſight, drolling upon his Staff and long Hair, as afterwards they hated his Avarice and narrow Spirit.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author ſays, that <hi>Gylippus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, many came fluttering about him, as it were ſome Owl, and were liſted under him. And this is more like the Truth than what was ſaid before; for in the Staff and the Cloak beholding the Badge and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Sparta,</hi> they crowded to him. And <hi>Thucydides</hi> affirms, that all the Work was done by him alone; ſo does <hi>Philiſtus,</hi> who was a <hi>Syracuſian,</hi> and a Spectator of all that paſt.</p>
               <p>However, the <hi>Athenians</hi> had the better of the firſt Encounter, and ſlew ſome few of the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> amongſt whom was <hi>Gongy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Yet the next day <hi>Gylippus</hi> ſhow'd what it is to be a Man of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for with the ſame Arms, the ſame Horſes, and on the ſame ſpot of Ground, changing only the Figure of the Battel, he overcame the <hi>Athenians:</hi> and they fleeing to their Camp, he ſet the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> to
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:35403:236"/>
work, and with the Stone and Materials that had been brought together for finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Wall of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> he built a Croſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Wall to intercept theirs and break it down, ſo as nought remained to them of all their toyl.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> taking Courage, manned out their Gallies, and with their Horſe and followers ranging about, they gathered up a great many Priſoners, and <hi>Gylippus</hi> going himſelf to the Cities, ſtirred and inſtigated them, who all heard him readily, and took Arms. So that <hi>Nicias</hi> fell again to his old Conſiderations, and, ſeeing the Face of Affairs change, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponded and writ to <hi>Athens,</hi> bidding them <hi>ſend either another Army, or rather recall this out of</hi> Sicily; <hi>that he might however be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharged of the Command, becauſe of his Diſeaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before this, the <hi>Athenians</hi> had been very hot of ſending another Army to <hi>Sicily,</hi> but Envy of <hi>Nicias</hi>'s former great Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Succeſs, caſt in many Delays, till now that they were all for haſtening away Recruits. <hi>Eurymedon</hi> went before, in Mid-winter, with Money, and to declare <hi>Euthydemus</hi> and <hi>Menander</hi> (choſen out of thoſe that ſerved there under <hi>Nicias</hi>) to be Joint-Commanders with him. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was to go after in the Spring with a great Navy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="453" facs="tcp:35403:236"/>In the mean time <hi>Nicias</hi> was briskly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackt both by Sea and Land; in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he had the diſadvantage in his ſhipping, yet did he deſtroy and ſink many Gallies of the Enemy. But by Land, he could not provide ſuccour in time, ſo <hi>Gylippus</hi> fell upon, and ſurprized <hi>Plemmyrion</hi> at the firſt Aſſault in which the Stores for the Navy, and a great ſumm of Money (being there kept) was all loſt, many there he ſlew, and took others Priſoners. What was of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt importance, he cut off the Proviſions from <hi>Nicias,</hi> which were ſafely and readily convoy'd to him whilſt the <hi>Athenians</hi> held <hi>Plemmyrion;</hi> they being beaten out, he could not be ſupplied but with great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and with fighting the Enemy, who rid at Anchor under that Fort.</p>
               <p>And now it ſeemed manifeſt to the <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſians</hi> that their Navy had not been beaten by Strength, but by their Diſorder in the Purſuit: Now therefore all Hands, went to work to fit out a gallanter Fleet than the former, however <hi>Nicias</hi> had no Stomach to a Sea-fight, but ſaid, '<hi>twas madneſs for them</hi> (<hi>when</hi> Demoſthenes <hi>was coming in all haſte with ſo great a Fleet and freſh Forces to their Recruit</hi>) <hi>to engage the Enemy with a leſs number of Ships and ill provided.</hi> On the contrary <hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Euthydemus,</hi> puft up with their new Command, let looſe
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:35403:237"/>
their Ambition, and envy againſt both the Old Generals: They were for preventing <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> by ſome brave Action before his coming; and were for doing ſomething beyond <hi>Nicias,</hi> they pretended <hi>the Honour of the City, which</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>would be ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh'd and utterly loſt, if they ſhould be afraid of the</hi> Syracuſians, <hi>who dared them to Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they forced <hi>Nicias</hi> to a Sea-fight; and by a Stratagem of <hi>Ariſton,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gallies, they in the left Wing (as <hi>Thucydides</hi> tells us) were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and loſt many of their Men.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Nicias</hi> was overwhelmed with Deſpair, beaten when he had the ſole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and again miſcarrying with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</p>
               <p>But now by this time was diſcovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Haven <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> moſt ſplendidly equipp'd, and terrible to behold. He brought along, in ſeventy three Gallies, five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men of Arms; of Darters, Archers, and Slingers, not leſs than 3000, with the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring of their Armour, the Flags and Streamers, waving in the Air from the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the multitude of Trumpeters, and Minſtrels, and Hoboys, and ſet off with all the Warlike Pomp and Oſtentation, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may the Enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:35403:237"/>Now (one may believe) the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> were again in a deadly fright, ſeeing no end nor expectation, but toiling in vain, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Nicias</hi> was not long overjoyed for this Reinforcement; for the firſt time he came to ſpeech with <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> (who adviſed <hi>forthwith to attaque the</hi> Syracuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>and ſpeedily to put all to the hazard; to win</hi> Syracuſe, <hi>and return home</hi>) afraid, and wondring at his briskneſs and temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he beſeeched him <hi>to do nothing raſhly and deſperately, ſeeing that delay would be the Ruine of the Enemy, whoſe Money would not hold out, nor their Confederates be long kept together; that when once they came to be pinch'd with Want, they would again preſently ſeek to him for Terms, as formerly; that many in</hi> Syracuſe, <hi>who held ſecret Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with him, wiſh'd him to ſtay, in regard they were tired with the War, nor could endure</hi> Gylippus <hi>longer: And if their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities ſhould the leaſt ſharpen upon them, they would give up all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicias,</hi> glancing darkly at theſe matters, and partly unwilling to ſpeak out plainly, put the Captains to imagine, that it was pure Cowardice which made him talk in this manner: And they (ſaying <hi>that he was now again upon the relapſe to his old Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Shifts, and Trifling, whereby he</hi>
                  <pb n="456" facs="tcp:35403:238"/>
                  <hi>let ſlip the Opportunity, in not immediately falling on the Enemy, but ſuffering his Men to cool, and to grow contemptible</hi>) ſtuck to <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> and with much ado forced <hi>Nicias</hi> to comply.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> with a Party of Foot, by night made an Aſſault upon <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polae;</hi> part of the Enemy he ſlew ere they took the Alarm; the reſt, defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he put to flight. Nor was he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this Victory there, but puſh'd on further, till he fell among the <hi>Baeotians;</hi> for theſe were the firſt that made head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and, after a great Shout, warmly charged them with Puſh of Pike, and killed many on the Place. And now was there nothing but Horror and Confuſion throughout the whole Army; the Body that ſtood involved with thoſe that fled, they that defended, and thoſe who came round, falling foul together, knock'd one another down, taking them in the purſuit for thoſe that fled, and handling their Friends as if they were the Enemy. For jumbled thus in diſorder, diſtracted with blind Fear and Uncertainties, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning falſe, the Night not being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely dark, nor yielding any ſteady Light, the Moon then towards ſetting, ſhadowed with many Weapons and Bodies that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to and fro, and glimmering ſo as not to
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:35403:238"/>
ſhew an Object plain, but to make, through fear, a Familiar, ſuſpected for a Foe; which caſt the <hi>Athenians</hi> into horrid difficulties and deſpair.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, they had the Moon on their Backs, whereby they ſhaded one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and both hid their Numbers and the Glittering of their Arms; but the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Moon from the Shields of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, made them ſhew more numerous, and better appointed than indeed they were.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Being preſs'd on every ſide where they had retreated, they took the rout; and, in their flight, ſome were deſtroyed by the Enemy, ſome fell by the hands of their Friends, and ſome tumbled down the Rocks. Thoſe that were diſpers'd and ſtragled in the Fields, were pick'd up in the morning by the Horſemen, and put to the Sword; the ſlain were Two thouſand; of the reſt few came off ſafe with their Arms.</p>
               <p>Upon this Diſaſter, <hi>Nicias,</hi> ſtruck, as might be expected, accuſed the raſhneſs of <hi>Demoſthenes;</hi> but he coloured it over, and adviſed <hi>to be gone in all haſte; for neither were other Forces to come, nor the Enemy to be beaten with the preſent; or ſuppoſing they were yet too hard for the Enemy, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they ought to remove, and avoid that place, being always accounted a ſickly place,</hi>
                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:35403:239"/>
                  <hi>and dangerous for an Army; eſpecially now, becauſe of the ſeaſon, being (as they ſee by experience) Pernicious.</hi> It was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Autumn,</hi> and many now lay ſick, and all were out of heart.</p>
               <p>It grieved <hi>Nicias</hi> to hear of flight, and departing home, not that he did not fear the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> but he was worſe affraid of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> their Impeachments, and Sentence, therefore he made as if he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended nothing farther there; or, ſhould ought happen, better dye by the hand of an Enemy, than by his Fellow-Citizens.</p>
               <p>He was not of the opinion which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Leo</hi> of <hi>Byzantium</hi> declared to his Fellow-Citizens, <hi>I had rather</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>periſh by you, than with you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicias</hi> therefore, for the matter of place and quarter, whither to remove their Camp, ſaid, <hi>That might be debated at leiſure:</hi> And <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> his former Counſel ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſucceeded ſo ill, ceaſed to preſs him farther; others thought <hi>Nicias</hi> expected, and had aſſurance from ſome Body within the City, which made him ſo ſtoutly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their retreat, ſo they did acquieſce. But another Army coming to the <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> and the Sickneſs raging in his Camp, he alſo now approved of their retreat; and commanded the Soldiers to make ready to go aboard.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="459" facs="tcp:35403:239"/>And when all were in readineſs, and none of the Enemy had obſerved them, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſuch a thing, the Moon fell E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyps'd<note place="margin">An E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe.</note> in the Night, to the great fright of <hi>Nicias,</hi> and of others, who, for want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, or out of Superſtition, are ſcar'd with theſe Appearances. That the Sun would be dark'ned about the Thirtieth day of the Month by the Moon going between, this even the ordinary People now well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough underſtood; but the Moon it ſelf to be dark'ned, how that could come about, and how on the ſudden a broad full Moon ſhould loſe all her light, and ſhew ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colours, that was not eaſie to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended: But they concluded it <hi>to be O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, and a ſign from God of heavy Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to enſue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For he, who the firſt, and the moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of any, and with the greateſt aſſurance, committed to Writing how the Moon is enlightened and overſhadowed, was <hi>Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras;</hi> yet neither was he ancient, nor his Notion much taken notice of, but was lookt upon as Heterodox, and kept ſecret, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing only amongſt a few, under ſome kind of Caution and Confidence. For they would not ſuffer Naturaliſts and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as they then called them, that is, <hi>ſuch who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of things above;</hi> as leſſening the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, by deducing things from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:35403:240"/>
ſenſeleſs Cauſes, and a long Chain of Neceſſity, without any thing of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or a free Agent.</p>
               <p>Hence it was, that <hi>Protagoras</hi> was Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht, and <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> caſt in Priſon, <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> had very much ado to procure his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and <hi>Socrates,</hi> though he medled not at all in this ſort of Learning, yet was put to death for Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>At the length the Reputation of <hi>Plato</hi> ſhining forth by his Life, and becauſe he ſubjected Natural Neceſſity to a divine and more excellent Principle, he wiped off the obloquy and ſcandal from theſe contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and made way for the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks to all People. So his Friend <hi>Dion,</hi> when the Moon (at the time he was to Embark from <hi>Zacynthus</hi> to go againſt <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius</hi>) was Eclyps'd, was not in the leaſt diſturbed, but went on, and arriving at <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe,</hi> drove away the Tyrant.</p>
               <p>But it ſo fell out with <hi>Nicias,</hi> that he had not at this time a skilful <hi>Divine</hi> with him; for his Domeſtick (and who took off much of his Superſtition) <hi>Stilbides</hi> dyed a little before.</p>
               <p>However, this Prodigy (<hi>as Philochorus</hi> ſaith) could not be unlucky to them that flee, but ſurely very favourable; for things done in fear require to be hidden, for the Light is their Foe.</p>

                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:35403:240"/>Nor was it uſual to obſerve the Sun or Moon more that three days, as <hi>Autoclides</hi> has related in his Commentaries: But <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> perſwaded them to wait another courſe of the Moon; as if he had not preſently ſeen it clear again, after it paſſed the ſhady place, that the Light was no longer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the Earth.</p>
               <p>Yet he in a manner abandoning all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cares, betook himſelf wholly to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; till the Enemy came upon them with their Infantry, beſieging the Forts and Camp, and drew their Ships in a circle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Harbour. Nor did they from the Gallies only, but the little Boys every where got into Cock-boats, and rowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, provoking the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over them. Amongſt theſe a Youth of Noble Parentage, <hi>Heraclides</hi> by name, having launch'd out before the reſt, in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi> Ship purſued and well nigh took him, his Uncle <hi>Pollichus,</hi> in fear for him, made out with Ten Gallies, whereof he had the Command; and the reſt, to relieve <hi>Pollichus,</hi> in like manner drew forth, which brought on a very ſharp Engagement; wherein the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> had the Victory, and ſlew <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> with many others.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the <hi>Athenian</hi> Souldiers had no patience to ſtay longer, but mutiny'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Officers, requiring them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:35403:241"/>
by Land; for the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> upon their Victory, immediately ſhut, and lockt up the Entrance of the Harbour; but <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> would not conſent to this, for it was a ſhameful thing to leave behind ſo many Ships of Burthen, and Gallies, little leſs than Two hundred; putting therefore on board the beſt of the Foot, and the luſtieſt Darters, they filled one Hundred and ten Gallies; the reſt wanted Oars: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his Army, <hi>Nicias</hi> poſted along by the Sea-ſide, deſerting the great Camp, and Walls that reach'd to <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>So the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> not having of a long time performed their uſual Sacrifice to <hi>Hercules,</hi> went up now, both Prieſts and Captains to Sacrifice; And now their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies being Manned, the <hi>Divines</hi> predicted from their Sacrifice, <hi>Victory and Glory to the</hi> Syracuſians, <hi>provided they would not be the Aggreſſors, but fight upon the Defenſive;</hi> for ſo <hi>Hercules</hi> overcame all, by only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending himſelf when ſet upon.</p>
               <p>In this confidence they ſet out: And this proved the hotteſt and fierceſt of all their Sea-fights; raiſing no leſs concern and paſſion in the beholders, than in the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; becauſe they might overſee the whole action, with all the various turns, ſo ſudden and unexpected; wherein the <hi>Athenians</hi>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:35403:241"/>
ſuffered no leſs from their own preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than from the Enemy; for they fought againſt light nimble Ships, with theirs laden, heavy, and at every turn fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling foul on one another. And they were thrown at with Stones that fly indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any way, for which were returned Darts and Arrows, which glancing on the waves, no longer fly point blank, or regard the mark at which they were levell'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſton,</hi> a <hi>Corinthian</hi> Captain, taught this the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> who fighting ſtoutly, fell himſelf in this very Engagement, even whilſt the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> had the Victory.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians,</hi> their loſs and ſlaughter being very great, their flight by Sea cut off, their ſafety by Land ſo difficult, did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinder the Enemy towing away their Ships, from under their noſes, nor demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Dead, judging their want of Burial a leſs Calamity than the leaving behind the ſick and the wounded; all this they had before their eyes, yet far more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than thoſe did they reckon themſelves, who were to work yet thorow more ſuch evils, after all, to make certainly the ſame end.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Athenians</hi> prepared to diſlodge that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gylippus</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> faſt at their Sacrifice and their Cups for their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:35403:242"/>
and it being alſo a Holiday, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not either by Perſwaſion, or by Force to rouze them up, and carry them againſt the <hi>Athenians</hi> as they decamp'd. But <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> of his own Head, put a trick upon <hi>Nicias;</hi> ſending ſome of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to him, that pretended <hi>they came from thoſe that were wont to hold ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with him, to adviſe him not to ſtir that night, the</hi> Syracuſians <hi>having laid am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes, and all beſet the ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicias,</hi> caught with this ſtratagem, did ſimply ſtay; as if he feared leſt that he ſhould not feel the Enemy effectually. For they the next Morning Marching before, ſeized the Paſſes, fortified where the Rivers were fordable, cut down the Bridges, and ordered their Horſemen to range the Plains and Ground that lay open, ſo as to leave no manner of way for the <hi>Athenians</hi> to move without fighting.</p>
               <p>They ſtay'd both that day, and another night, then went along, as if they were leaving their own, not an Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, lamenting and howling for want of Neceſſaries, and for their parting from Friends and Familiars that were not able to help themſelves; and likewiſe judging the preſent evils lighter than thoſe they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:35403:242"/>But among the many miſerable Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that appeared up and down in the Camp, the ſaddeſt ſight of all, was <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> himſelf, labouring under his Malady, and unworthily reduced to extreme want of all accommodations, neceſſary for his condition, which required more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, becauſe of his Sickneſs; yet he bore up under all this Illneſs, and underwent more than many in perfect health could be able to endure: And it was plainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that all this toyl was not for himſelf, or from any regard to his own Life, but purely for their ſake under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he would not abandon hope.</p>
               <p>And indeed the reſt were given over to weeping and lamentation through fear or ſorrow, but he, whenever forced thereunto, 'twas manifeſt, he reflected on the ſhame and diſhonour of this Adventure, ſet againſt the Greatneſs and Glory he had expected to win.</p>
               <p>Not only beholding his perſon, but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind his words, and the diſſwaſions he uſed to prevent this Expedition, they reckoned that ſo much the leſs did he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be thus wretched.</p>
               <p>And they had no heart to put their truſt in the Gods, conſidering that a Man ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, who had performed to the Powers Divine ſo many and ſo great Acts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, ſhould have no more favourable
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:35403:243"/>
Succeſs than the wickedeſt and meaneſt Fellow of the whole Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicias</hi> however endeavoured all the while by his Voice, his Countenance, and his Carriage, to be above theſe Misfortunes; and all along the way pelted at, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Wounds eight days continually from the Enemy: Yet preſerved he the Forces with him in a Body entire, till that <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> was taken Priſoner.</p>
               <p>The Party that he led, whilſt they fought and made a ſtout reſiſtance, were at the Village <hi>Polyzelia</hi> hemmed in; <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> thereupon drew his Sword, and ſmote, but killed not himſelf, the Enemy preſently run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in and ſeizing upon him.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> had gone and informed <hi>Nicias</hi> of this, and he ſent ſome Horſemen, and by them knew the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Armies Defeat, he then vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to ſue to <hi>Gylippus</hi> for a Truce, <hi>for the</hi> Athenians <hi>to depart out of</hi> Sicily, <hi>leaving Hoſtages for the Money that the</hi> Syracuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>had expended in the War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now they would not hear of theſe Propoſals, but threatning them in great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſtorm, and upbraiding them, let fly at them, deſtitute of all things neceſſary. Yet <hi>Nicias</hi> made good his Retreat all that Night, and the next day, through all their Darts, held on his way to the River <hi>Aſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi>
                  <pb n="467" facs="tcp:35403:243"/>
there the Enemy encountring them, drove ſome into the Stream; others, ready to die for thirſt, plunged in headlong, there drinking and drowning with the ſame la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. And here was the cruelleſt and moſt immoderate Slaughter; till <hi>Nicias,</hi> falling down to <hi>Gylippus, Let Pity, O</hi> Gylippus, (ſaid he) <hi>move you in your Victory; not for me, who have ſome Glory and Name from ſuch like Misfortunes, but for the other</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians: <hi>You well know, that the Chance of War is common to all; and the</hi> Athenians <hi>uſed it moderately and mildly towards you in their Proſperity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At theſe Words, and at the ſight of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias, Gylippus</hi> was ſomewhat troubled; for he was ſenſible that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> had received good Offices from <hi>Nicias</hi> in the late Treaty; and he thought it a great and glorious Action, to carry off the Chief Commanders of the <hi>Athenians</hi> alive: Wherefore he received <hi>Nicias</hi> with reſpect, and bid him <hi>be of good Chear;</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Men to ſpare the Lives of the reſt; but the Word of Command being communicated ſlowly, the Slain were far the greater number than the Priſoners. Yet many were privily conveyed away by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Soldiers; thoſe taken openly were hurried together on heaps, their Arms and Spoils hung up on the goodlieſt and the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:35403:244"/>
faireſt Trees all along the River; the Conquerors Crowned, their Horſes ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly adorned, with thoſe of their Enemy cropp'd and cut bare, entred the City, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, in the nobleſt Conteſt, wag'd by <hi>Greeks</hi> againſt <hi>Greeks,</hi> and with the greateſt Strength, and the utmoſt Effort of Valour and Manhood, won a moſt entire Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
               <p>And a General Aſſembly of the People of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and their Confederates, ſitting, <hi>Euricles,</hi> a leading Man, moved firſt, <hi>That the Day on which they took</hi> Nicias, <hi>ſhould from thence-forward be kept Holy-day, by Sacrificing, and forbearing all manner of Work; and from the River, be called, the</hi> Aſſinarian <hi>Feaſt.</hi> This was the Twenty ſixth day of the Month of <hi>July. And that the Servants of the</hi> Athenians, <hi>and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Confederates, be ſold for Slaves; them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the</hi> Sicilian <hi>Auxiliaries, to be kept and employed in the Quarries; except the Captains, and they to be put to death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> debated theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Hermocrates</hi> ſaying, <hi>That to uſe well a Victory, was better than to gain a Victory;</hi> They, in a great Hubbub, rebuked him warmly. And <hi>Gylippus</hi> demanding the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi> Generals to be delivered to him, that he might carry them to the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> now inſolent with
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:35403:244"/>
their good Fortune, gave him ill Words. Yet before this, even in the War, they hardly endured his auſtere Carriage, and <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> Haughtineſs: And (as <hi>Timaeus</hi> tells us) they condemned in him his Sordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Avarice, an Hereditary Vice; for which alſo his Father <hi>Cleandrides,</hi> convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Bribery, was baniſh'd: And this very Man, of the One thouſand Talents which <hi>Lyſander</hi> ſent to <hi>Sparta,</hi> embezell'd Thirty, and hid them under the Tyles of his Houſe; which being detected, he moſt ſhamefully ran his Country. But theſe Matters are more at large handled in the Life of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander. Timaeus</hi> does not ſay, that <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> and <hi>Nicias</hi> were ſtoned to death, as <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Philiſtus</hi> have left written, but that upon a Meſſage from <hi>Hermocrates</hi> (whilſt yet the Aſſembly were ſitting) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them by ſome of the Guards, they ſlew themſelves; and their Bodies, thrown out before the Gates, lay open for a Publick Spectacle.</p>
               <p>I have heard that now to this day, in a Temple at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> is ſhown a ſhield, ſaid to have been <hi>Nicias</hi>'s, with Gold and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple curiouſly wrought and embroidered. Moſt of the <hi>Athenians</hi> periſh'd in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by Diſeaſes and ill Dyet, allowed only two pints of Barley every day, and one of Water. Many of them were carried off by
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:35403:245"/>
ſtealth and ſold, or concealed amongſt the Slaves, and ſold as Slaves, having mark'd an Horſe on their foreheads, which they ſuffered over and above their ſlavery.</p>
               <p>But their modeſty and handſome carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was an advantage to them; for they were either ſoon ſet free, or winning reſpect, continued with thoſe who poſſeſt them.</p>
               <p>Several amongſt them were ſaved for the ſake of <hi>Euripides;</hi> for, of all the In-land <hi>Grecians,</hi> his Muſe (it ſeems) was of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eſteem with the Men of <hi>Sicily.</hi> And when any Travellers arrived, that could tell them ſome Copy, or give them any taſt of his Verſes, they lovingly communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated them to one another. Many of thoſe that were preſerved, are ſaid, after they got home, to have gone and made their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to <hi>Euripides,</hi> relating how that ſome of them had been releaſed from their ſlavery, by teaching what they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member of his Poems; and others, when ſtragling after the fight, been relieved with Meat and Drink for repeating ſome of his Lines. Nor need this be any wonder, for 'tis reported, That a Ship of <hi>Caunus</hi> fleeing into their Harbour for Protection, purſued by Pyrats, was not received, but forced back, till one asked if they had any of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides</hi>'s Verſes, who ſaying they had, they were admitted, and their Ship brought into Harbour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:35403:245"/>'Tis ſaid, that the <hi>Athenians,</hi> chiefly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Reporter, cou'd not believe their loſs; for a certain Stranger (it ſeems) coming to <hi>Peiraeum,</hi> and there ſitting in a Barbers Shop, and talking of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, let fall ſome words, as if the <hi>Athenians</hi> already knew all that had paſt; which the Barber hearing, before he acquainted any body elſe, he ran, in all haſt, up into the City, applyed himſelf to the <hi>Archons,</hi> and preſently ſpread it all about. Whereupon there being every where (as may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd) great Fear and Conſternation, the <hi>Archons</hi> ſummoned a general Aſſembly, and there brought in the Man, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned him how he came to know thoſe things; and he, giving no ſatisfactory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, was taken for a ſpreader of Falſe News, and one that trouble the City; and was therefore faſtned to the Wheel, and rack't a long time, till other Meſſengers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, that related the whole Diſaſter parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.

So many, and ſo excellent Lecturers, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuenſes, Silver-Smiths, Stewards, and Table-waiters, and he always ſtood over them to inſpect and teach them himſelf, accounting it the Duty of a Maſter to look over the Servants, that are indeed the <hi>liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tools</hi> of Houſe-keeping; and herein he was in the right (if he ſpoke as he meant) that the Servants ought to look after all other things, and the Maſter after them: For Oeconomy, which in things Inanimate is but good Huſwifery, in men becomes Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy: but ſurely he was miſtaken when he ſaid, No man was to be accounted Rich, that could not maintain an Army at his own Coſt and Charges; for War, as <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chidamas</hi> well obſerved, has no certain Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, the charge of which is indefinite; and he was clear of another opinion than <hi>C. Marcus;</hi> for he when he had diſtributed fourteen Acres of Land a Man, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that ſome deſired more; God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid (ſays he) that any <hi>Roman</hi> ſhould think that too little which is enough to keep him
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:35403:249"/>
alive and luſty; but however <hi>Craſſus</hi> was very hoſpitable to Strangers, for he kept open Houſe; and to his Friends he would lend Money Intereſt-free; but he called it in preciſely at the time; ſo that his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was worſe than the paying the Intereſt would have been. As for his Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they were very frank and courteous, his Company generally of the middle ſort, the neatneſs and contrivance of them look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better than if they had been more Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent. As for Learning, he chiefly minded Rhetorick, and ſuch Studies as might accompliſh moſt for Publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for although he was naturally as good a Spokeſman as almoſt any of them, yet in his Pains and Induſtry he ſurpaſſed them all; for there was no Trial, how mean and contemptible ſoever, that he came to unprepared; nay, ſeveral times he has gone through with a Cauſe, when <hi>Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi> himſelf have refuſed to ſtand up, upon which account particularly he got the Love of the People, who looked upon him as a neceſſary Man, and one ready to do a good turn: Beſides, the People were pleaſed with his courteous and frank Salutations and Greetings; for he never met any Citizen, how mean and low ſoever, but he returned him his Salute by Name. He was looked upon as a man
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:35403:249"/>
well read in Hiſtory, and pretty well ſeen in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Philoſophy, which one <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> read to him, whoſe Commerce with <hi>Craſſus</hi> was a ſufficient Argument of his good nature and meek diſpoſition: For 'tis hard to ſay whether he was poorer when he entered into his Service, or while he continued in it; for being his only Friend that uſed to accompany him in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes he would lend him a Cloak for a Journey, and when he came home demand it again. O the patience of the Wretch, when even the Philoſophy he profeſſed did not look upon Poverty as a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent! but of this hereafter, when <hi>Cinna</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> got the Power in their hands, 'twas ſoon perceived that they came not for any good they intended to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try but deſigning the ruine and utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Nobility, and as many as they could lay their hands on they ſlew, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which was <hi>Craſſus</hi> his Father and Brother; but himſelf being very young, for the preſent eſcaped the danger; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that he was every way beſet, and hunted after by the Tyrants, taking with him three Friends and ten Servants, with all poſſible ſpeed he fled into <hi>Spain,</hi> having formerly been there, and contracted a great acquaintance while his Father was <hi>Prator</hi> of that Country; but finding all
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:35403:250"/>
People in a Conſternation, and dreading the Cruelty of <hi>Marius,</hi> as if he was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at their Doors, he durſt not diſcover himſelf to any Body, but hid himſelf in a large Cave, which was by the Sea-ſhore, and belonged to <hi>Vibius Pacianus,</hi> to whom he ſent one of his Servants to ſound him, his Proviſions alſo beginning to fail. <hi>Vibius</hi> was well pleaſed at his Eſcape, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the place of his abode, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Companions, he went not to him himſelf, but Commanded his Bayliff to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide every day a good Meals-meat, and carry it and leave it upon ſuch a Stone, and ſo return without taking any further notice, or being inquiſitive, promiſing him his Liberty if he did as he commanded, and that he would kill him if he did otherwiſe. The Cave is not far from the Sea, made by the cloſing together of ſome Cliffs, through the Chinks of which enters a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and delicate Gale: When you are entred, you find a wonderful high Roof, and a great many very large Rooms one within another; neither is it void of Water or Light; for a very pleaſant and wholſome Spring runs through the Cliffs, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Chinks let in the Light all day long; and by reaſon of the thickneſs of the Rock, the Air within is pure and clear, that which is foggy and unhealthful being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:35403:250"/>
away with the Stream. While <hi>Craſſus</hi> remained here, the Steward brought them what was neceſſary, but never ſaw them, nor knew any thing of the matter, though they within ſaw, and expected him at the cuſtomary times; neither was their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment ſuch as juſt to keep them alive, but very plentiful and delicious; for <hi>Pacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> reſolved to treat him with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Civility; and conſidering he was a young Gentleman, he reſolv'd to gratifie a little his youthful Inclinations; for to give juſt what is needful, ſeems rather to come from neceſſity, than from a hearty Friend. Taking with him therefore two handſom Damſels, he ſhew'd them the place, and bid them go in boldly; whom when <hi>Craſſus</hi> and his Friends ſaw, they were afraid of being betray'd; demanding therefore what they were, and what they would have, they, according as they were inſtructed, anſwered, They came to wait upon their Maſter, who was hid in that Cave. Then <hi>Craſſus</hi> perceiving 'twas a kind Trick of <hi>Vibius,</hi> took the Damſels to him, and kept them there with him as long as he ſtaid, who gave an account to <hi>Vibius</hi> of what they wanted, and how their Caſe ſtood. One of which Ladies, though ſhe was very old, <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtellus</hi> ſays, he had ſeen, and often heard her tell the Story.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:35403:251"/>When <hi>Craſſus</hi> had lain concealed there eight Months, as ſoon as he underſtood <hi>Cinna</hi> was dead, he appeared abroad, a great number of People flocking to him, out of which he ſelected 2500. He viſited many Cities (and as ſome write) ſack'd <hi>Halaca;</hi> though he ever obſtinately denied it; hence getting together ſome Ships, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into <hi>Africa,</hi> and joyns with <hi>Metellus Pius</hi> an eminent Perſon, that had raiſed a very conſiderable Army; but upon ſome difference between him and <hi>Metellus,</hi> he ſtay'd not long there, but went over to <hi>Sylla,</hi> by whom he was very much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when <hi>Sylla</hi> paſſed over into <hi>Italy,</hi> he kept all the young Noble-men, that were with him in Employment, ſome he diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one way, and ſome another, it fell to <hi>Craſſus</hi> his ſhare to raiſe men among the <hi>Marſians,</hi> he demanded a Guard, being to paſs through the Enemie's Countrey, to whom <hi>Sylla</hi> replied ſharply; I give you for Guard, your Father, your Brother, your Friends and Kindred, whoſe unjuſt and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el murther I am now going to revenge; whereat <hi>Craſſus</hi> being netled, he went his way, broke boldly through the Enemy, and behaved himſelf briskly in all <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Encounters, from whence, they ſay, began the Emulation for Glory between him and <hi>Pompey;</hi> for though <hi>Pompey</hi> was the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:35403:251"/>
younger man, and had the diſadvantage to be deſcended of a Father that was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteemed by the Citizens, and hated as much as ever Man was; yet in theſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs he appeared ſo glorious and great, that <hi>Sylla</hi> always uſed when he came in, to ſtand up, and pull off his Hat, an Honour which he ſeldom ſhewed to Older men, and of as good Quality, evermore he ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him <hi>Imperator;</hi> this fir'd and ſtung <hi>Craſſus,</hi> though indeed 'twas but <hi>Pompey</hi>'s due to be preferred, for he both wanted experience, and his two innate Vices, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didneſs and Avarice, Tarniſh'd all the Luſtre of his Actions; for when he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Turdeſia,</hi> a Town of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrians,</hi> he converted all the Spoil to his own uſe, for which he was complained of to <hi>Sylla:</hi> Nay, in the laſt and greateſt Battle before <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, where <hi>Sylla</hi> was worſted, ſome of his Batalions giving ground, and others quite broken; though <hi>Craſſus</hi> got the Victory in the right Wing which he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and purſued the Enemy till night, he then ſent to <hi>Sylla</hi> to acquaint him with his Succeſs, and demand Proviſion for his Soldiers. By Preſcriptions and Sequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he loſt his repute, by making great purchaſes for little or nothing, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Preſents too beſides: Nay, they ſay he ſequeſtred ſome one of the <hi>Breſcians</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:35403:252"/>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Order, only for his own profit, wherefore <hi>Sylla</hi> never after truſted him in any Publick Affairs. As no man was more cunning than <hi>Craſſus</hi> to enſnare others by flattery; ſo no man lay more open to it, or ſwallowed the Bait more greedily than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and this particularly was obſerved of him, that though he was the moſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and ſcraping man in the World, yet he ever hated and railed at ſuch People. It troubled him to ſee <hi>Pompey</hi> ſo ſucceſsfull in all his Undertakings, that he had rode in Triumph before he was capable to ſit in the Senate, and that the People had ſirna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him the Great, and when ſome body was ſaying, <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great was coming, he ſmiled and asked him, Why, how big is he? deſpairing therefore to equal him by Feats of Arms, he betook himſelf to the long Robe, when by doing kindneſſes, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, lending money, by ſtanding by and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for thoſe that ſtood for Offices, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at as great Honour and Power, as <hi>Pompey</hi> had from his many famous Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and this was peculiar to them, <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s name and intereſt in the City was greateſt when he was abſent, for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown in War, but when preſent he was often leſs eſteemed than <hi>Craſſus,</hi> by reaſon of his ſuperciliouſneſs and haughty way of living, ſhunning mean Company, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:35403:252"/>
rarely at the <hi>Forum,</hi> aſſiſting only ſome few, and that not readily, that his Intereſt might be the ſtronger when he came to uſe it for himſelf; whereas <hi>Craſſus</hi> being a Friend always at hand, ready and eaſie of acceſs, and very well experienced in theſe Affairs, with his Freedom and Courteſie got the better of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality. As for the Gracefulneſs of Body, Eloquence of their Diſcourſe, and Dignity of their Perſons, they were equally excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: But however this Emulation never tranſported him ſo far as to quarrel him, or bear him any ill will; for though he was grieved to ſee <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him, yet he never added Baſeneſs to his Jealouſie, though <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when he was taken Captive by the <hi>Corſairs</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, O Craſſus, <hi>how wilt thou rejoice at the News of my Captivity?</hi> Though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they lived friendly together: For when <hi>Caeſar</hi> was going Praetor into <hi>Spain,</hi> and wanting Money, his Creditors fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and ſeized upon his Equipage, <hi>Craſſus</hi> then ſtood by him and relieved him, and was his Bail for 830 Talents; now the City of <hi>Rome</hi> being divided into three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, of <hi>Pompey, Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Craſſus,</hi> (for as for <hi>Cato</hi> his Fame was greater than his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, being rather admired than followed) the ſober and ſubſtantial part were for <hi>Pompey,</hi>
                  <pb n="484" facs="tcp:35403:253"/>
the brisk and hot headed followed <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Ambition, but <hi>Craſſus</hi> trimmed between them, making advantages of both, and cauſed a great alteration in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City, being neither a truſty Friend nor implacable Enemy, and was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily angred or appeaſed according as he found it for his advantage, ſo that in a ſmall time he would aſſert and decry the ſame Laws and the ſame men, but though he was ſo much favoured, he was more feared, ſo that <hi>Sicinius</hi> who was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Teizer of the Magiſtrates, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his time, being ask'd how chanc'd he let <hi>Craſſus</hi> alone? Oh, ſays he, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Hay on his horns, alluded to the cuſtom of tying Hay to the Horns of a Bull that uſed to Butt, that People might avoid him. Now the Inſurrection of the <hi>Gladiators,</hi> and the Deſolation of <hi>Italy,</hi> which many call the <hi>Sparteceian</hi> War, began upon this occaſion: One <hi>Lentulus Batiatus</hi> trained up a great many <hi>Gladiators</hi> in <hi>Capua</hi> (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of which were <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Thracians</hi>) who not for any fault by them committed, but by the injuſtice of their Maſter, were compell'd often to fight one with another. Two hundred of theſe conſulted how to eſcape, but their Plot being diſcovered, they who firſt perceived it for preventions ſake, being ſeventy eight, got out of a
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:35403:253"/>
Cooks ſhop chopping-knives, Spits, &amp;c. and made their way through the City; and lighting by the way on ſeveral Waggons, that were carrying <hi>Gladiators</hi> Arms to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther City, they ſeized upon them and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelves; and ſeizing upon a defenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble place, they choſe three Captains, of which <hi>Spartacus</hi> was chief, a <hi>Thracian</hi> Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, a Man not only of an high Spirit and valiant, but more underſtanding and courteous than could be expected from one of his condition, and more Civiliz'd than the People of that Country uſually are. When he firſt came to be ſold at <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſay a Snake twined about his Face as he lay aſleep and his Wife who alſo accompanied him, his Country-Women, a kind of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs, and inſpired by <hi>Bacchus,</hi> declared that it was a great and terrible ſign, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending great Power to him with an happy event. Firſt then routing thoſe that came out of <hi>Capua</hi> againſt them, and ſeizing upon their Arms, they gladly threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their own as barbarous and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; afterwards <hi>Clodius</hi> the Praetor, was Commanded againſt them with a Party of three thouſand, who beſieged them within a Mountain, which had but one narrow and Difficult paſſage, which <hi>Clodius</hi> kept guarded, encompaſſed with broken and ſlippery precipices, but upon
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:35403:254"/>
the top grew a great many wild Vines; they cut down as many of their boughs, as they had need of and twiſted them into Ladders, that would reach from thence to the Bottom, by which without any danger they got down all but one, who ſtayed there only to throw them down their Arms, and after all he ſaved himſelf. Now the <hi>Romans</hi> were ignorant of all this, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore coming upon their backs, they aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them at unwares, took their Camp, and ſeveral of the Shepherds and Herdſmen that were there, ſtout nimble fellows, revolted over to them; theſe they Armed and made uſe of them for Scouts and light Armed Soldiers. Again <hi>Publius Varinus</hi> is ſent General againſt them, whoſe Lieutenant General <hi>Phrurius,</hi> with two thouſand Men, they fought and routed. Then <hi>Coſſinius</hi> Collegue to <hi>Varinus,</hi> was ſent with conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Forces, him <hi>Spartacus</hi> miſſed but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little of taking, as he was Bathing at <hi>Salenae,</hi> for he with great difficulty made his eſcape, but <hi>Spartacus</hi> poſſeſſed himſelf of his Baggage, and following the chaſe with a great ſlaughter, ſtormed his Camp and took it, where <hi>Coſſinius</hi> himſelf was ſlain; nay after many Skirmiſhes with the Praetor himſelf, and in one taking Priſoners his Lictors and his own Horſe, he began to be great and terrible, wiſely therefore
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:35403:254"/>
conſidering, that he was not to expect to match the Force of the Empire, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Army towards the <hi>Alps,</hi> intending when he had paſſed them that every Man ſhould go to his own home, ſome to <hi>Thrace,</hi> ſome to <hi>Gaul,</hi> &amp;c. but they being grown confident in their numbers, and puffed up with their Succeſs, would give no Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him, but with Excurſions ravaged <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo that now the Senate was not only moved at the Indignity, and Baſeneſs, both of the Enemy, and of the Inſurrection, but looking upon it as of dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, both the Conſuls are ſent to it as to a great and difficult Enterprize, and Conſul <hi>Gellius</hi> falling ſuddenly upon a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Germans,</hi> who through Contempt and Confidence, were ſtragled from <hi>Spartacus,</hi> fell upon them on a ſudden, and cut them all to pieces. But <hi>Lentulus</hi> with a mighty Army beſieging <hi>Spartacus,</hi> he ſallied upon him, and joyning Battel took his chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers Priſoners, and made himſelf Maſter of all his Baggage. As he made toward the <hi>Alps, Caſſius</hi> that was Praetor of that part of <hi>Gaul</hi> that lies about the <hi>Po,</hi> met him with ten thouſand Men, but being overcome in Battel he had much ado to eſcape himſelf, with the loſs of a great many of his Men; when the Senate underſtood this, they were diſpleaſed at the Conſuls, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:35403:255"/>
them to meddle no farther, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Craſſus</hi> General of the War, and a great many of the Nobility went Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers with him, partly out of Friendſhip, and partly to get Honour. He ſtaid in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cena,</hi> expecting <hi>Spartacus</hi> would take a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and come that way, and ſent his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant with two Legions, to wheel about and obſerve the Enemies motion, but upon no account to engage or Skirmiſh; but he upon the firſt opportunity joyned Battel, and was routed, having a great many of his Men ſlain, and a great many ſaving their lives with the loſs of their Arms. <hi>Craſſus</hi> rebuked <hi>Mummius</hi> ſeverely, and Arming the Soldiers again, he made them find Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for their Arms, that they would part with them no more; but for Five hundred that were the Beginners of the flight, he divided them into Fifty tenths, and one of each was to Die by Lot, thus he revived the ancient puniſhment of Decimation, where Ignominy is added to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Death, like the repreſentation of a diſmal and terrible Tragedy, where the reſt ſit as Spectators. When he had thus reclaimed his Men, he led them againſt the Enemy, but <hi>Spartacus</hi> retreated into <hi>Luca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> toward the Sea, and in the ſtraights meeting with ſome <hi>Cilician</hi> Pyrats, he had thought of attempting <hi>Sicily,</hi> whereupon
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:35403:255"/>
Landing Two thouſand Men, he hoped to new-kindle the War of the Slaves, which was but lately extinguiſhed, and ſeemed to need but little fewel; but after the Pyrats had ſtruck a bargain with him, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Earneſt, they deceived him, and ſailed away. He thereupon retired again from the Sea, and pitched his Camp in the Peninſula of <hi>Rhegium;</hi> there <hi>Craſſus</hi> came upon him, and conſidering the nature of the place, and that it ſupplyed him for all that was neceſſary for his undertaking, he deſigned to build a Wall croſs the <hi>Iſthmus;</hi> thus keeping his Soldiers at once from idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his foes from forrage; which great and difficult undertaking he perfected in a ſmall time, beyond all expectation, making a Ditch from one Sea to the other, over a neck of land of Three hundred furlongs long, fifteen foot broad, and as much in depth, and upon it built a wonderful high and ſtrong Wall, which <hi>Spartacus</hi> at firſt ſlighted and deſpiſed, but when Proviſions began to fail, and intending to paſs further, he found he was walled in, and no more was to be had in the Peninſula, taking the opportunity of a ſnowy ſtormy night, he filled up part of the Ditch with earth, and boughs of Trees, and ſo paſſed over the third part of his Army, wherefore <hi>Craſſus</hi> was afraid leſt he ſhould March directly to
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:35403:256"/>
                  <hi>Rome;</hi> but was ſoon eaſed of that fear, when he ſaw many of his men upon a muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny revolt from him, and encamp by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the <hi>Lucanian</hi> Lake. This Lake they ſay is very changeable, ſometimes ſweet, and ſometimes ſo ſalt, that it cannot be drunk. <hi>Craſſus</hi> falling upon theſe beat them from the Lake, though he could not purſue the ſlaughter, by reaſon of <hi>Spartacus</hi> his coming in, who ſtayed the flight. Now he began to repent that he had formerly writ to the Senate, to call <hi>Lucullus</hi> out of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> out of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo that he did all he could to finiſh the War, before they came, knowing that the honour of the Action, would redound to him that came to his aſſiſtance; reſolving therefore firſt to ſet upon thoſe that were revolted, and encamped apart, whom <hi>C. Cunicius</hi> and <hi>Caſtus</hi> Commanded, he ſent ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men before to ſecure a little Eminence, and to do it, as privately as poſſible, which that they might do, they covered their Helmets, but being diſcovered by two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were ſacrificing for the Enemy, they had been in great hazard, had not <hi>Craſſus</hi> immediately appeared, and joined Battel with them, which proved very Bloody, for twelve thouſand three hundred were ſlain, and two only wounded in their backs, the reſt all died ſtanding in their ranks,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:35403:256"/>
and fighting bravely: <hi>Spartacus</hi> after this Diſcomfiture, retired to the Mountains of <hi>Petilia,</hi> but <hi>Quintus</hi> one of <hi>Craſſus</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and <hi>Scropha</hi> the <hi>Queſtor,</hi> purſued, and overtook him, but when <hi>Spartacus</hi> ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied and faced them, they baſely betook themſelves to flight, and had much ado to carry off their <hi>Queſtor</hi> who was wounded; this Succeſs ruined <hi>Spartacus,</hi> becauſe it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Fugitives, who now diſdained any longer to make a flying Fight, not to obey their Officers, but as they were upon their March, they came to them with their Swords in their Hands, and compelled them to lead them back again through <hi>Lucania,</hi> againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to make what haſte they could to find out <hi>Craſſus;</hi> here News is brought that <hi>Pompey</hi> was at hand, and people uſed to talk openly, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this War was reſerved for him, who would come and oblige the Enemy to fight, and certainly rout him. Whereupon <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> deſiring to fight, he encamped very near the Enemy and made Lines of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvallation, but the Slaves made a Sally, and attacqu'd the Pioneers; now as freſh Supplies came in, on either ſide, and <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacus</hi> ſeeing there was no avoiding it, he ſet all his Army in Array, and when his Horſe was brought him, he drew out his Sword, and killed him, ſaying, if he got

the day, he ſhould have a great many better Horſes of the Enemies, and if he loſt it, he ſhould have no need of this; ſo making di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards <hi>Craſſus</hi> himſelf, through Wounds and Darts he miſſed of him, but two Centurions that fell upon him together, he ſlew; at laſt being deſerted by thoſe that were about him, he himſelf ſtood his ground, and being ſurrounded by the Enemy, he bravely defending himſelf was cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But though <hi>Craſſus</hi> made uſe of his Fortune, and not only did the part of a General, but gallantly expoſed his Perſon; yet <hi>Pompey</hi> ſhared in the honour of the Action, for he met with many that fled and ſlew them, ſo that he Wrote to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that <hi>Craſſus</hi> indeed had Vanquiſhed the Fugitives in a pitched Battle, but that he had put an end to the War. <hi>Pompey</hi> was honoured with a magnificent Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph for his Conqueſt over <hi>Sertorius</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> but <hi>Craſſus</hi> himſelf, could not ſo much as deſire a Triumph, and it look'd meanly in him to accept of an Ovation for a Servile War, and paſs through the City on Foot: (as to the Difference between O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Triumph it is writ in the life of <hi>Marcellus:</hi>) And <hi>Pompey</hi> being immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called to the Conſulſhip, tho <hi>Craſſus</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to be joyned with him, he did not ſcruple to requeſt his Aſſiſtance, who very
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:35403:257"/>
readily laid hold on that Opportunity, (for he deſired by all means to lay ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon <hi>Craſſus</hi>) and briskly furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Intereſt; and at laſt he declared in his Speech, that he was not leſs beholden to them for his Collegue, than for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Office. But being entred upon the Employment, this Amity continued not long; but differing almoſt in every thing, claſhing and maligning one another, the time of their Conſulſhip paſſed without any matter of Conſequence, except that <hi>Craſſus</hi> made a great Sacrifice to <hi>Hercules,</hi> and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the People at ten thouſand Tables, and meaſured them out Corn for three Months. Now as their Command was ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and they were making their farewel Speeches, a Roman Knight, one <hi>Ovatius Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius,</hi> a private Country-Gentlemen, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Roſtrum,</hi> and declared a Viſion he had in his Sleep. <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſays he, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to me, and commanded me to tell you, That you ſhould not ſuffer your Conſuls to lay down their Charge before they were made Friends. When he had ſpoke, the People cryed out, that they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. <hi>Pompey</hi> ſtood ſtill and ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but <hi>Craſſus</hi> firſt offering him his hand, I cannot think, ſays he, my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, that I do a mean thing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy my ſelf, if I make the firſt Offers
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:35403:258"/>
of Accommodation and Friendſhip with <hi>Pompey,</hi> whom you your ſelves ſtiled <hi>the Great,</hi> before he was of Mans Eſtate, and decreed him a Triumph before he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſitting in the Senate. This is what was memorable in <hi>Craſſus</hi>'s Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but as for his Cenſorſhip, that was altogether idle and unactive; for he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made a Scrutiny of the Senate, nor took a Review of the Gentry, nor an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the People, though he had as mild a Man as could be deſired for his Colleague, <hi>Lutatius Catulus,</hi> though 'twas reported, that when <hi>Craſſus</hi> intended a violent and unjuſt action, which was the reducing <hi>Egypt</hi> to be tributary to <hi>Rome, Catulus</hi> ſtrongly oppoſed it, and falling out about it, they laid down their Office by conſent. As for that great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of <hi>Catiline,</hi> which was very near ſubverting the Government, <hi>Craſſus</hi> was not without ſome ſuſpicion of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and one man ſwore him in the Plot; but no body credited him, yet <hi>Cicero</hi> in one of his Orations, openly charges both <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> with it, though that Speech was not publiſhed till they were both dead, and in that Speech which he made upon his being elected Conſul, he declares that <hi>Craſſus</hi> came to him by Night and brought a Letter concerning <hi>Catiline</hi> and confirming the Conſpiracy, for which
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:35403:258"/>
                  <hi>Craſſus</hi> hated him ever after, but was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by his Son from doing him any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; for <hi>Publius</hi> was mightily addicted to Learning and Eloquence, and a conſtant follower of <hi>Cicero,</hi> inſomuch that he put himſelf into Mourning for his Baniſhment, and oblig'd all the young Gentlemen to do the ſame; at laſt he reconciled him to his Father. Now <hi>Caeſar</hi> returning from his Command, and deſigning to get the Conſulſhip, and ſeeing that <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> were again at Variance, was unwilling to diſoblige one, by making application to the other, and deſpaired of ſucceſs without the help of one of them; he therefore made it his buſineſs to reconcile them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it appear, that by deſtroying one the other, they advanced the <hi>Cicero</hi>'s, the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuli,</hi> and the <hi>Cato</hi>'s, who would really be of no Account, if they would joyn their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Factions together, and ſo they might manage the Affairs of the Empire as they pleaſed; ſo they being reconciled by his Perſwaſion, they three ſet up an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Power, which utterly ſubverted the Government, both as to Senate and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; not that he made them greater than they were before; but by their means made himſelf greateſt of all; for by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents of both he was gloriouſly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Conſul, which Office when he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:35403:259"/>
with Credit, they decreed him the Command of the Army, and allotted him <hi>Gaul</hi> for his Province, and ſo placed him as in the Cittadel, not doubting but they ſhould divide the reſt at pleaſure, when they had confirmed him in the Command he deſired. <hi>Pompey</hi> was moved hereto by an immoderate deſire of Ruling; but <hi>Craſſus,</hi> adding to his old Diſeaſe of Covetouſneſs, an affectation of Trophies and Triumphs, emulating <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Exploits, not content to be beneath thoſe two, tho above all others, could never reſt content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till it ended in an ingnominious Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and a Publick Calamity. When <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> came out of <hi>Gaul</hi> to <hi>Luca,</hi> a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People went thither to meet him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> and <hi>Craſſus</hi> had various Conferences with him, how to get the whole manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Affairs into their hands, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject every thing to their Power; <hi>Caeſar</hi> to keep up his Army, and <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> to get new ones, and new Provinces, in which there was but one way, the getting the Conſulate a ſecond time, which they were to ſtand for, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> to aſſiſt them by writing to his Friends, and ſending ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Souldiers to vote; but when they returned to <hi>Rome</hi> their Deſign was preſently ſuſpected, and a report was ſpread, that this interview was for no good. When
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:35403:259"/>
                  <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Domitius</hi> asked <hi>Pompey</hi> in the Senate, If he intended to ſtand for the Conſulſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he anſwered, Perhaps he would, perhaps not; and being urged again, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, He would ask it of the Honeſt Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, but not of the Diſhoneſt. Which Anſwer appearing too haughty and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, <hi>Craſſus</hi> anſwered more civilly, He would deſire it, if it might be for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Publick, otherwiſe he would deſiſt; wherefore ſome others were da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring enough to deſire it, amongſt which was <hi>Domitius;</hi> but when ſuch eminent Men appeared for it, the reſt were fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give it over; but <hi>Cato</hi> encouraged <hi>Domitius</hi> to proceed, who was his Friend and Relation, exciting him to perſiſt, as though he was now defending the Publick Liberty, for they did not ſo much aim at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulate, as at Arbitrary Government, and this laſt was not a Petition for an Office, but a ſeizure of the Provinces and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Thus ſpoke <hi>Cato,</hi> and he ſpoke his thoughts only, and almoſt compelled <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius</hi> to appear at the <hi>Forum,</hi> where many ſided with them; for People admired what ſhould make 'um deſire the Conſulſhip again, and why they two together, and not with ſome third Perſon; we have a great many Men not unworthy to be Fellow-Conſuls

with <hi>Pompey</hi> or <hi>Craſſus; Pompey</hi>'s Party being apprehenſive of this, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all Undecencies and Violencies, and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things, lay in wait for <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> as he was coming thither before day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break with other Company; his Torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers they killed, and wounded ſeveral others, of which <hi>Cato</hi> was one: theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beat back and ſhut into a Houſe, mean while the Conſuls are declared; not long after they beſieged <hi>Domitius</hi> his Houſe, thruſt <hi>Cato</hi> out of Doors, killed ſome that made reſiſtance, and Decreed <hi>Caeſar</hi> his Command for Five years longer, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces for themſelves, <hi>Syria,</hi> and both the <hi>Spains,</hi> which being decided by Lots, <hi>Syria</hi> fell to <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and the <hi>Spains</hi> to <hi>Pompey;</hi> they were both well-pleaſed with their Chance, for the People were deſirous that <hi>Pompey</hi> ſhould not go far from the City, and he being extreamly fond of his Wife, was very glad to continue there; but <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> was ſo tranſported with his Fortune, that 'twas manifeſt he never thought he had ſo good luck befel him as now; ſo that he had much ado to contain himſelf before Company and Strangers, but amongſt his Confidents he blurted out many vain and childiſh things, which were unworthy of his Age, and contrary to his Nature, for he
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:35403:260"/>
was not much given to boaſting in all his life beſides; but then being ſtrangely puft up, and his head heated, he would not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his fortune with <hi>Parthia</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> but looking on the Actions of <hi>Lucullus</hi> againſt <hi>Tygranes,</hi> and the Exploits of <hi>Pompey</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Mithridates</hi> but Childs-play, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to himſelf in his hopes to paſs beyond <hi>Bactria</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> and the utmoſt Ocean; not that he was obliged by his Office to undertake a Foreign Expedition, but 'twas well known that <hi>Craſſus</hi> affected it, and <hi>Caeſar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> wrote to him out of <hi>Gaul,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his reſolution, and inciting him to the War; and when <hi>Atteius</hi> the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune of the People deſign'd to ſtop his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for moſt men murmured, that one man ſhould undertake a War againſt a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that had done them no injury, and were at Amity with them, he deſired <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> to ſtand by him and accompany him, for he had a great Authority amongſt the Mobile, and when ſeveral were ready to riſe and exclaim againſt it, <hi>Pompey</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a pleaſing Countenance, and ſo mollified the People, that they let <hi>Craſſus</hi> paſs quietly; but <hi>Atteius</hi> met him, and firſt by word of mouth conjured him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and then commanded his Sergeant to ſeize him and detain him; but the other

Tribunes not permitting it, they releaſed <hi>Craſſus; Atteius</hi> therefore running to the gate, whither, when <hi>Craſſus</hi> was come, he kindled a fire in a Caldron, he offered Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migations and Sacrifices, calling upon and naming ſeveral ſtrange and horrible Deities, and curſed him with moſt dreadfull impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: now the <hi>Romans</hi> conceit there is ſo much Virtue in theſe ſacred and ancient Rites, that no Man can eſcape the effects of them, and that the Conjurer himſelf ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom proſpers; ſo that they are not often made uſe of, and that but upon a great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; ſo that <hi>Atteius</hi> was to be blamed to devote that City to ſuch Calamities, upon whoſe account only he was ſo highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with <hi>Craſſus.

At his firſt coming things went as he would have

them, for he made a Bridge over <hi>Euphrates</hi> without much difficulty, and paſſed over his Army in ſafety, and took in many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> which yielded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up voluntarily; but he loſt a hundred of his Men before one, where <hi>Apollonius</hi> had uſurped; wherefore drawing all his forces down he took it by Storm, plundered the Goods, and ſold the Inhabitants; the <hi>Greeks</hi> call this City <hi>Zenodotia,</hi> upon the taking of which he permitted the Army to ſalute him Imperator, but it looked mean and poor, as if he deſpaired a Nobler Atchievement that was ſo exalted with this little Succeſs; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Garriſons of ſeven thouſand Foot and one thouſand Horſe in the new Conqueſts, he return'd to take up his Winter Quarters in <hi>Syria,</hi> where his Son, a moſt accompliſhed Gentleman, met him coming from <hi>Caeſar</hi> out of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and brought with him 1000 ſelect Horſe; here <hi>Craſſus</hi> ſeemed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his firſt Error, unleſs you will allow the whole Expedition to be one; for whereas he ought to have gone forward and ſeiz'd <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Seleucia,</hi> Cities that were ever at enmity with the <hi>Parthians,</hi> he gave the Enemy time to provide againſt him; beſides he ſpent his time there more like an Uſurer than a General, for he took no account of the Arms, nor Diſcipline of his Soldiers, but in computing the Revenue of the Cities,

and weighing the Treaſure that was in the Temple of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> giving Commiſſions for levying of Soldiers, and diſmiſſing them for Money, whereupon he loſt his credit and became deſpicable; here he met with the firſt ill Omen from this Goddeſs, which ſome call <hi>Venus,</hi> others <hi>Juno,</hi> others Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the Cauſe that produces all things out of Moiſture, and inſtructs us in all good; for as they were going out of the Temple, young <hi>Craſſus</hi> ſtumbled, and his Father fell upon him; when he drew his Army out of Winter quarters, Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors came to him from <hi>Arſaces</hi> with this ſhort Speech; If the Army was ſent by the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> he denounced a mortal War, and would give no quarter; but if (as he underſtood it was) that againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his Country, <hi>Craſſus</hi> for his own ends had invaded his Country, then their King would be more merciful, and taking pity upon <hi>Craſſus</hi> his dotage, would ſend back thoſe Soldiers whom he looked upon rather beſieged, than in a Garriſon. <hi>Craſſus</hi> vainly told them, he would return his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at <hi>Seleucia,</hi> whereat <hi>Vagiſes</hi> the Chief of them ſmiling, ſhew'd the Palm of his Hand, ſaying Hair will grow here before you will ſee <hi>Seleucia;</hi> ſo they returned to their King <hi>Hyrodes,</hi> telling him 'twas War Several of the <hi>Romans</hi> that were in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:35403:262"/>
in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> with great hazard made their eſcape, and told them the danger was worth their Concern; for that they by <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> knew the number of the Enemy, and the manner of their fighting, when they aſſaulted their Towns, (and as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is) they made it ſeem greater than real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was, that by flight it was impoſſible to eſcape them, and as impoſſible to overtake them when they fled, that they had new ſtrange ſort of <hi>Weapons</hi> as ſwift as ſight, that they pierced whatever they met with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you could ſee who threw; their <hi>Kata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phracti,</hi> or Arm'd Men at all points, were ſo provided as that they would beat down any thing, and give way to nothing; which when the Soldiers heard, their hearts failed them; for before they thought there was no difference between the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> or <hi>Cappadocians,</hi> who ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Lucullus</hi> in following and purſuing of them, and were perſwaded that the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the War conſiſted only in the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the March, and the trouble of chaſing thoſe that durſt not come to handy blows, ſo that the danger of a Battel was beyond their expectation; wherefore the Officers adviſed <hi>Craſſus</hi> to proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at preſent, but take new Meaſures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole; eſpecially <hi>Caſſius</hi> the <hi>Queſtor,</hi> and the Southſayers told him privately the
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:35403:263"/>
Omens were unlucky, and that the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices portended diſmal Conſequences; but he gave no heed to them or any body elſe, but thoſe that exhorted him to proceed; nor did <hi>Artabaces</hi> King of <hi>Armenia</hi> confirm him a little, who came to his aid with 6000 Horſe; theſe were ſaid to be only the King's Life-guard, for he promiſed 10000 Curiaſſiers more, and 30000 Foot at his own Charges; he perſwaded <hi>Craſſus</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Parthia</hi> by the way of <hi>Armenia,</hi> for he would not only ſupply his Army with Forage, but his Paſſage would be more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, by reaſon of the roughneſs of the Country, and a continued Chain of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which were almoſt impaſſable to Horſe, in which the main ſtrength of the <hi>Parthians</hi> conſiſted; <hi>Craſſus</hi> returned him but cold thanks for his readineſs to ſerve him, and the Splendour of his Aſſiſtance, and told him he was reſolved to paſs through <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> where he had left a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brave <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers, whereupon the <hi>Armenian</hi> went his way. As <hi>Craſſus</hi> was paſſing his Army by <hi>Zeugma,</hi> many ſtrange and ſupernatural Thunders were heard, and the Lightning flaſhed upon the Army, and during the Storm a Hurricane broke down the Bridge, and carried part of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and two Thunderbolts fell upon the very place where the Army was going to
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:35403:263"/>
Encamp, and one of the General's Horſes famouſly capariſon'd, broke from the Groom, leap'd into the River, and was ſeen no more; and when they went to take up the great Standard, the Eagle turned its head backward, and after he had paſſed over his Army, as they were diſtributing Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they firſt gave Lentils and Salt, which the <hi>Romans</hi> account ominous, being what is ſet before the dead. And as <hi>Craſſus</hi> was haranging his Soldiers, he let fall a Word which ſtruck a great terror in the Army; for, ſaid he, I will break down the Bridge, that none of you may return; and whereas he ought when he had perceived his blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to have corrected himſelf, and explained his meaning to thoſe that were ſo concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, he wou'd not do it out of meer ſtubbornneſs; and when at the laſt general Sacrifice the Prieſt gave him the Entrails, they ſlipt out of his hand, and when he ſaw the ſtanders by concerned at it, he laught and ſaid, See what 'tis to be an old Man, but I'll hold my Sword faſt enough; ſo marching his Army along the River with ſeven Legions, little leſs than 4000 Horſe, and as many light armed Soldiers, the Scouts returning, declaring that not one Man appeared, but that they ſaw the footing of a great many Horſes which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to retire and fly; whereupon <hi>Craſſus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:35403:264"/>
great hopes, and the <hi>Romans</hi> began to deſpiſe the <hi>Parthians,</hi> as men that would not come to handy-ſtrokes; but <hi>Caſſius</hi> and the reſt adviſed him to refreſh his Army in ſome of the Garriſon Towns, and remain there till they could get ſome certain Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Enemy, at leaſt to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Seleucia,</hi> and keep by the River, that ſo they might have the convenience of Ships to bring him Proviſions, which might always accompany the Army, and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would ſecure them from being environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if they ſhould fight it might be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equal terms. As <hi>Craſſus</hi> was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereupon, there came to the Camp an <hi>Arabian</hi> Tribune named <hi>Ariamnes,</hi> a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſubtle Fellow, and one which was the chief cauſe of all the misfortune that befell them; ſome of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s old Soldiers knew him, for he had ſerv'd with them under him, and had received ſome Kindneſſes of him, and was looked upon as a Friend to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but was now ſuborned by the King's Officers, and ſent to <hi>Craſſus</hi> to entice him if poſſible from the River and Hills into the Plain, where he might be ſurrounded, for the <hi>Parthians</hi> deſired any thing rather than to be obliged to meet the <hi>Romans</hi> face to face; he therefore coming to <hi>Craſſus</hi> and he had his Tongue well hung) highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>Pompey</hi> as his Benefactor, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired

the Forces that <hi>Craſſus</hi> had with him, but ſeemed to wonder why he delayed and made Preparations, as if he ſhould not uſe his Feet more than his Arms, againſt thoſe Men that taking with them their beſt Goods and Chattels, had deſigned long ago to fly for refuge to the <hi>Scythians</hi> or <hi>Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> but ſuppoſing they were to fight, at leaſt he ought to make what haſt he could, before the King could recover Courage, and get his Forces together; for you ſee <hi>Surena</hi> and <hi>Syllaces</hi> are oppoſed to you, to hinder your further progreſs, but the King himſelf does not appear; but this was all a Lye for <hi>Hyrodes</hi> had divided his Army into two parts, with one he in Perſon waſted <hi>Armenia,</hi> revenging himſelf upon <hi>Artuaſdes,</hi> and ſent <hi>Surena</hi> againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> not out of Contempt as ſome pretend, for there is no likelihood that he ſhould deſpiſe <hi>Craſſus,</hi> one of the Chiefeſt men of <hi>Rome,</hi> to go and fight with <hi>Artuaſdes,</hi> and invade <hi>Armenia;</hi> but for my part I believe he apprehended the danger, and therefore he expected the Event, and that <hi>Surena</hi> ſhould firſt run the hazard of a Battel and circumvent the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Nor was this <hi>Surena</hi> an ordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but for Wealth, Family, and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the ſecond man in the Kingdom, but for Courage and Proweſs he was the firſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was any one ſo large ſized, or ſo well

ſhaped; whenever he travelled alone he had 1000 Camels to carry his Baggage, 200 Chariots full of <hi>Concubines,</hi> 1000 compleatly Arm'd men for his Life-Guards, and a great many more light Arm'd, and at leaſt 10000 of his Servants and Retinue, and the Honour had long belonged to his Family, that at the King's Coronation he put the <hi>Crown</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Head, and when this very King <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes</hi> had been exiled, he brought him in; 'twas he that took the great City of <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> was the firſt Man that ſcaled the Walls, and with his own hand beat off the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and though at that time he was not above 30 years old, he was counted as wiſe and diſcreet; wherein he had much the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> who was eaſy to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon, firſt through his overweening confidence, and afterwards becauſe he was daſtarded and cow'd by his <hi>Calamities.</hi> When <hi>Ariamnes</hi> had thus work'd upon him, he drew him from the Rivers into vaſt Plains, by a way that at firſt was pleaſant and eaſie, but afterwards very troubleſome by reaſon of the depth of the Sand, not a Tree, not any Water, and no end of this to be ſeen; ſo that they were not only ſpent with thirſt, and the difficulty of the paſſage; but the uncomfortable Proſpect of not a bough, not a ſtream, not a hillock, not a green herb, diſmayed them quite, but an odd
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:35403:265"/>
kind of a Sea of Sand, which encompaſſed the Army with its Waves. Here they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſuſpect ſome Treachery, and at the ſame time came Meſſengers from <hi>Artuaſdes,</hi> that he was engaged in a bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy War with <hi>Hyrodes,</hi> that had invaded his Country, ſo that now 'twas impoſſible for him to ſend him any ſuccours. Wherefore he adviſed <hi>Craſſus</hi> to turn back, and with joynt Forces to give <hi>Hyrodes</hi> Battle, or at leaſt that he ſhould ſo March and Encamp where Horſes could not eaſily come, and keep to the Mountains. <hi>Craſſus</hi> out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Vanity, writ him no Anſwer, but told them, At preſent he was not at leiſure to mind the <hi>Armenians,</hi> but he would call upon them another time, and revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon <hi>Artuaſdes</hi> his Treachery. Here <hi>Caſſius</hi> his Party began again to complain, but when they perceived how much <hi>Craſſus</hi> was diſpleaſed, they gave him over, but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately rail'd at the <hi>Barbarian.</hi> What evil Genius, O thou worſt of Men, brought thee to our Camp, and with what charms and potions haſt thou bewitched <hi>Craſſus,</hi> that he ſhould march his Army through a vaſt and deep Deſart, through ways which are rather fit for a Captain of <hi>Arabian</hi> Robbers, than the General of a <hi>Roman</hi> Army? But the <hi>Barbarian</hi> being a very ſubtle fellow, very ſubmiſſively exhorted
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:35403:266"/>
them, and encouraged them to ſuſtain it a little farther, but ran about the Camp, and under pretence of cheering up the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, asked them in ſcoff, What do you think you march through <hi>Campania,</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every where to find Springs, and Shades, and Baths, and Inns of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſider you now travel the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> Thus he mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them like Children, and before the cheat was diſcovered, he rode away, not but that <hi>Craſſus</hi> was privy to his going, but he had perſwaded him, that he would go and contrive how to diſorder the Affairs of the Enemy; and it was obſerved that <hi>Craſſus</hi> came not abroad that day in his Scarlet Robe, which <hi>Roman</hi> Generals uſe to wear, but in a black one, which, as ſoon as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, he changed. And the Standard-Bearers had much ado to take up their Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, which ſeemed to be fixed to the place; <hi>Craſſus</hi> laught at it, and haſtened their March, and compelled his Infantry to keep pace with his Cavalry, till ſome few of the Scouts returned, and told them that their Fellows were ſlain, and they hardly eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that the Enemy was at hand, reſolved to give them Battel; here all was in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, <hi>Craſſus</hi> was ſtruck into an amaze, and, for haſt, could not put his Army in good order. Firſt therefore, as <hi>Caſſius</hi> adviſed, they
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:35403:266"/>
opened their Ranks and Files, that they might take up as much ſpace as could be, to prevent their being ſurrounded, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the Horſe into the Wings, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards changing his Mind, he drew up his Army in a ſquare, and made a Front every way, each of which conſiſted of Twelve Companies, to everyone of which he alotted a Troop of Horſe, that no part might be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the Aſſiſtance that the Horſe might give, and that they might be ready to aſſiſt every where, as need ſhould require; <hi>Craſſus</hi> Commanded one of the Wings, young <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> t'other, and himſelf was in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; thus they marched on till they came to a little River named <hi>Boliſſus,</hi> a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable one in it ſelf, but very grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Soldiers, who had ſuffered ſo much by Drought and Heat all along their march. Moſt of the Commanders were of the opinion, that they ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there that night, and to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as much as poſſible of the number of the Enemies and their Order, and ſo march againſt them at break of Day, but <hi>Craſſus</hi> was ſo exalted at the eagerneſs of his Son, and the Horſemen that were with him, who deſired and urged him to lead them on, and engage, that he Commanded thoſe that had a mind to it, to eat and drink as they ſtood in their Ranks; and before they
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:35403:267"/>
had all well done, he led them on, not leiſurely and by ſtops, as if he was going to Battel, but kept on his pace as if he had been in haſte, till they ſaw the Enemy, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their expectation, neither ſo many nor ſo magnificently Armed as the <hi>Romans</hi> expected, for <hi>Surena</hi> had hid his main Force behind the firſt ranks and ordered them to hide the glittering of their Armour, with Coats and Skins; but when they approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the General gave the Signal, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately all the field rung with a hidious noiſe, and terrible clamour; for the <hi>Parthians</hi> do not encourage themſelves to War, with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets and Trumpets, but with a kind of Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Drum which makes a dead, and ſolemn noiſe, like the Bellowing of Beaſts, mixt with ſomething like thunder; for they well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that the ſenſe of hearing, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the firſt impreſſions, moſt eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs the Mind, and ſubverts the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. When they had ſufficiently ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the <hi>Romans</hi> with their noiſe, they threw of the covering of their Armour, they ſhone like lightening in their Breſt-plates, and Helmets poliſhed and furbiſhed, and made of <hi>Margianian</hi> Steel, and their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were covered with Braſs and Steel Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings. <hi>Surena</hi> was the talleſt and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeſt Man himſelf. And the Sweetneſs of his Looks, and Effeminacy of his Habit,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:35403:267"/>
could not promiſe ſo much Manhood, as he really was Maſter of; for his Face was Painted, and his Hair parted, after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of the <hi>Medes,</hi> whereas the other <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> look'd more terrible, with their hair ſhaggy, after the <hi>Scythian</hi> Mode. Their firſt deſign was with their Launces to beat down, and force back the firſt Ranks of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> but when they perceived the depth of their Battel, and that the Soldiers kept their ground, they made a retreat, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſeparate and break their Orders, they encompaſſed the <hi>Romans</hi> round, ere they were aware of it; then <hi>Craſſus</hi> Commanded his Light Armed Soldiers to charge in, but they had not gone far, before they were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with ſuch a ſhower of Arrows, that they were glad to retire amongſt the heavy-Armed, which was the firſt occaſion of their diſorder and terror, when they perceived the ſtrength and force of their Darts, which pierced and broke their Arms, Body and all. Now the <hi>Parthians</hi> divided themſelves and began to ſhoot from all ſides, not aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at any particular, for indeed the order of the <hi>Romans</hi> was ſo cloſe, that they could not miſs if they would, and Arrows being forced out of ſtrong bent Bows, the ſtrokes were very violent. Now was the ſtate of the <hi>Romans</hi> deſperate, for if they kept their ranks, they were wounded, and if they charged, though they hurt the Enemy ne'er
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:35403:268"/>
the more, they ſuffer'd ne'er the leſs. For the <hi>Parthians</hi> threw their Darts when they fled, an Art, which none but the <hi>Scythians</hi> are better practis'd in, and 'tis cunningly contriv'd; for while they thus fight to make their eſcape, they avoid the diſhonour of a Flight; however the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſome comfort to think, that when they had ſpent all their Arrows, they would either give over, or come to Handy-ſtrokes; but when they underſtood there were ſeveral Camels loaded with Arrows, and when the firſt Ranks had diſcharged thoſe they had, they wheeled off, and took more; <hi>Craſſus</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no end of it, was out of all heart, but ſent to his Son that he ſhould endeavour to fall in upon them, before he was quite ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded; for the Enemy charged moſtly upon that Quarter, and rode about that they might come behind him; wherefore the young Man taking with him 1300 Horſe (1000 of which he had from <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>) 500 Archers, and Eight Companies of his beſt Armed Soldiers that ſtood next him, he led them up with deſign to charge the <hi>Parthians.</hi> Whether it was that they feared to ſtand an Army in ſo good Array, (as ſome think) or elſe deſigning to entice young <hi>Craſſus,</hi> as far as they could, from his Father, pretended to fly; whereupon he crying out, That they durſt not ſtand, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them, and with him <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabacchus,</hi>
                  <pb n="515" facs="tcp:35403:268"/>
both famous, one for his Courage and Proweſs, the other for being of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Family, and an excellent Orator, both Intimates of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and his Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The Horſe thus puſhing on, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry ſtaid little behind, being exalted with hopes and joy, for they ſuppoſed they had already Conquered, and now were only purſuing, till, when they were gone too far, they perceiv'd the Deceit; for they that ſeemed to fly, now turned again, and a great many freſh ones came on; hereupon they made an Halt, for they doubted not but now the Enemy would Attack them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſo few, but they placed their Curiaſſiers againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and with the reſt of their Horſe, rode about ſcowring the field, and ſtirring up the ſand, they raiſed ſuch a Duſt, that the <hi>Romans</hi> could neither ſee nor ſpeak to one another, and, for want of room, tumbling upon one another, they were ſlain, not by a quick and eaſie Death, but with intolerable pain and convulſions; for, rowling among the Darts, they lingered away of their Wounds, and when they would, by force, pluck out the barbed Arrows, they caught hold of the Nerves and Veins, ſo that they tore and tortured themſelves; many of them Died thus, and thoſe that ſurvived were Diſabled for any ſervice, and when <hi>Publius</hi> exhorted them to charge the Curiaſſiers, they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:35403:269"/>
him their Hands nailed to their Shields, and their Feet ſtuck to the ground, ſo that they could neither fly nor fight; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he charged in briskly with his Horſe, and made a gallant Onſet; but the Fight was very unequal, either as to the offenſive or defenſive part; for the <hi>Romans</hi> with their weak and little Javelins, ſtruck againſt Targets that were of tough raw Hides, or Steel; whereas the naked Bodies of the <hi>Gauls</hi> were expoſed to the ſtrong Spears of the Enemy; for upon theſe he moſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and with them he wrought Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; for they would catch hold of their Spears, and ſeize upon the Enemy, and ſo pull them off from their Horſes, where they could ſcarce ſtir by reaſon of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs of their Armour, and many of them quitting their own Horſes, would creep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe of the Enemy, and ſtick them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Belly; which growing unruly, by reaſon of the pain, trampled upon their Riders, and Enemies promiſcuouſly. The <hi>Gauls</hi> were chiefly tormented by reaſon of the Heat and Drought, being not accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; and moſt of their Horſes were ſlain, by being ſpurred on againſt the Spears, ſo that they were forced to retire among the Foot, bearing off <hi>Publius</hi> grievouſly wounded: Obſerving a ſandy Hillock, not far off, they made to it; tying therefore their Horſes to one another, and placing
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:35403:269"/>
them in the midſt, and joyning all their Shields together, before them, they thought they might make ſome Defence againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> but it fell out quite contrary, for when they were drawn up in a Plain, the Front, in ſome meaſure, ſecured thoſe that were behind, but when they were upon the Hill, one being higher than another, there was no avoiding of it, but all were equally expoſed, bewailing their Inglorious and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Fate. There were with <hi>Publius</hi> two <hi>Greeks,</hi> that lived near there at <hi>Carras, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymus,</hi> and <hi>Nichomachus,</hi> they perſwaded him to retire with them to <hi>Icenas,</hi> a Town not far from thence, and Allie of the <hi>Romans.</hi> No, ſaid he, there is no death ſo terrible, for the fear of which <hi>Publius</hi> would leave his Friends that die upon his Account; but wiſhing them to take care of themſelves, he embraced them and ſent them away, and becauſe he could not uſe his Arm, for he was run through with a Spear, he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Side to his Armour-Bearer, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to run him through; and 'twas ſaid, that <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> fell after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Vegabacchus</hi> ſlew himſelf, as alſo the reſt of beſt note, and the <hi>Parthians</hi> coming upon the reſt with their Lances, killed them fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor were there above 500 taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; cutting off the head of <hi>Publius,</hi> they directly march towards <hi>Craſſus;</hi> and this was the poſture of Affairs, when he had
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:35403:270"/>
commanded his Son to fall upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and word was brought him that they were fled, and perceiving that the Enemy did not preſs upon him ſo hard as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for they were gone to fall upon <hi>Publius,</hi> he began to take heart a little; and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Army into a convenient place, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected when his Son would return from the purſuit of thoſe whom he thought defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as ſoon as he ſaw his danger) the firſt Meſſengers were intercepted by the Enemy, and ſlain, the laſt hardly eſcaping came and declared, That <hi>Publius</hi> was loſt, unleſs he had ſpeedy Succours; <hi>Craſſus</hi> was mightily diſtracted, not knowing what Counſel to take, being fearful for the main Chance, and deſirous to help his Son, at laſt he reſolved to move with his Forces: Juſt upon this, up came the Enemy with their ſhouts and noiſes, now more terrible, with their Drums aſtoniſhing the <hi>Romans,</hi> who now feared a freſh engagement; and they that brought <hi>Publius</hi> his Head upon the point of a Spear, when they were come ſo near that it could be known, ſcoffingly enquired where were his Parents, and what Family he was of, for 'twas impoſſible that ſo brave and gallant a Gentleman, ſhould be the Son of ſo pitiful a Coward as <hi>Craſſus:</hi> This ſight, above all the reſt, diſmayed the <hi>Romans,</hi> for it did not incite them to courage as it ought to have done, but to horror and trembling,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:35403:270"/>
though they ſay, <hi>Craſſus</hi> out-did himſelf in this Calamity, for he paſſed through the ranks, and cried out to them: This, dear Country-men, is my own peculiar Loſs, but the Fortune and the Glory of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſafe and untainted ſo long as you are ſafe, but if any one be concerned for my loſs of the beſt of Sons, let him ſhew it in revenging him upon the Enemy: Take away their joy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their Cruelty, nor be diſmayed at what is paſt; for whoever attempts great matters muſt ſuffer ſomething: Neither did <hi>Lucullus</hi> overthrow <hi>Tigranes</hi> without Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, nor <hi>Scipio Antiochus:</hi> Our Anceſtors have loſt 1000 Ships about <hi>Sicily,</hi> and how many Generals and Captains in <hi>Italy?</hi> None of which notwithſtanding failed to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Conquerors, for the State of <hi>Rome</hi> did not arrive to this height by Fortune, but by perſeverance and virtue. While <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> thus ſpake, exhorting them, he ſaw but few that gave much heed to him, and when he ordered them to ſhout for the Battel, he found the deadneſs of heart of his Army, which made but a faint and weak noiſe, but the ſhout of the Enemy was clear and bold, and when they came to the buſineſs, the Horſemen riding about ſhot their Arrows, and the foremoſt ranks with their Spears drove the <hi>Romans</hi> cloſe together, except thoſe who ruſh'd upon them for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing killed by their Arrows. Neither did
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:35403:271"/>
theſe do much Execution, being quickly diſpatched, for the ſtrong thick Spear made great Wounds, and often run through two Men at once; as they were thus fighting, the Night coming on parted them, the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> boaſting that they would indulge <hi>Craſſus</hi> one Night to mourn his Son, unleſs upon better conſideration he would rather go to <hi>Arſaces,</hi> than be carried to him; and therefore took up their Quarters near them, being fluſh'd with their Victory: But the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had a ſad Night of it, for neither taking care for the Burial of their dead, nor the Cure of the Wounds, nor the Groans of the expiring, every one bewailed his own Fate: For there was no means of eſcaping. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould ſtay for the Light, or venture to retreat into the vaſt Deſart in the Dark, and now the Wounded Men gave them new trouble, for to take them with them would retard their flight, and if they ſhould leave them, they might ſerve as Guides to the Enemy by their Crys, but however they were deſirous to ſee and hear <hi>Craſſus,</hi> though they were ſenſible he was the cauſe of all their Miſchief; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired and hid himſelf, where he lay as an Example of Fortune to the Vulgar, but to the Wiſe an Example of Inconſiderateneſs and Ambition: Who, not content to be Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to ſo many Millions of Men, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inferiour to two, eſteemed himſelf as the
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:35403:271"/>
loweſt of all. Then came <hi>Octavius</hi> his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General, and <hi>Caſſius</hi> to comfort him, but he being altogether ſtruck ſenſleſs, they called together the Centurions, and Officers, and agreeing that the beſt way was to fly, they ordered the Army to march without ſound of Trumpet, and at firſt with ſilence; but when the diſabled Men found they were left behind, a ſtrange Confuſion and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, with an Outcry and Lamentation ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the Camp, and a trembling and dread fell upon them, as if the Enemy were at their heels; by which means now and then turning back, now and then ſtanding to their order, ſometimes taking up the Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that followed, ſometimes laying of them down, they waſted the time, (except 300 Horſe) whom <hi>Ignatius</hi> brought ſafe to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae</hi> about midnight; where calling to the Watch, aſſoon as they heard him, he bid them tell <hi>Coponius</hi> the Governour, that <hi>Craſſus</hi> had fought a very great Battel with the <hi>Parthians;</hi> having ſaid but this, and not ſo much as telling his Name, he rid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at ſpeed to <hi>Zeugma:</hi> 'Tis true, by this means he ſaved himſelf and his Men, but he loſt his Reputation by deſerting his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; but however his Meſſage to <hi>Coponius</hi> was for the advantage of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> for ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting by this haſty and confuſed delivery of himſelf, that all was not well, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ordered the Garriſon to be in Arms,
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:35403:272"/>
and aſſoon as he underſtood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Craſſus</hi> was upon the way towards him, he went out to meet him, and received him with his Army into the Town; but the <hi>Parthians,</hi> although they perceived their diſlodgment in the Night, yet did not purſue them, but as ſoon as it was day, they came upon thoſe that were left in the Camp, and put no leſs than 4000 of them to the Sword, and with their light Horſe pick'd up a great many ſtraglers; <hi>Vargontinus</hi> the Legate broke off from the main Body with about three Cohorts, which ſtrayed out of the way, the <hi>Parthians</hi> encompaſſing theſe in an eminence, ſlew every Man of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting twenty, who with their drawn Swords forced their way through the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt, and they admiring their Courage, opened their Ranks to the right and left, and let them paſs without any further mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation, to <hi>Carrae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after a falſe report was brought to <hi>Syrena,</hi> that <hi>Craſſus</hi> with his principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers had eſcap'd, and that thoſe who were got into <hi>Carrae,</hi> were but a confuſed Rout of inſignificant People not worth further purſuit. Suppoſing therefore that he had loſt the very Crown and Glory of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and yet being uncertain whether it were ſo or not, and therefore not able to reſolve, whether he ſhould beſiege <hi>Carrae</hi> or follow <hi>Craſſus,</hi> he ſent one of his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:35403:272"/>
to the Walls, commanding him in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> to call <hi>Craſſus</hi> or <hi>Caſſius;</hi> for that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Syrena</hi> had a mind to threat with him; as ſoon as <hi>Craſſus</hi> heard this he embrac'd the Propoſal, and ſoon after came up a Band of <hi>Arabians,</hi> who very well knew the faces of <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> as having been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp before the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. They having eſpied <hi>Caſſius</hi> from the Wall, told him that <hi>Syrena</hi> deſired a Peace, and would give them ſafe Convoy, if they would make a League with the King his Maſter, and withdraw all their Garriſons out of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and this he thought moſt adviſable for them both, before things came to extremity. <hi>Caſſius</hi> greedily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the Propoſal, deſired that a time and place might be appointed, where <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and <hi>Syrena</hi> might have an interview. The <hi>Arabians</hi> having charged themſelves with the Meſſage, went back to <hi>Syrena,</hi> who was not a little rejoiced, that <hi>Craſſus</hi> would ſtand a Siege; next day therefore he came up with his Army, inſulting over the <hi>Romans,</hi> and haughtily demanding of them <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> bound, if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected any mercy; the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſeeing themſelves deluded and mock'd, were much troubled at it, and adviſing <hi>Craſſus</hi> to lay aſide his long and empty Hopes of aid from the <hi>Armenians,</hi> reſolved to fly for it; and this Deſign ought to have been kept

private, till they were upon their way, but <hi>Craſſus</hi> could not conceal it from the Villain <hi>Andromachus,</hi> nay he was ſo infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, as to chuſe him for his Guide. The <hi>Parthians</hi> then to be ſure had punctual intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of all that paſſed; but it being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to them by the Laws of their Country, and no leſs difficult to fight by Night, <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> choſe that time to ſet out in, and the truſty <hi>Andromachus,</hi> leſt he ſhould get the ſtart too far of his Purſuers, led him into Moraſſes, and places full of Ditches and Incloſures, ſo that it was exceeding pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and vexatious to his Company, and ſome there were who ſuppoſing by theſe Windings and Turnings of <hi>Andromachus,</hi> that no good was intended, reſolved to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him no further; and at laſt <hi>Caſſius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf returned to <hi>Carrae,</hi> and his Guides the <hi>Arabians</hi> adviſing him to tarry there till the Moon was got out of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> he told them, that he was moſt afraid of <hi>Sagittarius;</hi> and they with 500 Horſe left, him and went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> Others there were, who having got honeſt Guides, took their way by the Mountains, and got into places of ſecurity by day-break; theſe were 5000, under the Command of <hi>Octavius,</hi> a very gallant Man; but <hi>Craſſus</hi> fared worſe, for <hi>Andromachus</hi> had ſo intangled him in the Fens and rough Ways, that before he could get clear of them, the <hi>Parthians</hi> were at his Heels.
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:35403:273"/>
There were with him four Cohorts of Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary Soldiers, a very few Horſemen, with whom having with great difficulty got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way, and not being above a Mile and half from <hi>Octavius,</hi> inſtead of going to joyn him, he retreated unto another Hill, neither ſo defenſible nor unpaſſable for the Horſe, but yet lying under the Hills of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naca,</hi> and continued in a long Ridge through the Plains, <hi>Octavius</hi> could ſee in what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the General was; and himſelf, at firſt but ſlenderly followed, came in to the reſcue. Soon after the reſt upbraiding one another with Baſeneſs, in forſaking their Officers, marched down, and falling upon the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> drove them from the Hill, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing <hi>Craſſus</hi> about, and fencing him with their Shields, they declared that their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſhould never lie expoſed to a <hi>Parthian</hi> Arrow, ſo long as there was a Man of them left alive; <hi>Syrena</hi> therefore perceiving his Soldiers grew faint in their Attaque, and knowing that if the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould ſpin out the Battel till Night, they might then gain the Mountains, and be out of his reach, he betook himſelf to his uſual Craft; for ſome of the Priſoners were ſet free, who had heard a contrived diſcourſe in the Camp, that the King did not deſign a War to be purſued with the utmoſt extremity againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> but rather by his gentle Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> to make a ſtep towards

Reconciliation of the two Empires; and the <hi>Barbarians</hi> deſiſted from fighting, <hi>Syrena</hi> himſelf going gently to the Hill, unbent his Bow, and held out his Hand, inviting <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> to an Agreement, and withal aſſured him, that it was beſides the Kings intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they had thus far ſhewn their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Force; that now he deſired no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contention but that of Kindneſs and Friendſhip, by making a firm Alliance, and permitting them to go away in fafety: Theſe Words of <hi>Syrena</hi> ſome received joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and accepted the Offer; but <hi>Craſſus,</hi> who had had ſufficient experience of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs, and not being able to aſſign any Reaſon of the ſudden Change, would give no ear to them, and only took time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider; but the Soldiers cried out and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to treat, afterwards upbraided and affronted him, ſaying, <hi>That it was very unreaſonable that he ſhould bring them to fight with ſuch Men Armed, whom himſelf without their Arms durſt not look in the Face.</hi> He tried firſt to prevail with them by Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and told them, <hi>That if they would have patience till Evening, they might get into the Mountains and Paſſes, unacceſſible for Horſe, and ſo be out of danger of the</hi> Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Darts;</hi> and withal he pointed out the Way with his Hand, entreating them <hi>not to neglect their Preſervation, which preſented it ſelf to them.</hi> But when they mutinied, and

claſh'd their Targets in a threatning man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he was overpower'd and forced to go, and turning about at parting, ſaid, <hi>You,</hi> Octavius <hi>and</hi> Petronius, <hi>and the reſt of the Commanders which are preſent, you ſee the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of going, which I lie under, and ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ſenſible of the Indignities and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which is offered to my Perſon; however out of tenderneſs to the Honour of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, <hi>declare to all the World, that</hi> Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <hi>periſh'd rather by the ſubtilty of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, than by the Treaſon and Perfidiouſneſs of his Friends and Country-men.</hi> But <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> would not ſtay there, but with <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> went down from the Hill; as for the <hi>Lictors, Craſſus</hi> bid them be gone.

him upon the Spur, and greeting him, ſays he, <hi>This is a moſt undecent Spectacle, a</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Emperor on Foot, whilſt I and my Train are on Horſe-back:</hi> But <hi>Craſſus,</hi> replyed, That there was no error committed on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, for they both met according to the cuſtom of their own Country, <hi>Syrena</hi> told him that from that time there was a League betwixt the King his Maſter and the <hi>Romans,</hi> but that <hi>Craſſus</hi> muſt go with him to the River to ſign it, for you <hi>Romans</hi> (ſays he) are ſomething forgetful of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles and Agreements, and therefore need ſome remarkable ſign to keep it in your Memory, and withal reacht out his Hand to him. <hi>Craſſus</hi> therefore gave order that one of his Padds ſhould be brought, <hi>Syrena</hi> told him there was no need he ſhould put himſelf to that trouble, for the King his Maſter preſents him with one; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, a Horſe with a Golden Bit, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich Trappings, was brought up to him, and himſelf was forcibly put into the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and his Gentlemen ſwitched the Horſe to make the more haſt; but <hi>Octavius</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up got hold of the Bridle, and ſoon after one of the Colonels with <hi>Petronius</hi> and the reſt of the Company came in ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to ſtop the Horſe, and pulling back thoſe who on both ſides of him forced <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> forward. Thus from pulling and thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting one another, they came to a Tumult,
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:35403:275"/>
and ſoon after to blows. <hi>Octavius</hi> drawing his Sword killed a Groom of one of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and one of them getting behind <hi>Octavius</hi> killed him, <hi>Petronius</hi> was not Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but being ſtruck on the Breaſt, he fell down from his Horſe, though without hurt; one <hi>Pomaxaithres</hi> killed <hi>Craſſus,</hi> others ſay it was another, and that this man only cut off his Head and right Hand; for as for thoſe that were by, they had not leiſure to obſerve Particulars, being either killed fighting about <hi>Craſſus,</hi> or uſing their heels to get to their Comrades on the Hill. But the <hi>Parthians</hi> coming upon them, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Craſſus</hi> had the puniſhment he juſtly deſerved, <hi>Syrena</hi> bid the reſt to come down from the Hill without fear; ſome of them came down and ſurrendred themſelves, others were ſcattered up and down in the Night, (a very few of which got ſafe home) and others the <hi>Arabians,</hi> beating the field, hunted and put to Death. It is generally ſaid, that in all 20000 Men were ſlain, and 10000 taken Priſoners, but <hi>Syrena</hi> ſent the Head and Hand of <hi>Craſſus</hi> to <hi>Hyrodes</hi> the King, into <hi>Armenia;</hi> but himſelf by his Meſſengers ſcatering a Report, That he was bringing <hi>Craſſus</hi> alive to <hi>Seleucia,</hi> made a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Proceſſion, which by way of ſcorn he call'd a Triumph.

Whilſt theſe things were doing, <hi>Hyrodes</hi> had ſtruck up a Peace with the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and made a match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Son and the King of <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a</hi>'s Daughter, their Feaſtings and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments were very Sumptuous, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſome <hi>Grecian</hi> Compoſitions, ſuitable to the Occaſion, were recited amongſt them, for <hi>Hyrodes</hi> was not altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language, but <hi>Artua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades</hi> was ſo expert in it, as that he wrote Tragedies and Orations, and Hiſtories, ſome of which are ſtill extant. When the head of <hi>Craſſus</hi> was brought to the Door, the Table was juſt taken away, and one <hi>Jaſon</hi> an Actor of Tragedies ſung the Scene in the <hi>Bacchoe</hi> of <hi>Eurypides</hi> concerning <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave,</hi> he having gotten a great deal of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. <hi>Sillaces</hi> comming into the Room, and having <hi>ador'd</hi> the King, threw down the head of <hi>Craſſus</hi> into the midſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, the <hi>Parthians</hi> taking it up with Joy, and Acclamations, <hi>Sillaces</hi> by the King's order was made to ſit down, but <hi>Jaſon</hi> laid aſide the Perſon of <hi>Pentheus,</hi> and taking up the head

of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and acting one inſpired by <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> he, in a rapturous and Enthuſiaſtical manner, pronounced theſe words.</p>
               <p>A. G. <hi>We'he hunted down a mighty ſtag to day. And from the Mountains bring a Noble prey.</hi> Cho. <hi>What happy hand the fatal Monſter ſlew?</hi> A. G. <hi>I claim that honour to my Courage due.</hi>

               <p>And this humour took wonderfully, but in the recital of thoſe Verſes, who ſlew him, &amp;<hi>c. Pomaxaithres</hi> who happened to be at Supper, ſtarted up and would have got the head into his own hands, for it is my due, ſays he, and no Mans elſe. The King was hugely pleaſed at this ſcuffle, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> gave large rewards to them, and to <hi>Jaſon</hi> the Actor he gave a Talent. Thus <hi>truly Tragical</hi> was the end of <hi>Craſſus</hi>'s Expedition, but yet the divine Juſtice, failed not to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh both <hi>Hyrodes</hi> for his Cruelty, and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena</hi>'s Perjury; for <hi>Syrena</hi> not long after was put to death by <hi>Hyrodes,</hi> out of meer envy to his Glory; and <hi>Hyrodes</hi> himſelf having loſt his Son <hi>Paccoras</hi> (who was ſlain in a fight with the <hi>Romans</hi>) falling into a Diſeaſe which turned to a Dropſie, had Aconite given him by his ſecond Son <hi>Phraates:</hi> the Poyſon working only upon the Diſeaſe, and carrying away the Dropſical matter with it, the King began to recover on the ſudden, ſo that <hi>Phraates</hi> at length was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take the ſhorteſt courſe and ſtifled him with his Pillow.</p>

frankly acknowledged to the People; for when he was accuſed for buying off an Evidence, he ſaid that he was very much pleaſed, that having adminiſtred their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs for ſo long a time, he was at laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed rather for giving than receiving. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Nicias</hi> in his Expences was of a more Publick Spirit than <hi>Craſſus,</hi> priding himſelf much in the Dedication of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, endowing of Schools, and adorning Proceſſions; but the Expences of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Feaſting ſo many <hi>Myriads</hi> of People, was much greater than the whole Eſtate of <hi>Nicias,</hi> together with what he ſpend upon good accounts; ſo that here we may ſee confirmed that old Obſervation, <hi>That Vice is an unequal thing, and unſupportable to it ſelf:</hi> For what theſe two great Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famouſly got, they expended very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. And let ſo much be ſaid of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. As for their Management of Publick Affairs, I ſee not that any Craft, or Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or Arbitrary Action can be objected to <hi>Nicias;</hi> but <hi>Craſſus</hi> is generally blamed for his changeableneſs in his Friendſhips and Enmities, for his Unfaithfulneſs, and his Ungentleman-like Proceedings; for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could not deny, that to compaſs the Conſulſhip, he hired men to lay violent Hands upon <hi>Domitius</hi> and <hi>Cato.</hi> Then at the Meeting for the diſpoſing of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſulſhips, many were wounded, and four
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:35403:278"/>

And this puts me in mind of a Paſſage, which I had forget in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Life, That he ſtruck with his Fiſt one <hi>Lucius Analius</hi> a Senator, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting of him, and drove him out of the Court bleeding.

His deſire of Peace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and to finiſh that tedious War, was
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:35403:279"/>
a Divine and truly <hi>Grecian</hi> Deſign; nor does <hi>Craſſus</hi> deſerve to be compared to him on this account, although he had enlarged the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire from the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Sea to the <hi>Indian</hi> Ocean. However in a State where there is ſome ſenſe of Vertue left, a powerful Man ought not to give way to the ill-affected, or expoſe the Government to thoſe that are uncapable of it, nor ſuffer high Truſts to be committed to thoſe who want common Honeſty. This did <hi>Nicias,</hi> who by his Connivence raiſed <hi>Cleon,</hi> a Fellow remarkable for nothing but his loud Voice and brazen Face, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of an Army. Indeed I do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>Craſſus,</hi> who in the War with <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacus</hi> was more forward to fight than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a diſcreet General, though he was put upon it by a point of Honour, leſt that <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> by his coming ſhould rob him of the Glory of the Action, as <hi>Mammius</hi> did <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi> at the taking of <hi>Corinth;</hi> but <hi>Nicias</hi>'s Proceedings are inexcuſable; for he did not yield up an Opportunity of getting Honour and Advantage to his Competitor, but think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Expedition would be very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous, reſolved to take care of one; and left the Common wealth to ſhift for it ſelf; and when as <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> leſt that a mean and pitiful Fellow ſhould ruine the State by his Conduct in the <hi>Perſian</hi> War, bought him off from his Command, and <hi>Cato</hi> in a moſt
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:35403:279"/>
perplex'd and critical Conjuncture, ſtood for the Tribuneſhip, for the ſake of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Nicias</hi> that reſerved himſelf for trifling Expeditions, ſuch as for <hi>Minoas, Cythera,</hi> and the miſerable <hi>Meleans,</hi> if there be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to come to blows with the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> ſneaks out of his Generalſhip, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays to the Unskillfulneſs and Raſhneſs of <hi>Cleon,</hi> the Fleet, the Sea-men, and his whole Country together, with an Army that needed and deſerved a moſt skilful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. I ſay, ſuch a man is not to be thought ſo much careleſs of his own Fame, as of the Intereſt and Preſervation of his Country. By this means it came to paſs he was in a ſort preſt for the <hi>Sicilian</hi> War, men generally believing that he was back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in it, not ſo much for the Difficulty of the Enterprize, as out of his immoderate Love of his Privacy and Eaſe: But yet this is a great ſign of his Integrity, that though he was always averſe from War, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to command, yet they always pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him as the beſt experienced and ableſt General they had: On the other ſide, <hi>Craſſus</hi> could never have attained to it, unleſs by meer Neceſſity in the <hi>Servile</hi> War, <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> and <hi>Metellus</hi> and the two <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent, although at that time he was at his higheſt pitch of Intereſt and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>with him, as to take him into his Service. But they ſeem to ſpeak more probably, who tell us, That <hi>Philip</hi> advanc'd <hi>Eumenes</hi> for the Friendſhip he bore to his Father, whoſe Gueſt he had ſometime been. After the Death of <hi>Philip,</hi> he continued in the Service of <hi>Alexander,</hi> with the Title of his Principal Secretary, but in as great favour as the moſt intimate of his Familiars, being eſteemed as wiſe, and faithful as any Perſon about Court: So that he went General in the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition againſt <hi>India,</hi> and ſucceeded in the command of <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> when <hi>Perdiccas</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to that of <hi>Hephaeſtion</hi> then newly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed. Wherefore after the Death of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> when <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> who had been Captain of his Life-guard, ſaid, That himſelf had followed <hi>Alexander</hi> with Shield and Spear, but <hi>Eumenes</hi> only with Pen and Paper, the <hi>Macedonians</hi> laught at him, as knowing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well that beſides other particular marks of Favour, the King had done him the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to make him a kind of Kinſman to himſelf by Marriage. For <hi>Alexander</hi>'s firſt Miſtreſs in <hi>Aſia,</hi> by whom he had his Son <hi>Hercules,</hi> was <hi>Barſine</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabazus:</hi> Now, in the famous diſtribution of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Ladies amongſt his Captains, <hi>Alexander</hi> gave her Siſter <hi>Apame</hi> to <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> but <hi>Barſine</hi> to <hi>Eumenes.</hi> Notwithſtanding he frequently incurred <hi>Alexander</hi>'s diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, particularly once upon the Score of
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:35403:282"/>
                  <hi>Hephaeſtion:</hi> For the Quarrels that had been taken up for <hi>Eumenes, Hephaeſtion</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to <hi>Euijus</hi> a Muſician. Whereat <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> in a rage, and <hi>Mentor</hi> came to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and aloud upbraided him, and told him, That the way to be regarded was to throw away their Arms, and turn Fidlers, or Tragedians, inſomuch that <hi>Alexander</hi> took their part and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chid <hi>Hephaeſtion.</hi> But ſoon after changed his mind, and was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with <hi>Eumenes,</hi> and accounted the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he had taken, to be rather intended as an Affront to the King, than a Reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Hephaeſtion.</hi> Afterwards when <hi>Nearchus</hi> with a Fleet was to be ſent into the Gulph of <hi>Perſia, Alexander</hi> borrowed money of his Friends (his own Treaſury being exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted) and would have had 300 Talents of <hi>Eumenes;</hi> but he ſent a hundred only, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that 'twas not without great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty he had raiſed ſo much. <hi>Alexander</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther complained, nor took the money; but gave private order to ſet <hi>Eumenes</hi> his Tent on fire, deſigning to take him in a manifeſt Lye, when his money was carried out; but before that could be done, the Tent was conſumed, and <hi>Alexander</hi> repented of his Orders, all his Papers being burnt. Now the Gold and Silver which was melted down in the fire, being afterwards digged up, was found to be more than a Thouſand Talents, yet <hi>Alexander</hi> took none of it, and only
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:35403:282"/>
writ to the ſeveral Princes to ſend new Copies of the Papers that were burnt, and ordered them to be delivered to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another difference happen'd between him and <hi>Hephaeſtion</hi> concerning a Gift, and a great deal of ill Language paſſed between them, yet <hi>Eumenes</hi> ſtill continued in favour. But <hi>Hephaeſtion</hi> dying ſoon after, the King took it very much to heart, and preſuming, all thoſe that differed with <hi>Hephaeſtion</hi> in his life-time, did now rejoyce at his death, uſed great ſtrangeneſs, and ſeverity towards them, eſpecially towards <hi>Eumenes,</hi> whom he often twitted with his Quarrels, and ill-Language to <hi>Hephaeſtion.</hi> But he being a wiſe and dextrous Courtier, made advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of what had done him prejudice, and ſtruck in with the King's humour of honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Friends memory, ſuggeſting divers inventions to do him honour, and contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting very largely and readily towards erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a ſtately Monument. After <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s Death, a diſpute hap'ning between his own <hi>Phalanx,</hi> and his more intimate Friends; <hi>Eumenes,</hi> though in his Judgment he incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the latter, yet in his Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtood neuter, as if he thought it unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming him who was a ſtranger, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the private Quarrels of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> And when the reſt of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:35403:283"/>
Friends left <hi>Babylon,</hi> he ſtayed behind, and, in great meaſure pacified the Foot, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them towards an accommodation. When the Officers had agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and quelled the Mutiny of the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they ſhared the ſeveral Commands and Signiories, and made <hi>Eumenes</hi> Governour of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> and all the Coaſt upon the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea, as far as <hi>Trapezond,</hi> which at that time was not ſubject to the <hi>Macedonians</hi> (for <hi>Ariarathes</hi> kept it as King) but <hi>Leonnatus</hi> and <hi>Antigonas,</hi> with a great Army, were to put him in poſſeſſion of it. <hi>Antigonus</hi> (being now grown haughty, and deſpiſing all Men) took no notice of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diccas</hi>'s Letters; <hi>Leonnatus</hi> with his Army came down into <hi>Phrygia</hi> to the Service of <hi>Eumenes;</hi> but being viſited by <hi>Hecataeus,</hi> the Tyrant of the <hi>Cardians,</hi> and requeſted rather to relieve <hi>Antipater</hi> and the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> that were beſieged in <hi>Lamia;</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon that Expedition, inviting <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> to a ſhare in it, and endeavouring to reconcile him to <hi>Hecataeus.</hi> For there was an hereditary feud between them upon ſome Politick Account, and <hi>Eumenes</hi> had often declared openly, that <hi>Hecataeus</hi> was a Tyrant, and had exhorted <hi>Alexander</hi> to reſtore the <hi>Cardians</hi> their Liberty. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at this time alſo he declined the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition propoſed, pretending that he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:35403:283"/>
leaſt <hi>Antipater,</hi> who already hated him, ſhould, for that reaſon, and to gratifie <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cataeus,</hi> kill him. <hi>Leonnatus</hi> ſo far believed, as to impart to <hi>Eumenes</hi> his whole Deſign, which, as he pretended, and gave out, was to aid <hi>Antipater,</hi> but, in truth, was to ſeize the Kingdom of <hi>Macedon;</hi> and he ſhewed him Letters from <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> wherein ſhe ſeemed to invite him to <hi>Pella,</hi> with a deſign to Marry him. But <hi>Eumenes,</hi> whether fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Antipater,</hi> or looking upon <hi>Leonnatus</hi> as a fond, raſh, unconſtant, and therefore loſt Man, ſtole away from him by Night, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with him all his Men (which were Three hundred Horſe, and Two hundred of his own Servants armed,) and all his Gold, which was to the value of Five thouſand Talents of Silver, and fled to <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to him <hi>Leonnatus</hi>'s Deſign, and thereby gained great intereſt in him, and was made of his Council. Soon after <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diccas,</hi> with a great Army, which he led himſelf, conducted <hi>Eumenes</hi> into <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> and having taken <hi>Ariarathes</hi> Priſoner, and ſubdued the whole Countrey, declared him Governour of it. Who diſpoſed of the Chief Cities to his own Friends, and made Captains of Garriſons, Judges, Receivers, and other Officers of ſuch as he thought fit himſelf, <hi>Perdiccas</hi> not at all interpoſing. Notwithſtanding <hi>Eumenes</hi> ſtill waited
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:35403:284"/>
on <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> both out of reſpect to him, and a deſire not to be abſent from Court. But <hi>Perdiccas</hi> (believing he was able enough alone to ſecure his March for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but the Countrey he left behind him might ſtand in need of an active and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Governour) when he came into <hi>Cilicia</hi> diſmiſs'd <hi>Eumenes,</hi> under colour of ſending him to his Command, but, in truth, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Armenia,</hi> which was Frontier to it, and unſettled through the Practices of <hi>Neopto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemus.</hi> Him, though a proud and vain Man, <hi>Eumenes</hi> endeavoured to gain by Civility; but to balance the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Foot, whom he found both inſolent, and very ſtout, he contrived to raiſe an Army of Horſe, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from Tax and Contribution all thoſe of the Countrey that were able to ſerve on Horſeback, and buying up great ſtore of Horſes, which he gave among ſuch of his own Men, as he moſt confided in. Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Courage of his Souldiers, by many Gifts and Honours, and inuring their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to ſervice, by often Marching and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing; ſo that the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> ſome of them, were aſtoniſht, others overjoyed to ſee, that in ſo ſhort a time he had got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether no leſs than 6300 able Horſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="545" facs="tcp:35403:284"/>Now when <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Antipater,</hi> having ſubdued <hi>Greece,</hi> were advanced into <hi>Aſia,</hi> with intention to quell the power of <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> and were reported to deſign an impreſſion upon <hi>Cappadocia; Perdiccas</hi> being himſelf to march againſt <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> made <hi>Eumenes</hi> Commander in chief of all the Forces of <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and to that purpoſe wrote Letters, requiring <hi>Alcetas</hi> and <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> to be obedient to <hi>Eumenes,</hi> and giving full Commiſſion to <hi>Eumenes,</hi> to diſpoſe and order all things as he thought fit. <hi>Alcetas</hi> flatly refuſed to ſerve, becauſe his <hi>Macedonians</hi> (he ſaid) were aſhamed to fight againſt <hi>Antipater,</hi> and loved <hi>Craterus</hi> ſo well, they were ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him for their Commander. <hi>Neopto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemus</hi> deſigned Treachery againſt <hi>Eumenes,</hi> but was diſcovered; but being ſummoned, refuſed to obey, and put himſelf in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of defence. Here <hi>Eumenes</hi> firſt found the benefit of his own foreſight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance; for his Foot being beaten, he routed <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> with his Horſe, and took all his Carriage; and purſuing cloſe upon the Phalanx which he had broken, and diſordered, obliged the Men to lay down their Arms, and take an Oath to ſerve under him. <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> with ſome
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:35403:285"/>
few ſtraglers which he rallied, fled to <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Antipater.</hi> From them came an Embaſſy to <hi>Eumenes,</hi> inviting him over to their ſide, whereby he ſhould have the advantage of being ſecured in the Government he was poſſeſt of, and being put into further Command by them of obliging his Enemy <hi>Antipater</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Friend, and keeping <hi>Craterus</hi> his Friend from turning to be his Enemy. To which <hi>Eumenes</hi> replied, That he could not ſo ſuddenly be reconciled to his old Enemy <hi>Antipater,</hi> eſpecially ſince he ſaw him uſe his Friends like Enemies; but was ready to reconcile <hi>Craterus</hi> to <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> upon any juſt and equitable terms; but if his deſires ſhould prove unreaſonable, he was reſolved to aſſiſt the injured to his laſt breath, and would rather loſe his Life than betray his word. <hi>Antipater</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Anſwer, took time to conſider upon the whole matter; when <hi>Neoptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> after his defeat arrived, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them with the ill ſucceſs of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, and requeſted both of them to aſſiſt him; but eſpecially <hi>Craterus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Macedonians</hi> loved him ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, that if they ſaw but his hat, or heard his voice, they would all Arm and follow him. And in truth <hi>Craterus</hi> had
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:35403:285"/>
a mighty name among them, and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers after <hi>Alexander</hi>'s death were extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fond of him, remembring how he had often for their ſakes incurred <hi>Alexander</hi>'s diſpleaſure, reſtrained him from following the <hi>Perſian</hi> Faſhions, to which he very much inclined, and keeping up the Cuſtoms of his Country, when through Pride and Delicacy they began to be diſregarded. <hi>Craterus</hi> therefore ſent <hi>Antipater</hi> into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and himſelf and <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> Marcht with a great Army againſt <hi>Eumenes;</hi> expecting to come upon him unawares, and to find his Army diſordered with revelling after the late Victory. Now that <hi>Eumenes</hi> ſhould ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect his coming, and be prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, is an Argument of his Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, but no great one of his Sagacity: But that he ſhould contrive both to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal from his Enemies, the ill Poſture he was in, and from his own Men, whom they were to fight with, ſo, as to ſerve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Craterus</hi> himſelf, not knowing he commanded the Enemy, this indeed ſeems to ſhew the peculiar Addreſs and Talent of a great General. He gave out therefore that <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> and <hi>Pigris,</hi> with ſome <hi>Cappadocian</hi> and <hi>Paphlagonian</hi> Horſe, and deſigning to March by night, he fell into
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:35403:286"/>
a deep ſleep, and had an extraordinary Dream. For he thought he ſaw two <hi>Alexanders</hi> ready to engage, each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his ſeveral Phalanx, the one aſſiſted by <hi>Minerva,</hi> the other by <hi>Ceres;</hi> and that after a hot diſpute, he on whoſe ſide <hi>Minerva</hi> was, was beaten, and <hi>Ceres</hi> gathering the Corn, wove it into a Crown for the Victor. This Viſion <hi>Eumenes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted as boading Succeſs to himſelf, who was to fight for a fruitful Corn-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the whole being ſowed with Corn, and the fields ſo thick with it, that they made a beautiful ſhew of a long peace; And he was farther confirmed in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, when he underſtood that the Enemy bore <hi>Minerva</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; wherefore he alſo bore <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> and gave his Men orders to make Garlands for themſelves, and to dreſs their Arms with wreaths of Corn; he found himſelf under many temptations to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to his Captains and Officers whom they were to engage with, and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal a ſecret of ſuch moment in his own breaſt alone, yet he kept to his firſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and ventured to run the hazard of his own Judgment. (When he came to give Battel,) he would not truſt any <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi> to engage <hi>Craterus,</hi> but appointed
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:35403:286"/>
two Troops of Foreign Horſe, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> Son to <hi>Artabazus,</hi> and <hi>Phaenix</hi> of <hi>Tenedos,</hi> with Order to charge as ſoon as ever they ſaw the Enemy, without giving them leiſure to ſpeak or retire, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any Herauldor Trumpet from them; for he exceedingly feared the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> leſt, knowing <hi>Craterus,</hi> they ſhould go over to his ſide. He himſelf with 300 of his beſt Horſeled the right Wing againſt <hi>Neoptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> When the Enemy having paſt a little Hill came in view, and <hi>Eumenes</hi> his Men charged with more than ordinary brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Craterus</hi> was amazed, and bitterly reproached <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> for deceiving him, with hopes of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> revolt, but he encouraged his Men to do bravely, &amp; forthwith charged. The firſt Ingagement was very fierce, and the Spears being ſoon broke to pieces, they came to cloſe fighting with their Swords; and here <hi>Craterus</hi> did by no means diſhonour <hi>Alexander,</hi> but ſlew ſeveral of his Enemies, and repulſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that aſſaulted him; but at laſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Wound in his ſide, from a <hi>Thracian,</hi> and fell off his Horſe. Being down, many not knowing him went over him, but <hi>Gorgias</hi> one of <hi>Eumenes</hi> his Captains knew him, &amp; alighting from his Horſe guarded his Body, which was now in an ill condition, and
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:35403:287"/>
even in the very Agony of Death. In the mean time <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> and <hi>Eumenes</hi> were engaged, who being inveterate and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemies, ſought for one another, but miſſed for the two firſt Courſes, but in the third, diſcovering one another, they drew their Swords, and with loud Shouts they immediately charged, their Horſes ſtriking againſt one another like two Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, they quitted their reins, and taking mutual hold they drew off one anothers Helmets, and their Armour from their Shoulders; while they were thus ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping one another, each of their Horſes went from under them, and they fell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the ground, each of them keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hold and wreſtling. <hi>Neopto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemus</hi> getting up firſt, <hi>Eumenes</hi> wounded him in the hamm, and withal got upon his feet before him, <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> ſtaying himſelf upon one knee, the other Leg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grievouſly wounded, and himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermoſt, fought courageouſly, though his ſtrokes were not mortal, but receiving a blow in the neck he fell down and fainted. <hi>Eumenes</hi> tranſported with Rage, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Hatred to him, ſell to reviling and ſtripping of him, and perceived not that his Sword was ſtill in his hand, wherewith he wounded <hi>Eumenes</hi> in the
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:35403:287"/>
Groin near the privy parts, but in truth rather frighted than hurt him; his blow being faint for want of ſtrength. Having ſtript the dead Body, ill as he was of the Wounds he had received in his Legs and Arms, he took Horſe again, and made towards the left Wing of his Army, which he ſuppoſed to be ſtill engaged. Hearing of the Death of <hi>Craterus,</hi> he rode up to him, and finding there was yet ſome Life in him, alighted from his Horſe and wept, and laying his right hand upon him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed bitterly againſt <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> and lamented both <hi>Craterus</hi> his Misfortune, and his own hard fate, that he ſhould be neceſſitated to engage againſt an old Friend and Acquaintance, and either do or ſuffer ſo much miſchief.</p>
               <p>This Victory <hi>Eumenes</hi> obtained about ten days after the former, and got a great reputation for atchieving it, partly by his Conduct, and partly by his Valour.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary it created him great Envy both among his own, and his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that he a Stranger, and a Foreigner, ſhould employ the Forces, and Arms of <hi>Macedon,</hi> to cut off one of the braveſt and moſt conſiderable Men among them. Had the news of this defeat come timely enough to <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> he had doubtleſs been the
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:35403:288"/>
greateſt of all the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> but now he being ſlain in a Mutiny in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> two days before the News arrived, the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> in a rage decreed <hi>Eumenes</hi> his Death, giving joint-Commiſſion to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> and <hi>Antipater</hi> to proſecute the War againſt him. Paſſing by Mount <hi>Ida,</hi> where the King had a breed of Horſes, <hi>Eumenes</hi> took as many as he had occaſion for, and ſent an account of his doing ſo to the Maſters of his Horſe. Whereat <hi>Antipater</hi> is ſaid to have laught, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to admire the warineſs of the Man, who ſeemed to think that an account of the King's Affairs would either be expected from him, or given to him. <hi>Eumenes</hi> had deſigned to engage in the Plains of <hi>Lydia</hi> near <hi>Sardis,</hi> both becauſe his chief ſtrength lay in Horſe, and to let <hi>Cleopatra</hi> ſee how powerful he was: But at her particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar requeſt (for ſhe was afraid to give any umbrage to <hi>Antipater</hi>) he marched into the upper <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and Wintered in <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laene,</hi> when <hi>Alcetas, Polemon,</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus</hi> diſputing with him, who ſhould command in Chief: You know (ſaid he) the old ſaying, That deſtruction regards no Punctilio's. Having promiſed his Soldiers pay within three days, he ſold them all the Farms and Caſtles in the Country,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:35403:288"/>
together with the Men and Beaſts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they abounded; every Captain or Officer that bought, did with <hi>Eumenes</hi>'s conſent, employ his Machins to ſtorm the place, and divided the Spoil among his Company, proportionably to every man's Arrears. Hereby <hi>Eumenes</hi> came again to be beloved, ſo that when Letters were found thrown about the Camp by the Enemy, promiſing one hundred Talents, beſides great Honours to any one that ſhould kill <hi>Eumenes,</hi> the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were extremely offended, and made an Order that from that time forward one thouſand of their beſt men ſhould continually guard his Perſon, and keep ſtrict Watch about him by Night in their ſeveral turns. This Order was chearfully obeyed, and they gladly received of <hi>Eumenes</hi> ſuch Honours as Princes uſe to confer upon their Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites: for he had power to beſtow purple Hats and Cloaks, which among the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi> is one of the greateſt Honours the King can give. Now good Fortune puffs up narrow Souls, to imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves high and mighty, and looking down upon the World; but a truly noble and reſolved Spirit, in diſtreſs and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure raiſes it ſelf, and becomes more conſpicuous, and ſuch was <hi>Eumenes.</hi>
                  <pb n="554" facs="tcp:35403:289"/>
For having by the Treaſon of one of his own men, loſt the Field to <hi>Antigonus</hi> at <hi>Orcyni</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> in his flight he gave the Traitor no opportunity to eſcape to the Enemy, but immediately ſeized and hanged him. Then in his flight taking a contrary courſe to his Purſuers, he ſtole by them unawares, returned to the place where the Battel had been fought, and there encamped. There he gathered up the dead bodies, and burnt them with the Doors and Windows of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Villages, and raiſed heaps of Earth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Graves, inſomuch that <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who came thither ſoon after him, was aſtoniſhed at his great Courage, and firm Reſolution. Lighting afterwards upon <hi>Antigonus</hi> his Carriage, he might eaſily have taken many Captives, both bond and freemen, and much Wealth collected from the Spoils of ſo many Wars; but he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leſt his men overladen with ſo great Booty, might become unfit for ſo many Marches, and through ſoftneſs unwilling to hold out ſo long time as he deſigned; For upon thoſe two things he laid the main ſtreſs of his Action, expecting to tire <hi>Antigonus</hi> into ſome other courſe. But then conſidering it would be extremely difficult to reſtrain the <hi>Macedonians</hi> from
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:35403:289"/>
plunder, when it ſeemed to offer it ſelf, he gave them order to provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and bait their Horſes, and then attack the Enemy. In the mean time he ſent privately to <hi>Menander,</hi> who had care of all his Baggage, pretending a Concern for him upon the ſcore of old Friendſhip and Acquaintance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adviſing him to quit the Plain, and inſconce himſelf upon the ſide of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Hill, where the Horſe might not be able to hem him in. When <hi>Menander,</hi> ſenſible of his danger, had truſſed up his Carriage, and decamped, <hi>Eumenes</hi> openly ſent his Scouts to diſcover the Enemies poſture, and commanded his men to arm, and bridle their Horſes, as deſigning im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to give Battel; but the Scouts returning with News that <hi>Menander</hi> had ſecured ſo difficult a Poſt, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to take him, <hi>Eumenes</hi> pretending to be aggrieved with the diſappointment, drew off his men another way. 'Tis ſaid, that when <hi>Menander</hi> reported this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians</hi> commended <hi>Eumenes,</hi> imputing it to his ſingular good nature, that having it in his power to make Slaves of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and raviſh their Wives, he forbore, and ſpared them all, <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſhould
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:35403:290"/>
thus reply, Alas, good man, he had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to us, but to himſelf, being loth to wear ſo many Shackles when he deſigned to fly. From that time <hi>Eumenes</hi> daily flying, and wandring about, perſwaded divers of his men to disband, whether out of kindneſs to them, or unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to lead about ſuch a Body of Men, as were too few to engage, and too many to fly undiſcovered. Being come to the Cittadel of <hi>Nora</hi> in the Confines of <hi>Lyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> with fifteen hundred horſe, and two hundred Foot well appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he again diſmiſt as many of his friends as deſired it, through fear either of the ſtraitneſs of the place, or want of Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and imbracing them with all demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of kindneſs, gave them licenſe to depart. <hi>Antigonus</hi> when he came before this Fort, deſired to have an interview with <hi>Eumenes</hi> before the ſiege; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Anſwer, That <hi>Antigonus</hi> had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Friends who might Command in his room; but they whom <hi>Eumenes</hi> defended, had no body to ſubſtitute if he ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry; wherefore if <hi>Antigonus</hi> thought it worth while to treat with him, he ſhould firſt ſend him Hoſtages, and when <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> required that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Eumenes</hi> ſhould firſt come to him, as being the greater man; he
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:35403:290"/>
replied, while I am able to wield a Sword, I ſhall think no man greater than my ſelf. At laſt, when according to <hi>Eumenes</hi> his demand, <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſent his own Nephew <hi>Ptolomy</hi> to the Fort, <hi>Eumenes</hi> went out to him, and they mutually imbraced with great civility and friendſhip, as having formerly been very intimate. After long Converſation, <hi>Eumenes</hi> making no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own Pardon and Security; but inſiſting that he would be confirmed in his ſeveral Governments, and withall be honourably rewarded for his Service, all that were preſent were aſtoniſhed at his Courage and Gallantry, and many others of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> flocked to ſee what manner of perſon <hi>Eumenes</hi> was; for ſince the death of <hi>Craterus,</hi> no man had been ſo much talked on in the Army. But <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> being afraid for him, leſt he might ſuffer ſome violence, firſt commanded the Souldiers to keep off, calling out, and throwing ſtones at them that preſſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. At laſt embracing <hi>Eumenes</hi> in his arms, and keeping off the crowd with his Guards, not without great difficulty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he returned him ſafe into the Fort. Then <hi>Antigonus</hi> having built a Wall round <hi>Nora,</hi> left a Force ſufficient to carry on the ſiege, and drew off the reſt of his Army; <hi>Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
                  <pb n="558" facs="tcp:35403:291"/>
was beleaguered, and kept Garriſon, having plenty of Corn, and Water, and Salt, but no other thing, either for Food or Delicacy; yet with ſuch as he had, he kept a chearful Table for his Friends, inviting them ſeverally in their turns, and ſeaſoning his Entertainment with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and affable behaviour; for he had a ſweet countenance, and looked not like a rough batter'd Souldier, but was ſmooth and florid, and his ſhape as delicate, as if his limbs had been carv'd by Art in the moſt accurate proportions. In converſation he was not quick, but courteous and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. The greateſt diſtreſs of the beſieged, was the ſtraitneſs of the place they were in, their Quarters being very narrow, and the whole place but two Furlongs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs; ſo that both they, and their horſes fed without exerciſe; wherefore not only to prevent the reſtineſs that both might contract by that large living, but to have them in condition to fly, if occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, he aſſigned a Room fourteen Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits long (the largeſt in all the Fort) for the men to walk in, directing them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their walk gently, and ſo gradually mend their pace. And for the Horſes, he tied them to the Roof with great Halters, which being faſtened about their Necks
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:35403:291"/>
with a Pully, he gently raiſed them, till ſtanding upon the ground with their hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet, they juſt touched it with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ends of their fore-feet. In this poſture the Grooms plied them with Whips and Noiſe, provoking them to curvet and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, endeavouring to ſtand upon their fore-feet; and thus their whole Body was exerciſed, till they were all in a foam, and groaned again; an excellent ſort of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe this, whether for ſtrength or ſpeed; and then he gave them their Corn boiled, that they might ſooner diſpatch, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter digeſt it.</p>
               <p>The Siege continuing long, <hi>Antigonus</hi> receiv'd advice that <hi>Antipater</hi> was dead in <hi>Macedon,</hi> and that Affairs were embroyl'd by the differences of <hi>Caſſander</hi> and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perchon,</hi> whereupon he conceiv'd no mean hopes, purpoſing to make himſelf Maſter of all, and in order to his deſign, to bring over <hi>Eumenes,</hi> that he might have his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and aſſiſtance. Wherefore he ſent <hi>Hieronymus</hi> to treat with him, propoſing a certain Oath, which <hi>Eumenes</hi> firſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and then referred himſelf to the <hi>Macedonians</hi> themſelves that beſieg'd him, to be judged by them, which of the two Forms were the moſt equitable. <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in the beginning of his had ſlightly
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:35403:292"/>
mentioned the Kings, but all the ſequel referred to himſelf alone: But <hi>Eumenes</hi> would have the Form of it to <hi>Olympias</hi> and the Kings, and would ſwear not to be true to <hi>Antigonus</hi> only, but to them, and to have the ſame Friends and Enemies not with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> but with <hi>Olympias</hi> and the Kings. This Form the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> thinking the more reaſonable, ſwore <hi>Eumenes</hi> according to it, and raiſed the Siege, ſending alſo to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that he ſhould ſwear in the ſame Form to <hi>Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> Now all the Hoſtages of the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocians</hi> which <hi>Eumenes</hi> had in <hi>Nora</hi> he returned, and from thoſe they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to, took War-horſes, Beaſts of Carriage, and Tents in exchange, and rallying thoſe men which from the time of his flight were ſcattered, and wandering about the Country, got together a Body of near a thouſand Horſe, and with them fled from <hi>Antigonus,</hi> whom he juſtly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for he had not only ordered him to be firſt blocked up, but had ſent a very ſharp Anſwer to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting <hi>Eumenes</hi> his Amendments of the Oath. While <hi>Eumenes</hi> was flying he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Letters from them in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who were jealous of <hi>Antigonus</hi> his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to wit, from <hi>Olympias,</hi> inviting
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:35403:292"/>
him thither, to take the Charge and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s little Son, againſt whom there was divers Plots. Other Letters he had from <hi>Polyperchon</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> the King, requiring him to make War upon <hi>Antigonus,</hi> making him Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of all the Forces in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and impowring him out of the Revenue of <hi>Cyndos,</hi> to take fifty Talents to reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe himſelf, and levy as much more as he thought neceſſary to carry on the War: they write alſo to the ſame effect to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> and <hi>Teutamus,</hi> the Chief Officers of the <hi>Argyraſpides,</hi> who, receiving theſe Letters, treat <hi>Eumenes</hi> with a ſhew of reſpect, and kindneſs, but it was apparent enough they were full of Envy and Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, diſdaining to give place to him. Now their Envy, <hi>Eumenes</hi> very fairly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, by refuſing to accept the Money, as if he had not needed it; and their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and Emulation, who were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able to govern, nor willing to obey, he conquered by turning it into Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. For he pretended that <hi>Alexander</hi> had appeared to him in a Dream, and ſhewed him a Regal Pavilion richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, with a Throne in it; and told him if they would ſit in Council there, he himſelf, would be preſent, and proſper all the Conſultations, and Atchievements, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:35403:293"/>
which they ſhould enter in his name. <hi>Antigenes</hi> and <hi>Teutamus</hi> were eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to believe this, being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to come and conſult <hi>Eumenes,</hi> as much as he diſdained to wait at another Man's Threſhold. Wherefore they erected a Tent-Royal, and a Throne, and called it <hi>Alexander's,</hi> and there they met to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult upon all Affairs of moment. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they advanced into the upper Country, and in their March met with <hi>Peuceſtus</hi> friend to <hi>Eumenes,</hi> and with other of the Lords, who joined Forces with them, and greatly encouraged the <hi>Macedonians</hi> with the number and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of their Men. But they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves having ſince <hi>Alexander's</hi> Deceaſe, been from under Government, and lived with great delicacy, and ſo becoming ſoft and effeminate, and imagining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves great Princes, which fond conceit of theirs, was daily pampered by the flattery of the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> all theſe things concurring, made them rude to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and unconverſable, and all of them unmeaſurably flatter the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting them to Revels, and Sacrifices, till in a ſhort time they brought the Camp to be a diſſolute Place of Entertainment, by every Captains endeavouring to make a Party among the Commons, as in all
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:35403:293"/>
Democracies is uſual. <hi>Eumenes</hi> perceiving they deſpiſed one another, and all of them feared him, and ſought an opportunity to kill him, pretended to be in want of Money, and took up many Talents, of thoſe eſpecially, who moſt hated him, to make them both confide in him, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear all Violence to him for fear of loſing their own Money. Thus his Enemies Eſtates, were the guard of his Perſon, and by receiving Money, he purchaſed ſafety, for which other Men uſe to give it. Now the <hi>Macedonians</hi> while there was no ſhew of Danger, made all their Court, and came to the Levè of thoſe that treated, and preſented them; and they had their Guards, and affected to appear Generals. But when <hi>Antigonus</hi> came upon them with a great Army, and their Affairs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeemed to call out for a true Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, then not only the common Soldiers caſt their Eyes upon <hi>Eumenes,</hi> but theſe Men who had appeared ſo great in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful time of eaſe, ſubmitted all of them to him, and quietly poſted themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally as he appointed them. And when <hi>Antigonus</hi> attempted to paſs the River <hi>Paſitygris,</hi> all the reſt that were appointed to guard the Paſſes, were not ſo much as aware of his March; only <hi>Eumenes</hi> met and encountered him, ſlew as many of
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:35403:294"/>
his Men as filled up the River with their Carcaſes, and took 4000 of them Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. Chiefly when <hi>Eumenes</hi> was ſick the <hi>Macedonians</hi> diſcovered that in their Judgment, others would treat hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely, and make fire-balls, but he alone knew how to fight and lead an Army. For <hi>Peuceſtas</hi> having made a ſplendid Entertainment in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and given each of the Soldiers a Sheep wherewith to Sacrifice, promiſed himſelf to Command in chief, ſome few days after the Army was to march, and <hi>Eumenes</hi> being dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly ſick, was carried in a Litter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Body of the Army, that his reſt might not be diſturbed. But when they were a little advanced, unexpectedly they had a view of the Enemy, who had paſſed the Hills that lay between them, and was marching down into the Plain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing therefore the glittering of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Golden Armour, which glar'd in the Sun, the good Order of their March, the Elephants with their Caſtles on their backs, and the Men in their Purple, (as their manner was when they were going to give Battel) the Front ſtopt their March, and called out for <hi>Eumenes,</hi> for they would not advance a ſtep but under his Conduct; and fixing their Arms in the ground, gave the Word among themſelves
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:35403:294"/>
to ſtand, requiring their Officers alſo not to ſtir or engage, or hazard themſelves without <hi>Eumenes.</hi> News of this being brought to <hi>Eumenes,</hi> he haſtned them that carried his Litter, and put forth his right hand. Aſſoon as the Soldiers ſaw him; they ſaluted him in the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Language, and took up their Shields, and ſtriking them with their Pikes, gave a great ſhout, inviting the Enemy to come on, for now they had a Leader. But <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> underſtanding by ſome Priſoners he had taken, that <hi>Eumenes</hi> was ſick and to that degree as to be carried in a Litter, preſumed it would be no hard matter to tread in pieces the reſt of them, ſince he was ill. Wherefore he made the greater haſte to come up with them and engage. But being come ſo near, as to diſcover how the Enemy was drawn up, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, he was aſtoniſhed, and pauſed for ſome time, at laſt he ſaw the Litter carrying from one Wing of the Army to the other, (and as his manner was) laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloud, he ſaid to his Friends, That Litter there, it ſeems, is the thing that offers us Battel; but withal he immediately wheeled about with all his Army, and decamped. The other ſide finding a little reſpite, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their former cuſtom of revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and aſſuring every Man the port of a
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:35403:295"/>
General, taking up for their Winter-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters near the whole Country of the <hi>Gabeni,</hi> ſo that the Front was quartered near 100 furlongs from the Rear, which <hi>Antigonus</hi> underſtanding, marcht imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately towards them, taking the worſt way, through a Country that wanted Water (but the way was ſhort though uneven) hoping if he ſhould ſurprize them thus ſcattered in their Winter-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Soldiers would not eaſily be able to come up time enough, and join with their Officers. But being to paſs through a Country uninhabited, where the Winds were bleak and boiſterous, and the Froſts great, he was very much checkt in his March, and his men exceedingly tired. The only relief in this caſe was making continual fires, whereby his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies got notice of his coming. For the <hi>Barbarians</hi> who dwelt on the Mountains, bordering upon the Deſart, amazed at the multitude of fires they ſaw, ſent Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers upon Dromedaries, to acquaint <hi>Peu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtus:</hi> He being aſtoniſht and almoſt ſtruck dead with the News, and finding the reſt in no leſs diſorder, reſolved to flee, and get up what Men he could by the way. But <hi>Eumenes</hi> delivered him from his great fear and trouble, undertaking to ſtop the Enemies Career, that he ſhould
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:35403:295"/>
arrive three days later than he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Having perſuaded them, he immediately diſpatched Expreſſes to all Officers, to draw the Men out of their Winter-Quarters, and Muſter them with ſpeed. He himſelf with ſome of the chief Officers rode out, and choſe an eminent place within view of ſuch as travelled the Deſart; this he fortified and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered out, and commanded many fires to be made in it, as the Cuſtom is in a Camp This done, and the Enemies ſeeing the fire upon the Mountains, Anguiſh and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair ſeized <hi>Antigonus,</hi> ſuppoſing that his Enemies had been long advertiſed of his March, and were prepared to receive him. Wherefore leſt his Army now tired and wearied out with their March ſhould be forced immediately to encounter with freſh Men, who had Wintered well, and were ready for him, quitting the near way, he marched ſlowly through the Towns and Villages, to refreſh his Men. But meeting with no ſuch Skirmiſhes as are uſual, when two Armies lie near one another, and being aſſured by the People of the Country, that no Army had been ſeen, but only continual Fires in that place, he concluded he had been outwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Stratagem of <hi>Eumenes,</hi> and being very much troubled, advanced towards
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:35403:296"/>
him, reſolving immediately to give Battel. By this time the greateſt part of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were come together to <hi>Eumenes,</hi> and admiring his Conduct, declared him ſole Commander in chief of the whole Army. Whereat <hi>Antigenes</hi> and <hi>Teuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> Captains of the <hi>Argyraſpides,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much offended, and envying <hi>Eumenes,</hi> formed a Conſpiracy againſt him; and aſſembling the greater part of the Lords and Officers, conſulted when and how to cut him off. When they had unanimouſly agreed, firſt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe his ſervice, and make him miſcarry in the next Battel, and thence take an occaſion to deſtroy him; <hi>Eudamus</hi> the Maſter of the Elephants, and <hi>Phadimus,</hi> gave <hi>Eumenes</hi> private advice of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; not out of kindneſs, or good will to him, but leſt they ſhould loſe the Money he had lent them. <hi>Eumenes</hi> having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them retired to his Tent, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Friends he lived among a Herd of wild Beaſts, made his Will, mangled and tore all his Letters, leſt his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents after his Death, ſhould be queſtioned or puniſhed for the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence they had given him. Having thus diſpoſed of his Affairs, he thought of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Enemy win the Field, or of flying through <hi>Media,</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> and ſeizing
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:35403:296"/>
                  <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> but came to no Reſolution while his Friends ſtayed with him. After forecaſting divers things in his mind, which his changeable Fortune made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady and ſickle, he at laſt put his Men in Array, and encouraged the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> as for the <hi>Argyraſpides,</hi> they encouraged him, and bid him be of good heart, for the Enemy would never be able to ſtand them. For indeed they were the oldeſt of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s Soldiers, tried Men, that had long made a Trade of War, that had never been beaten or ſo much as foiled, moſt of them 70, none leſs than 60 years old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore when they charged <hi>Antigonus</hi> his Men, they cried out, <hi>You fight againſt your Fathers, you Raſcals;</hi> and furiouſly falling on, routed the whole Troop at once, no Body being able to ſtand them, and the greateſt part dying by their hands, ſo that <hi>Antigonus</hi> his Foot were routed, but his Horſe got the better, and he became Maſter of the Baggage, through the Cowardiſe of <hi>Peuceſtus,</hi> who beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf negligently and baſely. While <hi>Antigonus,</hi> not daunted with the loſs of his Infantry, was vigilant and active, and had the advantage of the ground. For the place where they fought was a large Field, neither deep, nor hard
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:35403:297"/>
under foot, but like the Sea-ſhore, covered with a fine ſoft ſand, which the treading of ſo many Men and Horſes, in the time of the Battle, reduced to a ſmall white duſt, that like a Cloud of Lime darkened the Air, ſo that one could not ſee clearly at any diſtance, and ſo made it eaſie for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> to take the Carriage unperceived. After the Battel <hi>Teutamus</hi> ſent a Meſſage to <hi>Antigonus</hi> to demand the Baggage. He made Anſwer, He would not only reſtore it to the <hi>Argyraſpides,</hi> but ſerve them farther in other things, if they would but deliver up <hi>Eumenes.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyraſpides</hi> made a villainous Reſolution, to deliver up this great Man alive into the hands of his Enemies. So they came to wait upon him, being unſuſpected by him, but watching their opportunity againſt him, ſome lamenting the loſs of the Baggage, ſome encouraging as if he had been Victor, ſome accuſing the reſt of the Captains, till at laſt they all fell upon him, and ſeizing his Sword, bound his hands behind him with his own Girdle. When <hi>Antigonus</hi> had ſent <hi>Nicanor</hi> to receive him, he begged he might be led through the Body of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and have liberty to ſpeak to them, neither to requeſt, nor deprecate any thing, but only to adviſe them what would be for their Intereſt. A
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:35403:297"/>
ſilence being made, as he ſtood upon a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Ground, he ſtretched out his hands bound, and ſaid, What Trophy, O ye baſeſt of all the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> could <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> have wiſhed for, ſo great, as you your ſelves have erected him, in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up your General Captive into his hands? How vile is it when you were Conquerors, to own your ſelves Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for the ſake only of your Baggage, as if it were Wealth, not Arms wherein Victory conſiſted? Nay, you deliver up your General to redeem your Lumber. As for me I am unvanquiſhed, though a Captive, Conqueror of my Enemies, and betrayed by my Fellow-Souldiers. For you, I adjure you by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of Arms, and by all the Gods that are the avengers of Perjury, to kill me here with your own hands, for 'tis all one; and when I am murdered yonder, it will be eſteemed your Act; nor will <hi>Antigonus</hi> complain; for he deſires not <hi>Eumenes</hi> alive, but dead. If ye would with-hold your own hands, releaſe but one of mine, it ſhall ſuffice to do the Work; but if you dare not truſt me with a Sword, throw me bound as I am, to wild Beaſts. This if you do, I ſhall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquit you from the guilt of my death, as the moſt juſt and kind of Men to their
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:35403:298"/>

While <hi>Eumenes</hi> was thus ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the reſt of the Souldiers wept for grief; but the <hi>Argyraſpides</hi> bawled out to lead him on, and gave not attention to his trifling. For it was nothing ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous the Lamentation of this <hi>Cherſoneſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Plague, which in thouſands of Battels, had annoyed and waſted the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> as it would be for the choiceſt of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Souldiers to be defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Fruits of ſo long Service, and in their old Age to come to beg their Bread; beſides that their Wives had lain now three Nights with their Enemies. So they puſhed him on with all ſpeed and violence. But <hi>Antigonus</hi> fearing the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, (for no body was left in the Camp) ſent ten of his ſtrongeſt Elephants with divers of his <hi>Mede</hi> and <hi>Parthyaean</hi> Lances to keep off the Preſs. Then he could not endure to have <hi>Eumenes</hi> brought into his preſence, by reaſon of their former Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Friendſhip; but when they that had taken him, had enquired of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> how he would have him kept? As I would (ſaid he) an Elephant or a Lion. A little after, being moved with Compaſſion, he commanded the heavieſt of his Irons to be knock'd off, one of his Menial Servants to be admitted to anoint him, and that any of his Friends that
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:35403:298"/>

'Tis repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that <hi>Eumenes</hi> ſhould enquire of <hi>Ono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchus</hi> his Keeper, why <hi>Antigonus,</hi> now he had his Enemy in his hands, would not either forthwith diſpatch or generouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly releaſe him? And that <hi>Onomarchus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliouſly anſwered him, That the Field was a more proper place than this to ſhew his Contempt of Death. To whom <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> replied, And by <hi>Jupiter</hi> I ſhewed it there; ask the men elſe that engaged me; but I could never meet a Man that was too hard for me. Therefore (rejoyned <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomarchus,</hi>) now you have found ſuch a Man, why don't you ſubmit quietly to his pleaſure? When <hi>Antigonus</hi> reſolved to kill <hi>Eumenes,</hi> he commanded to keep his Meat from him, and ſo with two or three days faſting, he began to draw near his end: But the Camp being on a ſudden to remove, an Executioner was ſent to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch him. <hi>Antigonus</hi> granted his Body to his Friends, permitted them to burn it,
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:35403:299"/>
and having gathered his Aſhes into a Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Urn, to ſend them to his Wife and Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eumenes</hi> being thus taken off, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity appointed no other of the Captains or Commanders to revenge the Diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them that had betrayed him; but <hi>Antigonus</hi> himſelf abominating the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyraſpides,</hi> as wicked and inhumane Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, delivered them up to <hi>Ibyrtius</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator of <hi>Arachoſia,</hi> commanding him by all ways and means to confound and deſtroy them, ſo that not a man of them might ever come to <hi>Macedon,</hi> or ſo much as within ſight of the <hi>Greek</hi> Sea.</p>

               <p>IT is no great wonder, if in long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, the Wheel of Fortune running variouſly hither and thither through the Univerſe, ſhall happen to fall divers times into the ſame Trace, and the like Occurrences be often produced; and if the number of Subjects to be wrought upon, be infinite, Fortune being ſupplied with matter ſufficiently copious, may

And whilſt he conſidered which way next to turn his Arms, the <hi>Luſitanians</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors<note place="margin">The <hi>Luſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanians</hi> ſend Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to him.</note> to deſire him to be their General, for being terrified with the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, and finding the neceſſity of having a Commander of great Authority and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in war, being alſo ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of his Worth and Valour, by thoſe who had formerly ſerved him, they were extremely deſirous to commit themſelves and their Fortunes wholly to his care, and humbly beſeeched him to accept of the Command. And to give a true Character of <hi>Sertorius,</hi> he was of a temper not to be ſurprized with fear, nor eaſie to be Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated with pleaſure, in Adverſity and Dangers undaunted, and no ways puffed up with Proſperity, but of an even Mind, Courteous and Obliging. Upon a ſudden Aſſault or dangerous Attempt, no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in his time was more bold and daring, for whatever was to be performed
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:35403:311"/>
in War by Deceit, Circumvention, or Surprize; or if any ſtrong place was to be taken in any paſs to be gained ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, any ſudden Invaſion or Inroad to be made, he was a moſt notable Contriver, and politick Advancer of all ſuch intricate and difficult Deſigns, in beſtowing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and conferring Honours upon thoſe who had performed good ſervice in the Wars. He was Bountifull and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent even to Prodigality, but very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and backward in puniſhing Crimes, and Mild and Mercifull to Offenders; yet that piece of Harſhneſs and Cruelty, which he executed in the latter part of his Days, upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hoſtages, ſeems to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that his Clemency was not Natural, but only acted and handſomely diſſembled, as his Occaſions or Neceſſity required; and as to my own Opinion, I am perſwaded that ſincere Vertue eſtabliſhed by Reaſon and Mature Judgment, can never be totally Perverted or Extirpated by any Misfortune whatever. Not that I think it impoſſible but that great Indignities of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered without cauſe, and frequent Abuſes put upon thoſe of the beſt Nature, and moſt vertuous Inclinations, may make ſome impreſſion and alteration in their Temper; and thus I ſuppoſe it happened to <hi>Sertorius,</hi> who being exaſperated by

the repeated Injuries of ungratefull Perſons, he was at laſt ſevere to thoſe who had unworthily injured him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Luſitanians</hi> having ſent for <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius,</hi> he left <hi>Africa,</hi> and being made General with abſolute Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he ordered all things for the beſt Advantage, and brought the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parts of <hi>Spain</hi> under his Subjection; many Countries alſo voluntarily ſubmitted themſelves won by the Fame of his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and of his Martial Performances. Upon ſome Occaſions alſo he would not fail to invent ſtrange Artifices to pleaſe the People, and to make uſe of alluring De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and even of deluding Impoſtures, amongſt which certainly that of the Hind<note place="margin">

<pb n="598" facs="tcp:35403:312"/>
he kindly accepted, and was much taken with it at the firſt ſight, but when in time he had made it ſo tame and gentle, that it would come when he called, and follow him whereſoever he went, and could endure the Noiſe and Tumult of the Camp; knowing well that Barbarous People are naturally prone to Superſtition, by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees he gave out that it was inſpired with a Deity, that it was given him by the Goddeſs <hi>Diana,</hi> that it diſcovered to him hidden Myſteries, and revealed to him what was to come to paſs hereafter: To which alſo he added theſe further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances; if he had received at any time private Intelligence, that the Enemies had made an Incurſion into thoſe Provinces which were under his Command, or had ſollicited any City to revolt, he pretended that the Hind had informed him of it in his ſleep, and charged him to keep his Forces in readineſs; or if otherwiſe he had notice that any of the Commanders under him had got a Victory, he would hide the Meſſengers, and bring forth the Hind crowned with flowers, for joy of the good News that was to come, and would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to Rejoyce and Sacrifice to the Gods for the good account they ſhould ſoon receive of their Proſperous Succeſs, and by thoſe Inventions filling their

Heads with ſtrange Imaginations, and the thoughts of Miracles, he brought them to be more Tractable and Obedient in all things; for now they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no longer to be led by a Stranger, but rather conducted by a <hi>Hero,</hi> or one nearly related to a God.

The next Morning when a gentle Breeze aroſe, and moved the lighteſt Parts of the Earth, and diſperſed it about as the Chaff before the Wind, and when the Sun coming to be higher, the bluſtering Northerly Wind had covered the Hills with the duſt, the Soldiers turned this new Mount of Earth over and over, and brake the Clots of Clay in Pieces, whilſt others on Horſeback rode through it backward and forward, and raiſed a Cloud of duſt, which being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Wind, was blown into the Dwellings of the <hi>Characitanians,</hi> the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances into which were all towards the

Nor did he only at firſt take his riſe from theſe ſlender Opportunities, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards alſo met with great Impediments in the further Encreaſe, and Progreſs of his Honour and Authority, and that, not only from thoſe who publickly reſiſted him, but from many others that privately Conſpired againſt him; but it was much otherwiſe with <hi>Sertorius,</hi> for not one of his Party did ever publickly oppoſe him, or promote any Inſurrection againſt him; nor ſecretly; till at laſt a few of his Acquaintance entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a private Conſpiracy. <hi>Sertorius</hi> put an end to his Dangers, as often as he was Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious in the Field, whereas the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Eumenes</hi> were the beginning of his Calamities, through the Malice of thoſe that envied his Glory.</p>
               <p>Their martial performances were equal
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:35403:330"/>
and parallel, but their manners and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were different. <hi>Eumenes</hi> naturally loved War and Contention, but <hi>Sertorius</hi> eſteemed Peace and Tranquility: When <hi>Eumenes</hi> might have lived in ſafety, with honour, if he would have quietly retired, he perſiſted in his contentions, and made War with the greateſt of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Princes, with the danger and loſs of his Life: But <hi>Sertorius,</hi> who was unwilling to trouble himſelf with any publick diſturbances, was forced, for the ſafety of his Perſon, to make War againſt thoſe who would not ſuffer him to live in peace: If <hi>Eumenes</hi> had not violently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Superiority, or could have contented himſelf with the ſecond place, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> would have uſed him handſomly, and ſhewn him all favour and reſpect, whereas <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Friends would never permit <hi>Serto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> to live in quiet. The one made War of his own accord, out of his ambition to Rule and Govern; and the other was conſtrained to accept of the Soveraign Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to defend himſelf from his Enemies that made War againſt him. <hi>Eumenes</hi> was certainly a true Lover of War, for he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd his covetous Ambition before his own eaſe and ſecurity; but <hi>Sertorius</hi> was truly warlike, who procured his own ſafety by the ſucceſsful force of his Arms.</p>
               <p>As to the manner of their Deaths, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:35403:331"/>
to one without the leaſt thought or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of it; but to the other when he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it daily; which in the firſt argued a clear equal temper, and a noble mind not to diſtruſt his Friends: But in the other it ſhewed ſome infirmity of Spirit, for <hi>Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> intended to fly and was taken. The death of <hi>Sertorius</hi> diſhonoured not his life, he ſuffered that from his companions, that none of his mortal enemies were ever able to perform. The other not being able to deliver himſelf before his impriſonment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing alſo to live in captivity, did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevent nor expect his fate with any honour or bravery; for by meanly ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and petitioning, he made his enemy, that pretended only to have power over his Body, to be Lord and Maſter of his Body and Mind.</p>
