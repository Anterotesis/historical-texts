            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yea, the <hi>Papists</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they say, That the <hi>Pope</hi> is the <hi>Vicar</hi> of CHRIST, and head of the Church. They mean not anie one <hi>Pope</hi> onlie: But, the whole succession of such, which they deryve from PETER.</p>
            <p>Thus having shown, that <hi>Antichrist</hi> is not one onlie individuall person: but, a succession of manie. Wee come next, to consider, how <hi>hee</hi> is in holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture descrybed. And, before wee anie furder proceed, wee are to frame this irrefragable Argument, and playn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, thus:</p>
            <p>Unto whom the Prophecies of holie Scripture, descrybing <hi>Antichrist,</hi> doe sole, and onlie agree, <hi>hee</hi> is that <hi>Grand Antichrist,</hi> foretold in the Scriptures. But, unto the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the holie Seripture, descrybing <hi>Antichrist,</hi> do sole and onlie agree.</p>
            <p>Therefore, it followeth; That the

               <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> is that <hi>Grand Antichrist,</hi> foretold in the Scriptures. The <hi>Major</hi> is undenyable, all the Controversie, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is onlie in the probation of the <hi>Minor</hi>: which I shall (GOD willing) labour, to prove, by the <hi>Induction,</hi> of the Prophecies themselves: and, their <hi>Application,</hi> all of them, to the <hi>Pope.</hi> And, that being taken collectivelie or joyntlie, they are applyable to none else, but to <hi>him.</hi>

            <p>First <hi>Haymo</hi> a german Archbishope, who lived anno 800. writing upon this place sayeth, <hi>The Apostle showeth that our LORD shall not come to judgement, till first a decay be of the Roman Empyre, which wee now see fulfilled</hi> (sayeth hee) <hi>&amp; that Antichrist doeth now appeare in the World, who shall kill the Martyrs of CHRIST; Lyra</hi> likewise upon the same words of <hi>Paull,</hi> sayth, <hi>That in his time</hi> (anno 1300) <hi>The whole Kingdomes of the World had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie revolted from the Roman Empire, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying subjection or tribute thereto.

that the Antichristian Monarchie fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prophecied by <hi>Paull</hi> is in the place ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of erected. <hi>Salmeron</hi> also the Iesuit (on 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. <hi>disput.</hi> 2. sayeth, <hi>The Roman Empyre is long ago overthrowne and divided in many Kingdomes, and as it were</hi> (sayeth hee) <hi>altogether extinct.

            <p>Now, as for the revealing of this man of sinne, whereof <hi>Paull</hi> speaketh, There are two principall degrees; The first, when <hi>Boniface</hi> the third assumed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the supremacie over the whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Church, which he did when hee usurped the tytle of <hi>Vniversall Bishope</hi> &amp; Head of the Church, which his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour <hi>Gregorie</hi> the first had declared to

            <p>The second degree was when <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight (as their own author of <hi>Fascicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus temporm</hi> speaketh) <hi>In tantam arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantiam seipsum erexit, ut Dominum totius mundi se diceret, tam in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdlie, In the bull of <hi>Clement</hi> the sixt, in favours of these who should happen to die comming to his jubile, these were his words. <hi>Wee command the Angells to carrie their soules into Abrahams bosome</hi> which bull is extant, registrat in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of <hi>Iohannes Phofferus</hi> Professour of divinitie in <hi>Friburg.</hi> DE MATERIA IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DULGENTIARUM, anno 1472.</p>

               <hi>Formosus,</hi> whose dead bodie (as hath beene said) hee untombed, beheaded, and cast into <hi>Tyber,</hi> was a most uncleane beast, abusing his bodie with a most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous strumpet <hi>Marozia</hi> upon whom hee begot, (as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> telleth us) <hi>Iohn</hi> who afterward succeeded Pope, by the name of <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. or as <hi>Platiua</hi> counteth <hi>Iohn</hi> the 10.</p>

All which popish miracles I distinguish in three ranks, the first is of these who are falslie reported, but not done, the second is of these that seeme to be done, but are onlie counterfited, the third is of these that are trulie done, but by satan. The first of which are bred of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43976:80"/>
lyes, and nourished by credulitie, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sort is bred of fraud, and fed by superstition, it being hard to tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iuglers or priests (like these of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) haue beene greatest Cozeners. The third is, the working of Satan (as the Apostle speaketh 2. Thess. 2.9.) and his strong delusion of such, who because they receive not the loue of the trueth, therefore are given over to believe a lye, so that all popish miracles are either fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie reported, or falslie done, or falslie as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to God, saint, or angel.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43976:81"/>
gayne like inferiour priests, but to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to a Popedome, which was thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boniface</hi> perceiving his predecessour <hi>Caelestin</hi> (who had beene a Here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Another notable and later example in anno 1534. known to all FRANCE was this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See Sleid. com. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>f.</hi> 94.</note> The provost of <hi>Orleans</hi> wife died, and forebade her body to be buried with great solemnitie (as use was) whereby the gray Friers in whose Church she was buried, being disapointed of the great gayne which they expected, suborned a young Frier, placed aboue the syling of the Church in the time of even-song, to make a great noyse, whereupon many resorting thither, and conjuration of the spirit being used to declare who hee
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43976:81"/>
was, Answered, that it was the soule of the Provost of <hi>Orleans</hi> wife, &amp; was dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the Lutheran heresie (tho shee died a Roman Catholick) and she made that noyse that her bodie might be ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out of the graue in that Church, and laid in some other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon &amp; unhallowed place, which thing the Provost, &amp; some both of his and her friends, suspecting this to be a fraudulent trick of revenge, because they had not gotten their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted gaine at her death and buriall, they went to the King and desired the matter to be tryed, which being done before the Parliament of PARIS, it was at last found out and confessed; and the young Frier, with the first Devysers, who were <hi>Colimannus,</hi> and one <hi>Stephanus Atreba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis</hi> with their associats, were adjudged to be carryed to <hi>Orleans,</hi> where the fact was committed, and thereafter to bee brought foorth to the place where pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick execution is used upon Malefactors, and openlie there to confesse their fraud, and to be accounted thence-foorth infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for ever.</p>
            <p>Wherefore is it likewise but for gain? that the Pope ascribeth such wonders

So that the Pope cannot onlie work wonders himself, but as he pretendeth heere, can giue a constant vertue to a dead thing carryed about to do the like.</p>
            <p>But of all popish miracles this may be accounted the greatest lyeing wonder, which a priest daylie doth work by his whispering over a little piece bread fyve words of consecration, that he thereby immediatly turneth the same into the substance of Christs flesh and blood, and that thus Christs body is multiplyed in so many thousands of places at once, where the masse is said, and the creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Creator of his own creator.</p>
            <p>Next to come to these Fabulous fained wonders that are for confirmation of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, they are either fabled to be so by men, or if they be reallie wrought they
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43976:82"/>
are (as their own <hi>Biell</hi> heereafter decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth) by the operation of the divel.</p>
            <p>These then which are fabulouslie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by men, we haue one, whereof <hi>Platina</hi> maketh mention in the life of <hi>Sergius tertiꝰ,</hi> to confirme the great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that is due to the Pope, which was, that after <hi>Sergius</hi> the 3. had raised out of the graue the bodie of his predecessour <hi>Formosus,</hi> &amp; after beheaded him, as if he had beene alive, &amp; did cast his bodie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the river <hi>Tyber,</hi> as unworthie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian buriall, yet thereafter his bodie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caught into a net by some fishers, and brought to S. PETERS Church, all the Images that were there, bowed to him and did reverence.</p>
            <p>Another to confirme the reverence &amp; adoration that is due to the Hostie, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> telleth us in his third book of the Eucharist &amp; 8. Chapter of a hungrie Mare, who notwithstanding, the Hostie comming by, left her corne and turned her about to worship the Hostie.</p>
            <p>Another doth <hi>Gabriel Biell</hi> report, That some Shepheards in the field,<note place="margin">

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43976:83"/>
of consecration, the bread turned into flesh.</p>
            <p>Another to confirme the order of their Friers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is reported that S. Dominik had such power over the Devil, that hee forced him, when he appeared to him, by his conjuration: so long to hold his Lamp in his hand till it was consumed, and that the Devill was not onelie troubled there with,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Loc. com.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> but also greatly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. This their forecited <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> reporteth, and yet ingenouslie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his owne judgement thereupon, calleth it a thing that is most ridiculous.</p>
            <p>And more particularlie to come to such sort of miracles that are reported to have beene done in <hi>Rome,</hi> in a most ancient book (which I haue beside me) called <hi>Mirabilia Rome,</hi> printed at <hi>Rome</hi> by one <hi>Iohn Besicken,</hi> anno 1500. in the tenth yeare of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Church of <hi>S. Paull,</hi> at the right side of the Quire, it is reported that there standeth the Crosse which spake to <hi>S.

a noble Roman Ladie, named <hi>Galla</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived while shee was at dinner, sent down to her from Heaven for her great devotion. 3. In the Church of S. <hi>Alexiꝰ</hi> upon the hill called Aventine that the image of the virgin Mary which is ther, spake to the keeper of that Church much to the praise of <hi>Alexius.</hi> 4. That in S. Maries Church, is Her image, which spake to Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> saying, <hi>Why doest thou not of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Next whereas for confirmation of the worship of Images &amp; going to such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in pilgramage as <hi>Loretto,</hi> our lady of <hi>Hales,</hi> &amp; the like, sundrie miracles ar ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ruded to be believed to be wrought by them set down by <hi>Turselin</hi> the Iesuite. Their owne famous <hi>Gabriel Biell</hi> in his 49. lecture on the Cannon of the Masse speaketh thus. <hi>If at any time miracles be

            </p>
            <p>Of all these miracles then, that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be wrought by the Pope, or the Roman Church,, we may justly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere them in Augustins words, &amp; thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen treatise upon <hi>Iohn,</hi> saying. <hi>The Lord hath forewarned us of these who pretend mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, fortelling us that in these last dayes false Prophets shall aryse, working signes &amp; wonders that they may seduce (if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible the very Elect, &amp; that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shall be after the working of Satan, with all power or efficacie, and with signes &amp; lyeing wonders.</hi> So that how many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or wonders Romanists do alleadge for them, to prove them to be the true Church, with so many argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts do they furnish us against them, to prove their Church to be Antichristian, &amp; the Head therof to be that foretold <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
