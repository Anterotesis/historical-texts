            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

which I haue read vnto you.

Wherein (that <note place="margin">The text analysed.</note> I may now come to the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues) the present felicitie of all those that die in the Lord, is not onely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>viz.</hi> in these words, <hi>Bles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is, first, <hi>a voice from heauen,</hi> not only auouching this truth, but also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>Iohn</hi> to <hi>write</hi> it. Secondly, the testimonie of the spirit: <hi>Euen so, saith the spirit.</hi> The reason why those which die in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10666:5"/>
the Lord are presently happie, is, <hi>because they rest from their labours</hi> and molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <hi>their works</hi> (meaning the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed reward of their workes) <hi>follow with,</hi> or accompanie <hi>them.</hi> As if hee should haue said, They which die in the Lord are foorthwith happie, because death to them is the end of all miserie &amp; trouble, and the beginning of euerlasting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</p>
            <p>Now whereas the holy Ghost doth not onely deliuer this assertion, that <hi>the dead which die in the Lord are blessed,</hi> but is so carefull to countenance and prooue the same vnto vs, and well are wee to be assured, that his care is not superfluous; this is therefore an euident token, that men commonly in the world be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion, which is the cause why the holy Ghost saw it needfull not onely to deliuer this truth, but also to ratifie and confirme it.</p>
            <p>For first, men commonly account it a miserable thing to die; and naturally are so affraide of death, as to saue their liues they will not sticke to commit any sinne almost, as to denie Christ and his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10666:5"/>
religion, and to ioyne with Antichrist, and by their sinne to cast away their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious soules, which they would not doe, if they could be perswaded, that death brings happinesse with it.</p>
            <p>Againe, to die in the Lord, as it is here vnderstood with opposition, and not in the subiection and faith of Antichrist; not in the communion of the now apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staticall Church of Rome; of the Papists, who falsely tearme themselues Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, is counted a damnable thing; of the carnall and backsliding Gospellers, a more miserable thing, than to liue in the saith and subiection of Antichrist. That therefore wee may die willingly when God shall call vs, and may be readie to lay downe our liues for the testimonie of the truth, rather than to yeeld to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and generally may be more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to commit sin, than to suffer death; let vs remember what the holy Ghost saith, that <hi>blessed are those which die in the Lord.</hi> And let vs consider, that this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no humane inuention, or earthly deuice, but a diuine and heauenly oracle. For so saith Iohn, <hi>I heard a voyce from</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:10666:6"/>
               <hi>heauen.</hi> Many will say, If I might heare an Angell from heauen tell me that which you Ministers doe teach vs, as namely that to die in the Lord is an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie thing, assuredly I would beleeue it. If from heauen it were testified vnto me, that it is a blessed thing to die, not in the faith and communion of the Romish Church, but in the faith of Christ profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Churches reformed by the preaching of the Gospell, I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die than ioyne with the Church of Rome. And yet behold, this truth is not onely auouched by a voice from heauen, but also that (as <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh in the like case) we might haue <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>true;</hi> and being spoken and written, hath the testimonie of the spirit, that it is the vndoubted word of God. Such is the credit of the written word, that <hi>if an Angell from heauen</hi> should gainsay it, <hi>he</hi>

word, which is the most sure foundation of our faith; neither would he beleeue, <note place="margin">Luke 16. 31.</note> though an Angell should come from heauen, or a spirit from the dead. Satan <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 14</note> can transforme himselfe into an Angell of light, and take vpon him the person <note place="margin">1.

But the word of God cannot deceiue vs. Seeing therefore this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is pronounced by God from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and at his appointment is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the holy Euangelist to writing, and also hath the testimonie of the holy Ghost, who is the spirit of truth: Let vs therefore with all reuerence and good conscience hearken vnto it as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of God, and with the full perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of faith giue vnfained credit vnto it, as vnto the vndoubted word of the Lord; namely, <hi>that the dead which die in the Lord, are from thenceforth blessed because they rest from their labours, and their workes follow them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words three things are to be considered. First, who they are which be here pronounced blessed. Secondly,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10666:7"/>
what this blessednesse is, and wherein it doth consist, which is shewed in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>that they rest from their labours,</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly, when this blessednes belongeth to them: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith hee, <hi>from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,</hi> that is, forthwith and immediatly after their death, and so forward.</p>
            <p>As touching the first: <hi>Blessed</hi> (saith he) <hi>are the dead.</hi> What? the dead bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? A strange paradoxe no doubt to hypocrites and worldly men, who haue placed their felicitie in the fruition of temporall things, and put the day of death farre from them, fearing nothing more than to die, and hoping for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse, than to be blessed after death. But let vs remember that it is an oracle of God deliuered from heauen, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the holy spirit. From hence therefore let vs learne truly to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the immortalitie of the soule, and effectually beleeue, that there is a life immortall, after this mortall life is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And in this beliefe let vs be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full so to liue, as that we may hope after this life is ended, to be happie and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Neither let vs be so mad, as for the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10666:7"/>
momentanie fruition of temporall vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in this vale of miserie, to lose an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting inheritance in the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>But hee addeth, <hi>which die in the Lord.</hi> For not all that are dead are blessed; for many die out of the Lord Iesus and out of Gods fauour, as those which depart in the faith of Antichrist, or otherwise die in their sinnes, as in ignorance, infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, impenitencie, &amp;c. and they are so far from being blessed when they die, as that by their death their miserie is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely increased. But they are blessed <hi>which die in the Lord.</hi> Which words some vnderstand as spoken of Martyrs onely, and so reade them, <hi>who die for the Lords cause.</hi> And no doubt, if all they be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, who die in the Lord; much more may we assure our selues, that they which doe not onely die in the Lord, but also for him, are most happie and blessed. And this must encourage all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, as we are perswaded that the Lord hath laid downe his life for our sakes; so to bee most readie and willing to lay downe our liues for his sake, if it shall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10666:8"/>
please the Lord to vouchsafe vnto vs both that honour, as to be the Martyrs of Iesu; as also that fauour, as to make our death and afflictions, which otherwise all of vs must looke to suffer as chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for our sinnes, to be sufferings for righteousnes.</p>
            <p>But yet not onely such as die for the Lord, are here pronounced blessed; nor all they are blesled, who would seeme to die for the Lord, but all they and onely they who <hi>die in the Lord</hi> are blessed. For if any man dying for the maintenance of heresie shall think he dieth for the Lord, (as all in that case are readie to pretend) notwithstanding hee is not blessed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee doth not die in the Lord. For none are in him, but such as truly belieue in him, and none truly belieue in him, which doe not loue him and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for his sake. But they which die for heresie, as they doe not truly belieue in Christ, so doe they not truly loue his members; but by their heresie cut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from the bodie of Christ which is his true Church. For hs he that giueth his bodie to bee burnt and hath not loue, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 3.</note>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:10666:8"/>
(saith the Apostle) so hee that thinketh himselfe to be martyred, &amp; hath not true faith, it profiteth him nothing. And such is the state, as of all other heretikes, so especially of the Popish martyrs of these times, as they are esteemed among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For besides that they do not die for their religion properly, but for treason and rebellion, and it is not the punishment but the cause that maketh a Martyr; their religion also is Antichristian, being the Caholike apostasie, the common sewre of heresie, and the very mysterie of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. Neither doe they die in the cause or faith of Christ, but in the cause and faith of Antichrist; and therefore are the martyrs, not of Christ, but of Antichrist. The truth whereof none can denie, if this once bee prooued vnto them, which by our writings is sufficiently prooued, that Rome is Babylon, the Pope Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and the Papists such as haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the marke of the beast.</p>
            <p>Therfore not only they which die for the Lord, nor all they who would seeme to die for him, but as I said, all they, and only they which die in the Lord, as the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10666:9"/>
words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doe plainely signifie, are here by the voice of God from heauen, and by the testimony of the spirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced blessed.</p>
            <p>But let vs consider who may be said to die in the Lord, for this is the most materiall point in all this text. The like phrase is vsed 1. Thess. 4. 16. <hi>The dead in Christ.</hi> 1. Cor. 15. 18. <hi>They which are a sleepe in Christ.</hi> Which places being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of al the faithfull, do cuidently proue, that this phrase is not to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to Martyrs only, but generally to be extended to all true Christians. They therefore are said to die in Christ, who being in Christ, do so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd this life; or who being by a true saith ingrafted into Christ, doe in that faith depart this life. So that to this happines two things are required, first that we be in Christ, for else we cannot be said to die in him; the second, that we abide in him vnto the end, for else we do not die in him.</p>
            <p>But you will say, how can we be in Christ, seeing he is in heauen, and we on the earth? I answere, whosoeuer truly beleeueth in Christ, he is in Christ, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10666:9"/>
being in him is blessed. Heere therefore I am to shew two things, 1. That the faithfull be in Christ, 2. That their being in him is the ground of their happinesse. For there euery faithfull man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is a true member of the body of Christ, <hi>bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 30.</note> and consequently they are in him, and he in them, they being in him by faith, and he in them by his spirit. And they are not only in him, but also one with him, according to his prayer, Ioh. 17. For <hi>as the body is one, and yet hath many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and all the members though many are but one body, so is Christ. For by one Spirit we were all baptised into one body,</hi> namely of Christ, and by the same <hi>were all made to drinke into one spirit,</hi> viz. of Christ; that is, by the Spirit of Christ, we are in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme engrafted into the body of Christ, and in the Lords Supper vnited to his Spirit. 1. Cor. 12. 12. 13. As therefore there is an vnion betwixt the head of the natural body, and the members thereof, which be most remote from it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the vnity of the same soule, which being chiefely seated in the head, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10666:10"/>
also the feet; so is it in the mysticall body of Christ. For hereby, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>We know that we dwell in Christ, and he in vs, because he hath giuen vs of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> This therfore is my first reason: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is in the body of Christ, hee is in Christ; euery one that truly beleeueth in Christ, is in the body of Christ, as a liuely member thereof: therefore euery one that truly beleeueth in Christ, is in Christ. The like comparison our Sauiour vseth, Ioh. 15. where he saith that he is the vine, and the faithfull are as it were <note place="margin">Iohn 15. 2. &amp;c.</note> branches in him. As the branches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be in the vine, so the faithfull are in Christ.</p>
            <p>Againe, the Sacraments serue to this end, to assure the faithfull that they be in <note place="margin">2</note> Christ. For by the one we are baptised into Christ, that is, by Baptisme ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into him, Gal. 3. 27. in the other, we <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 3. Gal. 3. 27.</note> eate his body, and drinke his blood which whosoeuer doth, he is in Christ and Christ in him, Ioh. 6. 56. both whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 56.</note> are plainely testified by the Apostle i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the place euen now cited. For (saith h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But what need I other proofes, seeing <note place="margin">3</note> the holy Ghost in the Scripture plainely affirmeth that the faithfull be in Christ? as 1. Cor. 1. 30. <hi>You</hi> (saith the Apostle to the faithfull) <hi>are of God in Christ.</hi> And it <note place="margin">1.

In the 8. to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, when he would signifie that the faithfull are forced from damnation, he saith, <hi>There is no condemnation to them which he in Christ Iesus.</hi> When he would signifie that the faithfull are also rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, he saith, <hi>Whosoeuer is in Christ, he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>is a new creature.</hi> And finally, as the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are here said to die in Christ, so else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where they are said to liue in him, and he in them: 2. Tim. 3. 12. Gal. 2. 20. <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 12 Gal. 2. 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The vse which we are to make hereof, is two-fold, the one of instruction, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of comfort. For seeing the faithfull are in Christ, it behoueth all them who would seeme to bee true Christians, to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10666:11"/>
behaue themselues as becommeth those which are in Christ, gouerned and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his spirit according to his Word. For this we are to know, that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (I meane especially such as be noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious offences) of such as be, or would seeme to be in Christ, do redound to the dishonor of Christ our head. For as we seeme to haue communion with him (which in sinful actions indeed we haue not, but are then affected as members of the naturall body benummed with the palsie, which though they haue vnion with their head, yet haue not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of sense and motion, deriued to them from the head) but I say as wee seeme to haue communion with him; so we seeme to draw him into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowship of our sinne, which is horrible to be thought. When as therefore we are incited or allured to the practise of sinne, let this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion restraine vs. For seeing wee professe our selues, our soules and bodies to bee members of Christ, let vs say with the Apostle, <hi>Shal I take the member of Christ; and make it the member of a harlot? G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 15.</note>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:10666:11"/>
               <hi>forbid.</hi> And so for other sinnes, shall I defile the member of Christ with idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and make it a member of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ? or shall I pollute the member of Christ, with drunkennesse, with theft, with blood, with witchcraft, &amp;c. and make it (as much as in me lieth) a limbe of the diuell? God forbid.</p>
            <p>The comfort which all the faithfull are from hence to reape, is that comfort of all comforts, namely that they are in Christ; and consequently are so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of themselues, as being in Christ. I say againe, that all they, who embrace the mercies of God in Christ, and doe lay hold vpon him by a true and a liuely faith, are to bee assured that they are in Christ: and consequently that they are in the fauour of God, and accepted of him in Christ as righteous, and in Christ adopted as the children of GOD and heires of eternall life. Many not well considering this point, doe greatly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the faith, either of others, or their owne. Of others, as namely they, who halting betweene vs and the Papists, do affirme, that whiles we consider the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10666:12"/>
of God and merits of Christ, wee haue cause of assurance, as the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants teach; but when wee looke into our selues, wee haue iust cause to doubt according to the doctrine of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. But I answere, if we looke into our selues, as we are in our selues, considered a part from Christ; the best of vs all shal haue iust cause, not onely to doubt, as the Papists teach, but also to despaire. Yea, it were presumption for a man in that case, to make but a doubtfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it. But although we are to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the conceit of our owne vilenes, and are not onely to doubt, but also to despaire of saluation in our selues, wee being not considered as in Christ: yet this hindreth not, but that wee may and ought to be assured of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>in Christ. For though wee be sinfull in our selues, yet are wee the righteousnes of God in Christ: though in our selues wee haue broken the law, and are therefore sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the curse thereof; yet in Christ we haue fulfilled the law, and are freed <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> from the curse: though in our selues we are the children of wrath, and seruants <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 3.</note>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:10666:12"/>
of sinne; yet in Christ we are the children of God, and heires of eternall life. As <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 12. Rom. 8. 16.</note> therefore the faithfull most certainly be in Christ, so let them learne to conceiue of themselues as they be in Christ; that what cause soeuer they haue in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to doubt, they may in Christ as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure themselues of their iustification and saluation. Many a one that indeede be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth in Christ, doth himselfe wrong, by not thinking of himselfe, as hee is in Christ. For the more assured wee are of Gods loue in Christ, the more shall our heart bee enflamed with loue towards God, and our brethren for his sake; the more zealous we shall be of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the more cheerefull in his seruice. And that which is the happinesse of a Christian here wee shall leade our liues <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 13.</note> in the expectation of a better life. For the life, as it were, of this life mortall, is the assurance of life immortall.</p>
            <p>Thus you haue heard that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full be in Christ, and the vse which wee are to make thereof; now wee are to shew, that this being in Christ, is the ground of our happinesse. For it is not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10666:13"/>
our liuing, nor our dying in it selfe, that maketh vs happie; but our being in Christ whilest we liue, maketh vs happy, <hi>beatitudine viae,</hi> that is, with such a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse as in this time of our pilgrimage is incident vnto vs whilest we are in the way: and our being in Christ, when we die, maketh vs happie, <hi>beatitudine patriae,</hi> that is, with complete and eternal felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when we comming to the end of our way, doe arriue into the hauen of rest, and heauen of blisse, which is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and kingdom, which the Lord hath prepared for all those that be in Christ. Now that our being in Christ is the ground of all our happinesse, I shew it thus. For first, if we be not in Christ, we are in the state of damnation. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, the cause why any man is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from damnation, is, because he is in Christ. <hi>There is no condemnation</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> (saith the Apostle) <hi>to them that are in Christ Iesus,</hi> Rom. 8. 1.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If wee be not in Christ, wee are dead in our sinnes, neither can we do any thing (being out of him) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to a spirituall life. But being in <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 4. 5.</note>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:10666:13"/>
him, we liue in him, and he in vs a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> life which neuer shall haue end. For as in the vnion of the bodie with the soule, the bodily life consisteth: so in the vnion of the whole man with Christ, consisteth our spirituall life. And as the <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 12.</note> bodie seuered from the soule, is dead; so the whole man seuered from Christ, <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 6. Luke 9. 60.</note> is spiritually dead, how liuely or cranke so euer he may seeme to be, in respect of the bodily life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if we be out of Christ, we are altogether foolish in respect of spiritual things: yea, our wisedome is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God; we are in our serues vniust <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> and guiltie of sinne, vnholy and defiled with manifold corruptions: and laffly, in our selues are bondflaues of fin and Satan, but being in Christ, he is <hi>made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 30.</note> 
               <hi>vs of God, wisedome, righteousnes, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and redemption.</hi> For, being in Christ, wee haue communion with him, and he with vs. So that as our sinne was his by imputation, so is his obedience ours; he <hi>being made sinne for vs, that we</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 21. Col. 1. 24. Act. 9. 4.</note> 
               <hi>might be the righteousnes of God in him.</hi> And as his sufferings be ours, so ours be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10666:14"/>
his. But wee are not onely made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his merits to our iustification; but also being in him, we are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his graces vnto sanctification. For as the sacred oyle being powred on the head of the high Priest, who was a figure of Christ, rested not there, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended to his lower parts: so the oyle <note place="margin">Psal. 123. 2.</note> of grace wherewith Christ our head was annointed without measure, is from him deriued to his members. For <hi>of his fulnes wee doc all receiue, euen grace for grace:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 1. 16.</note> Ioh. 1. 16.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, being in Christ, we haue not onely communion with him in respect of his merits and efficacie; but also haue vnion with him, in respect of his person: wee being made one with him, and hee with vs; from which vnion, the asort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said communion doth proceede. And therefore in him, as our head, wee may truly be said to haue fulfilled the law: in him, wee haue satisfied the iustice of God: And that which is more; in him, are wee not onely risen againe, but also are ascended into heauen, <hi>and set in the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 6.</note> 
               <hi>heauenly places in Christ,</hi> Ephes. 2. 6. And
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10666:14"/>
               <hi>our life is hid with Christ in God</hi> Col. 3. 3. <note place="margin">Coloss. 3. 3.</note> Al which doe argue the assurance, which the faithfull ought to haue, of their iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, of resurrection vnto glorie, and of eternall life. For so long as the head is aboue the waters, the other members cannot be drowned: so, while our head is happie in heauen, the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his members is most sure and certaine.</p>
            <p>Lastly, being in Christ, we are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnited vnto him; but in him wee are also vnited to the whole Trinitie; and <note place="margin">1. John. 3.</note> being vnited vnto it, we shall haue with it euerlasting fellowship; in which fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship and fruition of God, perfect fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie doth consist.</p>
            <p>Thus haue you heard, that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are in Christ; and that all which bee in Christ, are happie and blessed. Now if we beleeue (as our dutie is) this vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted truth; namely, that al which by faith are in Christ be blested; then will we in our iudgements esteeme, and in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections desire to be in Christ, aboue all the things of this world. For what is our happinesse, that is esteemed and affected
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10666:15"/>
of vs as our chiefest good? If therefore this be our happinesse, to bee in Christ, then will wee, with the Apostle, esteeme all other things as drosse and dung, that <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8. 9.</note> hauing gained Christ, by a true faith, <hi>wee may bee found in him:</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly will we giue diligence, not onely in vsing the meanes, whereby wee may beleeue and be in Christ: but also in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering testimonies to assure vs, that we are in Christ by a true and liuely faith.</p>
            <p>The vse therefore which wee are to make of the former doctrine, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the blessed estate of those which be in Christ by faith, is two-fold. First, that we labour to be in Christ: the second, that we labour to know that wee are in Christ. As touching the former, wee are to performe two things. The first, that we vse the meanes to beleeue. Secondly, that wee doe beleeue. The ordinarie meanes of begetting faith is the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the word. For as the Apostle saith, <hi>Faith commeth by hearing the word:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17. &amp; 14.</note> and againe, <hi>How can they beleeue in him, of whom they haue not heard? and how can they heare without a Preacher?</hi> For what
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10666:15"/>
are Preachers, but Ministers by whom you doe beleeue? 1. Cor. 3. 5. who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 5.</note> they are by preaching the Gospel, the instruments of God for the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of faith in the elect, by which they are iustified, and adopted sons of God; are therefore said <hi>to iustifie men,</hi> and by <note place="margin">Deut. 12. 3.</note> the preaching of the Gospell, which is the immortall seed whereof <hi>Peter</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 15. 1. Pet. 1. 23.</note> 
               <hi>to beget men vnto God.</hi> If therefore there be no saluation but by Christ, and if we haue no part in Christ but by faith, and if we attaine not to faith ordinarilie but by hearing the word of God; this therefore must teach vs, as wee desire to be saued, so to be carefull and conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable hearers of the word of God, which <hi>is his power to our saluation.</hi> For how <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 16.</note> meanly soeuer carnall and worldly men esteeme of the preaching of the Gospel; notwithstanding it is the ordinance and <hi>good pleasure of God, by the foolishnes of preaching</hi> (for so men esteeme it) <hi>to saue</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>those that doe beleeue,</hi> 1. Cor. 1. 21.</p>
            <p>But our hearing must be mingled with <note place="margin">Hebr. 4. 2.</note> faith, or else it profiteth nothing. When as therefore the Lord in the ministerie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10666:16"/>
of the Gospell, doth not onely reueale and offer vnto vs his vnspeakeable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in Christ: but also by his embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours doth desire vs, that wee would be reconciled vnto him, and that we would accept of his mercie offered vnto vs in Christ, by receiuing him to be our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: we are not only in generall to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that hee is the only Sauiour of Mankind; but in particular, wee are to embrace the mercies of God offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in him, and receiue him as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, earnestly desiring in out hearts to be made partakers of his merits, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained resoluing in our minds to rest and rely vpon him, as our only Sauiour. He that thus receiueth Christ, is estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> of God (who accepteth in weake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christians their sincere desire to receiue Christ, and vnfained resolution to rest vpon him alone for saluation, for the deed it selfe, which is faith) he is estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, I say, to beleeue, and by this faith whereby he thus receiueth Christ, he is vnited vnto him. And howsoeuer as yet in the court of his owne conscience, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he is not iustified, being poore it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10666:16"/>
spirit, and hungring and thirsting after the righteousnes of Christ, which in his owne sense he doth not yet find impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him: yet notwithstanding in high court of heauen, he is as surely iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified before God, as by our Sauiour, Matth. 5. he is pronounced blessed.</p>
            <p>And if any man shal think it strange, <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 3. 6.</note> that so small a measure of faith should be effectuall to vnite vs vnto Christ, and to iustifie vs before God; let him consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that faith doth not iustifie vs as it is a qualitie, gift, habite, or worke in vs, or in respect of the worthines thereof; but only relatiuely, in regard of Christ the obiect, which it doth apprehend. In so much that <hi>Peter</hi> calleth the faith of all <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 1.</note> the faithfull, though vnequall in it selfe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is of equall value or price, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth alike iustifie; though all be not alike assured of their iustification. For the same righteousnes of Christ, which by a strong faith is apprehended to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, is also apprehended by a weake faith. For as the almes receiued by a feeble hand, doth as well relieue the partie, as that which is receiued by a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10666:17"/>
strong hand, and it is not the hand but the almes properly which doth relieue and as the brazen Serpent which was a figure of Christ, did heale those among the Israelites which listed vp their weake eyes towards it, as well as those which were quicke-sighted: so the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Christ being apprehended by a weake faith, doth as well iustifie the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer, as when it is receiued by a strong faith, so it is the righteousnes of Christ, which faith doth apprehend, and not faith it selfe which doth iustifie.</p>
            <p>But it will be said, faith is a full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, therefore he that hath not a full assurance, hath not faith. I answere, not all faith is a full assurance, but the strong and perfect faith. For a man must belieue in Christ, before he can be in Christ, or haue remission of sinnes by him. A man must haue remission of sinnes, before he is bound to beleeue it, and a man must beleeue it, and haue some measure of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, before he can haue the fulnes of assurance, which is not attained at the first.</p>
            <p>But you will say, faith is defined of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10666:17"/>
good Diuines to be a full assurance. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that they define it in the perfection of it: to teach vs, not to content our selues with the lesse degrees of faith; but to proceed from faith to faith, vntill wee come to that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or full assurance of faith.</p>
            <p>For this is the second thing which, as I said, wee are to labour for, namely to know and to be assured that wee be in Christ. And to this purpose wee are to performe two things. First, we are to trie our selues whether we be in Christ: and secondly wee are to giue diligence to make our being in Christ more sure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. As touching the former, it is the aduice of the Apostle, that wee should trie our selues whether wee bee in the <note place="margin">2. Cor. 13. 5.</note> faith. For many deceiue, both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with a vaine opinion, and others with a bare profession of faith. As first they, who haue not so much as the dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall or historicall faith, which is but <note place="margin">Hebr. 11. 6.</note> a degree towards a iustifying faith. For though a man may haue this generall or historicall faith, and yet want the iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith; yet a man cannot haue a iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10666:18"/>

faith, who hath not in some measure the generall or dogmaticall <note place="margin">Hebr. 11. 6.</note> faith. Now this generall faith consisteth of two things, knowledge of the word of God, and assent vnto it that it is true. First therfore, they who haue not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the principles of religion, are so farre from hauing a true iustifying faith; that they haue not so much as the first steppe or degree towards it. Therefore, though ignorant persons be most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to commend their faith, yet they are to know, whiles they continue in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, they are altogether voide of faith, and consequently of all grace, whereby they might hope to be saued. For without knowledge there can be n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> faith; and without faith there is no hope of saluation, or any other sauing grace.</p>
            <p>Againe, those which doe not giue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the whole word of God, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie part thereof, that it is true; are so f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from hauing the iustifying faith, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they haue not so much as the general or historicall faith, which the diue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> themselues are said to haue; as namely those which will beleeue so much of the <note place="margin">Iam. 2. 29.</note>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:10666:19"/>
Scriptures as they list, and no more then liketh them. For although the proper obiect of faith, as it iustifieth, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs vnto Christ, is Christ our Sauiour, or the promises of the Gospell concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning saluation by him; yet by the same faith, whereby wee are iustified, wee doe vndoubtedly beleeue the whole word of God and euery part thereof. The iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying faith euermore including and presupposing the generall and dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they haue not the true euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall faith who haue not also the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall faith, perswading them of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable and accursed estate in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, both in regard of their sinnes, as also of the punishments; which by the threatnings of the law, if they did truly beleeue them, they would acknowledge to bee due vnto them. Now, this legall faith, is a necessarie preparatiue to the iustifying faith. For vntill wee see our selues to be accursed in our selues, wee will not so much as desire seriously to be iustified by Christ. Vntill we find our selues to be bondslaues of sinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10666:20"/>
wee will not earnestly seeke to bee ransomed or redeemed. Vntill wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our selues to be the children of wrath, we will not seeke to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vnto God in Christ. In a word, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till wee finde our selues to be miserable in our selues, we will not seriously seeke and sue for the mercies of God or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ our Sauiour; but as much as in vs lieth suffer his precious blood to bee spilt in vaine, without any care to applie it to our selues. For what neede hast thou, either of a Sauiour, if thou art not in thy selfe lost; or of a Redeemer, if thou art not a captiue; or of a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, <note place="margin">Iohn. 8. 33.</note> if thou art not an enemie: or what need hast thou of mercie, if thou art not in miserie? <hi>The whole neede not the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> saith our Sauiour Christ, <hi>but the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 13.</note> 
               <hi>sicke.</hi> Well, thou euer hast had a good conceit of thy selfe, thou euer hast loued God aboue all things, and thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy selfe, thou neuer didst doubt of thy saluation in al thy life, &amp;c. an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent argument that thou diddest neuer care for Christ, or finde thy selfe to stand in neede of a Sauiour. But remember
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10666:20"/>
who saith, <hi>I came not to call the righteous,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 13.</note> (that is, such as bee righteous in their owne conceits) <hi>but sinners</hi> (that is, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled sinners) <hi>to repentance.</hi> And againe, that he came <hi>to seeke and to saue that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 11.</note> 
               <hi>which was lost,</hi> to preach <hi>the Gospell to the poore,</hi> namely in spirit, <hi>to heale the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 4. 18.</note> 
               <hi>broken hearted, to preach deliuerance or redemption to the captiues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore neuer perswade thy selfe that thou hast a iustifying faith, if thou doest not as well beleeue the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Law, as the promises of the Gospell. For although faith doth not iustifie, as it apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, yet that faith which doth iustifie, (including euermore the generall, and consequently the legall faith) doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the threatnings of the law as the vndoubted word of God. The same faith therefore, which doth assure thee of thy reconciliation, redemption and saluation in Christ, doth first informe thee, that thou art an enemie of God, a bondslaue of sinne, and vtterly lost in thy selfe; that being with the Publican <note place="margin">Luke 18. 14.</note> humbled in thy selfe, thou maist be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:10666:21"/>
Thirdly, they deceiue either them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with a fancie, or others with a shew of faith, who haue not an effectuall and liuely faith. For as there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold knowledge, the one a literall or speculatiue knowledge, the other spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and operatiue, and that knowledge is onely true which is working, 1. Ioh. 2. <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 3. 4</note> 3. 4: so there is a double faith, an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, vnfained, and liuely faith; and an idle, counterfeit and dead faith. Now, faith is said to be liuely and effectuall in two respects. First, <hi>respectu actus primi,</hi> in regard of the effectuall and true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. Secondly, <hi>respectu actus secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> in regard of the operation of it. In both senses every kinde of faith becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth effectuall by application of that which is beleeued. As first, the dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall faith is liuely and effectuall, when thou doest not onely beleeue in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall what God is; but by particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to thy selfe, doest beleeue that he is such a one to thee. As for example, if thou doest beleeue onely by a general and historicall faith, that God is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present, that is, in euery place present
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10666:21"/>
filling heauen and earth, and that hee is omniscient, and as the Scriptures call <note place="margin">Ier. 23. 24.</note> him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> knowing all things, yea the very secrets of mens hearts, and that by a most perfect and distinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; thou maist be little the better for this faith. But if thou doest beleeue with application to thy selfe, that he is euery where present with thee, and that his eyes be alwaies vpon thee, beholding all thy waies; then will this faith be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to make thee behaue thy selfe vprightly, as in his presence and sight, and so of the rest.</p>
            <p>The like may bee said of the legall faith. For a man may beleeue in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused and generall manner the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the law to be true, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the more bee humbled; but goe on securely in his sinne, and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his impenitencie and infidelitie, promise to himself impunitie. But when as a man applieth the threatning after this manner to himselfe: If this be true (as I vnsainedly acknowledge it to bee the vndoubted word of God) that euery one is in himselfe <hi>accursed and subiect to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:10666:22"/>
               <hi>eternall death</hi> and damnation, <hi>who hath not continued in all the things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them:</hi> how can it possibly be auoided, but that I am in my selfe a most accursed wight and damned wretch, who haue not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in all the things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them? nay, in steed of doing the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, I haue done the things forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; in steed of keeping all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, I haue broken them al diuersly and grieuously; in steed of continuing in a perpetual obedience, I haue continued in the breach of Gods commandements; as indeed vntill the time of a mans conuersion, he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nay hee can doe nothing else but sinne against God. Thus, by application, the legall faith becommeth effectuall, and thereby a man is humbled and brought to despaire of saluation in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, so that if hee would be saued, hee must seeke to be freed from the curse of the Law, and so bee forced to seeke for saluation out of himselfe in Christ; to which ende the Lawe is said to bee a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10666:22"/>
schoolemaster vnto Christ.</p>
            <p>The very same is to be vnderstood of the Euangelicall faith, or faith in Christ. For many there be (and they as it is to be feared are the greatest number) who are content to make profession of the Gospel, either because it is inioyned (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ready to embrace the religion of Antichrist, if authoritie should impose it vpon them) or because it standeth well with their outward respects, or to say the best of them, because it promiseth salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that beleeue; but rest in this outward profession of faith, without any speciall application of the promises of the Gospell, or apprehension of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ, without which it is not a true and effectuall faith, vniting vs vnto Christ, or iustifying vs in him. For it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee, that a man seeing by a legall faith, his owne damnable estate in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he should be said truly and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to beleeue the promise of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, which assureth saluation to all (though most wretched in themselues) that beleeue in Christ; who is not willing to receiue and embrace him as his Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10666:23"/>
desiring in his heart to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the merits of Christ, and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in his mind to rest and rely vpon him for saluation. For whatsoeuer either Papists, or they that are Popishly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, doe speake of this applying of the promises of the Gospell, and particular apprehending of Christ; it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that without it, faith doth not iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie vs before God, or vnite vs vnto Christ. For though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> sufferings of Christ, bee as a soueraigne salue to heale our <note place="margin">Esay 53. 5.</note> sores; though his body be meat indeed, and his blood drinke indeed, to feed our <note place="margin">Iohn 6. 55.</note> soules vnto eternal life, though his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes be as a wedding garment, to couer our nakednes, and to make vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God: yet his merits doe not cure our diseased soules, vnlesse they be applied; his body &amp; blood do not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish vs, vnlesse we spiritually eate his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and drinke his blood; neither doth the robe of his righteousnes couer vs, vnlesse we put it on. And surely if faith doth iustifie vs, as it is an instrument to apprehend Christ, who is our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in any other respect; then
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10666:23"/>
is it most certain, that it doth not iustifie, vnlesse it be such a faith as doth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the righteousnes of Christ, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the promise of the Gospell to our selues.</p>
            <p>Wee must therefore learne to applie the promise of the Gospel to our selues; which we may do after this manner. Is this true (as I acknowledge it to be the word of truth) that although I am by the sentence of the law, and testimony of mine owne conscience, an accursed wretch in my selfe, notwithstanding, I shall be happy and blessed in Christ, if I receiue him to be my Sauiour, and truly beleeue in him, (for in him I shall not only be acquited from the curse, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so intitled to the kingdome of heauen?) And doth the Lord in the ministery of the Gospell, which he hath vouchsafed vnto me, not only reueale the riches of his abundant mercy in Christ, and offer the same vnto vs; but also stirre vs vp to embrace his mercy offered vnto vs in Christ, and by his Embassadors earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire vs to be reconciled vnto him? I <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 20.</note> do therfore vnfainedly receiue the Lord
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10666:24"/>
Iesus, to be my sweete Sauiour, first, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desiring in my heart to be made partaker of his merits, (to which end I wil daily pray vnto God, that as he hath desired mee to accept of his mercy, and to be reconciled vnto him, so he would bee pleased to accept of the merits and obedience of Christ, as a full discharge for my sinnes, and that in him he would bee reconciled vnto mee, pardoning my sinnes, and imputing vnto mee the righteousnes of his Sonne) and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resoluing in my mind, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be my only Sauiour, and to rest vpon him alone, for my saluation, being perswaded that hee died for my sinnes, and rose againe for my iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus, by application, the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical faith becommeth effectual to vnite vs vnto Christ, and to iustifie vs before God. But as our faith must be effectuall, in apprehending Christ the obiect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, vnto iustification, so must it bee in some measure effectuall in the subiect, that is, the beleeuer, vnto sanctification.

            <p>The way then to die in Christ, is to liue in him by a true and vnfained faith, which purifieth the heart, and worketh by loue, walking vprightly, as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the members of Christ in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere profession of his faith; so shall we in the end of our life attaine to the end of our faith which is the saluation of our <note place="margin">1.

In all the Scripture there is but one example of a man who after a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">Luke 23.</note> life was conuerted at the houre of his death. One there is, that men should not then despaire; and but one, that they should not before hand presume. And forasmuch as nothing is either more certaine than death, or more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine than the time thereof; it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs carefully to prouide, whiles wee haue time, to be in Christ; that death, whensoeuer it commeth, may finde vs in him. Let our life be a preparation for death, and let this be the chiefest care of our life, that wee may be found in Christ at the time of our death.

Now are we in the second place briefely to consider, what this blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is, and wherein it doth consist. This is shewed in the words following, that they rest from their labours, and their workes follow with them.

in eternall and most perfect glory, and gladnes. The glory standing partly in the excellency of those heauenly gifts, wherewith they shall be adorned, being in respect thereof, like vnto the Angels, and renewed perfectly according to the glorious image of God, yea, made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Christ our head, in such a proportion of glory, as his seueral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <note place="margin">1.

            <p>In expectation of this happie hope,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10666:32"/>
we are to liue soberly, iustly, and holily <note place="margin">Titus 2. 13.</note> in this present world. For if wee set this ioy before, as the marke towards which we contend, we will not suffer our selues to be withdrawne from our obedience to God, neither by any worldly desires, which in comparison hereof, are to bee esteemed as meere vanities, nor by any terrors of the world, which, in respect of <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18.

that knew him, that hee was a sober, graue, discreet, frugall, temperate, and chast man. And as for his religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, first I say, though hee were borne in the time of Popery: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he hath professed vnto me, and to others in my hearing: that from his youth he hath been perswaded, that the Pope is Antichrist, and that he abhorred the Idolatrous superstitions, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doctrines of the Church of Rome; against both which I haue heard him by way of discourse inueigh seriously and to good purpose. But as hee was no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, so no neuter or nullifidian, which is too common a fault among the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of this world; but a professed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant and open professor of the true faith of Christ, that is to say, one that did <note place="margin">Reuel. 14. 1.</note> beare the marke of God in his forehead, as the faithfull are described in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this chapter. And this (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) was no small fauour of God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed vnto him.

            <p>Of his loue to other my brethren in the Ministery, the great concourse of Ministers at this present, to honor his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, is a sufficient euidence. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching my selfe, I do with thankfulnesse, acknowledge the greatnes of his loue manifested towards me diuers waies: wherein he may seeme to haue followed the graue aduise of the Greek Orator, in <note place="margin">Isocrates ad Daemonicu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <gap reason="foreign">

their slanderous speeches proue, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Beloued in the Lord, it is no small to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a member of Christ, when a man loueth the members of Christ, for their godlines and vertues sake.

            <p>I hasten to his cariage among men: and first, in his dealings, as a priuate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherein he was (I speake of his generall course) a strict obseruer of truth in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> words, of iustice in his deeds, of fidelity in his promises. But chiefely conside<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him, in the discharge of his calling
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10666:37"/>
For a mans calling is that sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath placed him, to exercise his faith and obedience, that therein hee may glorifie God, and doe good to men. Consider his priuate calling, as he was an housholder, or head of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. And therein acknowledge with me, his great loue and fidelity to his wife, his fatherly prouidence towards his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and nephewes: his great wisedome and care in gouerning his seruants, and preseruing them from those horrible vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (which as they be vsuall now adaies, in great families, so no doubt, will pull downe the fearefull iudgements of God vpon them) I meane swearing and swag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering: and finally, his goodnesse and bountie towards those, whom he found diligent, honest, and frugall.</p>
            <p>But his publique calling, as he was a Magistrate, and gouernour in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, doth now call me vnto it. Wherein, all (I doubt not) who did not mislike him for his iust seueritie, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst themselues, or such as were neere vnto them, wil freely acknowledge, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10666:38"/>
he was a very good Iusticer, and a very notable good Common-wealthes man, both for his sufficiencie and wisedome, (which was great) and also for his great zeale, and good affection towards his countrie; and couragious resolution, to shew himselfe forward in good causes. The truth whereof, if we did not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently see, whilest wee enioyed him: I dout we shall too well feele, by wanting him. And thus you haue heard of his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie, and gouernment of himselfe, of his faith, and religion towards God, and of his iustice &amp; charity towards men. In all which, you are not to vnderstand me, as though I went about to maintaine, that he had no infirmities, or that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer failed in any particulars: for alas, <hi>is many things we offend all;</hi> and highly i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And as these signes did shew, that he liued in the Lord: so the same added to his demeanor, in the time of his sicknes, will proue that he died in the Lord. I wil begin with his Christian charitie, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing those that had offended him, in giuing satisfaction to such as thought themselues wronged, in seeking to bee reconciled, with such as he might thinke did beare any grudge towards him, which being considered, together with the greatnes, both of his mind and state, will seeme no small argument of great Christianity. And herein he did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (as he had cause) the good proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God towards him, in giuing him occasion whilest he was aliue, and able to answere for himselfe, to cleare himselfe, (as to my vnderstanding hee did) of diuers imputations, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise might perhaps haue proued scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous after his death.</p>
            <p>No lesse commendable was his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian pietie towards God, shewing it

selfe in the time of his sicknes, not onely in the exercises of religion, as often hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word preached, receiuing the Sacrament more than once to assure him of his vnion and communion with Christ, daily inuocation of the name of God: but also in approouing his faith and patience, being by a long and sharp sicknesse so throughly tried. In respect whereof I may not forget his behauiour at two especiall times; the one a weeke before his death, when as his speech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from him, hee supposed the time of his dissolution to bee at hand. And therefore minding to prepars him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for death, he calleth by signes for inke and paper, and (as hee could) wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the names of diuers Ministers, and some other his faithfull friends, whom he would haue sent for, that they might bee both assistants vnto him by the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

comfort, he made a notable confession of his faith; which also he then sealed, by the receipt of the Sacrament. Againe, not long before his speech began to faile him the second and last time, hee deliuered (as many times hee had done before) diuers good and godly spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Among the former, I remember one argument which he vsed to comfort himselfe, <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> (saith he) <hi>who was my Sauiour, he and no other shall be my Iudge.</hi> Among the latter, and indeede one of the last that I could vnderstand, he professed his vndoubted faith &amp; assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hope of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but (as he said) <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting only to the mercies of God in Christ Iesus my Sauiour;</hi> and in that faith as we neede not doubt, he ended his life, or as the Scripture speaketh, he fell asleepe; for such indeede was the manner of his death. All which premisses being weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ballance of charitie, wee may bee bold to conclude according to the iudgement of charitie, that hee is in the number of those, whom the holy Ghost in this place pronounceth blessed.

Wherefore, though wee haue iust cause to mourne in respect of our selues, as namely his graue and vertuous Ladie, that the Lord hath taken from her so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and kinde an husband; his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, that they be depriued of so wise and prouident a grandfather; his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers, that we are berest of so good a friend; the countrie, that it hath lost so prudent and carefull a Iusticer, and so good a commonwealths man, as I said: but yet so, as that with meekenes and humilitie wee submit our selues to the gracious prouidence of God our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, giuing him leaue to call whom and when it pleaseth him: yet in respect of him wee haue little cause to mourne, but great cause to be thankfull vnto God for him: In that after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fauours which it pleased the Lord t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
