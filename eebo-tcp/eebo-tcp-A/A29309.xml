         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S you have been frequent in your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to God in our behalfe, ſo you may
look upon a wonderfull and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deliverance and victory, as a returne of
your prayers, for which I deſire ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
of thanks may be made, as ſhall be
thought fit for ſo great a mercy, which God gave us
upon munday morning, being <hi>Auguſt</hi> 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1644. Upon
Saturday evening intelligence came to <hi>Namptwich</hi> of the
enemies paſſing by us towards the King, and quartering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Whit church,</hi> whereof I met with the news at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
out of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> that day, where I had leave to meet
Sir <hi>John Meldrum,</hi> and the <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Gentlemen: And
my Horſe were not (ſince they had the fight at <hi>Tarvin</hi>)
returned hither, but were quartered about <hi>Middlewich.</hi>
Two or three of our Troops came not in, which made the
aſſault the heavier upon the reſt; which together with
ſome ſeven Companies of foote (whereof three or foure
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51220:3"/>
were of my owne Regiment, one of Collonell <hi>Brookes,</hi>
and the reſt of Collonell <hi>Duckenfeilds</hi> Regiment) mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
out of <hi>Namptwich</hi> upon Sabbath day in the evening
about ſix of the clocke, and came to <hi>Malpaſſe,</hi> the next
morning about ſpring of the day, where my Troope char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Enemy three or foure times, the other Troopes
which followed, not being able to come up in the narrow
lanes.</p>
            <p>The Enemy were judged to be about fortie Colours,
and betwixt two thouſand and three thouſand in number:
The Commanders thereof being many of them Papiſts,
(for this was the remainder of the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
ſometimes commanded by <hi>Goring</hi>) did fight and come
on very gallantly, but their Leaders never went backe
againe. There was in the Front of my Troope divers Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
who behaved themſelves very gallantly, as Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Collonell <hi>Jones,</hi> Captaine <hi>Zanchy,</hi> Captaine <hi>Finch,</hi>
Captaine <hi>Church,</hi> Lievtenant <hi>Burroughs,</hi> and divers others.
When wee came to the top of the hill, they diſcovered the
Enemy to ſtand in ſix or ſeven ſeverall bodies, or diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in very good order. But before this time wee had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
divers of their Colonells, and great Officers. It was
not thought fit to purſue any further, wee having beaten
two ſtrong parties of them, and followed them through
<hi>Malpaſſe</hi> Towne: Nor was it ſafe to engage an handfull
againſt ſo great a number; And we could not retreate
without apparent danger to have loſt all: Therefore it was
reſolved that wee ſhould ſtand in the mouth of the lane
till the foote came up to relieve them, which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Major <hi>Lanchane,</hi> and Lievtenant Collonell
<hi>Venables,</hi> which was accordingly done: But before the
foote came up, our Horſe were very much ſpent, having
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51220:3"/>
received three or foure freſh charges, by ſeverall freſh
Brigades or Diviſions, wherein was neither man, nor one
foote of ground loſt, but rather gained every charge; And
when the foote came up, they performed very good execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet were they all in danger to be ſurrounded by the
Enemy, who as they were ſufficiently ſtrong, ſo they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not opportunitie when God delivered up ſo many of
their Commanders into our hands, which were killed,
wounded, and taken priſoners, as will appeare by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed.</p>
            <p>Their common Souldiers upon the loſſe of ſo many of
their Commanders retreated, and wee were not able to
purſue them farre; But had wee had five hundred Horſe,
we might (by Gods bleſſing) have wholly deſtroyed this
Army; whereof there may be ſtill about two thouſand
remaining, which with the addition of Sir <hi>William Vaug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hans</hi>
Regiment, and Collonell <hi>Trevers,</hi> and the remainder
of the Princes Regiment of Horſe, they cannot be but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
three thouſand ſtrong. They were then upon their
march towards <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and ſo to the King; but fled
backe towards <hi>Cheſter;</hi> where they could not be admitted,
but were looked upon very ſcornefully, becauſe they were
beaten backe with ſo inconſiderable a number, which they
exceeded above ten to one.</p>
            <p>The enemy being ſtill an overmatch for us, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
they may force their paſſage to joyn with the
Kings Army; therefore it were much to be deſired that
what horſe and foot is intended us might be ſpeeded unto
theſe parts. It is uncertain where the Prince is, but ſome
ſay he is gone towards <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> ſome ſay towards the
King, but it is not known to very many in <hi>Cheſter.</hi> Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant

Captain <hi>Church,</hi> and others, ſhewed much courage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
