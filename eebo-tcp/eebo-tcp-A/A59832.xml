            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>2 COR. viii. 12.</bibl>
               <q>For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Occasion of these Words was this. The Christians of <hi>Judaea</hi> were at this time in great Want, by reason of a general Dearth, which was foretold by <hi>Agabus</hi> at <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 11. 28. <hi>And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit, That there should be great dearth throughout all the world, which came to pass in the days of Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Caesar.</hi> Upon this Notice, <hi>the Disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the Brethrem which dwelt in Judaea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that Contribution for the Saints which St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs them about, at the Conclusion of his first Epistle to them, Ch. 16. and this is what he inculcates on them in this and the following
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52280:5"/>
Chapter, but with so much Art and Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that though he uses the most powerful Arguments, yet he would not seem to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade, nor to think that they needed any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion; for it is not Honourable for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, whose Religion is Charity, to need such Persuasions and Importunities. They may be directed in their Charity, and put in Mind of such particular Charities, as are of the greatest Necessity, or the most present use, or have the most general Influence, or do the greatest Reputation and Service to Religion; or their Charity may be heightened, inflamed, and enlarged, by the Proper Arguments and Motives of Liberality; but their Religion teaches them to be Charitable, and the Name and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of a Christian is a Reproach to them without it: And this is all the Apostle aims at even in his soft and tender way of Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; not merely to persuade them to contribute to the Necessities of the Saints, which he knew they were willing to do; but that they should contribute liberally, with a free and chearful Heart, and open Hand; which is the sum of all his Arguments, as I shall shew you in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, if Time permit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52280:5"/>But the great Difficulty concerns the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Measures of a liberal and overflowing Charity. Our Saviour has prescribed no set Bounds and Proportions to our Charity; and it is thought as possible to be imprudent and excessive, as too frugal and sparing: We have many other Obligations upon us besides CHARITY; to provide for our own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Subsistence, to take Care of our Wives and Children, and to discharge all other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Offices according to our Station and Character in the World: All which ought to set Bounds to our Charity. But what these Bounds are, is thought the great Question, which is not easily answered: This is true; nor can any certain Measures be prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; nor does the Apostle pretend to it: But though there is a great Latitude in true Christian Charity, which does not consist in a Point, but admits of different Degrees and Proportions; yet the Apostle, in my Text, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us to such a Principle, as is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and safer than any stated Rules, because it will be sure never to sink below the just Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of Charity; and will render all we do, be it more or less, very acceptable to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52280:6"/>
God. <hi>For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he hath not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Words, I shall observe Three Things, which are expressed, or necessarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in them. <hi>First,</hi> That a great Readiness and Forwardness of Mind, to do Good, is the true Spirit of Charity; which gives Value and Acceptation to all we do. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Readiness of Mind to do Good, to Relieve the Necessities of those who want, will observe the just Proportions of Giving, will give <hi>according to what a man hath:</hi> as is necessarily implied in the Words; for if a willing Mind be accepted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what a man hath, it is, because it gives according to what a man hath. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That where there is this Willing Mind, with a fitting Proportion according to our Abilities; whether it be more or less, which we give, it is equally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God. Such a Man <hi>is accepted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he hath, not according to what he hath not.</hi> I shall speak as briefly as I can to each of these, that I may not be prevented in such an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, as is proper to this Solemnity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52280:6"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> That a great Readiness and Forwardness of Mind (for so <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies) to do Good, to relieve the Necessities of those in Want, is the true Spirit of Charity, and gives Value and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation to all we do. Such a Willingness of Mind, when <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is the Principle and first Mover in all our Charitable Actions, is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> very acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>This, I think, I may take for granted; for what is the Grace and Vertue of Charity, but a Charitable Inclination, Disposition, Temper, Habit of Mind? And what is this but a Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Forwardness to do Good? Our Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Passions are the Principles of Action, and therefore have a natural Tendency towards their proper Acts and Objects, and will act when they have the Power and Opportunity of Action: Charity is Love, the Love of Pity and Compassion to the Miseries and Sufferings, and Wants of our Brethren; and Love in all other Instances is a very restless active Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and so will our Love to the Poor and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable be, if it be Inclination and Habit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52280:7"/>There is no man but will pretend to be very ready and willing to do Good, though he never does any: For to have no Inclination to do Good, is so Infamous, that those who do no good, are ashamed to own it; but to do no good, is a Plain Evidence against them, when nothing can hinder them from doing Good, but the want of Will and Inclination to do it; when God has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished them with the means of doing Good, and there are thousands of Objects to exercise their Charity, and to move their Pity, if they had any. The Will is accepted for the Deed, both by God and Men, when it is not in our Power to do that Good which we sincerely desire to do, and which we would certainly do, were it in our Power; but it is to mock both God and Men, to pretend a Willingness, when it is visible to all the World, That a Will to do Good is the only thing we want. But such a Readiness and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness of Mind as is Active and Vigorous, as contrives and lays Designs of Charity, or embraces such as are offered, and takes all wise Opportunities of doing Good, this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acceptable to God, as being the most Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and God-like Temper, the Image of his own Goodness, and the noblest Exercise of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52280:7"/>
our Love to Men, inspired with the Love of God. Now in Moral Actions it is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that gives the Value; not so much the Gift, as the Mind of the Giver; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That though <hi>we give all our goods to feed the poor, and have not charity, we are nothing.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. God can feed the poor without us, if he so pleases; but as for several other wise ends of Providence, so he has ordered, That <hi>the poor shall be always with us</hi> for the trial and exercise of our Virtue, but the Virtue is not the Gift, but the Charity. And could we perform all the Acts of Charity without a charitable Mind, the World might be better for it, but not we our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> This readiness and forwardness of Mind to do good will observe the just proportions of Charity, will give <hi>according to what a man hath.</hi> I observed before, That our Saviour in his Gospel hath prescribed no fixt Measures nor Proportions of Charity: Nor could he reasonably do this, considering the nature of Charity; which though it be not so absolutely free, that we may chuse whether we will be charitable or no (for charitable we must be at the peril of our Souls); yet the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions must be free, or it is not Charity, but a Poors rate, as all the positive Laws, which God
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52280:8"/>
gave the <hi>Jews</hi> for the relief of the Poor, were no better; and therefore, by the wiser <hi>Jews,</hi> were never placed to the account of Charity, but of Justice, and a Legal Righteousness: Which is the very distinction St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes between a <hi>righteous</hi> and a <hi>good man,</hi> Rom. 5. 7. <hi>But scarcely for a righteous man will one die, yet peradventure for a good man one would even dare to die. A Righteous man</hi> is one, who is legally Righteous, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves what the Law requires; but a Good man is one who is acted by a free, unconfined and generous Goodness.</p>
            <p>Now upon this pretence, That there is no proportion assigned to Charity, there are to<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

few men living, but know in some measure what Charity means: And though they may dispute how much they ought to give, yet certainly know, that they ought to give; and that to give nothing, or what is next to nothing, all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances considered, is not Charity.</p>
            <p>A Charitable Temper and Disposition of Mind is an indispensible Duty, and the most Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Part of the Christian Religion. This our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour commands; and he need command no more, for Charity is and will be a Rule and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to it self. Where this Divine Principle is, it will teach us when, and how, and in what Proportion to give: The Sun needs no Rules and Directions how to communicate its Light and Heat. Nature is the surest and most infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rule, and Law to it self; and thus it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably in Moral as well as in Natural Agents. For what is the immediate effect of Nature and Life, can never be taught without its Principle; cannot exceed its Principle, and cannot fall below it. All the Rules in the World can never teach that man Charity, who wants the Principle; a Charitable Mind needs no Rules, but turns natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally on its own Byas; which will direct its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions right.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52280:9"/>There is a great difference indeed between Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Moral Agents. Natural Agents are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily determined to some one End, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have but one Principle, which uniformly and steddily pursues the Ends of Nature; but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Agents, as they act freely, so they have many different Principles, Inclinations, and Passions, which stint and limit each other; that none of them can act to their utmost Vigour, but as they are mutually poized and ballanced: And this is the Work of Reason and Religion, to put them into their Natural Order, and to set just Bounds to them; and that proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the degrees of their Activity and Strength; but yet every Principle, unless violently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, will act according to its Nature, as it more or less prevails. And this gives Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and Proportions to all our Actions; as to shew you this in our present Case.</p>
            <p>Charity is that Love to Mankind which makes us pity all their Wants and Sufferings, and inspires us with a great Zeal and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to Help and Relieve them. If you enquire, What the Natural Measure of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is? I know no other Natual Measure, but its Natural End, that is, To relieve all that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and are in want; for that is what Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52280:9"/>
would do, and what all Charitable Men heartily wish that they could do. Well! but this is impossible, for there are too many miserable People for any man to Relieve them all. This is true, and Want of Power must of Necessity set Bounds to our Charity; but since we cannot Relieve all, we must relieve such as we can; and wisely consider where the greatest Necessities, and greatest Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations are: Which will give the Preference to Christians before Infidels; to Good Men before the Wicked; to God's Poor, whom the Divine Providence has made Poor, to the Poor of their own Making, whom Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Luxury, and Vice have made Poor and Miserable. Well! But how far must we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve these Poor? Must we give as long as we have any thing to give, and make our selves the Objects of Charity? By no means! There are other as Natural Principles as Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which must set Bounds to it. Self-Love is a Natural and Necessary Principle; no man is bound to love any man better than himself: To love our Neighbour as our selves, is all that the Gospel it self makes our necessary Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; though some Great and Generous Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, and Divine Charities, may go further,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52280:10"/>
as far as concerns this Life. Next to Self-Love, our Natural Affection for our Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren must take place, as ingrafted in it, and thought the Best and the Dearest Part of it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearest to our selves, and what the best men are the most tenderly concerned for. And this is the chief thing, which among men of any Principles, disputes the Bounds of Charity: For as for those stupid Brutes, who love Money on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to look on, or to count their Bags and Securities, without suffering themselves, or any Body else, to use it, they are not fit to be named: For I can hardly reckon them among reasonable Creatures. But men's Care of themselves, and of their Wives and Children (not to descend at present to other Relations, which may come within the compass of Charity, though of a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more sacred Obligation) is thought a very Prudent and Reasonable Consideration in this Case, and indeed is so; for there is a great deal o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Truth and Reason in that common Saying rightly understood, That <hi>Charity begins at Home</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Controversy then is between ou<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Love to our Selves, our Wives and Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Charity to the Poor. Now there is no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, but the first must have the Preference; but yet Charity to the Poor must have its Place also
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52280:10"/>
And then the only Question is, In what Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this must be? And that is a very hard Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, if you put it in Arithmetick, for I can name no Proportion; nor has our Saviour thought fit to name any: But, as I observed to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, True Charity will assign a just Proportion to it self: For a true Charitable Mind will spare what it reasonably can, and never below the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Charity; and will spare more or less, according to the Degrees of its Charity. I must be forced to represent this in short to you, that I may not be tedious.</p>
            <p>That Love we have for our selves, and for our Natural Dependents, will generally secure us against exceeding the Proportions of Charity, that there is seldom any Danger on that side. On the other hand, if we have a true Charitable Mind and a sincere Compassion for the Sufferings of others, we shall certainly do what we our selves, considering our Circumstances, and what all Charitable men who know our Circumstances, will call Charity. But then, the more Intense and Fervent our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is, this will still increase the Proportion, and sometimes to such Heights, as can hardly escape the Censure of Affectation and Folly: And were it not for the Interposition of the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, might sometimes prove very fatal to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52280:11"/>
and their Families. As to give you the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this in short; There are Two things ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary to dispose men to Give Liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: A just Sense of the Miseries of others; and a true Judgment of our own Abilities.</p>
            <p>As for the First:</p>
            <p>A Charitable Mind is very easy to receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Charity; and the more charitably it is disposed, still the more easy. Every pitiable Object moves and affects such men, and they are no more able to resist the Silent Oratory of meager Looks, naked Backs, and hungry Bellies (were they not sometimes harden'd by Cheats and Vagabonds) than to deny themselves what is necessary to Life: Much less can they deny any known and unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Charity; for since Charitable they are, and Acts of Charity they will do, they are very glad to know how to dispose of their Charity, to do that Good which they intend by it. A Soft and tender Mind, which feels the Sufferings of others, and suffers with them, is the true Temper and Spirit of Charity; and Nature prompts us to ease those Sufferings, which we feel: This makes us so ready to supply our own Wants, because we have a quick and smart Sense of them; and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sympathy and fellow-feeling of Charity, will proportionably incline us to relieve our suffering
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52280:11"/>
Brethren, when we feel in our selves what it is they suffer. An inward Principle is more powerful than all external Arguments; and Sense and Feeling is this Principle; and Charity is this Sense.</p>
            <p>Thus, as for Proportions, a Charitable Mind sets no other Bounds to its Charity, but only Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; that the only Question is, Whether we can spare any thing from our selves and Families? and what we can spare? Now when Charity is the Judge of this, it is always a favourable Judge on the side of the Poor and Miserable, and always the more favourable Judge, the greater the Charity is: It will teach us to think, That we want less, and consequently can spare more, when we consider how much others want: At least it will teach us to abate of what we do not want; of all Idle and Superfluous Expences; of all needless Pomp and Ceremony, which is more than our Station and Character requires; and it is incredible to think what an inexhausted Fund this would be for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Did we truly estimate our own Wants, recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our Expences, and set just Bounds to our Desires, many of us would soon find, that we have a great deal to spare: And nothing will so effectually do this, as Charity; and therefore Charity is the best Rule and Measure to it self. So that there is no great occasion to dispute Proportions; let us learn
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52280:12"/>
to be Charitable, and Charity will teach us what to give. Every man can tell when another is Charitable; and a Charitable man man can tell when he himself is so; and as our Charity increases, so we shall abound in the Fruits of Charity; for the more we love, the more liberally we shall give.</p>
            <p>This is not to leave what we will give to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Uses, to our own free Choice, as a Trial of our Ingenuity, as some represent it: For had this been the Case, there should have been some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion fixt, less than which we should not give, though we might give as much more as we pleased; for otherwise nothing is matter of strict Duty, but all is left to Ingenuity; which is so far from being true, that there is not a more necessary Duty in all Religion than Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and even the greatest Degrees and Heights of Charity, are all Duty: For we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be Charitable, and to aim at the highest Degrees of Charity; and the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of giving is referred to the Principle, and included in the Degrees of Charity; such a Proportion as such a Degree of Charity will give, is as much a strict Duty as such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Charity is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52280:12"/>The very nature of Charity proves that thus it is, and that it can't be otherwise. For meerly to give, or not to give; to give more or less, is no certain proof of a charitable, or uncharitable Man; how liberally soever we give, we are not charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unless we give from a principle of Charity, and our Charity be as great as our Gift. So that had God prescribed how much every Man must give to the Poor, they might have observed this proportion of Giving without any Charity, and then such Gifts as these had been no acts of Charity, when the Gift and the Charity was parted: But a charitable Man will give, and will give in proportion to the degrees of his Charity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Charity; and the encrease of Charity is the only proper object of Command; for he will give liberally, who loves much; and the proportion of giving is commanded in the degrees of Charity, which alone can prescribe, and will observe a just proportion.</p>
            <p>Let no man then inquire, how much he must give; the proper inquiry is, how much he must love. Let no man satisfie himself with some small trifling presents, which bear no proportion to what he has, upon pretence that God has prescribed no proportion of giving; but let him ask himself, Whether, in his own Conscience, what he gives,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52280:13"/>
bears any proportion to that love and charity to the poor and miserable, which God requires: and let him remember, that though God has not fixt the proportions of giving, he requires great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Charity; and though Men may give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally without Charity, yet not to give in some due proportion, is a certain sign of want of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when there wants no ability to give.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to observe by the way, that what I have now said of Charity, is true of all other Christian Graces and Vertues; that it is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which both must and will give laws and measures to the external acts of such Graces and Vertues: As to instance at present only in the Acts of religious worship, the measures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of which are as much disputed, and no more determined and limited by the laws of our Saviour, than those of Charity: We are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to fast, and pray, and to communicate at the Lord's Table, and to read and meditate on the Holy Scriptures, and such other acts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but we are not told, how often we must fast and pray and receive the Lord's Supper, nor how much time we must spend in our publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotions; or though all the publick Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Religion must be regulated by the publick Authority of the Church; which as to time and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52280:13"/>
place, and other external circumstances, is the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest rule; yet our private Devotions are free, and both publick and private Devotions have a great latitude; and thus as it is in the case of Charity, some men think, they can never spend time enough in the publick and private Exercises of Religion; and others think a very little will serve the turn, and any trifling pretence is sufficient to excuse them from their Closets, or the Church, and especially from the Lord's Table.</p>
            <p>And the resolution of this is the same, as in the case of Charity; We are commanded to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Worshippers of God, and the true spirit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion naturally prescribes the external measures and proportions. Devout minds, who have a true sense of God, and of their constant dependence on him; That they owe all temporal and spiritual Blessings to him, and daily need the pardon of their Sins, the protection of his Providence, and the supplies of his Grace, will never fail to worship God, whom they inwardly reverence and adore; and as our devout sense of God encreases in strength and vigour, the external expressions of devotion will be more frequent, more lively and affecting; for nature will exert it self, and will exert it self in proportion to its strength and vigour. But to return.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52280:14"/>3. The third thing I proposed, I must at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent wave; that where there is a willing mind, with a fit proportion, according to our abilities, (which, as you have heard, there will be, where there is a truly willing and charitable mind) whether it be more or less, that we give, it is equally acceptable to God. Such a man is accepted according to what he hath, not according to what he hath not: and indeed there is no great occasion to insist on it; for it is self-evident, that God will not exact that from us, which we have not.</p>
            <p>Only we must observe, that this does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse any man from Charity, though he have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to give; he must have a willing charitable mind to make him accepted; nor does it excuse those from Charity, who have but little to give, for they must give according to what they have: nor does it excuse those, who have nothing to give, from other acts of Charity, which require the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing, and a great many such acts of real Charity there are, which poor people may do for each other, though they have not a penny in their purse.</p>
            <p>But it is time now to turn my Discourse to the proper business of this great Solemnity. Publick Charities are always reckoned amongst the greatest Ornaments of any Country, and make up the most
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52280:14"/>
lovely and charming part of their Characters: Stately and magnificent Buildings shew great art, and great riches, and a gallant and noble genius, but great Charities have something divine, and strike the mind with a religious veneration. There may be much more magnificent shows, than this day's procession, but none which affect wise and good men with a sincerer pleasure: To follow a great number of Orphans, in the mean, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Dress of Charity, singing the praises of God, and praying for their Benefactors, is beyond all the <hi>Roman</hi> Triumphs, however adorned with a pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous equipage, and great numbers of royal slaves.</p>
            <p>These present us with nothing but the miserable spectacles of spoil and rapine, the uncertain chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and vicissitudes of fortune, the lamentable fate of conquered Princes and People, and the pride and insolence of Conquerors; but here are the triumphs of a generous Goodness and divine Charity, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs without blood and spoil, without slaves, and captives, unless redeemed slaves, rescued from the jaws of poverty, and all the injuries and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of a ruined fortune: that to me this great City, and this honourable Train, never looks greater than in this humble pomp. A pomp not for vanity and ostentation, but to endear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52280:15"/>
Charity, by shewing the visible and blessed fruits of it: and to the same end, I must give you an account of the present state of these publick Charities.</p>
            <div type="report">
               <head>
                  <hi>The REPORT</hi> was here Read.</head>
               <p>THat these are all great Charities, I need not tell you; indeed all so great, that it is hard to know, to which to give the preference, and what occasion all these Charities have of fresh, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral, and constant supplies, <hi>the Report</hi> acquaints you.</p>
               <p>But I cannot pass over one thing I observe in <hi>this Report,</hi> and which, I fear, many necessitous people feel, that there have been no <hi>Orphans</hi> taken into <hi>Christ's Hospital</hi> this Year, nor, as I remember, for two Years last past. I do not mention this by way of reflexion, as any fault in the administration and government, but to put you in mind, how much that excellent foundation needs your supply; and though I do not love to compare Charities, they being all of great use and necessity in their kind, yet I think this foundation has something to plead for it self beyond any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:52280:15"/>A helpless age, destitute of friends, and all means of support will plead for it self without saying any thing: it is a pitiable sight to see poor innocent Children turned helpless into the wide World to starve, or beg, or steal, or to suffer all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difficulties and necessities at home: without education, without government or discipline, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being used to labour, or taught any honest way of living; which, as they grow up, improves into a habit of idleness, and that betrays them to all degrees and kinds of wickedness, trains them up to the Gallows, or fills our other Hospitals with vagrant and miserable people.</p>
               <p>There is nothing, which all wise Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths have been more concerned for, than the education of Children, which proves a great sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and gives great ease and security to any go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by breeding up usefull members of it: So that this is a Charity, which would in a great measure make some other Charities less need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and it is certainly a greater Charity to prevent the miseries of mankind, than to relieve them.</p>
               <p>This is a Charity, wherein every member of this great City, is most nearly concerned, because they and no others have a right to it. It is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52280:16"/>
for their posterity, against all the sudden strokes of fortune, which no man can be secured from; Here it is, that families, which are unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly ruined by the uncertain chances of trade may be raised again by Charity; at least, by that vertue and industry, which their education teaches them, and those fair advantages, with which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their several capacities they are placed in the world; they have a new opportunity given them of trying a better fortune, or rather, a more propitious providence. So that every Citizen is concerned to promote and enlarge this Charity, because no man knows who shall want it, if not for his Children, yet for his Grand-children, or remoter descendents; and possibly to men, who are sensible of the uncertain changes of the World, and have a religious reverence for the divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, it would be no mean argument to promote this Charity, were care taken, that the Descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Benefactors, if ever they should want this Charity, should certainly have it.</p>
               <p>It is certainly for the honour of this great City to make the best provision it can for the Children of unfortunate Citizens; and those on whom provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has smiled, while they have seen their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours shipwrackt by such unaviodable accidents,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52280:16"/>
as no prudence or conduct could escape, cannot make a more proper acknowledgment of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodness than this.</p>
               <p>I shall add but one thing more of this nature. This is the only Charity, which is most likely to raise a fund of Charity: Among such great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as have their education in this place, there have been, and we may reasonably hope there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways will be, not a few, who will raise their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in the World, and remember, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was Charity. I'm sure, such men ought to do so, and then such an Hospital as this, may help to support and enlarge it self, and in time raise new Hospitals, for new Colonies of Charity.</p>
               <p>But while I plead for <hi>Christ's Hospital,</hi> I would not be thought to divert the whole current of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity into this one channel; as things now are, there is absolute necessity of other Charities: the sick, diseased, and maimed, are great objects of Charity, especially Souldiers and Sea-men, who venture their lives, and lose their health and their limbs in the service of their Country, to defend our fortunes, liberties, lives, and religion. There is none of us, but would think it a very poor recompence for the loss of health and limbs to be cured upon Charity;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52280:17"/>
it is certainly the least that we can do for them; so very little, that if it be charity to do it, it is barbarity to deny it, and that is but a very small degree of charity, which is but one remove from barbarity itself.</p>
               <p>As for other sick, and diseased, and lame peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who cannot be at the charge of a Cure, where sickness, disability, and poverty meet, this makes them double objects of charity, especially, as it often happens, when these disabilities fall upon the industrious, who before supported themselves and their families by honest labours, without cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Nay as for those, who may be justly thought the least objects of charity, the wicked and vicious, who reap the deserved fruits of their own wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, I am sure, they are the objects of the greatest pity, because this life will not end their miseries; and if we can prolong their lives here to save their souls, it will be charity indeed, and what effect the sense of their wickedness and sufferings, and the Grace of God, may have upon them, no man can tell.</p>
               <p>As for distracted Persons, I believe, no man, who considers, what a blessing reason and understanding is, and what a misery the want of it is, can think
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52280:17"/>
of them without the most sensible compassion: I think, all other evils whatsoever, are to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before it; and therefore to restore them to their senses again, which we hear by the blessing of God is often done, or however to keep them from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves, or others any injury, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve human nature from that contempt, which such publick spectacles expose it to, is a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Charity.</p>
               <p>Now all this shews, that a charitable man need not be at any great loss, how to dispose of his Charity; here are too many very proper objects of Charity, (if God so pleased) and we ought to be very thankfull to God, that we our selves are not in the number, for <hi>it is more blessed to give, than to receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then the great numbers of miserable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who in several kinds want our Charity, is a very powerfull argument to greater liberality and bounty. For this I must add to what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready said concerning the measures and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Charity; that a truly charitable mind will encrease its proportions according to present wants; will sometimes abridge itself even in the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of life to supply great and pressing necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for a great love will not only spare, what
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52280:18"/>
it easily can, but when there is great reason for it, will deny it self to do good.</p>
               <p>And here I intended to have represented to you our Apostles arguments for a liberal and bountifull Charity: but, I fear, I have already too much trespassed; and where there is a willing mind, so many and so great objects of Charity, are themselves very pressing arguments. And therefore as the Apostle endeavours to inspire his <hi>Corinthians</hi> with an holy Emulation of the zeal and forwardness of the Churches of <hi>Macedonia, how that in a great trial of affliction, the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their joy, and their deep poverty, abounded unto the riches of their liberality;</hi> so I shall only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to emulate the great Examples of past and present times, and that you would set as great Examples for times to come. If any thing deserves our emulation, great and generous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities do, which are a resemblance and imitation of the divine goodness, than which nothing can more endear us to God or Man: We owe all our present foundations to Royal Bounty and private Charities; and thanks be to God, our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age, as bad as it is, is not without some great Examples; and though true virtue is void of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52280:18"/>
pride, and vanity, and envy, and jealousies of earthly Rivals, yet it fires at great Examples, and is ashamed to be out-done by Equals in love to God or Men; Especially when the honour of the Church, whereof they are members, and the Religion, which they profess, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p>It is well known, how many pious and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table foundations are owing to Popish supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they hoped to expiate their sins, and to merit heaven by their good works, and in this hope, and this perswasion, they did a very great many. We understand better than to think of meriting any thing of God, much less of purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a liberty of sinning, by Acts of Charity; but if those great rewards, which are promised to Charity, and which we profess to believe, will not make us charitable, without the opinion of merit and satisfaction; Charity is so great and excellent a vertue, and so very usefull to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that at least thus far Popery will be thought the better Religion; and therefore as the Apostle argues, <hi>As ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also:</hi> As we have a more orthodox
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52280:19"/>
saith, a clearer and distincter knowledge, and a purer worship, than the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> let us excell in Charity too, and convince the World, that to renounce Popery, is not to renounce good works.</p>
