            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head> The Introduction.</head>
            <p>IF Dr. <hi>H.</hi> had been pleaſed to conſult me by Word or Letter, before he had ſo falſly accuſed me, of telling a falſe Story (which, if I may not ſay, might have been expected in Juſtice, or at leaſt in common Civility, yet I will ſay) he had not only been kinder to me, in ſaving me this unexpected, and unwelcom labour; but juſter to himſelf, in not anſwering a matter before he heard it, and by preventing the appearance of making more haſte than good ſpeed, by a teeming impatience, to be delivered of a falſe Conception.</p>
            <p>And tho' by his Reproachful Charge, he hath given me ſufficient provocation, and by his haſty writing without due information, no leſs advantage, to reply in ſuch a ſtyle as he hath choſen to begin in; yet in this Vindication, to which he hath conſtrained me by unavoidable neceſſity (unleſs he expects that as a <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> I ſhould by ſilence, give conſent to his unjuſt Calumnies) I ſhall keep that modeſt temper which becomes one, who deſigns no Perſonal Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, nor writes for Victory, but Truth, the ſearch and diſcovery of which, needs no Tricks, no little Arts, or big Words, but is beſt attained by ſedate proceeding, and plain and open dealing.</p>
            <p>And to evidence my Reſolution, to keep ſtrictly to this Method, I ſhall ſubjoyn theſe particulars by way of Introduction.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That I will not meddle with any thing but what concerns my own juſt Vindication, my inclination not allowing me to do more; for I ſhould greatly rejoyce to find the Title of the Doctors Book made good, as near as is poſſible, worthy of that Excellent King of happy memory; whoſe Honour, I believe, is better ſecured by the Reputation of his acknowledged Wiſdom, Celebrated Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41199:3"/>
Exemplary Patience, and Chriſtian Magnanimity in his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, than by ſuch Defenders; and either needs none, or deſerves one more conſiderate and better inform'd, who might avoid ſuch miſtakes, as I meet with, in that part of the Poſtſcript wherein I am attacqued; for one remarkable flaw mars the beauty of a whole Piece; and palpable Errours cauſe all the Truths with which they are mixt, to be doubted of, and call'd in queſtion; and Defences ſo managed, overthrow their own deſign and end, and uſually, do more harm than good.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſolemnly appeal to the Searcher of Hearts, Avenger of Falſhood, and Revealer of Secrets, that I will write nothing, of the Truth of which I am not throughly perſuaded, and that by as full Evidence, as I judge ſuch a matter of fact needs, and at ſuch a diſtance of time, is capable of.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I will with undiſguiſed openneſs, produce the means by which I know what I profeſs the knowledge of, and the Reaſons upon which I believe what I profeſs the belief of, and the probable Arguments upon which my Opinion is grounded, as to thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars concerning which I pretend no more than thinking them to be as I declare them.</p>
            <p>And having with Honeſty and Candour laid down ſuch means of my knowledge, ſuch Reaſons of my belief, ſuch probable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for what I think; I ſhall willingly ſubmit them to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every indifferent Reader: And if they be not cogent and convincing to bring him to be of my mind, let him retain his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sentiments; but withal I beg his leave that without his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or diſpleaſure, I may retain mine, till Means of Knowledge, Reaſons of Belief, Arguments for thinking otherwiſe be produced, which in an even ballance may out-weigh mine.</p>
            <p>And when I meet with ſuch, I promiſe to yield without contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, or exacting Miracles for my conviction; for tho' I cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low every random Story, and ill grounded Conjectures, for good Evidence, nor dare follow an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> or eſteem a <hi>Will-in-the-Wiſp</hi> to be a ſafe Guide, yet will I not rebel againſt the Light, when as clear as the Sun at noon day, to which, tho' Dr. <hi>H.</hi> hath been pleaſed to compare his Arguments, I doubt not, when I come to examine them, to make it appear, it had been an extravagant Hyperbole, to have likened them to the fainteſt Moon-ſhine.</p>

            <p>THE Queſtion in debate being concerning the Author of that famous Book, intituled Εἰκὼν Βασιλικὴ, or the Pourtraiture of His Sacred Majeſty in his Solitudes and Sufferings, whether it were written by that Royal Martyr, or ſome other hand? And an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion being raiſed, that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> wrote it, (which ſpread and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed much upon a <hi>Memorandum</hi> of the E. of <hi>Angleſey</hi>'s coming to light, which his Lordſhip had writ in a blank Leaf before the ſaid Book;) and, (by reaſon of the Relation I am known to have had to him) I having been often asked what I knew, or thought of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, having declared the ſubſtance of what I am now forced to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh more fully. And this being the ſuppoſed Crime for which Dr. <hi>H.</hi> hath handled me ſo roughly, as to accuſe me, to have aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Objection, againſt the King's being the Compoſer of it, to the utmoſt of my power with a falſe Story: In order to wipe off ſo raſh, not to ſay ſo rude an Accuſation, I ſhall with all poſſible clearneſs proceed by theſe five Steps.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I will declare what I know of this Book, and by what means, and what I believe of it, and for what Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I will produce ſuch probable Arguments, as confirm my ſelf, and may ſatisfie others, that I am not miſtaken nor decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, nor would deceive others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I will diſtinctly conſider, and fully anſwer, all that Dr. <hi>H.</hi> hath produced to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I will endeavour to give ſatisfactory Anſwers to the Objections I meet with from an abler Pen.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I will declare why I have acknowledged ſuch my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and belief, when requeſted, and ſet down my Reaſons, for ſo doing; 1. Negative. 2. Poſitive.</p>
            <p>And by theſe Steps, I hope, I ſhall free my Reputation from that odious Reproach, of being guilty of aſſiſting an Objection by a falſe Story; at leaſt I ſhall free my ſelf, from confirming by my ſilence, what I judge to be an Errour.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="section">
            <head>SECT. II.</head>
            <p>I Know, and believe, the Book, whoſe Author is enquired after, was written by Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> (except two Chapters writ by Biſhop <hi>Duppa</hi>) ſo far as the ſubjoyned means may produce ſuch knowledge, and the Reaſons may induce ſuch belief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41199:4"/>Firſt, Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> ſome time before the whole was finiſhed, was pleaſed to acquaint me with his deſign, and ſhewed me the Heads of divers Chapters, and ſome of the Diſcourſes, written of them; and after ſome time ſpent in peruſal, he vouchſaft to ask my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning it; and after ſome conſideration, according to the freedom he gave me to ſpeak my thoughts; I told him, I ſuppoſed it would be much for the King's Reputation, Honour and Safety: But I expreſly added, I ſtuck at the lawfulneſs of it, and modeſtly askt him, how he ſatisfied himſelf ſo to impoſe upon the World? To which he ſo readily replied, that I concluded he had thought on it before; look on the Title, 'tis the Pourtraicture <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and no man draws his own Picture which ſatisfied himſelf; and tho' we might argue it a little, did at preſent ſilence me, my heart being ſo inclinable to what was the ſcope of the whole. And I perfectly remember, that in the ſecond Chapter, which is of the Death of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> there being theſe words, which now in the Printed Book of the firſt Edition. are <hi>page</hi> 8. <hi>l.</hi> 18, 19, 20. <q>He only hath been leaſt vext by them, who counſelled me, not to conſent againſt the Vote of my own Conſcience.</q> He told me whom he meant by that paſſage, <hi>viz.</hi> the then Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> Dr. <hi>Juxton,</hi> which, tho' moſt Readers underſtand now, after it hath been ſo long ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, yet many then did not, of which number I was, my Age rendring me leſs acquainted with the Characters of Great Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> ſome good time after what had paſſed, as is related in the preceding Paragraph, we being both in <hi>London,</hi> and having dined together, Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> in the afternoon, deſired me to walk with him to a Friend, when we were gone part of the way; He told me he was going to the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Duppa,</hi> (whom he had acquainted with his deſign) to fetch what he had left with his Lordſhip to be peruſed: Or to ſhew him what he had further written; and as we drew near his houſe he deſired me that after a little general converſation I would withdraw and leave them two alone, which accordingly I did; and when they had been ſome conſiderable time together, He came forth, and we return'd: As ſoon as we were in the ſtreet, he gave me this account of their conference.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi> told me, there were two Subjects more, He wiſht I had thought on, and propounded them to me, <hi>viz.</hi> The Ordinance againſt the Common-prayer book: And the denying his Majeſty the attendance of his Chaplains. (Which are now the 16th, and 24th Chapters in the Printed book,) and deſired me
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41199:4"/>
to write two Chapters upon them, which I promiſed I would But before we parted he recall'd that requeſt, and ſaid, I pray go you on, to finiſh what remains, and leave theſe two to me.</q> I will prepare two Chapters upon them, which accordingly he did, as Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> own'd to me, and others whom he had made privy to the whole, and never pretended to have written theſe, as he did to have done all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> ſome time after the King was murdered, upon my asking him, whether He, (the King) had ever ſeen the Book, gave me this anſwer;<q> I know it certainly no more than you, but I us'd my beſt indeavours that he might, for I delivered a copy of it to the Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford,</hi> when he went to the Treaty at the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and intreated his Lordſhip, if he could obtain any private opportunity, he would deliver it to His Majeſty, and humbly deſire to know his Majeſties pleaſure concerning it.</q> But the violence which threatned the King haſtning ſo faſt, He ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to print it, and never knew what was the Iſſue of ſending it. For when the thing was done, he judged it not prudent to make farther noiſe about it, by enquiry.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I once asking him (for we ſeldom were in private, but ſomewhat was diſcourſt of this Book even to the laſt time I ſaw him, after he was Lord Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> Elect) whether that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second knew that he wrote it. He gave me this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <q>I cannot poſitively and certainly ſay he doth, becauſe he was never pleaſed to take expreſs notice of it to me. But I take it for granted he doth, for I am ſure the Duke of <hi>York</hi> doth, for he hath ſpoken of it to me; and own'd it as a ſeaſonable and acceptable ſervice, and he knowing it, I queſtion not but the King alſo doth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Mr. <hi>Gauden</hi> his Wife, Mr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> (who tranſcrib'd a Copy of it, if I be not much miſtaken, and which Copy I think was that ſent to the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> tho' in this I am not ſo poſitive) and my ſelf believ'd it as much as we could believe any thing, and when we ſpake of it in his preſence, or in his abſence, did it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt doubt of his having writ it; being as much aſſur'd of it, as 'twas poſſible we could be of any matter of fact, and 'tis unaccountably ſtrange, that all we who had the beſt reaſon, and faireſt opportunities to know the truth, ſhould all be deceived or impos'd upon, which we were to the higheſt degree imaginable, if Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> wrote it not.</p>
            <p>Sixthly Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> delivered to me with his own hand what was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41199:5"/>
laſt ſent up (after part was Printed, or at leaſt in Mr. <hi>Royſtons</hi> hand to be Printed,) and after he had ſhew'd it me, and ſeal'd it up, gave me ſtrict Caution, with what warineſs to carry and deliver it; and according to his Direction, I delivered it, Saturday <hi>Decem.</hi> 23. 48. in the Evening to one <hi>Peacock</hi> (Brother to Dr. <hi>Gaudens</hi> Steward, or Bayliff, ſometime before deceaſed) who was inſtructed by what hands He ſhould tranſmit it to Mr. <hi>Royſton,</hi> and in the ſame Method a few days after the Impreſſion was finiſhed, I received ſix Books, by the hand of <hi>Peacock,</hi> as an acknowledgment of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle I had contributed to that Service, one of which I have ſtill by me.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> DR. <hi>Gauden</hi> in the beginning of the long Parliament, which carried on the War againſt the King, preach't before them, on <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.19, laſt words, <hi>Love the Truth and Peace,</hi> which Sermon was Printed, and the Houſe of Commons preſented him with a large Silver Tankard with this Inſcription. <hi>Donum Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norarium Populi Anglicani in Parliamento Congregati,</hi> Johanni Gauden, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which conſtantly went about his Houſe. And He had been inclinable to the Parliaments Intereſt, till He found they went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their firſt Pretenſions, and the expectations of Himſelf, and other good Men. But when He diſcover'd that, He endeavour'd to redeem his Errour, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by bending to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary extream.</p>
            <p>And I am perſwaded it was this, which put him upon the deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and finiſhing of this Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſecond probable Argument, may be drawn from the 14th Chapter, which is upon the Covenant. And I beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for relating this matter more minutely, than may ſeem neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; that it may appear how, and by whom I was furniſhed with it, to render it more cogent.</p>
            <p>After the Book was publiſhed, being in Diſcourſe with my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Tutor, Dr. <hi>J. Barwick,</hi> who died Dean of St. <hi>Pauls.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing privy to the Truth of this affair; out of curioſity ask'd him, what He thought of this Book? He, ſo well knowing my Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41199:5"/>
and Principles, wondered to hear me ask ſuch a Queſtion. I beg'd his Pardon, and told him, the thing being doubtfully ſpoken of, I made bold with him to ask his Judgment. Well then, ſaid He, I will prove it to you. And thus attempted it, it was writ by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or by ſome other man, but it could be writ by no other, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by himſelf. I deſired him to prove his ſecond Propoſition, which He did thus: If by another, it muſt be an enemy, or a Friend; but neither Enemy nor Friend could do it; therefore it muſt be himſelf.</p>
            <p>I once more deſired him, to prove his ſecond Propoſition, which he attempted thus; not by an Enemy, for no Enemy of the King would repreſent him ſo much to his Advantage; not by a Friend, for no Friend of the Kings would write, as He doth, of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Now, how eaſily could I have reply'd; tho' at preſent I acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſced, that Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> though now a moſt hearty Friend to the King, had himſelf taken the Covenant, which we may rationally conclude, had induced him to write more favourably of it, than any of the Kings Party or Friends, or the King himſelf would ever have done.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Third probable Argument may be drawn from <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. and 24. which as I ſhew'd before (<hi>Reſ.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi>) Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> told me, were written by Biſhop <hi>Duppa</hi>; for the Ordinance againſt the Common-Prayer, and denying His Majeſty the Attendance of His Chaplains, were Subjects, which Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> was leſs concerned to think on; for 'tis well known, He had forborn the uſe of the Common-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (tho' 'twas continued longer in his Church than in any therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts) and had never been the Kings Chaplain, but Biſhop <hi>Dup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> having been the Princes Tutor, a long time Chaplain, and a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, was as mindful of theſe particulars, and as much concern'd to be ſo, and with as great reaſon as any man living could be, and therefore firſt deſired Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> to write on theſe Subjects but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter recall'd that Motion, and undertook to do it himſelf, which he alſo performed, as I ſhew'd before; and his free declaring, that he had neither thought of theſe Subjects, nor wrote of them, which it was ſo unlikely he ſhould, renders it very probable he ſpake Truth, in declaring that he wrote the reſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I meet with expreſſions in the Devotional part, very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently us'd by Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> in his Prayers; (for he uſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Prayer both in his Family, and in Publick,) which I never heard from any other Man, and 'tis very eaſie to obſerve, that moſt Men, even in ordinary Converſation, and more eſpecially in their Prayers, tho' they vary in their method, have peculiar Phraſes, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41199:6"/>
Modes of expreſſing themſelves; and where we find ſuch occur, 'tis a probable evidence, they proceed from him, to whom they were peculiar.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I am as ſure, as I can be of any thing, that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> made the Extract out of this Book call'd, I think, <hi>Apophthegmata Corolini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana.</hi> I am ſorry I have not one by me, to give a fuller account of it. But the thing is moſt notorious, that there was ſuch a Book came out, in a very ſhort time after, Printed by Mr. <hi>Dugard.</hi> Now why ſhould Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> concern himſelf ſo much more than any other of the Kings Friends, and diſpatch it with ſuch expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had he had no more concern in it than other men; and had not been inabled to finiſh it ſo ſpeedily, and could with ſuch readineſs take it in pieces, and digeſt it into wiſe and weighty Sentences, who had put it together, and whoſe thoughts had dwelt ſo long, and much upon it? I cannot forbear to judge, that to thoſe who will conſider it impartially, it carries the faireſt and higheſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to confirm, what is before declared, the reaſonable belief of his being the Compoſer of it; how much more, when all the five are joyn'd together?</p>

               <q>The laſt Objection againſt Him, is his Divine and Holy Book.

               <hi>He could ſcarce have exprest himſelf more improperly, if he had ſtudied to do it. We may gueſs at his meaning, by what follows; but, who ever made this Divine and Holy Book an Objection againſt him, but rather accounted it his great honour, and from a Man, who writes for Crowned Heads to read, more accuracy and caution might be expected; and this ſtumble at the threeſhold, is no auſpicious or lucky Omen, but rather an earnest and taſt, of what we are to look for in the Sequel, but theſe are ſo ſmall faults in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of what follows, they are not worth taking notice of, let them have their pardon of courſe. I ſhall wink at ſuch for the future, that I may not ſeem to trifle, but keep to what is material, inſiſt on things, and not on words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I proceed in my reply.</hi> Who they be, I cannot imagine, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of whoſe induſtry cannot be imagined to perſwade the World 'tis a forgery. But e'ne let them ſhift for themſelves. But if they have half ſo much to ſay for themſelves, as the <hi>Eſſex</hi> Dr. hath produced in the firſt Section, to prove that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> wrote it, I ſee not but they may ſtand tryal with a better oppoſer, tho' 'tis hard to meet with a bolder accuſer, whoſe Affirmations are ſo ſtrong, and whoſe Confirmations are ſo weak, for my aſſiſting it with a falſe ſtory is ſoon ſaid, but not ſo ſoon proved, you now have the ſtory of my own telling, convince me of falſhood if you can, do your beſt or your worſt, provided you write in ſincerity, producing nothing but what you have as good means to be aſſured of as I produce for what I know, and as good Reaſons for your belief, as I produce for mine. <hi>For Huffing, and Hectoring will weigh little with wiſe Men, and good Nature, and good Manners, may be overcome with too much ill uſage, to cauſe you to be anſwered as you would not, if you accuſe as you ſhould not.</hi>

            <p>But why did you not tell the ſtory before you refute it, that it

might be known, whether it were truly that <hi>Eſſex</hi> Doctors ſtory, (which you raſhly call falſe) or a dream of your own Imagination? You now have the ſtory of his own telling, and you may try your skill at refuting it, when you pleaſe, and if you perform that undertaking no better than you do the promiſe, of ſetting the whole matter in its true and proper light, I have not ſo much cauſe to fear your Confutation, as you have to fear the wo denounced againſt thoſe who put dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for light, and light for darkneſs.</p>

               <q>I could never obtain leave of my ſelf to believe, that any man could write at that Divine rate but he that felt the miſeries, that ſuggeſt ſuch thoughts and heavenly Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The various conditions of men, good men, wonderfully help them, in their retirements and ſolitudes, to Divine intercourſes and aſpirations; and He that could counterfeit ſuch things, and make ſuch appeals to God, without being in ſuch conditions, as theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals ſuppoſe: Muſt be rather next to an Atheiſt, than a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and if the <hi>Eſſex</hi> Dr. had any value for the memory of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Friend, he would certainly have forborn telling it in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with a more than uſual confidence, as he hath done, and that for this one Reaſon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Eſſex's</hi> Drs. Reply. All this Harangue is but a piece of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd ware, with which Sir <hi>Will. Dugdale</hi> furniſht him, in a ſhort Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in theſe words. <hi>The unlikelyhood that any ſuch expreſſions could flow from an Heart not oppreſſed and grieved, with ſuch a weight of ſorrow as his was.</hi> Of which the Dr. hath made none of the beſt Paraphraſe, <hi>to enlarge his Paper.</hi> But let us try the force of it. <hi>I could never obtain leave of my ſelf to believe,</hi> &amp;c. as above. In good time Sir, muſt then all the World be tied to believe no more than Dr. <hi>H.</hi> will give their Majeſtys Chaplain at <hi>Algate</hi> leave to believe, be the evidence of matter of fact never ſo clear? I pray Sir, who made your <hi>Courteſie or Contumacy,</hi> to give your ſelf leave to believe, or not believe the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of all other Mens Perſwaſion, or not being perſwaded? I have heard much wiſer men (than I pretend to be) affirm, that, believing or not believing, depends not upon our own choice, but upon the clearneſs or cogency of the motives of credibility, or the weakneſs and inſufficiency of them; but let that paſs, for my buſineſs is not ſpeculatively to diſpute, but to prove a matter of fact, and vindicate my ſelf from the imputation of telling a falſe Story; yet becauſe this Argument hath been often uſed, I will conſider it a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to manifeſt how weak and unconcluding it is.</p>
            <p>'Tis no new nor ſtrange thing for one man to perſonate another,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41199:7"/>
and to write and ſpeak as is ſuitable to, and uſual for men in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and frequently when their fancies are warmed, the Copy out-does the Original; and he ſeems never to have read a Romance, the Poets, Scenical or others, or the Greek and Roman Hiſtories, who cannot give Inſtances of all the Paſſions raiſed, and expreſſions ſuitable put into the mouth of them, for whoſe uſe they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and uttered with a warmer <hi>Pathos,</hi> than they would have been by the perſons themſelves, <hi>perſonated by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the proof of this is above all exception in Books of devotion (and which comes nearer our caſe) in which we find the greateſt variety of <hi>Proſopopoeias,</hi> in Meditations, Soliloquies, Prayers, Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, Praiſes, Aſpirations, and other Addreſſes to God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Authors of them, who cannot be ſuppoſed to be in all the conditions themſelves, but to fit them for thoſe, who may be in a condition, in which it will be proper for them to uſe them. And the reaſon is obvious, <hi>and eaſily accounted for.</hi> For tho' I deny not that our affections are kindled by our preſent circumſtances, and ſurprizing mercies or calamities are Springs of ſuch joy or ſorrow, as ſharpen and ſet an Edge upon our Expreſſions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill an Air, an Energy, and ſuitable Eloquence into them, which the ſame perſon could not reach at another time, yet tis alſo true that they being ſudden and unſtudied, a kind of Raptures without deliberation, and leſs Artificial, have a viſible inequality in their Contexture, and riſe or fall according to the differing preſſures, or inlargements, under which men are: St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s <hi>Rara hora, Brevis mora,</hi> looks this way. And an obſervation I have heard, ſeems not deſpicable, <hi>viz.</hi> that he who prays always alike, may be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to pray rather by Art, than by his Heart; the Habits of Art being much more ſteddy and permanent than the temper and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of mens Hearts, which are very mutable and different, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the circumſtances from which they riſe.</p>
            <p>But when a man deſigns to perſonate another, he puts himſelf in ſuch an ones place, and writes and ſpeaks, what he eſteems moſt fit and ſuitable to a perſon in ſuch a condition, and adapts his words and expreſſions, with ſecond and third thoughts, takes a great deal of pains, uſes a ſtudious induſtry to fit every thought to ſuch a condition, every affection to ſuch a thought, and every expreſſion to be a lively <hi>Icon</hi> of ſuch a paſſion or affection; ſo that whatever you will give your ſelf leave to believe, it ſeems not a whit ſtrange to other men it ſhould be ſo, as you cannot believe, nor in the leaſt diſſonant to right reaſon and experience, of which Inſtances might
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41199:8"/>
be given without number. I beg pardon for this Digreſſion into which the Dr. led me, by an ill-grounded ſpeculation, which makes little to his purpoſe, and I think hath done him little ſervice; yea, will rather cauſe conſiderate Readers to ſuſpect his want of better Arguments, <hi>elſe he would not have had recourſe to ſuch thin and Airy Speculations, which prove nothing but the weakneſs of their Judgments, who put any ſtreſs upon them, and would by them impoſe upon other men.</hi> Yea, give me liberty to add, if the Drs. Argument hath any weight, it ſeems to be in the wrong Scale, and makes that end of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance to preponderate, which he endeavours to make appear the lighteſt; for the evenneſs of the thought and expreſſion, the equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſtyle and affection, and the ſame Thread running quite through from firſt to laſt, rather argues it an Artificial Compoſure of one who had vacancy for ſedate, and deliberate thinking, than of him, for whoſe <hi>Icon</hi> and Pourtraiture it was deſigned, who was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with ſo diſtracting an hurry of miſeries, as muſt often change the temper of his mind. But to compenſate for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the former part of this Paragraph, it hath a ſting in its Tail, concluding, <q>that if Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> wrote it, he is next to an Atheiſt, and that for that Reaſon the <hi>Eſſex</hi> Dr. if he had any value for his memory, would have forborn telling it in all places with more than uſual confidence, as he hath done, that is, leſt he repreſent him as an Atheiſt.</q>

               <hi>Eſſex</hi> Drs. Reply; to which I ſay in general; My Story repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him not ſo like an Atheiſt, as your raſhneſs repreſents you, like a falſe Accuſer, of both him and me; and for this Reaſon, if Dr. <hi>H.</hi> had any kindneſs to the Reputation of his friend, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties <hi>Algate</hi> Chaplain, he would have conſidered better, before he had publiſht, with ſomewhat more than confidence, ſuch groundleſs Accuſations and ſuch crude, and ill contriv'd Stories; and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, why Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> more an Atheiſt, for preparing theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes for the King, to be own'd or laid aſide, as to His Majeſties wiſdom ſhould ſeem good: (See Reaſon 3.

               <hi>Eſſex</hi> Dr's Reply. Sir, what with your uſual confidence, you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce with, <hi>The truth of the Story is thus,</hi> is all meer Story, but not one word of truth, nor hath it the leaſt bluſh or appearance of <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> or ſo much as <hi>Probability,</hi> as I hope to convince your ſelf.</p>
            <p>Firſt. Not probable; any Man who knows any thing of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Decency, and the circumſtances of the Perſons of whom he writes (as he ſhould be ſuppoſed to do, who preſumes to Dedicate his writings, to ſo wiſe a King and Queen) would have contriv'd his ſtory, and told his tale more handſomely, and would rather have ſaid that the Parſon of <hi>Rayne</hi> who was a very private man had waited upon Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> who liv'd at the rate of a Thouſand a year, and made the greateſt figure of any Clergy Man in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> or perhaps in <hi>England</hi> at that time, than boldly and bluntly to ſend for him what ever the occaſion might be; but let that paſs, a ſlip in good manners is a ſmall fault, compared to the impoſſibility of his ſtories being true, for tho' Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> was once Miniſter of <hi>Rayne</hi> and Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> Dean of <hi>Bockin,</hi> which are neighboring Towns, yet I queſtion whether the Men were ever neighbours: And that Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> was not gone from <hi>Raine,</hi> Before Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> came to <hi>Bockin</hi>: But I need not urge that, for what I aver, (and am as ſure of as I can be of any matter of fact, which is moſt notorious) proves the impoſſibility (I charge the Drs. ſtory with) home and beyond contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; for before this Book was thought of, or many of the ſubjects had hapned, of which it treats, Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> was ſequeſtred for his Loyalty fled into the Kings Quarters, and on Mr. <hi>Attkins</hi> (a plundered Miniſter as they then call'd them) who was fled into the Parliaments Quarters was placed in his ſequeſtred living of <hi>Rayne</hi>: I came to Dr. <hi>Gaudens Auguſt</hi> 1644. and I never knew Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> all the while I liv'd there, tho' I knew him well when the book was printing, as I may touch in place convenient, and relate the occaſion of our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Somewhat runs in my mind of his being with my Lord</hi> Capel, <hi>who was his Patron, and had given him the Parſonage of</hi> Rayne, <hi>who commanded about that time for the King in</hi> Shropſhire; <hi>but what need I multiply words about what I am not certain of,</hi> when I am as certain, as I can be of any
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41199:9"/>
thing, he was far from being Dr. <hi>Gaudens</hi> Neighbour, or any poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſending for him, <hi>how trimly ſoever, and with a good grace, the Story is told, not much to the credit of the teller of it, or the confirmation of the thing he tells it for; it ſo expoſes it ſelf, it needs no farther confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I will be ſo kind, as to ſlip an advantage, of loading it with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier aggravations, tho' ſo much provoke't.</hi> If any thing ſeem to deſerve a farther anſwer, I muſt requeſt the Reader to call to mind, or read over again my firſt Section, where there is enough to ſatisfie him; for I never pretended to carry the whole to the Preſs, but as is there ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly declared a part of it. I proceed to the 2d Paragraph, <hi>p.</hi> the 38.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Algate</hi> Drs. <hi>P. ſc.</hi> And whereas 'tis ſaid, <q>That Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> told K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. he made the Book; the truth of the Story is this, that he putting in for the Biſhoprick of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and meeting with ſome oppoſition from Biſhop <hi>Sheldon,</hi> the King askt him, what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences he had to ſo great a favour, he anſwered, that he put out his Fathers Book, which anſwer, tho' true in ſome ſenſe, yet being ambiguouſly ſpoken, as it got him the Biſhoprick, ſo it alſo gave riſe to the late Earl of <hi>Angleſey</hi>'s <hi>Memorandum,</hi> which hath made ſo great noiſe in the World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſſex</hi> Drs. Reply. Good Sir, if a man ſhould be ſo bold as to ask a few Queſtions, would you anſwer them as roundly as you would chouſe the World with this Dream? 1. I pray Sir, did you hear all this? 2. Have you any man of truth or modeſty to produce as a Voucher? 3. In ſober ſadneſs do you in cool blood believe it your ſelf? 4. Or to ſpeak home, will you confirm it by your ſolemn Oath, as the <hi>Eſſex</hi> Dr. is ready to do, the Story with which he will confront it? '<hi>The truth of the Story is this</hi>; ſo you ſay, but <hi>pace veſtrâ,</hi> by your good leave, I cannot <hi>obtain leave of my ſelf</hi> to believe one ſentence in all your ten lines, and for a better reaſon than you give for your incredulity, where you uſe that phraſe; and my reaſon (how ſilly and weak ſoever it may ſeem) in plain Engliſh is becauſe there is not one <hi>wiſe,</hi> or <hi>true</hi> word, in all this, (moſt falſly call'd) <hi>Truth of the Story.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I even wonder, that Providence ſhould furniſh me with ſo exact a knowledge of this affair, which I thought of little uſe before, till it inabled me to confute this <hi>ſhameleſs</hi> fiction; <hi>and I will for once be as confident as you, and ſay,</hi> the truth of the Story is this, as I had it from Biſhop <hi>Gaudens</hi> own mouth, immediately upon his nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to be tranſlated from <hi>Exeter</hi> to <hi>Worceſter.</hi> But before I relate his words to me on that occaſion, let me make ſome few remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome particulars. 1. <hi>Whereas 'tis ſaid Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>told K.</hi> Ch. II. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoever ſaid ſo, ſaid what was not ſo. He never told him. See Sect. 1.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41199:10"/>
Reaſon 4. 'Tis ſtrange he ſhould himſelf tell the King, and yet not know the King knew it, but by inference, becauſe the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> did. 2. <hi>He putting in</hi> for the Biſhoprick of <hi>Worceſter</hi> (let that uncouth phraſe paſs.) But he did not put in for <hi>Worceſter,</hi> but rather was put off with that inſtead of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> pardon the expreſſion, what follows will juſtifie it, at leaſt excuſe it. 3 <hi>The King askt him, &amp;c.</hi> ſtill worſe and worſe; the King askt him no ſuch queſtion, nor was there the leaſt ſhadow of occaſion why he ſhould, and the Biſhop never anſwered, as is ſaid he did; for no Queſtion needed no Anſwer. 4. Ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſpoken; not ſpoken at all, therefore not ſpoken ambiguouſly; <hi>remember the Logick Rule, Ab eſt primi adjecti, ad eſt ſecundi valet nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</hi> As for Inſtance, if a man be not their Majeſties <hi>Chaplain,</hi> he is not their <hi>Chaplain</hi> at <hi>Algate,</hi> unleſs it be helpt out, with ſpeaking <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguouſly.</hi> 5. Helpt him to that Biſhoprick, <hi>(ſc. Worceſter)</hi> inſtead of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> He was right enough ſerved, for ſpeaking ſo ambiguouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he had ſo ſpoken. 6. <hi>Gave riſe to the late E. of</hi> Angleſeys <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum.</hi> In good earneſt, Sir, were you awake when you dream'd all this? Was the King <hi>(Ch.</hi> the II.) who was known to be a man of extraordinary ſagacity and quickneſs, in diſcerning mens temper and words, ſo eaſily impoſed upon and cheated by a fallacy, to believe what it was his Intereſt, more than any mans, not to believe but upon moſt cogent evidence and convincing reaſons? and to tell it ſo freely, and with aſſurance to the E. of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> as his <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum</hi> declares with all due circumſtances; ſo that his <hi>Memorandum</hi> may ſleep in a whole skin, for all theſe dreams; but of that more in due place hereafter. Having paſt theſe ſhort remarks upon the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular paſſages, I ſhall now confront <hi>his truth of the Story,</hi> with this <hi>Story of Truth,</hi> in the Biſhop's own words.</p>
            <p>Only give me leave before I relate his words, to ſay, (that beſides the friendly freedom, which he always uſed to me, in kind communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his concerns to me) I can gueſs but at two reaſons, why he ſhould tell me ſo fully and punctually what I ſhall preſently relate. Either, 1. It was to prevent my being ſurprized at his miſſing <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> which ſome who were moſt intimate with him, knew he had the promiſe, and upon that the expectation of; Or, 2. Providence ſtoopt ſo low, to furniſh me with a clear Reply to ſuch a ſenſleſs feigned dream, as I am confuting by it. Now follow Biſhop <hi>Gaudens</hi> words to me on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>After the Death of the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> I next morning waiting on the King, found a remarkable alteration in him: His Majeſty was, <hi>ſad,</hi> uneaſie, and out of his uſual good humour and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41199:10"/>
I could not but obſerve it, but at preſent took no farther notice of it; the ſecond morning I found him ſo, as much, or rather more, than on the preceding day, yet neither then did I take any notice of it to him, but when I had a ſhort time waited on him, withdrew; but the third morning having been fully inform'd that my Lord Chancellor had, by himſelf and all the Intereſt he could make, preſt the King to beſtow the Biſhoprick of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> upon the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Morly,</hi> I thus Addreſt my ſelf to his Majeſty. Sir, with all humillity I beg your leave to ſpeak to you, and your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Gracious Pardon for It. Sir, I well know, not only how well becoming, but how much it is the duty of every good Subject, to contribute to the eaſe and ſatisfaction of his Prince. And I cannot but conceive, that your Majeſty is in ſome ſtreight, between the Honour of your word, by which you graciouſly pleas'd to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, I ſhould Succeed my excellent Friend the late Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>: And the importunity, by which you are preſt in the behalf of another: I therefore with greateſt willingneſs, releaſe you free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that Promiſe. Here, ſaid the Biſhop, the King ſtopt me: Vouchſafed to embrace me in his Arms, with theſe expreſſions.</q> 
               <hi>My Lord, I thank you, and it may not be long, ere I have opportunity to ſhew you how kindly I take it.</hi> And in the mean time, <hi>you ſhall have</hi> Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>and to make it to you as good as I can, all the Dignities of that Church (I know not how it comes to paſs) being in my diſpoſal, I give you the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of them all, during your time, that you may prefer your Friends, and have them near about you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I appeal to the Judgment of every conſiderate reader, whether this ſtory, which I had for the ſubſtance, and to the beſt of my memory, in the very words, from Biſhop <hi>Gaudens</hi> own mouth, when the thing was freſh and recent carry the faireſt and moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly characters of truth, or the <hi>Algate</hi> Dr's ſtory: <hi>For which he brings no proof, but his own meer ſay ſo, as indeed it is impoſſible he ſhould, for, this muſt be a true ſtory, or elſe a dream and viſion of my own Imagination; the latter of which, it is both Naturally, and Morally, next to impoſſible it ſhould be. Firſt, Naturally, for I never pretended to ſo pregnant an Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to deviſe a ſtory ſo ſelf conſiſtent, in all its parts, for falſhoods will not jamm or hang coherently together, be they told with never ſo good a Grace, and Magiſterially cram'd down Mens belief with huffing menaces, and hectoring Rhetorick: To fright men to ſwallow them, at their peril: For fear of being counted contumacious. Witneſs the flaws and incoheren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of all the</hi> Algate <hi>Dr's. Narratives, of this matter, catcht up from uncertain Rumours, and pieced out with groundleſs phancies of his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition inconſiderately.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:41199:11"/>Secondly, <hi>Morally impoſſible, for</hi> Nemo gratis nequam. <hi>No man will lie without advantage, much leſs to create prejudice to himſelf.</hi> And I am ſure there is not ſo much as the appearance of a temptation to induce Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> to tell it me, (as I ſolemnly aver he did) if it had not been the truth, nor to me to feign it in cool blood, and deliberately to appeal to the God of Truth and Righteouſneſs, as a Witneſs and Avenger, which I neither would or durſt do to gain the World.</p>
            <p>This might abundantly ſuffice to anſwer the <hi>Algate</hi> Dr's. <hi>Sham</hi> Story, concerning the Biſhoprick of <hi>Worceſter</hi> in the ſecond Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of his <hi>P. ſc.</hi> yet, tho' I be well aware that over-doing is for the moſt part undoing and adding probabilities after clear and full evidence doth more harm than good, and, like ſetting ſhores and props to a ſtrong houſe, creates ſuſpition, that 'tis tottering or like to fall without them, yet I will for once run that risk and hazard, and add theſe three Arguments, to confirm what is before affirmed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis highly probable that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> had the promiſe of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> (obtained by his moſt entire Friend Biſhop <hi>Duppa,</hi> who beſides the Power he had with the King, having been his Tutor, could unriddle to him (as queſtionleſs he did) the whole Affair of Εἰκὼν Βασιλικὴ, to which he had been not only privy, but a party, and plead that to obtain the favour of that promiſe for him) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe divers of his intimate Friends had knowledge of his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſucceed in that See; and why ſhould he abuſe his <hi>Beſt</hi> Friends with a groundleſs Flam?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the King <hi>was ſo uneaſie,</hi> and deferr'd ſome days to give it Dr. <hi>Morly,</hi> notwithſtanding all the Intereſt made for him, and His Majeſties own inclination to him, as having been beyond Sea with him in his Baniſhment; why not give it preſently as ſoon as vacant, but after ſome days demur, and uneaſineſs, till his promiſe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed by him to whom 'twas made?</p>
            <p n="3">3. (I will venture to reveal a ſecret at this diſtance, which was then induſtriouſly conceal'd, to prevent being made matter of ſport upon the diſappointment.) The Great Houſe built by Sir <hi>Dennis Gauden,</hi> the Biſhop's Brother, upon <hi>Clapham</hi> Heath, in which Sir <hi>Dennis</hi> after lived, <hi>and I think now Mr.</hi> Ewers, was built, (as I was aſſured by one who knew it well) to be the Manſion-houſe of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> being in that Dioceſs; for 'tis well known that <hi>Wincheſter-houſe</hi> beyond the Bridge had been pulled down, and turn'd into Rent and Tenements, and another was to be built or bought in lieu of it, by the Biſhop, and ſetled as a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion-houſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41199:11"/>
for that See, as after <hi>Wincheſter-houſe</hi> in <hi>Chelſea,</hi> was purchaſed by Biſhop <hi>Morley,</hi> and made part of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> tho' before in the Biſhoprick of <hi>London</hi>; theſe Dioceſſes being parted by the <hi>Thames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could add many more circumſtances relating to this Affair, but at preſent forbear, as judging them needleſs.</p>
            <p>I am at length arrived at the third and laſt Paragraph of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> Drs. <hi>P. ſc.</hi> which is to compenſate and make amends for all the impertinences of the preceding; for thus it begins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Algate</hi> Drs. <hi>P. ſc.</hi> 
               <q>But to put all things out of doubt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Book; give me leave to tell this Story: I was not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weeks ago in converſation with Sir <hi>John Brattle,</hi> a worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and who hath long enjoy'd a conſiderable Office in the Royal Mint, with whom diſcourſing about King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and particularly of the ſuſpicions raiſed of the truth of the Book. He frankly told me, and aſſured me the truth of this Story; that in the year 47. King <hi>Charles</hi> having drawn up the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of this Book, and having writ it in ſome looſe Papers at different times, deſired Bp. <hi>Juxton</hi> to get ſome friend of his, (whom he could commend to him as a truſty perſon) to look it over, and to put it into an exact Method; the Biſhop pitcht up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Father, whom he had been acquainted with for many years, who undertaking the Task was aſſiſted by this his Son, who declares he ſate up with his Father ſome nights, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him in methodizing thoſe Papers all writ with the King's own hand. Thanks be to God, Sir <hi>John</hi> is yet alive, and is ready to give the ſame Account to any man that asks him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſſex</hi> Drs. Reply. <hi>Jam ventum eſt ad Triarios.</hi> Sir <hi>John Brattle</hi> is a perſon whoſe name I do not remember I have heard before, and therefore make no Judgment prejudicial, or of diſadvantage to the Character here given of him. But as the <hi>Algate</hi> Dr. tells the Story, I doubt it may prove as meer a Story as the reſt. <hi>But before I come to my particular Remarks upon it, I confeſs 'tis not unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to obſerve, that when the Dr's. hand was in at Coyning Stories, which I have proved to be of both ſo baſe Metal, and falſe an Impreſs, he ſhould have recourſe to the Royal Mint, to borrow a more Authentick Stamp; for what elſe can an Office there add to a Teſtimony in a matter of fact</hi>?</p>
            <p>But with all due reſpect to Sir <hi>J. Br.</hi> I would ask the Dr. a few Queſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. May it not be poſſible, without any diminution of Sir <hi>John</hi>'s
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41199:12"/>
veracity, that in more than forty Years, there may be ſome miſtake of other Papers for theſe, or ſome other lapſe of Memory, about a matter in which he was concerned but once or twice; and that but tranſiently and on the by; or was Sir <hi>John,</hi> who muſt be then a young man, and 'tis likely, but in a private capacity, ſo well acquainted with the Kings hand, which 'tis probable he had ſeldom or never ſeen? I believe few private <hi>Country</hi> Youths, or young Gentlemen, are ſo very well us'd to their Soveraigns hand-writing, as to make a Critical Judgment of it, and to be able with aſſurance to diſtinguiſh it, from the writing of all other men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would gladly know when and where the King deſired this of Biſhop <hi>Juxton,</hi> for I refer my ſelf to thoſe who lived in thoſe times, &amp; obſerved the paſſages of them, whether they ever ſo much as heard that the King and Biſhop <hi>Juxton</hi> ſaw each other, after his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was driven from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by the Tumults, till he was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently brought to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, Jan 19. 48 to be tried and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly murdered. The King indeed then obtain'd leave for the good man to come to him, and aſſiſt him <hi>in extremis,</hi> for neither his Age, nor Character permitting him to be ſerviceable to him in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him in the Wars, He liv'd Private and Retir'd, and, I never heard he ſaw him, till upon the ſad occaſion forenamed, and that was after the Book was Printed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Suppoſing, but by no means granting, that the King had deſired Biſhop <hi>Juxton,</hi> as is ſaid, to deſire a truſty Friend to do it; why another rather than the Biſhop himſelf? Had the King any Friend more truſty than Biſhop <hi>Juxton?</hi> or was He too good, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove doing ſuch ſervice for his Maſter, who had not a Servant who honoured and lov'd him more; or was He too buſie to attend it, when he was wholly out of all imployment, and injoy'd the moſt undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed privacy and quiet, of any man that had ſerv'd the King in any eminent degree? Or was Biſhop <hi>Juxton</hi> leſs fit and able, than a private man, when the Book conſiſts of Policy and Piety? and who a fitter Judge of what concern'd the firſt, than one who had ſo long been Privy Councellor, and Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>England</hi>? And for the ſecond he was one on whom the King rely'd, as much, or more, than on any Man, for the conduct of his Conſcience; as appear'd by his ſingling him out, to be with him in his Preparations for Death, and upon the infamous Scaffold of his Martyrdom; and who was ſo able a Divine, that tho' his Publick Imployments, hindred him from Preaching often, yet when He did, perform'd it ſo well, I remember I heard a Biſhop, who was able to judge, ſay: He thought him one of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41199:12"/>
the moſt excellent Preachers He ever heard, and gave Inſtance in a Sermon He heard him preach, at Court, of Repentance. And why muſt Biſhop <hi>Juxton</hi> deſire another man to do that work, for which (had there been any ſuch work to be done) He himſelf was the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt man alive, for Fidelity, for Ability, for Inclination to his Maſters Service, and for vacancy and leiſure?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly, I pray which of theſe ſtories, in your P—ſc. would you have us believe? Your firſt of ſending it to Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> by a truſty Meſſenger? or your laſt of the Kings own delivering it to his truſty Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Biſhop <hi>Juxton? They cannot both be true; if that, not this, if this not that; they are ſo contrary, we muſt ſuppoſe the</hi> Algate <hi>Dr. the Relater of the One, and their Majeſties</hi> Algate <hi>Chaplain the Relater of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I confeſs the doubt is too hard for me to ſolve. I muſt e'ne leave it to be agreed betwixt themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might add, I have heard near half a dozen ſtories about this Book, all as inconſiſtent with one another, as theſe two. Yet all told with equal aſſurance, a ſufficient prejudice againſt them all, with all unprejudiced Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Algate</hi> Dr. P—ſc. <q>And whoſoever after this, will ſuſpect this Book, is certainly a man of that temper, who will keep up his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt this great man, in ſpight of all evidences, tho' as clear as the Sun at Noon, and for my own part I muſt tell him, that I think it not worth the while to attempt his farther ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe <hi>nullum remedium Deus poſuit contumaciae.</hi> God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath not provided a remedy, for reſolved ſtubbornneſs, in the ordinary courſe of dealing with men: and if nothing but miracles will convince them, I have no Commiſſion to pretend to them.</q>

               <hi>Eſſex</hi> Drs. Reply. Sir, tho' I will not vapour and huff my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with comparing what I have truely, ſincerely, and as in the ſight of God written; concerning my Knowledge and Belief about this Book, fairly declaring the means of my Knowledge, and the Reaſons of my Belief, to the Sun at Noon as you think good to compare your waking Dreams, and random gueſſes (which deſerve not to be likened to the light of the Moon, a day before, or after its change) yet I abhor keeping up prejudices againſt that great and excellent Prince; and have only given the account in the firſt and ſecond Sections, and reply'd to your ſlanders and reproaches (which extorted from me this unwelcome labour,) to clear my Reputation; you having according to your Talent, as <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> complain'd of <hi>Ziba</hi> ſlandered me, (to the whole Nation) and to my Lord the King, by preſuming to dedicate ſuch ſtuff to their ſacred Majeſties.</p>

            <p>I Shall in the next place ſay ſomewhat to another Paper, publiſh'd ſome months before, of the ſame ſubject, <hi>Intituled, Reſtitution to the Royal Author,</hi> &amp;c. which I confeſs, I was then deſired to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but forbore, not being perſonally concerned.</p>
            <p>But Dr. <hi>Hollingſworth</hi> having forced me to what I have now done, it ſeems neceſſary to add ſome few remarks upon this Paper, leſt my not taking notice of it, ſhould be misinterpreted, to be a tacite acknowledgment, of ſome difficulties in it, not to be grapled with.</p>
            <p>And I muſt do this Author the right, to own him to be a Perſon of another figure, than I have had to do with in the preceding Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: One who writes not <hi>extempore, Quicquid in buccam (in cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum</hi>) catches not up every groundleſs Report and flying Rumour, and Ecchoes it back as an Oracle: But ſeems to have weighed and conſidered what he writes, endeavouring the beſt Information he could get; and hath driven it as far as it would go, and relates in ſome particulars what is true, and puts ſome colour of Probability upon thoſe in which he is miſtaken, or was ill informed, and does all with modeſty and candor, and as becomes a man who hopes to obtain what he aims at, by ſober Reaſon and dint of Argument, not by Hectoring and noiſie Clamour, and I ſhall treat him as a Perſon who deſerves this Character, which <hi>ex animo,</hi> I give him, and hope He will not count me an Enemy, for telling him the Truth, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem it rather kindneſs than rudeneſs to ſhew him where he is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Now this Gentleman is pleaſed to raiſe three Objections againſt this <hi>Memorandum,</hi> to enervate the Force and Credit of it; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which Objections, I think this <hi>Memorandum</hi> very authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and an unconquerable Evidence to prove the Truth of what I have ſo ſincerely declared concerning this Book: and in a juſt Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of it, I will firſt anſwer all his Objections produced againſt it; and farther, ſubjoin a Remark, which I hope may be of ſome uſe, and therefore not unacceptable, which could be given by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pen.</p>
            <p>Firſt Objection; <q>It calls the Duke, his then Royal Highneſs, <hi>The Duke of</hi> York, which was no Court-Language in 1675, there being neither Reaſon nor Cuſtom for ſuch a length of Diſtinction at that time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1<hi>ſt, Loquendum cum vulgo</hi>; and I appeal to Experience <hi>if he were not call'd the Duke of</hi> York <hi>ten times to once that he was call'd His Royal Highneſs; and for the length, the former is the ſhorter of the two.</hi> But he proceeds in the ſame Objection; <q>Now it is ſomewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that a Perſon of Honour and a Courtier, eſpecially one of my late Lord <hi>Angleſey</hi>'s ſenſe, ſhould be guilty of ſuch an Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No Impropriety at all; eſpecially, if we conſider this was not ſpoken in Court, but privately writ in a Leaf before the Book:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41199:15"/>
for in ſuch like caſes, even Courtiers confine not themſelves to the Punctillios they obſerve in ſpeaking or in writing what is to be publiſh'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I hope I may convince himſelf, how weak, and non-conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Argument is, by a Paſſage with which he hath furniſh'd me in the ſame <hi>Page,</hi> line 36, 37. viz. <hi>His pt. Majeſty King</hi> James <hi>the Second</hi>; if that Abbreviation pt. ſtand for preſent, as I perceive 'tis generally believed to do, let us form two parallel Arguments. His Argument againſt the Earl of <hi>Angleſey</hi>'s being Author of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum,</hi> runs thus; <q>A Courtier, and a Perſon of ſuch ſenſe as the late E. of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> could not write this <hi>Memorandum</hi>; becauſe 'tis unlikely ſuch an one ſhould be guilty of ſuch Impropriety of Language, as to call his then Royal Highneſs, Duke of <hi>York,</hi> which was no Court-Language in 1675. Very good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe it ſhould, in time, be queſtioned, Whether this Gentleman wrote the two Sheets, call'd <hi>Reſtitution,</hi> &amp;c. and one ſhould argue againſt it, with a parallel Argument, A Man of ſuch ſenſe could not write them, becauſe 'tis ſomewhat unlikely, that he could be guilty of ſuch Impropriety of Language, as to call him, <hi>His preſent Majeſty King</hi> James <hi>the Second</hi>; which is neither Court-Language nor Country-Language in 1691. Now what think you, Sir, would this Argument exclude you from being the Writer of theſe Sheets? If not, why ſhould a leſs Impropriety of Language, exclude the E. of <hi>Angleſey</hi> from being the Writer of this <hi>Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum?</hi> eſpecially, if we conſider, (that ſuppoſing, but not yielding) if he expreſt himſelf not like a Courtier, 'twas a private Note in a Leaf of a Book, which might be ſeen, or never ſeen; and you have made yours publick to the wide World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Second Objection; <q>We are informed by the Advertiſement, that in the written Copy of the Εἰκὼν Βασιλικὴ, there are ſome Corrections and Alterations written with the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's own Hand, which is no contemptible Argument, if we had no other, that the King was the Author; otherwiſe we ſhould be at a loſs for the Reaſon of his Majeſty's correcting the Manuſcript, and ſuffering it to paſs under the Title of his own Compoſure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What the Corrections by the King's own Hand ſeem to you to be an Argument of, ſeems to me quite contrary; and I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly believe, this corrected Copy was that ſent by the Marqueſs of <hi>Hertford</hi> from Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>; as I gave account, <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41199:15"/>
on purpoſe to be corrected, allow'd, or laid aſide, as his Majeſty ſhould think good. See the Section referr'd to.</p>
            <p>And if the King himſelf had been the Author, <hi>Why was not the Book in his own Hand-writing, as well as the Correction and Alterations? or why any Corrections, of a fair Copy, if he had finiſhed the Original himſelf before 'twas copied?</hi> Or why, if he ſent it to be printed, did he not ſend the corrected Copy, rather than an imperfect one, which need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Correction and Alteration? Theſe Conſiderations confirm me beyond the leaſt Heſitancy, this was the Copy the Marqueſs of <hi>Hertford</hi> brought his Majeſty at the time of the Treaty in the Iſle of <hi>Wight:</hi> But the Violence towards him haſtned ſo faſt, he could not tranſmit it back, and Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> and Bp. <hi>Duppa,</hi> thought it better to print it as it was, than to defer it till it would be too late to do him the Service they deſigned by it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Objection the Third; <q>The making Bp. <hi>Gauden</hi> the Author of this Book, is another Diſadvantage to the Credit of the <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum</hi>; for the Stile, the Air, and Thought of Εἰκὼν Βασιλικὴ, is as different from the Management of Bp. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Writings, as 'tis poſſible to imagine: but out of reſpect to the Biſhop's Memory, I forbear to inſiſt upon the Compariſon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection from the Stile is a very thin and feeble one, as I could eaſily make appear, if I would enter upon the Theme of critical Judging of the Authors of Books, by the Stile in which they are written: and to name no more, I might fetch Aſſiſtance from <hi>Elias Du Pin,</hi> a <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctor, in his excellent new <hi>Bibliothec of Eccleſiaſtical Writers</hi>; by many Volumes of which, he hath obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Learned Part of the World, and raiſed their Expectation and Deſire of the reſt. But I will avoid ſuch an unneceſſary Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it being ſufficient to blunt the edg of this Objection, to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt theſe two Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It ought to be conſidered, whether the Writings compar'd are of the ſame kind? for a Man may differ more from himſelf, when his Writings are of different kinds, than two Strangers differ in their Stile, whoſe Deſign and End of Writing is the ſame: As the Sermons or Diſputings of different Men may be more like one another, if you compare Sermon with Sermon, and Diſputation with Diſputation, than the Stile of the ſame Man is like it ſelf, if you compare different kinds of his Writings, as Sermons with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, or either of theſe with an Oration fitted for a Learned
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41199:16"/>
Aſſembly. And 'tis an Obſervation very common, that the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers greatly differ in their Stile, and Air, and Notions, in their popular Harangues and Exhortations, their Polemick Tracts, and their Books of Devotion. So that whatever Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s way of management were in his other Writings, the difference of the Subject between them and this Book, gives a fair account of the different Stile, Air, and Thought, admitting it were as great as the Objection would ſuppoſe it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Stile and Air of Mens Writings be various, when the kinds of their writings are different, though they write without Diſguiſe, and only change their Stile, to accommodate it to the Subject or Kind of Writing in which they are engaged: How much more reaſonable is it to allow it muſt be ſo, when they on purpoſe do <hi>induere Perſonam,</hi> perſonate another Man, and endeavour to the utmoſt to appear like him for whom they write, and whoſe Name and Circumſtances they tacitly aſſume? What wonder that <hi>Idem non eſt Idem,</hi> the ſame Man appears not like himſelf, when he feigns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be another? as Bp. <hi>Gauden</hi> did, and wrote this Book as in his Majeſty's Name, though to be uſed, allowed, or altered as the King ſhould pleaſe.</p>
            <p>I have heard it hath been the cuſtom of former Reigns, for the Lord Chancellor, ſome Privy Councellor, or a Juncto of the Council, to pen or draw up Speeches, to be ſpoken by the King in Parliament, <hi>or on ſome other Solemn Occaſion, or in Declarations.</hi> Now any Man of Senſe will readily grant, that they who pen ſuch Speeches, keep not to their own Stile, or Air, or Thought, which they uſe when they ſpeak in their own Name or Perſon; but do the beſt they can, to adapt them to the Royal Perſon for whoſe uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they are prepared; and thus it moſt evidently was in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe.</p>
            <p>He proceeds in this Objection. <q>'Tis likely therefore that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and the then Duke, might tell the late Earl of <hi>Angleſey</hi> (which his Lordſhip might poſſibly forget) that the Manuſcript was not King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt his Hand, but a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s writing; which as it agrees with matter of Fact, it gives a fair account of the Alterations in the Copy, which the <hi>Memorandum</hi> grants were made by the King.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is ſoon ſaid, but very ill contrived, for 'tis not only highly improbable, <hi>but meerly ſuppoſitio impoſſibilis.</hi> If the King had writ it, why not correct his own Copy? But how ſhould Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41199:16"/>
receive it from the King? He was utterly unknown to him, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at a great diſtance from him, in the Parliament's Quarters, was under preudice with the Royal Party. I am ſorry this Gentleman writes, for once, ſo like him who feigned the Story of the King's ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to Mr. <hi>Simmonds,</hi> and he ſending for his Neighbour <hi>Gauden,</hi> and lending it him; and all this diſpatch'd in a trice, when Mr. <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> had been ſo many Years driven, for his Loyalty, from his Neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>But the fair and faithful Account, and which indeed agrees with matter of Fact, is, this was the Copy the Marqueſs of <hi>Hertford</hi> carried to the King, when he went to the Treaty at the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> from Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> and was humbly ſubmitted to his Majeſty's Wiſdom to be altered, corrected, approved, or diſallowed and diſpoſed of as he ſhould pleaſe; and accordingly the King corrected it, to fit it more to his own Senſe.</p>
            <p>Having finiſhed his Objections againſt the <hi>Memorandum,</hi> this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman proceeds thus to his Second Strength.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſing this <hi>Memorandum</hi> had all the pretended Advantages, I ſhall now produce ſuch Proof againſt it, which, the Circumſtances of the Evidence conſidered, muſt be allowed to over-ballance his Lordſhip's Atteſtation.</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1. We have the Letters Patents of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, Dated <hi>Nov.</hi> 29, 1660. in which <hi>R. Royſton</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Bookſeller, has that ſole Priviledg given him of Printing all the Works of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, among which Εἰκὼν Βασιλικὴ is mentioned, with a particular Character of Commendation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame Priviledg for Re-printing the Works of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt is granted to the above-mentioned <hi>R. Royſton,</hi> by his preſent Majeſty King <hi>James</hi> the Second; as appears by his Majeſty's Letters, Dated <hi>February</hi> 22, 1685/6, which Grant refers expreſly to the Firſt Edition, publiſhed by <hi>R. Royſton,</hi> in the Year 1662; and in which his Majeſty declares, that all the Works of his Royal Father were collected and publiſhed, which former Impreſſion, as I have already obſerv'd, makes particular mention of Εἰκὼν Βασιλικὴ. Now I leave it to any unprejudiced Perſon to judg, whether it is in the leaſt probable, that either of their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſhould tell the late Earl of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> that this excellent Book was written by Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> ſince they both have owned it to be their Royal Father's in ſo publick a manner. So that to uſe the Expreſſion of the Advertiſement, If the Declaration of two
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41199:17"/>
Kings, made with all the Circumſtances of Advantage, may be believed before a blind Manuſcript, written by a doubtful Hand, and grounded upon a private Relation; then we have ſufficient Evidence to ſatisfy the World, how much this Adviſer has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to impoſe upon it.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to the Letters Patent to print this Book, amongſt the Works of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, on which depends the whole ſtrength of the Argument; I confeſs 'tis a nice and tender Point, which good Manners, rather than want of good Reaſons, reſtrain me from fuller anſwering. I think it may ſuffice to ſay, with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and Caution, Kings uſe not ſo critically to inſpect all the minute Particulars of their General Royal Grants; but ſign them, as drawn up for the beſt Advantage of the Grantee: and an Under-Secretary or Clerk, who drew the Patents, put in what Mr. <hi>Royſton</hi> reckoned up, and deſired, and never boggled at inſerting Εἰκὼν Βασιλικὴ among King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Work, becauſe it was ſo reputed by moſt, and few knew the Myſtery, and they who did, did all they then could to hide and conceal it. And ſuppoſe either of the Kings had examined every particular, it was at utmoſt but conniving at a vulgar Errour, which it was not their intereſt too nicely to diſcover. And indeed the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſo palpably weak, that I am perſwaded this Writer, being a Perſon of ſo good Senſe, puts no Streſs upon it; but added it for Number rather than Weight, being rather too hot than too heavy to be dealt with; and for want of better (which 'tis exceeding hard to find, to prove what is not true) brings in ſuch an Argument, as in the Schools we call captious, or <hi>Argumentum odioſum,</hi> which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents uſe, allowably, to reject, not anſwer; becauſe 'tis deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not for real Proof, but to involve the Anſwerer in ſome Odium and Danger, and diſmiſs it unreply'd to, not becauſe they cannot, but becauſe they dare not anſwer it, or with <hi>Beneſeance</hi> ſhew its Weakneſs. And yet to approach one Step cloſer, what underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Man believes all the other particular Pieces, which make up the whole Volume of the Works of K. <hi>Charles</hi> I, to be originally penn'd by himſelf; but knows many of them were prepared by his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries and Council, and then peruſed and approved by him, and ſo became his, by adding the Royal Stamp of his Approbation and Owning of them: And the ſame was deſigned in this Book, as hath been ſhewed before. I ſhall conclude this Diſcourſe of the Letters Patent to Mr. <hi>Royſton</hi> to Print the King's Works, and infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this to be undoubtedly ſo, becauſe named amongſt them, with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41199:17"/>
a parallel Caſe, of a ſuppoſed Licenſe, to print the Works of as great a King.</p>
            <p>Admit Mr. <hi>Royſton</hi> had obtain'd a Patent to have the ſole Printing the Works of King <hi>David,</hi> and to make all ſure that no Man might in the leaſt invade his Priviledg, had got it explicitely inſerted into his Patent, all the Works of King <hi>David,</hi> that is to ſay, the whole Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> containing in number one hundred and fifty, (which is no hard Suppoſition) would it have followed hence that he who granted this Patent, had publiſh'd to all the World, that he knew and believ'd, that <hi>David</hi> was the real Pen-man of them all, tho ſome of the were certainly written ſome Ages after <hi>David</hi>'s Death, after the return of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity; and ſome by <hi>Heman, Aſaph?</hi> &amp;c. I grant his Patent might ſecure his Right to print all the 150, but 'twould be an invalid Argument to prove that <hi>David</hi> wrote all: It needs no Application.</p>
            <p>Having thus far vindicated the Truth of the Earl of <hi>Angleſey</hi>'s <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum</hi>; and conſequently, the Honour of his Lordſhip's Memory, from the Charge of Forgery caſt upon it, by ſhewing good reaſon why I cannot allow the pretended Proof againſt it, to over-ballance his Lordſhip's Atteſtation; which, how ſufficiently I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, I freely leave to the Judgment of all impartial Readers.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now ſubjoin the Remark I promis'd to ſet down, when I had anſwered the Objections againſt the <hi>Memorandum.</hi> And it is to ſhew, by comparing two ſignal Providences about this Book, how it ſeems to be the Will of God (for what ſpecial Ends is beſt known to his holy and unſearchable Wiſdom, at ſome of which, I may give my humble Gueſſes in due place) both to have this Book publiſhed and owned, as the Compoſure of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, for ſome time; and then to have the full Truth in due time, come to that light in which the ſtarting thoſe freſh Conteſts about it is like to ſet it.</p>
            <p>The Firſt, which I call a ſignal Providence towards its being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, is, the preventing its being ſeized upon, and ſtopt in the Preſs, when the Proof-Sheets, (if not alſo ſo much of the Copy as thoſe Sheets contained) were actually in the Hands and Poſſeſſion of, and carried away by as great an Enemy of the King's (as any Man living was) as Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> deſcribed him to me. I beg pardon for the length of the Story, which I ſhall relate from Mr. <hi>Simmonds,</hi> becauſe I think it worth the knowing, and alſo becauſe 'tis an Evidence I write not in this Affair by Hearſay and Conjecture, (as moſt do)
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41199:18"/>
but as of what I was privy to, and had an hand in all along from firſt to laſt.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Monday, January</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> or 15<hi>th,</hi> (for I have written Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials by me, which aſſure me, it could not be ſo early as the 1<hi>ſt,</hi> nor ſo late as the 22<hi>d,</hi>) Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> came to my Chamber at <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>-Houſe, where I then was Chaplain, and as a Man affrighted <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly</hi> ſpake to me, We are undone, or in great danger to be ſo, if you do not help us, which I hope you may, being in this Family. And when I ask'd him what the matter was? he having a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered himſelf, told me the following Story; and when he had done, we conſulted what remedy was to be uſed. His Story was as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I was, ſaid he, a while ſince at a Gentleman's Houſe, a Friend of mine in <hi>Hertfordſhire</hi>; whilſt I was there, there came a Troop of Horſe of Col. <hi>Rich</hi>'s Regiment, to quarter there-abouts; and the Lieutenant whoſe Name is <hi>Arwaker,</hi> quartered in my Friend's Houſe: He and I had many fierce Diſputes about the Cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and Parliament, and the Army's uſage of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. By which he was ſo provok'd, that at laſt he told me he would not ſuffer it, and ſaid, he would revenge it, were it not that he would not violate his Quarters. Whereupon, I thought the Place too hot for me to tarry longer in, and therefore haſted back to <hi>London,</hi> to my Lodgings in <hi>Carter-Lane.</hi> Not long after, that Troop came up to <hi>London,</hi> and the ſame Lieutenant quartered at the <hi>Bell</hi> in the ſame <hi>Lane.</hi> And yeſterday about twelve, as I was coming from Church to my Lodgings, we met each other in <hi>Carter-Lane:</hi> He knew me, but ſaid nothing to me, but turned again when he had paſt me, and dogg'd me to the Houſe I lodg'd in. As ſoon as I was in, and had ſhut the Door, he diſcharged his Piſtol with a brace of Bullets, to mark the Door, and haſted away to the <hi>Bell.</hi> As ſoon as the Maſter of the Houſe told me he was gone, I got away, and he preſently returned with ſix Troopers, and ſearch'd the Houſe for me, and breaking open my Cloſet, took away all my Papers, and the printed proof Sheets which lay looſe upon my Table: but they ſeeing them blotted, and thinking them to be but waſte-Paper, and not underſtanding the Title, it being Greek, or not having look'd into them, threw them down in the Dirt, which they of the Houſe obſerving, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up. We then, after conſulting what to do, concluded the beſt, if not the only way we could take, was to get a Note
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41199:18"/>
from Col. <hi>Rich</hi> to his Lieutenant, to reſtore all he had ſo taken from Mr. <hi>Simmonds.</hi>
               </q> It hapned, even beyond our Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, that the very ſame day Col. <hi>Rich</hi> came to dine at <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>-Houſe; and between Prayers and Dinner, I deſired Mr. <hi>Charles Rich</hi> (after Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>) to requeſt a Favour for me of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, who beckoned him to him croſs the Room, and deſired him to do me a Kindneſs, and referr'd him to me to know what it was: the Colonel drew me aſide, and ask'd what it was I deſired of him; I then ask'd him if there were not one Lieutenant <hi>Arwaker</hi> in his Regiment? he ſaid there was: I then told him he had, upon a pique, broke open a Miniſter's Cloſet, and taken away all his Sermon-Notes, and other Papers; and to diſguiſe the better, jocularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, He hath undone a poor Parſon, in robbing him of all his Tools; and pray'd him to write a Note to him, to require him to reſtore them.</p>
            <p>The Colonel was ſo kind and juſt, upon my fetching Pen, Ink and Paper, to write a Note to him, to re-deliver all; which he did ſo punctually, that Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> told me, he miſſed not one Paper, when his Landlord, who carried the Note, brought them; for he durſt not appear himſelf: ſo good and ſpeedy Succeſs we had, even beyond our Hopes, and there was no time to examine the Papers, all being diſpatch'd the next day after they were ſeized. Now what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever others may think, I judg it a Sign that God would have them publiſh'd for ſome eminent Ends, which, as I before hinted, I may touch hereafter; tho I argue not from his Permiſſive, to his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Providence.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſignal Providence, which ſeems to me to ſignify, that, on the other ſide, God would now have the Truth of this Affair brought to light, is, the Diſcovery of this <hi>Memorandum</hi> in ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and unexpected a manner, which is as generally known as the <hi>Memorandum</hi> it ſelf; to wit, at the Sale of the Earl of <hi>Angleſey</hi>'s Books by publick Auction. 'Tis like no Eye had ſeen it from the time of the Writing of it; and if Mr. <hi>Millington</hi> had not caſually o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the Book, there being ſome time betwixt the putting it up, and the Sale of it, it might in likelihood, have fallen into ſome Hand, who would either have not regarded it, or concealed it; to which may be added, Dr. <hi>Hollingsworth</hi>'s unſeaſonable provoking me, to declare what I now have done, in my own neceſſary, yea, unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vindication of my ſelf, from his inſulting and moſt falſe Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41199:19"/>For what remains of the two Sheets, tho I forbear the tranſcribing them, 'tis to avoid a tedious Work, which is needleſs; not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal any ſtrength in them, for I ſhall faithfully reply to all that hath any ſeeming weight in it.</p>
            <p>In Sir <hi>William Dugdale</hi>'s Account, here quoted, there are four Things aſſerted: to all which, I ſhall anſwer in order, denying what I know to be Miſtakes, and granting what I know or believe to be true or probable; and give the Reaſons of ſuch my Denying or Granting.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt and moſt material Paſſage, is that concerning Major <hi>Huntington</hi>; to which I ſay two things; (1.) That this Account of his Teſtimony, is wholly different from what was uſed to be alledged as his; and I have very often heard, but never met with this before; and 'tis highly improbable, that the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> would take any thing out of the Cabinet, and ſend up the Cullings to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who publiſh'd his Majeſty's Letters, on which the 21 <hi>chap.</hi> of the Book is written; nor had Gen. <hi>Fairfax</hi> that Reſpect or Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the King then, though he was heartily againſt his Murder. (2.) I will in the Faith of a Chriſtian declare what I had from Major <hi>Huntington</hi>'s own Mouth, without diminution or wreſting of it. I had ſo often heard Major <hi>Huntington</hi>'s Teſtimony alledged, that whilſt he had attended his Majeſty, or had the guarding of him, he ſaw the King frequently take theſe Papers out of his Cabinet and ſometimes read them, ſometimes write more; and that when he ſaw the Book, he declared thoſe Chapters in it were thoſe very Papers he had ſo ſeen.</p>
            <p>I having, I ſay, ſo often heard this alledged, and knowing well it was impoſſible to be true, had as earneſt a deſire to ſpeak with him, as I ever had to ſpeak with any Man; but could a good while meet with no Opportunity: but after ſome time, being at <hi>Tunbridg-Wells,</hi> the Major coming thither, with his Son-in-law Sir. <hi>J. Friend,</hi> a fair occaſion offered; for after ſome ſmall Acquaintance, and Converſe upon the Walks, the Major invited me to his Lodgings at <hi>Caverly-Plain,</hi> which I moſt readily accepted, and made him a Viſit one Afternoon: When I came, he received me very kindly, and all the Company, beſides himſelf, being engaged in their Divertiſements, I had as free an opportunity as I could wiſh to diſcourſe of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; after a while I told him I had a Favour to beg of him, in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he would greatly oblige me. He anſwered to this purpoſe, he would not deny me any thing in his Power wherein he might ſerve
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41199:19"/>
me. I then told him what I heard, as I have above related, and earneſtly intreated him to tell me what he knew, or had ſaid, of that Book. He willingly condeſcended, and began thus. <q>'Tis like you have heard how much Trouble this hath put me to; I have been examined by one Committee after another, and that time after time about it, and many things alledged that I ſhould ſay. But I will tell you freely and fully all I know, or ever ſaid concerning it, which was this: When that Book was publiſhed, and ſo confidently reported to be the King's; then ſurely, or I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, theſe are the Papers I ſee him ſo uſually take out of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet. But this was but my Conjecture, and I never declared it to be otherwiſe: for I aſſure you, I never read one Line or Word of the Papers in the King's Hand; I was not ſo rude, and I cannot ſay there was one Paſſage in theſe Papers, which is in this printed Book: For how ſhould I, never having look'd into them?</q>  Now whether I ſhould believe Major <hi>Huntington,</hi> whoſe Account, as in the Sight of God, I faithfully relate, as to the Scope or Subſtance of it, or an Account ſo utterly inconſiſtent with it, and which is in it-ſelf ſo highly improbable, let any conſidering Man judg.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I confeſs, as Sir <hi>William</hi> ſaith, it might be ſeen at the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> and Mr. <hi>Levet,</hi> for the Marqueſs of <hi>Hertford</hi> carried it thither; but if the Title was <hi>Suſpiria Regalia,</hi> it was one of the King's Corrections. For when Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> firſt ſhew'd it me, it was as is printed: for when I was bold to ask him how he could ſo impoſe upon the World? he bid me look upon the Title, 'tis the <hi>Portracture,</hi> &amp;c. and no Man draws his own Picture; as I ſaid before, <hi>Sect.</hi> the firſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I confeſs alſo Mr. <hi>Royſton</hi> might be ſent to, to prepare to print it; and 'tis likely the King might have ſent it as he had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and altered it, had not the Violence offered him prevented his purpoſe; or they who us'd his Name to write in, might do the ſame for the Printing it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For its being brought to Mr. <hi>Royſton, Decemb.</hi> 23. from Biſhop <hi>Duppa,</hi> agrees well with my Account as to the Perſons; but I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think it was ſome days before, unleſs he meant it of what he laſt received: for I am infallibly ſure, having a written Memorial to help me, that I brought up what was ſent by me, <hi>Saturday December</hi> 23. and I think delivered it to <hi>Peacock</hi> the ſame Evening.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:41199:20"/>In the ſecond Authority produced, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>William Levet</hi>'s long Letter, though there be many things very well ſaid, with a loyal Zeal, and juſt Indignation againſt the barbarous Uſage of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prince, yet there are but two Paſſages which reſpect this Book; the latter of which, about Mr. <hi>Royſton,</hi> is fully anſwered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>The other is, That he could depoſe the Book was his own, having oftentimes obſerved his Majeſty writing his Royal Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the bold and inſolent Behaviour of <hi>his</hi> Souldiers (His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Subjects) when they had him in their Cuſtody; and that he had the happineſs oftentimes to read the ſame in Manuſcript, under his Majeſty's own Hand, he being pleaſed to leave the ſame in the Window in his own Bed-Chamber.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is no ſuch Chapter or Title in all Εἰκὼν Βασιλικὴ; and therefore, though I do not deny but Mr. <hi>Levet</hi> might ſee his Majeſty writing ſuch his Reſentments, that is no Proof he wrote this Book, in which that Writing is not found.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he read it in the King's Bed-Chamber, in the time of the Treaty at the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi>; this I can eaſily grant him, for then, and thither, the Marqueſs of <hi>Hertford</hi> brought it: but that it was under the King's own Hand, I muſt beg his pardon, to believe he is miſtaken, unleſs it be underſtood of the Corrections and Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the <hi>Memorandum</hi> ſaith were written with the King's own Hand, or his Majeſty had tranſcribed it.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, whether theſe Authorities, or my Anſwers to them; and your Remarks upon the <hi>Memorandum,</hi> or my Replies in Vindication of it, be more ſufficient to clear the Point in hand, and give the Reader full ſatisfaction, muſt be left to his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if he will be pleas'd to conſider and weigh both, 'tis all the Courteſy I beg of him, <hi>or Courtſhip I will uſe to him.</hi>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div n="5" type="section">
            <head>SECT. V.</head>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this Labour, not choſen by me, but impos'd upon me by Dr. <hi>H.</hi> for my own Vindication, and to wipe off his falſe Accuſation, of being guilty of a falſe Story, by a free owning theſe Reaſons, for which I have occaſionally, and when I have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to do it, declar'd the Subſtance of what he hath forc'd me now to write, though not in any meaſure to that degree he hath taken li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to repreſent it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:41199:20"/>And firſt negatively, not to rob that excellent King of any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which was properly due to him, No Man of my Rank, loving him better, or honouring him more, while he lived; or more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring his Murder, or bewailing his Death, or (in my Station) giving more open Teſtimony againſt it, or ſuſtaining greater loſs for ſo doing: but I need not vindicate my ſelf, in a caſe wherein I never heard my ſelf accuſed or ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>But poſitively. The Reaſon why I have done what I own, was, becauſe, As <hi>we muſt not ſpeak wickedly for God, nor talk deceitfully for him,</hi> Job. 13.7. neither may we do ſo for any Man, even not for thoſe who are called Gods. 'Tis a well known, and as well approved a Saying of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>; An officious Lie ought not to be told to ſave the whole World. And I cannot deny, but there was more than an Appearance of ſome pious Fraud in this Affair, which I ſhould, by my Silence, have contributed to the maintaining of, when I was required to ſpeak my Knowledg of it.</p>
            <p>And though God had many Holy, Righteous, Gracious Ends to ſerve his Providence by, in the Publication of this Book; as, to render the Murder of ſo good a King more abhorred; to awaken many to Repentance who had contributed to it, (as I have heard it did) to diſpoſe the Nation to recal, and with Acclamations of Joy to receive the returning Royal Family, and many more. Yet as I find it expreſt in this very Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> the laſt, <hi>pag.</hi> 262. of the Firſt Edition; <hi>God's wiſe Providence (we know) oft permits many Events, which his revealed Word (the only clear, ſafe and fixed Rule of good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and good Conſciences) in no ſort approves.</hi> And I confeſs, I have many cogent Reaſons to perſwade me, that God was not well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> others, or <hi>my ſelf,</hi> for what we contributed to it. And though for the foreſaid Ends, and many others, he ſuffered it to ſucceed, yet I know not but he may have other Ends now to ſerve, by ſuffering this Diſcovery to be wrung and wreſted from me (I had almoſt ſaid) by ſome-bodies impertinent Affectation to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with what he underſtands not.</p>
            <p>However, it would be hard meaſure, and ſuch as other Men would be loth to have meted to themſelves, not to ſuffer a Man to reveal that, by concealing which he fears God is diſpleaſed, and ſo to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate him to labour under a continued uneaſineſs, and diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his own Mind: And if for avoiding this, any be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, I cannot help it. I only calmly intreat them to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be more expedient to pleaſe them than God? and in cool
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41199:21"/>
Blood to conſider what I have honeſtly and ſincerely written. If it convince not, if it ſatisfy them not, let them retain their former Sentiments; 'tis at this diſtance of time (being more than 43 Years) of no great Conſequence, whether it were ſo, or ſo; I am ſure, not of any equal concern to any Body to know it, as it is to me, when put upon it to diſcover it; for it would involve me in ſome Guilt to refuſe it, in ſuch Circumſtances, which I cannot ſee the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of to other Men, wholly Strangers to the Affair, how different ſoever their Opinions be, if they do not maliciouſly ſlander them who cannot be of their Minds, till they be convinced by ſtronger Arguments than thoſe upon which my Perſwaſion is grounded; which I conciſely will here re-capitulate (tho I entreat the Reader to review the two Firſt Sections.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. When Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> ſhew'd me the Heads of the deſigned Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and thoſe he had written, I ask'd him how he ſatisfied himſelf, ſo to impoſe upon the World? His anſwer was, Look upon the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, 'tis the Portracture, and none draws his own Picture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When we returned from Bp. <hi>Duppa</hi>'s, he told me the Biſhop had propounded two Subjects more to be written on, but deſired him to finiſh what remained; and he would prepare two Chapters on thoſe Subjects.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He told me he ſent a Copy to the King, in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> by the Marqueſs of <hi>Hertford,</hi> and humbly deſired to know his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Pleaſure concerning it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He told me the Duke of <hi>York</hi> knew he wrote it, and own'd it to him to be a ſeaſonable and good Service.</p>
            <p n="5">5. His Wife, ſome others, and my ſelf, believed it as firmly, as we could do any Matter of Fact, and there is no ſhadow of Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance why he ſhould put ſo groſs a Cheat upon us all; for 'twas <hi>before 'twas finiſh'd,</hi> and a good while before 'twas printed, we ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: and therefore he had not the Temptation to ſteal the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe it met with when made publick.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He delivered to me with his own Hand what was laſt ſent up, which I carried with me to <hi>London, Decemb.</hi> 23, 1648. Theſe are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41199:21"/>
the Reaſons, why I believe as I do, the Affirmative part of the Queſtion, that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> was the Author; and as I believe, I have alſo ſpoken: And if any Man can produce ſtronger Reaſons for the Negative Part, I do not ſay only I will, but that I muſt believe that contrary Part. For no Man who conſiders, can believe as he liſts, but the weightieſt Arguments will ruin the Scale.</p>
            <p>And if any will be ſo charitable as to reclaim me from an Errour he ſuppoſes I am in; I even beſeech him to write nothing for the Truth, of which he does not make the like appeals to God which I have done: for if he attempt it by Raillery or Railing, by feeble Conjectures, or Stories inconſiſtent with themſelves, or contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, he may with more Diſcretion ſpare his Pains: for as no wiſe Man will be influenced further by ſuch Tools, than to pity them who uſe them, or make themſelves merry; ſo I confeſs, I am ſo tired with examining ſuch Ware, <hi>and ſo cloy'd with ſuch Quelk-choſe,</hi> I ſhall <hi>have no Stomach to ſuch Fare,</hi> or think my ſelf concerned to take notice of it.</p>
