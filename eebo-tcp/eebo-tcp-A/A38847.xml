         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>SInce the ſtate of <hi>Ireland</hi> in general, and the condition of <hi>London-Derry</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is now become the ſubjects of moſt Mens Diſcourſe and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I think it not improper to ſend you the exacteſt and freſheſt Account I can, of what has been done in that Kingdom, which I have gathered from certain Gentlemen late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrived here, ſome in a ſmall Veſſel, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in a Wherry.</p>
            <p>They aſſure us that Major-General <hi>Kirk</hi> had lately ſent in another Meſſenger into the Town, with Orders to cauſe a White Flag to be ſet upon the Church-ſteeple, ſo ſoon as he got in, and to, fire a Gun for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Week's Proviſion they had yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that accordingly four Guns were fir'd from the Town.</p>
            <p>That Coll. <hi>Gourdon O Neale,</hi> being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Town, had made a very plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible offer to the Beſieged, That amongſt other advantages, they ſhould have their Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates, be permitted to wear their Swords, and go whither they pleas'd, provided they would ſurrender. But their anſwer was, That they had no reaſon to truſt to any Promiſe they made, neither would they hope or look for the performance of any thing that ſhould be offer'd them, ſince the ſolemneſt Aſſurances, and moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Capitulations had been violated to their Friends and Neighbours, when they came under their power, and that thoſe that had Protection granted them by the late King and General Officers, had notwithſtanding been plundered of all they had, and driven away from their Houſes and Habitations to ſtarve in the Fields; and therefore were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoved to ſtand it out to the laſt Man, hoping in a few days to be effectually relieved from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Lieutenant-General <hi>Hamilton</hi> being out of favour and employment, for having, as was pretended, uſed the Proteſtants in the <hi>North</hi> with too much lenity, the <hi>French</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who was commanded to go to the Siege of <hi>Derry,</hi> had refus'd to march, unleſs he might have a full power to act as he thought fit, declaring openly, that for his part, he was for putting all to the Sword, and would have the whole Country depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and laid waſte, as is uſually practis'd by the <hi>French.</hi> But in this he was oppos'd by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nobility, as being a piece of unſeaſonable as well as of unjuſtifiable Inhumanity, in the preſent jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Affairs. However, the late King condeſcended ſo far to his <hi>French</hi> Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to leave the Town of <hi>London-Derry</hi> wholly to his diſcretion, not thinking it fit to gratifie him any farther, in regard that ſeveral Towns, Families, and Perſons in thoſe Parts were under his particular Protection. Yet how little this Protection does avail in many places, the miſerable and deplorable condition of divers Towns and Families does abundantly declare, and the remaining <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> and Proteſtant Inhabitants being daily threaten'd by their implacable Enemies, with a general Maſſacree, and total Extirpation, ſo ſoon as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces ſhall ſet foot in that Kingdom. A Tragical Inſtance of their Cruelty has lately happened to the Biſhop of <hi>Waterford,</hi> to whoſe Houſe ſeveral <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> being come, they were very civilly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd by him; till at laſt ſome of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts that were in their Company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to pick Quarrels, and ſay very provoking things; the Biſhop admoniſht them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to Civility, and to a Chriſtian temper of mind and expreſſion, which they not regarding, the good old Biſhop being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged about 70 Years, was barbarouſly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his own Parlour, the Dean and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his Servants were much wounded, and eſcaped very narrowly running the ſame Fate with the Biſhop: When they had done this Villany, they fell preſently on rifling and plundering the Houſe, and carried with them all they could conveniently bring away, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fire to the reſt, which ſoon laid the whole Houſe in Aſhes.</p>
            <p>Theſe Gentlemen do further add, That the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> bigotted Papiſts being daily ſet on, and exaſperated by their governing Prieſts and Jeſuits, 'tis feared they may be ſoon tranſported to great acts of Cruelty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the merciful hand of Providence appear for their deliverance. That the late King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is not very well pleaſed with the poſture of his Affairs there, finding that the coyning of, and diſperſing of ſo much Copper Money, does do him a great deal of Diſſervice in the Minds of the People, who look upon it as a form'd Deſign to get into his hands what Money, Silver and Gold, he can, to make
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61722:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proviſion againſt another ſtorm; and it is ſaid, that a conſiderable Sum of Money is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready put on Board a Veſſel that went off from <hi>Kingsale,</hi> bound for <hi>France,</hi> wherein were alſo divers Prieſts and Jeſuits, who not liking the preſent condition of their Affairs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and being afraid to ſtay until the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages are ſhut up, thought fit to retire again into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That diſcontent and grumbling do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prevail amongſt the better ſort of the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,</hi> inſomuch that they begin to be leſs zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and concern'd for the Intereſt of the late King; that they are kept together with the hopes they are daily fed with of invading <hi>England,</hi> when every one of their Fortunes is to be made, and great Riches to be had; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made believe, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are ſo far from being in a condition to invade them, that there is a conſiderable Party in <hi>England,</hi> that has declared for the late K. and will be ready to joyn with them upon their firſt landing; that the <hi>French</hi> are Maſters of the Sea, and are daily expected to come and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport them over; that <hi>Scotland</hi> for the moſt part has declared for him, <hi>Dundee</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated all thoſe that appeared in oppoſition to his Intereſt, is become Maſter of the Field, and that <hi>Edinborough</hi> Caſtle holds out ſtill, theſe being the Arts wherewith the ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Minds and Hearts of K. <hi>James</hi>'s Intereſt in that Kingdom are kept up: This Practice became ſo faſhionable, that the very Night the News came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> of <hi>Dundee</hi>'s being defeated, and of the Caſtle of <hi>Edinborough</hi>'s being ſurrendred, great Bonfires were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be made, and ringing of Bells, to expreſs the Joy for the Victory <hi>Dundee</hi> had obtain'd over his Enemies, and that he was marching with his Victorious Army towards the Relief of <hi>Edinborough</hi> Caſtle.</p>
            <p>The Wherry that came in hither yeſterday, left <hi>Dublin</hi> on Thurſday laſt, on pretence of going to <hi>Wicklow</hi> for Fire-wood, and brought over Capt. <hi>St. George</hi> and five other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. They ſay, that the News at <hi>Dublin</hi> was, that about 7 or 8000 Proteſtants were driven to <hi>London-Derry</hi> Walls, who when almoſt ſtarved, the Town took Compaſſion on them, and brought them into the Town and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd them, ordering at the ſame time ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gallowſes to be ſet up on the Wind-Mill-hill, and all their Priſoners, amongſt whom they have conſiderable ones and divers Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, to be brought forth in view of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, on purpoſe that they might ſee how they reſolved to ſerve them; which they ſeeing to be in good earneſt, beat a Parly, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion it was agreed upon, that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants that had been driven to the Town-Walls, ſhould have liberty and ſecurity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their Habitations, without any injury or moleſtation, and accordingly they were all turn'd out, and the Priſoners carry'd back to the Town again.</p>
            <p>They Report alſo, that the Men of <hi>Derry</hi> have lately by a Stratagem given the Beſiegers a great defeat, and the manner of it was thus. It was concerted amongſt them, that none ſhould appear on the Walls for ſome time but two or three Perſons only, who were to walk up and down with diſconſolate faces and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing countenances, when in the mean time they had planted ſeveral great Guns againſt the Gate that leads into a Lane through which the Enemy muſt have march'd if the Deſign took effect. The Enemy obſerving ſo few on the Walls, was ſurprized at it, ſome of them had the Courage to advance nearer, and to ask the reaſon of their being ſo ſolitary, to which no Anſwer was at firſt made, but ſhaking of their Heads in token of diſlike of their Affairs within the Town. They proceeded then a little further, and became ſo familiar, as to diſcourſe the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels, and move a Parly, which being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, theſe Sentinels told them a melancholy Story of their lamentable Condition, offering that if they would ſave their Lives, and give them ſome Reward, they would next Night after ſuch an hour open one of the Gates. The Enemy believing all this to be true, drew up a great part of the Army nearer the Town, and ſeeing no appearance of Diſcovery or reſiſtance from the walls advanced at the time appointed to the Gate, which the Sentinels preſently opened; but they came no ſooner within the reach of their Guns, than they poured whole Volleys of great and ſmall ſhot amongſt them, which made terrible Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and forced them to run back in great diſorder; at the ſame time they made a Sally upen them, and follow'd them with the ſame Succeſs. In this Action, they ſay, they killed ſeveral hundreds of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>That the Proteſtants in <hi>Inniskilling</hi> have alſo had a very Fortunate Adventure lately, having taking ſeveral Carts loaded with Arms and Ammunition, lately come from <hi>France,</hi> and a good deal of Money, which was going to the Camp before <hi>Derry;</hi> and this has ſo exaſperated the Enemy, that there are about 15000 Men commanded to go and beſiege that place, but have not yet the Courage to advance nearer to it than by ten Miles, where they lie in two ſeveral Bodies, as well to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Intercourſe with <hi>Derry,</hi> as to hinder the other from Relieving it.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being now ſenſibly Alarm'd with the undoubted Reports of a preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion (as they call it) from <hi>England,</hi> do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think themſelves of Impriſoning and Securing the moſt conſiderable Proteſtants throughout the Kingdom: At <hi>Dublin</hi> they have but two Regiments, and are fitting out two Ships for Privateers, and to get Intelligence from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt. It is accounted a kind of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at <hi>Dublin</hi> to ſay that <hi>Edinborough-Caſtle</hi> is ſurrendred. Salt is worth 5 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel, and Coals 45 <hi>s.</hi> the Tun.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſent you the beſt Relation I could pick up from thoſe ſeveral Perſons that are lately come over, and if it can be any ways ſerviceable to you or your Friends, I ſhall have the Satisfaction of pleaſing a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that I owe ſo much Friendſhip and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to, as I do to your ſelf, as being with much ſincerity,</p>
