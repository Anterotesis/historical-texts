            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO THE People of the (so called) Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> especially the once more zealous and professing, who have so shamefully degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and declined from that which their Fathers the Primitive Protestants attained unto; yea, and from what they have but of late themselves, so zealously asserted and maintained to be the cause and work of God, which now they have generally shrunk from, the most part actively complying and concuring to the building up again and healing of old <hi>Babylon,</hi> that, even by themselves so called, and runing into the excess of ryot with the prophane world, (like the Dog returning to the vomit, and the Sow to the puddle, after the being once washed) others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lying by, and cowardly bowing under, and giving up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to a detestable neutralitie, which they in express termes vowed against to the most high God, not daring to bear a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony by their sufferings (plentiful occasion being given) for that, they, when having power made others suffer, who would not concur with them; and all of them (almost) joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a common enemy against the work and glorious appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God, brought and more abundantly bringing forth, among his people called in derision <hi>Quakers,</hi> by the <hi>Ismaels</hi> of this Generation, who mock at, and persecute the true Heirs of the promise, as ever it hath so been from the foundation of the World.</p>
            <p>Being certain particulars very weighty, and of great concernment for them to consider seriously, for their Souls good, directed unto them, by a true lover of their welfare and prosperity both temporal and eternal, a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner over them in this time of their great calamity and distress, who hath oft poured forth his soul before God on their behalf, that they might be saved, one of their brethren according to the flesh, and a true Protestant &amp; friend to the good Old Cause against <hi>Babylon</hi> in whatsoever appearance.</p>

Truly Friends, think what ye will, this is the thing (I say not the only) but the maine and chief thing thats in the quarrel betwixt God and you, your keeping up of Mens Traditions in place of the true institutions of Christ, while he now so comes forth to vindicate and restore them, your so adhearing to, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of the oldness of the Letter to the newness of the Spirit, that had its glory, but not comparable to this which excels, think not that this case and state of things, as then it was in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive dayes ended with those, that were then so zealous for, and loath to part with, the Law and outward Ministration thereof, in the Letter: Nay Friends, consider seriously of it in the fear of the Lord, lay by your passion and prejudice, for it concernes you near, consider of it in soberness, and yee shall truly find it your very case at this day, as then it was theirs, that same spirit for the outward, in opposition to the inward Ministration acting now as then, and heightned in its actings now, more then ever.

            <p>Many times hath it been in my heart thus to have spoken some few words unto you, (as these) who I dearly love in the Lord, and to whom I stand by many bonds obliged, if in any service I could be useful, but being somewhat sensible, what I had to do in my own particular case, and not altogether unacquainted with the deceipt of the busie enemy who in this day lies so near, ready to draw out the mind, to vent its own imaginations, and to speak of the things of God, without his warrant. I have hitherto with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden in expectation of a more fit opportunity, and a clearer warrant to go about it, which upon the perusal of these ensuing Papers was very clearly given to me: And indeed the subject spoken to, and the truths asserted in them, had been some years ago much on my heart, and seriously enquired after, and that this search and enquiry was of the Lord attended with a blessing to me, I can very clearly testifie; and finding the same things for the most part so sweetly, and with such a spirit of meekness offered unto you; I find it only my duty at present to be concuring in my Testimony, as agreeing fully with what in them is said, as most fit and necessary to be seriously minded by you. Dear Friends, it is high time for you to awake and consider what yee are doing, there is another thing to be brought forth in this day then yee have yet conceived of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And your guiltiness for opposing it, is greater then yee are yet aware of, nor will your apparent zeal for God, and his ordinances, which hath with some of you hitherto layen very near your hearts (this I do think it hath been and that yet it may be in a measure with some of you, where singleness of heart in any measure yet remains) serve the turn, if yee so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the way of provocation. Consider if something of the same snare and tentation be not on you, as was on them who so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously contended for <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets, the same was their plea, and upon the same grounds did they go on, to the rejecting and crucifying of Christ, as yee (some of you ignorantly and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more perversly) are in the way to do at this day; bear with my freedom, for truly I can say it, there is no bitterness nor pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion at my heart, while thus I use it, but the deep sence of the dreadful hazard yee are runing, hath drawn it from me, that if so in the will of the Lord yee may return to your first love, and so imbrace the guide of your youth again; the missing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting

from whom, hath alwayes been the cause of our Fathers the first Protestants their short comings and mistakes of the work of God, as well as of ours, that they were not in every thing come to own their true guide, though in some things they did it, and according to the simplicity that was in them, they were sweetly ordered by him, and accepted of him. And thus was it with them and so hath it been with many, who succeeded them; and was it not so of late among us also? yea, eminently so it was, both in <hi>Scotland, England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; mainly in this our great sin and guiltiness (as the foundation of all our mistakes and failings) its aggravated exceedingly beyond and above what was theirs, that the discovery of this duty of waiting to find the immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our guide in every thing as absolutely necessary (and at the very time when more fully and universally then ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly it was bestowed) being more clearly come, and coming forth then to them in that day it was, yet now more then ever, (which is dreadful to think of) is it both disowned and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted even by them whom I well knew to have sometimes sweetly enjoyed the blessed effects of the spirits immediate teachings in themselves, and so to have been instrumental to the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of others, such wonderful and astonishing effects does the deep and fiery tryals of this day bring forth, when every work of man is to be consumed, the Gold and precious stones (not built on the true foundation) as well as the Wood, Hay and stuble, that which is born of the flesh is but flesh, even that which is begotten, but through the knowledge of Christ after the flesh must be left behind, and parted with, else the Comforter cannot come that the fruitful field may become a wilderness, and the wilderness and solitary place a fruitful field; that so the Lord alone may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in this day, and all flesh lie low as grass before him: Let therefore the dread and terror of the Lord seize upon all, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the professing people of this Generation, that they may no more transgress in this thing of despising or neglecting, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate teachings of his Spirit: This key of knowledge which the Lawyers have taken away, this little stone which must fill the whole earth, dreadful is the judgment that is to be met with by such (whatever they be) who shall be found any more refusing to receive Jesus Christ thus coming to his Kingdome in their hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what then shall become of such who shall be found rebelling

against the true Light, so as to mock and persecute it?</p>
            <p>Dear Friends, as yee love your peace and safety beware of this, for it borders too near upon that guiltiness that will not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given: What needs you so to be afraid at the coming of Christ to his Kingdom, that so his will may be done in Earth as it is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? hath it not been the matter of your Prayers many a day, and do yee well to be angry, when its so gloriously coming to pass? O! how ill does this become you, &amp; how ill does he take it at your hands, were it not more becoming you (with him who so long since wished for it,) and rejoyced thereat) to desire that all the Lords people were Prophets? this would not have wronged, nor demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished any thing from his Ministry then, who was so eminent, nor will it now do from the true Ministers of Christ; those who make but a trade of preaching, thereby to win their living, as other tradesmen do, it is no marvel to see them very angry at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching glory of this day, if every one is to have the Spirit, and be permitted to speak publickly, what shall become then of our Ministry, say they, and how shall we live? And though there be some, yea, I conceive it may be granted, there be many among you, who upon this account do not own these men, nor this their plea for their pretended Ministry; but it may be really, think in your hearts that if there were no other thing in it, yee could with <hi>Moses</hi> wish for, and rejoyce thereat, even that all the Lords people were Prophets, and that it is a Gospel Ministry, and maintenance that yee stand for, and no other, and this being an institution of Christ, which now you perceive so to be struck at by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> yee may not so part with it. But Friends consider seriously of this matter, and it will not be found so, either on your part, or on theirs, whom with the world in scorn yee call <hi>Quakers</hi>; for we do really own both a Gospel Ministry, and a suitable maintenance according to the Scriptures, and yee do neither own the one, nor the other, but in words only; for though yee seem to disown those men who seek after the Ministry, and the standing of it, mainly upon the account of their hyre; yet consider it seriously if upon the matter yee do not the very same thing with them, and harden them in their guiltiness, and the people in their prejudice against us while yee so both by your profession and practice, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and imposed, and forced maintenance, which is so well known to be contrary to the Gospel, and condemned also by your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104192:6"/>
and many others of the Martyrs and servants of God, among our selves, and elsewhere. And again consider, however yee pretend to be for a Gospel Ministry; it is not so, no, yee are downright opposers, and persecuters of it; and alass that I should have such cause so to speak it. Can yee produce any institution of Christ, for justifying such a Ministry, which other wayes ye cannot maintain, but as through a line of succession from the gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Christ, descended upon you, and for keeping up of which a door must be set open, even for the ungodly to enter; for its plainly so affirmed by many of greatest note amongst you, that Grace belongs only to the well being, and not to the being of such a Ministry, and ministerial qualifications, as are by you required; see <hi>Durhame</hi> on the <hi>Revelation</hi> concerning Ministerial qualifications page 199. and where it is thus, A door set open for an ungodly man to enter (if he be furnished with gifts of humane Learning) and closely shut upon another; however he may be known to be eminently pious &amp; well furnished with spiritual knowledge &amp; gifts of the Holy Ghost, is this your Gospel Ministry? and yet thus it is according to the acts and appointments of your supposed, most pure and incorrupt Assemblies that hath been of late; so far are yee in this also become contrary to your Predecessors who both by their practice and profession affirmed that every faithful man and woman was a Priest, this is fully testified too, both by <hi>Knox</hi> his <hi>Chronicle,</hi> and <hi>Spotswood</hi> in his History of the (so called) <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> second book, page 60. and 61. are yee not ashamed therefore any longer to own such a Ministry? O Friends, come come down and lye in the dust, for greatly hath the Lord been thus provoked by you, and lamentable is the case of the people of these Nations, who are perishing in their sins, because of such a Ministry, such leaders of the people so causing them to err. And if it be here required what is that Ministry, and what are the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications thereof, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> require. To this I need say but little, the Author of the ensuing Papers having fully and faithfully spoken to it, and divers other particulars, whose Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony if not made use of will one day bear witness against you, as well against the multitude of time servers (who go along with every thing making no question for conscience sake (as the Apostle speaks in another case) as of others who are under some sort of suffering at present though in part, for a true Testimony, given
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104192:6"/>
in some particulars, yet even in this, no wayes answerable, nor suitable to what is required in this day, and all of you in your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral interests and capacities, as yee stand related to the (so called) <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and pretended work of Reformation, are very much called, seriously to mind what is therein said unto you, and if in soberness yee well consider of it, the thing intended may very clearly appear, that hitherto yee have been labouring but in the fire, as to the producing any work of Reformation which God allowes of; yea, and going rather backwards, from what was once attained to loosing, and plainly contradicting the true and honest principles of your worthy Predecessors, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> one thing rightly considered may evidently demonstrate to you, that your work hath not been nor is of God. The presence of God having been very eminently with the Author of these Papers in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after these things, this his service may be very useful for you, and will be so found, and acknowledged by those, whose eyes shall be opened to behold, how the Lord comes forth in this day of his power to try every work of man, and by the foolish things of the World to confound the wise. And to what is there said as to that particular, <hi>annent</hi> the qualifications of a true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, I shall only add these few words, that which so was necessary from the beginning, that which we have heard and seen, and handled with our hands of the word of Life, even the power and presence of the Lord, in his people do we (whom in scorn yee call <hi>Quakers</hi>) declare unto you, as the only essential qualification of a true Minister of Christ.</p>
            <p>And if this be it yee are so affraid of, that through the increase of this, the spirit of Prophesie, the true Church and Ministers of Christ, shall suffer loss, your fear upon this account is groundless, for these must stand, and only in that way must they prosper, so as that the gates of Hell shall never prevail against them, but if your fear be for the fall of that supposed Church, which they the hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings I mean, and yee so contend for both among your selves, and with others, which is truly Antichristian and no better, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly your fear is coming upon you, and for preventing of it (as yee may suppose) it is no marvel that ye so fall in with them for the defence of <hi>Rome,</hi> and her Ministry, or else as some who have been, and yet are famous among you, have both spoke and written, that yee must not only lose your Church and ministry, but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104192:7"/>
your Baptism, and the Bible, which the witness of God in your Consciences, cannot but tell you, how much yee did sometime detest and abhor so to say, or think untill of late through the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light of this day, in these and in many other truths of the like nature, your skirts are so discovered, and your heels made bare, and your way so hedged up of the Lord that yee cannot escape, either to own <hi>Rome</hi> as your mother Church, and so to return to her again, or fully to part with and come out of her for ever, and thence not to bring with you a stone of hers, either for a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Zion, or for a corner; nay, she must not be healed any more (which yee have been for a long time so endeavouring) but destroyed for ever, <hi>Ier.</hi> 51.9.26. and the time draws near, and yet thereby neither the Church, nor Ministers of Christ, nor the true Baptisme, nor the holy Scriptures of truth, nor any other of his true Ordinances shall thereby s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And because there be some, with whom I have had sweet fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship in the Lord, who its very like, would have expected some other thing from me, then such sharp and peremptory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and conclusions against them, and the way of the (so called) <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> in which I was bred with them, and had my beginning in the way of Godliness; I know very well, as things now stands with you, yee may think so, of what I have said, as also that it may be, yee would rather have expected some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the grounds, moving me to, and the advantages that I either looked for, or have found by such a thing: Now to speak shortly a word to this, I trust for it, yea, I am not without hope in it, that the day is coming (and frequently have I sought it of the Lord on your behalf) when ye shall so come to see the truth of what I say, and the necessity that (on your account) was on me for it, as that ye shall willingly acknowledge, that it was the greatest evidence of my dear and tender love in the Lord to you, which next to his glory led me to it, and that otherwise I should have been wanting of the expression of that true and sincere love which still I have unto you, as to the advantages I have found, which might be also offered, as the reasons whereby I was moved of the Lord, to make that so strange a change as yee account it, in owning these despised people called <hi>Quakers</hi>: I need say but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, if what is in this and the following Papers be well considered

of, and I know it is my place to lie low in the fear of the Lord, and to speak but little as to advantages, or any progress that I have made; and I acknowledge no man hath more matter so to do, yet in this case I may not be silent, but must in the fear of the Lord, give this my Testimony to the pretious people, and the truths of God asserted by them, that they do truely and really, both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and practice the new and living way in which holiness (by mortification and subduing a body of sin and death is attained, and have indeed come to the discovery of these things, even the life and power, which throughout the dark night of Apostacy hath lyen much hid, and hath been but very little felt, or known; yet such is the goodness of God to that pretious people, count of them, and call them what yee will, the true power and life of holiness is more truly known to them, and eminently holden forth by them, then by any people else that have come forth since the Apostles dayes, and a greater measure do they yet wait for, and as they are faithful, it will be multiplied on them; for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord is with them, and all their opposers must fall before them. Dear Friends consider then, how far yee have been mistaken concerning them, and with groundless jealousies carryed on with prejudice against them, as grosly erronious, blasphemers and the like; Nay, nay, friends, it is not so, and upon search yee shall find it far otherwayes, let your informers who many of them sinfully take things on report without tryal, and others who for maintaining of your own interests have made lies their refuge, let such say what they will, they are, and will be found a blessed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who as instruments in the Lords hands may be called the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairers of the breach, and the restorers of the paths to dwell in; they own dearly, and rejoyce in the use of the holy Scriptures, and desire to live up to the practice of all the truths of God declared in them. Beware then what yee say or think of them, and that yee approve not in the least their persecuters. And if as yet yee cannot receive what they offer, yet beware to reject it, or to judge of it, because yee cannot as yet close with it; the time may come when yee shall both see and receive it: If the work they are about be of God, (as undoubtedly it is, then it must prosper; beware therefore to be found any more in opposing of it, least yee also be found fighters against God.

            <p n="4">4. Your fore-fathers denyed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church, and her Priests, and Teachers, and Bishops, and Popes to be the true Ministers of Christ, but called them Antichristian, and her the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Pope Antichrist; from which testimony, you their posterity generally have shrunk, saying, that the Popish <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a true Church (though corrupt) which doctrine is generally maintained by you, and I have heard it asserted by those of no small profession, and it hath been preached in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and that their Ministers are true Ministers, though corrupt: And you say, if a Popish Priest should baptize a child, it holds good, and is a true Baptism; and this ye are driven to maintain by the hairs of the head (so to speak) when ye are arraigned, both by the Papists on the one hand, and by us on the other, concerning the rise of your Ministry, and the call of your first Reformers to preach the Gospel; for ye are drawn to a pittiful Dilemma, or Alternative, which is to confess, that either your first Protestant Reformers and Preachers were lawfully called by the Popish Priests and Bishops, to their Ministry, and consequently, that these Popish men were true Ministers of Christ, or else to grant they were called immediately of God; and ye find it most safe to uphold your Kingdom, to yield to the former, though against the hair, rather then to confess the latter; and a third shift cannot be invented, and ye should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to give away the main pillar of your cause against us, and howgh your selves, &amp; suffer the root upon which the National Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry grows, to be struck at by your own consent; for your main plea against our ministry and Ministers is, <hi>Who sent you? have ye the call of the Church? how can ye preach unless ye be called?</hi> Our answer is,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104192:17"/>
we are called of God, immediately by his Spirit, as was <hi>Isaiah, Amos, Paul,</hi> and many other servants of the Lord, who never had a call from man; and all that men can do in this point, is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, consent to, have union with such as are called of God to the work of the Ministry, which we dearly own, and refuse not to be tryed by such as have a spirit of discerning, and the approbation of such is accepted by us.

            <p n="5">5. And this is another weighty point, wherein ye have apostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed from your fathers the primitive Protestants, whose answer was the self-same with ours to the Papists (who asked them concerning their call to the Ministry) that they were called and moved thereto by God; and it was one of the points of <hi>Dittay</hi> against that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Martyr of Jesus Christ, <hi>George Wishard,</hi> one of your fathers, whom the Papists burnt for his testimony) that he had taken up the Ministry in his own head, and at his own hand, and was not called to it; which may be seen in the fore-cited Book, called the History of the reformation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which Book ye generally own, and it shall be a witness against you; and your fore-fathers were far from that poor shift you their posterity run your selves upon, that they were called of the popish Priests and Bishops; for neither were the most part of them called by such, nor any other creature, and such as were called by them, disown'd their call, and denyed them to be the true Ministers, or their Church (though corrupt) a true Church, as ye now generally maintain: And in the by I would ask you one question; if the popish Church be a true Church (though corrupt) as ye affirm, why have ye separated from it? and how can ye justifie your separation there-from? for it's another princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of yours, <hi>That a Church holding the fundamentals (which make it</hi> (say ye) <hi>a true Church) though there be many corruptions therein, is not to be separated from.</hi> And this principle ye have taken up to justifie your compliance with Prelacy, and this late Church-model and frame, which ye formerly vomited up, and not only quit it (and the poor Bishops could not be permitted to live among you, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you pulled them out of their places, ye banisht them) but vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God against the same. And now it stood somewhat against your stomacks to receive it among you again, and honour such men, as ye accounted unworthy of a foot of ground in the Nation, and excommunicated then, till ye fell upon this pill, whereby ye got it

            <p n="6">6. And your fathers, the primitive Protestants, denyed that a wicked man could be a true Minister of the Gospel; as may be read at large in <hi>Fox</hi>'s Book of Martyrs; <hi>No man living in mortal sin could be a Minister of the Gospel,</hi> was their common assertion; and it was one of the points of <hi>Dittay</hi> against <hi>Iohn Husse,</hi> for which he was burned, because he affirmed a wicked man no Minister; and have ye not shamefully shrunk from them herein, who maintain it, that grace is not absolutely necessary for the being of a Minister, and that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men may be Ministers, and ye would prove it from <hi>Iudas</hi> being an Apostle: Now <hi>Iudas</hi> fell from his Ministry (as saith the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) in selling his Master Christ, which generally your Ministers have done; and have they not thereby fallen from their Ministry, supposing, but not granting, they had once been true Ministers? and is it not exceeding ignorance, and stupidity to affirm, that a wicked man, who knows not Christ, nor the things of his Kingdom (as saith the Apostle, the natural man understands not the things of God) can be a preacher of Christ and his Kingdom? is it not as great a riddle, as who would say, a blind man can give a true description of light, or colours, or Pilot a Ship, shew the right way to a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger? yea, and much more; how can they preach unless they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? <hi>We believe, therefore have we spoken,</hi> saith <hi>Paul.</hi>

is evident by the Books of Policy and Discipline, framed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Council, <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. which thing by you is called dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and confusion; and it was an usual practice among them, without distinction of Clergy-man or Layely, when they met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to speak of the things of God, and of his work on their hearts, every one according to his gift; and these who spake were not distinguished from these who heard, by the name of <hi>Master,</hi> and stepping up into a Pulpit, and by getting the hands of so many laid upon them, or by a black Gown, or Canonical coat: And <hi>Iohn Husse,</hi> an eminent Instrument of the Reformation, and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher in <hi>Germany,</hi> did wear a gray coat, which he gave to his friend some dayes before his death, as <hi>Fox</hi>'s Book of Martyrs relates.

So foolish are ye become in your reasonings; and there are many living yet in the Nation, who remember of women who have spoke so feelingly, so lively, and experimentally of the Lord's work upon their hearts, that many eminent Preachers and Ministers, so accounted, have thought shame to open their mouth in their presence.</p>

Your fathers, the primitive Protestants were against Tythes, and that Ministers should have temporal possessions (as an Hire for their preaching) so said <hi>Iohn Wicklife</hi>; and they had not their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and thousands allorted to maintain them, far less would they force people against their wills to give them maintenance, and poynd them, or put them to horn, and imprison them, as ye will do. And your fathers did bear a notable testimony against the greediness and covetousness of the then Priests, as we do against you, for which ye so hate us, and stir up the Magistrate against us, as the Priests did against your fathers, and they could not suffer any man to reprove them for their covetousness: And I read of a poor man, in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Reformation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who but through his sleep, said, <hi>The Devil take the Priests, for they are a greedy pack,</hi> and the poor man was pursued for his life, and made to burn his Bill; and though we were silent, would not the stones rise up and witness against your covetuousness? and do not the poorest idiots in the Land see it? and is it not a Proverb among the people, the <hi>Kirk is gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>? Oh, what a dishonour have ye brought upon the Name and Truth of Christ! And were it not for a livelihood, and worldly honour and respect, would so many betake them to such a work? and does not your gain from your quarter, which you so punctually exact, (and they that will not put into your mouths, ye prepare war against them) and your removing from one Parish to another, where ye can have a fatter stipend, manifestly prove, ye are moved thereto, rather from a principle of covetousness, then from any desire of doing good to the souls of the people? and how came ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you to be Teachers? was it not the design of your Fathers and Relations, who saw it a ready way for them to put you in a livelihood, and sent you to Schools to learn the Calling; as ever the Shoo-maker, or other Tradesmen past his Apprentiship, and then becomes free to use the Trade? the thing is well known, and I speak it with regret; and have not many of your selves sometime a day intreated the Lord, that he would send a purge, and put away out of his house such buyers and sellers? and now the Lord is come to make the purge, and who of you can abide the day of his coming?

the purge goes so deep, its like to scourge you all out at doors, and e're yee be put out, yee will rather hold in who are in, and seek to uphold one another, but yee shall all fall together. And whereas yee plead, that he who preaches the Gospel, should live of the Gospel; so say I, but I certainly know, if the Magistrate would but take away his force whereby he compells the people to put into your mouths, and if your selves would forbear your cursing, &amp; excommunicating them, (all which is rigid law and far from Gospel) your Gospel could never maintaine you, and many of you would be let starve.</p>

Your Fathers the Primitive Protestants professed themselves against Traditions, and all whatsoever that had not a warrant in the word of God, in the matter of his worship; <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> said that every thing though not contrary, yet if besides the word of God in his worship, was to be denyed, and yet this day has discovered seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, which they kept, to have been but the traditions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men, but they knew not so much, and professed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against all traditions whatsoever, and what was not warranted of God; and now have yee not shrunk from them herein, and taken up many things, they did cast from them as traditions; and you say, the light of Nature or humane reason and prudence, may supply what is wanting in Scripture, to teach men at least some Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in the worship of God, for order and decency, which is the Doctrine of your Church confession of Faith: Oh have yee not thus shouldered Christ off his Throne, if he by his spirit is to direct men as to the substance of Worship, will he be wanting in the lesser to teach the Circumstances also, and the order and decency; does not all true order and decency, come from the Lords Spirit, who is the God of Order? and is this to do in Faith, to follow the direction of the light of Nature, which is stark blind in the things of God, and humane reason and prudence cannot step one right step herein? and have not hundreds of the Popish supperstitions crept in, under this mask of order and decency? and is not this the Prelates plea at this day, for his service book and Organs, and Surplice, and Altars, and sign of the Cross; lo, how have yee given away your cause in this also.</p>

And though yee lay such stress upon the observation of the first day of the week for a Sabbath, yet one of your Fathers (<hi>Calvin</hi>) denyed the observation of that or any other day, since the coming of Christ, to be commanded of God, (and so many hundreds of Protestants) and is it not a great abomination, which may make the very Sun to blush, whose day yee call it, to profess to keep a day holy unto God, wherein yee ought not to think your own thoughts, nor speak your own words, nor take your own pleasures, and yet spend it so as yee do in gluttony and drunkenness, sporting, &amp; gaming, buying and sell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, worldly communication, quarreling and fighting, and will not the Minister, who in the Pulpit hath been telling you, yee should not speak your own words in that day; but so soon as he comes forth falls as fresh to the worldly discourse, as any other; which I have oft observed to the grief of my heart as many others have done.</p>

Now say yee generally, we have not seen a clear call to sufferings as yet, and we should not run upon them without a clear warrant and call, we are not put to it to take any contrary oath to the former, and there is not any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise or oath required of us, to the owning of that we covenanted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, only its laid on us to hear them, and pay their stipends, and we may do all this without owning them, and they shall never have the approbation of our hearts, and when an opportunity serves, that we may shake off this yoak, we shall be found ready to give them a heel-chop, and say some of the (so called) Ministers, why may we not preach under the Bishops, and sit in Synods with them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the ordering Church affairs with them, and give obedience to their lawful commands; and yet this cannot be called an owning of them, and we conceive it's no breach of our Covenant, and the things required of us, are not so weighty as that they should make us quit our calling, the preaching of the Gospel, what would become of our poor flocks, if we should not give some kind of submission, or condescendency unto them, we could not be permitted to preach, and some of us have got the favour, that no oath or ingagement is required of us; they who have given (as the most have done) let them see to it, we are free.</p>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> As for your alledging that yee see not a clear and manifest call to sufferings, it is no wonder so long as your minds are abroad, wandered from the just and righteous principle of God, his witness in your Consciences, which can only let you see the call, but now yee not consulting herewith, but misregarding it, and looking out to see your warrant or call in the Scriptures, yee may look long enough upon them, e're yee can see your call; therefore, the Light of Christ, in your Consciences being gone from, the deceitful heart will draw, the letter of the Scriptures to its own inclinations, and promp you to put such a gloss upon it, as may keep you from the cross; and while ye abide in this state, should ye be tryed further, &amp; put to these things, yee think for the time, yee could not condescend to, and yee should have a clear call then to suffer, yet the deceitful heart would furnish you with a second shift, and a third, till yee should never see a call to any thing at all; and is it not with many of you so? is not

your call grown dark &amp; unclear to you in many things, which before the cross came, was clear enough to you. Now whereas yee say ye are not put to it, to make any contrary oath or promise, and so yee think yee have not broken your Covenant. I ask, is not a real practical breach of it, aswell, a breach (if not more) as a verbal? yee have broken it in your practice, forasmuch as yee have in the least bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or yielded to them, which as yee mind Gods witness in all your Consciences, it will shew you: Now, admiting, or giving, but not granting, that your hearing them, and paying them their stipends, were not an owning them, yet I query you, is it a disowning them? can yee be said to disown them? while yee so uphold them, and come at them, I am sure, if yee be not exceedingly blinded yee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call, your hearing them, and paying them their stipends and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, a disowning them? well then, yee neither own them, nor disown them; and is not this the detestable neutrality yee in express termes covenanted to God against, I appeal to the witness of God in all your Consciences; if it be not so, in the like manner I answer to you called Ministers, is your Preaching under them, and sitting in Synods with them, and coming in the ordering of Church affairs together, and your obeying their commands a disowning them? Nay, yee cannot say it, except yee bewray your exceeding folly; well then, ye neither own them nor disown them, and is not this the detestable neutrality yee vowed against? and if perhaps some of you have not given any oath or promise to these men (and it is rare if it be so) yet your practice is as real a breach as an hundred oaths and promises; and whereas yee say, obedience may be given to their lawf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And as for your alledging these things, are not so weighty, required of you, as that yee should be put from your preaching; I answer, admitting yee were true Preachers, or Ministers (for I argue according to your own principles) yet e're the least circumstance yee should yield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

And your Fathers the Primitive Protestants affirmed, that when any thing contrary to sound Doctrine was set up, and brought in, the Ministers who stand upon the watch tower, should not keep silence, but testifie against such a thing, and forewarn the people to be aware thereof! and they judged silence to be a sinful connivence witness the Protestations made several times against such things, and but of late dayes, the Protestation made at the Cross of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> on the 22. day of the Month called <hi>September</hi> in the year 1638. wherein they largely shew, backing what they spoke, with pertinent Scriptures to that purpose, that they ought not to be silent: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it was a principle among them, (the first Reformers) that they should not forbear to preach, though all the powers on earth should forbid them, whatever punishment could be inflicted upon them therefore, and it was their practice also, for they put their lives in hazard, and many of them lost their lives, bearing their testimony, and they accounted the winning of souls of people, of more worth then the saving their bodily lives; and as yee may read in the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Reformation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to such who queried, why was not obedience given to the Magistrates command? it was answered its better to obey God then man, as <hi>Peter</hi> answered the Rulers of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Now such of you of the National Ministry who stuck to take the Canonical oath or to make an active complyance, with the Bishops, as the rest of you have done, yet have yee not shamefully shrunk he ein, yee who could open your mouths wide, against these things, now set up, before they were brought in among you, when there was no hazard of speaking, and talk boldly against the Bishops and their corruptions, and spend a good part of the hour glass on such a purpose; but now are yee not shrunk dumb with a panick fear, that hath overtaken you, and yee have quit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your Ministry at the command of man, far unlike the good Shepherd that flees not when the Wolf comes, but stands up to defend the flock from the Wolf, and laies down his life for the sheep, but the hireling flies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is an hireling, as yee have done; and have yee not rather

(I speak according to your own principles) regard yee no more their souls, nor your bodily maintenance? or is there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put in your Pulpits, is that enough either? can yee not preach elsewhere then in a Pulpit? may yee not preach in a field, or from house to house, as did <hi>Paul</hi> and many others, yea, your Fathers did so; or do the people refuse to hear you, then yee have but badly learned them, &amp; they are not taught so much love as to stick to their Pastor when the wolf comes; but should yee not preach to them whither they will hear or forbear as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did, and was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Lord so to do; or have they commanded some of you to go over Seas? should yee have obeyed that unjust command? or if they had taken you away by violence, what hinders but yee may return to the flock, were not the fear of man over you?

of <hi>Dittay</hi> against them) but against swearing in any case, or at all.</p>
            <p>So by these 14. or 16. Articles, let all in whom there is any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of ingenuity, or simplicity, try your present Church constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with the Light wherewith Christ hath enlightned you, examine, and ye will find, that though ye call your selves the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church, ye are far from the first Reformers; and that the whole Protestant Church in <hi>Europe,</hi> hath much degenerated from the primitive Christians and Protestants, both in principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and is become quite another thing, retaining the name like an old rotten Ship, that hath been so often clamped and clouted, that all the former timbers are worn out, and others put in their place, yet keeping the name, and somewhat of the form and shape; and ye have sailed long up and down in this old rotten Ship, which is just upon the splitting, and suffering shipwrack; and it were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for you, if ye would swim forth out of her for your lives; and the greatest loss of all, is of the Spirit and Life of your first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, as appears by your fruits and conversations at this day. Is not that fidelity, honesty and simplicity, much lost, and quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, that some yet living remember was in the Land, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, falshood, guile, and deceit come in the room thereof; and one brother cannot trust another, and love is waxen cold, and much selfishness crept in, and the profession or Religion made a meer cloak of maliciousness, and that temperance and sobriety in words, diet and apparel, that was among many is quite gone, and wantonness, gluttony, and drunkenness, whoredom, cursing, and swearing, and prophaning of the name of God, and fearful oaths come in stead thereof, and tyranny and oppression, more then among savages, and yet people given to such wickedness, are accounted your Church-members, and partake of all the Church-priviledges with you; and when any such die, the cry goes through your streets, there is a faithful brother departed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or when any of them hath a child to be sprinkled, the Priest will cause him to rehearse the Articles of his Faith (and he hath no more faith, nor so much as the devil, for the true faith purifies the heart, and lodges in a good conscience.) Oh horrid abomination! and is not the zeal among Professors quite withered, and deadness, laziness, stupidity, security, neutrality, carelessness and sottishness, generally overgrown them, and all manner of iniquity abounds?</p>

            <p>GIve ear unto me, O ye people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of what quality or degree whatsoever, and I will shew you the true and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgement of God (from whom I have received it, and by whom I am moved to declare it unto you, for your good) concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your late proceedings in the matter of your reformation from, and your covenanting against Prelacy, and the corruptions and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Superstitions accompanying it, and other particulars above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>A zeal there was in many of you (Rulers, Teachers, and People) in that day for the Lord, and his name and truth, which he did ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly regard, and it was marked before him, though the most of you all along minded more your selves, and how to compass your selfish, covetous, and ambitious designs then his honour; and ye made the name of truth and Religion a meer clock to cover and mask your hypocrisie with, yet a true simplicity and uprightness of heart was among others of you, and ye did well in disowning and departing from such men, who gave themselves forth to be the Lord's Ministers and servants, but they ran, and he sent them not, and their covetousness and ambition, and seeking how to please men for their own ends, and not his honour, nor any true zeal for him, set them on such a work, to Lord it over the people, which

he had forbidden, and it is abomination to him, together with the many things accompanying them, which they gave forth for his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, good order, decency and comliness in the Church, but were the meer inventions of men, and <hi>Babylons</hi> golden Cup of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications; and that ye vomitted up, and refused any more to drink of this cup, or to admit of such things as his Ordinances, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his worship, or as if he allowed it (whereby your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is exceedingly agravated before God, and his indignation and jealosie burns as fire against you for your returning thereto) and because of the iniquity of such men, their pride, pomp, covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, tirany and ambition his wrath kindled against them, and he poured contempt, and desolation upon them, for the cry of their wickedness, together with the Prayers and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>upplications which came from many in that day (because of them) ascended up into his Throne in the time of their great affliction of Spirit to see his Truth, and Name so much dishonoured, and the Lord heard and regarded, and delivered them from that, which was their trouble and grief of heart, and he removed that out of the way, which was a great let unto his work, and glorious appearance in the Land, and after the removal thereof, the Lord put a fair oppertunity in your hands to have been blessed instruments in his work, whereby had ye improved it, ye should have been at this day a glory in the Earth, a Praise, a Renowne, and a Blessing, and your memory should have endured; as a sweet savor unto all succeeding Generations. But he had many things against you, whereby he was provoked to lay you by also, so that ye should not be honoured (nor ever shall be in the state ye are in, and way of your proceedings) as instruments in his glorious work, which he hath purposed to bring (and is bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) forth in the earth even a work of wonders and admiration, whereby he will make to himself a name everlasting therein, and give matter to all the simple-hearted of thanksgiving, and praise for ever and ever; and this work he is bringing forth this day in the midst of you, and yee are so far from joyning issue with him therein, that ye are all opposing it, but it shall go on, and prosper, over the heads and bellyes of all gainsayers on the face of the whole Earth, and if yee repent not and give way unto his determination, he will bring this word to passe against you; <hi>Behold ye dispisers, wonder and Perish.</hi> And now hear the righteous judgment of God concerning these things he hath to charge you with, and have been snares unto

you, and matter of provocation unto him against you, for, although a true and tender Zeal (in a measure) there was in many of your hearts in that day for the Lord, and his Name and Truth; yet much of a fiery, headstrong, furious false Zeal, not according to knowledge, and which was not begot of the Lords Spirit, nor kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at his Alter, did company the same, and much prevailled over that which was pure, and tender, and of his begetting, and yet he regarded this, and because of it he loved and pittyed you, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered you long, till he could bear no longer, for ye were become as those, yea, and worse, whom he spued out before you, against whom his controversie was: and you went forwards in the counsels of of your own hearts, and advised with flesh and blood, and not with the Lords spirit, what yee should do, and yee relyed upon the arme of flesh, and thought to have reformed the Land with your carnal weapons, and power, and force, and might, not considering his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination which he spoke by the word of his mouth, to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of old, <hi>not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit saith the Lord.</hi> And yee dealt cruelly and roughly with such as had not freedom, nor clearness to go on with you, in the manner and way of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and so yee became guilty of the same iniquity, yee cryed unto him against in those men, who dealt cruelly and tyranically with your selves, and yee constrained many hundreds of poor people in the Land to vow unto God and make a Covenant with you, who knew not what they were doing, no, nor knew him at all; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause yee mixed your selves in, with a company of ignorant, vile, prophane and abominable persons, without all fear of God, and drew them along to concur with you, thereby thinking to make your selves stronge and mighty by reason of number and unformity, therefore was the Lord provoked against you, for he regarded none of these things; the vows of the wicked are an abomination to him with all their services, and he accepteth no uniformity, but that which is of his spirit, which knits the members of the body toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and admits nothing unto union with the body, but that which is of his begeting, and but two or three fearing the Lord joyning together in a perpetual Covenant, to stand up witnesses for his name and truth, are dearly regarded by him, but many thousands associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating together out of his fear he regards not at all. And forasmuch as by your vowing and covenanting, yee proceeded to put a stop and limit to the Lords spirit in any further discovery of his name
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104192:28"/>
and truth, his wrath waxed exceeding hot against you, and he loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed both you and your Covenant, and suffered it, as it is at this day, to be trampled under foot, and permitted your enemies, which were buried in the very dust, and their memory almost perished, to rise up against you, (to wit the Prelats) and bring you in greater slavery and subjection then ever, (and now they are doing their work, and when it is done they most return to the place whence they came, and the time is near) and many other circumstances in your proceedings, the Lord never own'd, nor shall own, in which as yee mind his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in all your Consciences, it shall instruct you, and also show un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the hypocritical, treacherous, deceitful, ambitious, forward spirit, that moved in you, and set you on work many times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his Spirit was grieved, and that of his begetting over topped, and oppressed. And above all the great controversie of the Lord with and against you, was and is, that yee got up above the cross of Christ and turned from it (the cross which is the power of God) which would have kept your feet in a straight, even, stedy course, so that yee should not have declined out of the right path, either to the right or left hand, and it would have proved a righteous ballance unto you, whereby ye might have weighed every motion that arose in your hearts, and thereby known what was of the Lords spirit, and what was of your selves, and of the suggesti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104192:28"/>
cast upon it, and suffered the earth in you to come over, and ye hid the talent the Lord had given you, therein, even the noble and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and blessed gift of his Light, and the manifestation of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (given to every man to profit withal as saith the Apostle) which would have been a sure foundation unto you, and would have taught you in the infallible wisdom, how to have reared up the building and frame, even to the setting of the least stone or pining thereof, and it would have cemented and knit every part together, and given it a comely proportion, and all its due and proper dimensions, in height, bredth and length, and made every stone living, and it should have been a glorious building indeed, a spiritual house to offer up a spiritual service, and sacrifice to God continually; and though the winds had blown, and the rains descended, and the floods had come, and assaulted it, yet it should have stood, which it hath not, but hath fallen, and the fall of it is great, and it hath filled you with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, confusion and astonishment, and darkness hath so overtaken you, and the vail is grown so thick over your hearts, that you see not as yet, cannot see your own folly, and that your building was but on the sand, and the work of your own imagination, out of the wisdom of God, and this I am moved of the Lord to declare unto you that it hath been so, and though your frame was somewhat more spacious and taking, to the eye of man, (being somewhat in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nearer the letter of the Scriptures) then that other cast down by you, yet it was as far from being the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or House of God, being not of his Spirit; for this ye had gone from in your own particulars, and at length became so impudent as to deny such a thing could be expected, to wit, the leadings of the infallible Spirit of Christ, to teach you, and guide you infallibly in your proceedings; and ye set the letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures above it, and in it's room, together with your own imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, for ye being gone from the Spirit of Truth, the eye which read the Scriptures aright, came to be put out, and the false eye opened, which read them backward; and the Scriptures were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by you to a wrong sence or meaning, and ye drew them to the square and rule of your opinions, which the erring mind, through Satans suggestion had begot in you; and now ye fathered your opinions upon the Scripture, and they were but the brats of your own imagination. And oh, what were the materials of your building? were they living stones polished and smoothed by the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104192:29"/>
power of God? or rather, were they not the most rude, profane rabble and multitude of the world, the same whereof the Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and popish frame was composed of? and who were the builders? were they men taught of God standing in his wisdom? was your Ministry a spiritual Ministry? were they able Ministers of the new Testament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit (such as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures speak of?) were they called from heaven by the Revelation of Christ? or rather, was not your Ministry even such as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, of mens making, which stood in man's wisdom, and taught of men, as among the very Papists? yea, it was even so. Oh, how little hath the teaching of God's Spirit been regarded! were they not accounted able Ministers who could talk upon the letter, and give many good and fine words to the people, and speak the Saints experiences recorded in Scripture, which generally they never knew themselves, or if any knew somewhat of that nature (as some did) it was not principally regarded; and men were let pass for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters who were gifted with humane learning, and gifts under which the best induments of knowledge or utterance, which come not immediately from the Revelation of the infallible Spirit of Truth, may be comprehended; and after ye had quit the Service-book, and that way of worship in set forms, and denyed them as dead life-less things, your humane learning and abilities (together with the customary way ye had inured your selves to) prompted you to talk and utter many words before God, which yet was as far from spiritual worship as the other; and if at any time somewhat of the Lord's Spirit moved and breathed among you, as it did, for the Lord much pittied for his seeds sake, yet it was much suffocated and choaked, by your running forth after the imaginations of your own hearts, ye not knowing the Cross which stayes the mind, and gives a check to the forward proposterous spirit, which is rejected of the Lord with all its services; and because your minding more the words and form, and visible things, then the living power, whereby the Lord was provoked more and more to withdraw from among you, and leave your house desolate, as at this day it is. And your Presbyterian form of Church-discipline, Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it was nothing upon the matter better then the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, there being no material difference (in the sight of God, to render it more acceptable to him) be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

hewn stones; the Sycomers are cut down, but we will build with Cedars, and make the frame more able and firm then before to stand out the storm. But I say unto you, in the name and authority of the living God (should ye attempt such a thing till ye come to his Light, and the leadings of the infallible Spirit of Truth in your particulars) it shall not prosper, it shall be as with them who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the rebuilding the walls of <hi>Ierico,</hi> and have no better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and ye shall but labour as in the very fire, and weary your selves for very vanity: I have determined, saith the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, to race all to the foundation which is not of my building, to pluck up root and branch; and all which is not of my planting, I have said to my Messengers and servants, go ye up upon her walls, break down her battlements &amp; bull-works, for they are not mine, &amp; level all to the ground, and let them not be built for ever and ever, Amen, saith my soul. And it is God's rich mercy, love, and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that he hath brought this day over you (could ye but open your eyes to see it, and some shall see) that ye may suffer loss in these things which have been and are a loss and snare unto you.</p>

            <p>THe day of God is the Revelation of his living and eternal arm in and among the children of men, to put an end to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and recover lost man, to the blessed, holy, pure, innocent state, wherein he was created by God, who breathed in him the breath of life, and he became a living soul; it's the setting up the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, the eternal King of righteousness, in the hearts of the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the pulling down the Kingdom of Satan, who hath ruled over the sons of men, as God, and swayed his Scepter as an absolute Monarch in the earth. It's the arising of the Son of righteousness with healing under his wings, in the shinings forth of his pure Light, for the dispelling the the thick <hi>Egiptian</hi> darkness that hath long covered the earth, and brought upon the Inhabitants a sad, sore, and dismal night, wherein
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104192:31"/>
the blessed, sweet, and amiable countenance of God hath been eclipsed, and vailed from men, whereby they could not live to God, for that life is in the light, which by the power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of darkness hath been much shut up; so that it hath not shined forth in its glorious brightness upon mankind: It's the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the Spirit of the Lord upon all flesh, and the breathing of life upon the dead bones, that they may stand up and live, with flesh and sinews, in strength, beauty, and comeliness of proportion. It's the manifestation and discovery of that great and glorious my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, hid from ages and generations, Christ within, the hope of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Jesus Christ in his powerful, spiritual, glorious, heavenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in his Saints, triumphing victoriously over death and hell, and all the powers of darkness, giving to his Saints to sit down with him upon his throne, and making them partakers of that glory he had with the Father before the world began. It's the bringing of many from the East, and from the West, and from the North, and from the South, to sit down with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the Kingdom of God; and the gathering of his elect seed from the four winds of the earth, which hath been long scattered, and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up in the holes and caves thereof, lying in death, bondage, and captivity. The day of God is the redemption of his beloved seed, and raising it up out of the grave, to live in the blessed and glorious presence of its God: It's the marriage day of the Spouse with the Lamb, and the bringing of her into the Chamber of Presence, and the Banquetting-house, where she is entertained with the sweet fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship and communion of the noble plant of renown, the beloved of her souls and under his shadow she sitteth down with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and his fruit is pleasant to her taste, where she gets access to him in the bed of love, and sees his sweet, comely, soul-ravishing countenance, and hears the sweet melodious voice, which pierceth the heart with darts of love, so that she is constrained to cry, <hi>Stay me with apples, comfort me with flagons, for I am sick of love; turn away thy face from me, for it hath ravished me,</hi> being filled with the glory of his Majesty, that the sight of it is scarce tollerable in the house of clay, which often trembles at the Revelation of the weight of glory. The day of the Lord is the tabernacling and habitation of himself with men (the <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God in us) bringing them up out of all visible and corruptible perishing things, into fellowship with him and his Son, through the eternal Spirit. It's the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104192:31"/>
of the new Covenant taking place in the earth, the tenour whereof is, <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be my People, and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, saying, know the Lord, for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto che greatest,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>for I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no more,</hi> Jer. 31. <hi>And again I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and yee shall be clean from all your filthiness, and from all your Idols will I cleanse you, a new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh, and I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and yee shall keep my Iudgements, and do them; and yee shall dwell in the Land, that I gave to your Fathers, and yee shall be my People, and I will be your God,</hi> Ezek. 36. It's the coming down of the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from above, out of Heaven upon the Earth, cloathed with the Garments of Salvation, the Lambs Glory (which is her Light, so that She needeth not Sun, nor Moon, nor Candle) and the pure white linnen, which is the Righteousness of the Saints; It's the causing the old Heavens and the old Earth to pass away, and the Elements to melt with fervent heat, and the drying up of the Sea, and the making all old things to vanish, and the creating the new Heavens, and the new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteousness, and the making all things new. It's the relieving the Creation of God which hath long travelled under the bondage of Corruption: It's the coming forth of the Woman cloathed with the Sun, and a Crown of twelve Starrs upon her head, and the Moon under her feet, out of the Wilderness; And her get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting victory and Dominion with her seed (which hold the testimony of Jesus the spirit of Prophecy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. the great quarel of the adversary against her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.) over the Dragon, Beast and false Prophet. It's the discovery, fall, and utter overthrow of mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> the mother of Fornications, who hath bewitched the whole earth with the Golden Cup, her Merchants hath handed forth into them who dwell thereupon; whereby they have adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and gone a whoring from God, and the pure holy life of Jesus Christ, and the chast leadings of his spirit, and the true spiritual glory hath been lost from among them, who drunk of the cup of her sorceries, and a false imaginary glory set up in its room,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104192:32"/>
which is the Image of the Beast, over which the Saints get victory; which false glory stands in some of the words and formes of truth patched together, with the inventions of men, by the cunning and art of the whorish spirit, which is very taking and specious to the eye of man, whereby it comes to pass that this whorish woman hath been taken for the spouse of Christ, and her Merchants for his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. The day of God is the pulling up by the roots every plant which is not of the Lords planting, and the fire of the fierce wrath and indignation of God passing thorough the bryars and thorns for the consuming of them, and the plowing up the fallow ground, and preparing and digging, and dunging of it, whereby it may become good and fruitful, that the pure and tender plant and seed of truth sown therein may grow up, and become a tree filled with the fruits of righteousness and holiness: this seed hath long lyen (as it were) barren in the earth, which hath been as a Wilderness, and brought forth the Vines of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and Grapes of <hi>Gomorah,</hi> but now the Lord hath looked upon the earth, and pittied it (for the seeds sake) and hath sent forth and is sending his servants to till and dress it, that it may be for the Lord and master of it, a garden of pleasure, and now the truth which hath been long holden down, in and under un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness is arising, and shall arise throughout the whole earth, in victory and dominion over all.</p>
            <p>And we the Lords People called in derision <hi>Quakers,</hi> and mocked and persecuted by the World (as all the Children of God before us have been) because we are not of them, and they know us not, do witness this day of God come and broke up among us in pure perfect brightness, to the fulfilling all these things aforesaid (every one in their measure) and yet more abundantly to be fulfilled, and his Kingdom revealed with power and great glory in our hearts, and the Lord hath brought back our Captivity, as the streams of the south, whereat we are as those that dream for joy; and we who sat by the Rivers of <hi>Babylon</hi> hanging our harps upon the Willow Trees are now returned to Zion, having our hearts and our mouths filled with the Songs thereof, and our Harps harping the sweet Praises of our God, in the Land of our Nativity. And the Lord hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us out of Kindreds, Nations, Tongues, and People, to be a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people unto himself, a choice Generation, a royal Priesthood, and holy Nation zealous of good works, to shew forth the Praises of him who hath called us out of darkness into his marvelous Light,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104192:32"/>
which hath shined forth in beams of Glory, through the darkness in us, to the dispelling and swallowing up thereof, by its brightness, and the Light is very dear, and precious unto us, and we cannot deny it; notwithstanding, all the opposition we meet with, from a wicked perverse World, shut up in darkness; and because they in the state they are in, cannot comprehend it, therefore they mock, persecute, and blasphem both it, and the vessels thereof, and they would have us to disown the Light, and cease to bear our testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony unto it, because they hate the Light themselves, being it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves their evil deeds, and makes manifest the hidden things of dishonesty, which they are loath should be known; therefore they would have the Light quenched, stopt and buried, least their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness be seen, hence it is that people of all Professions, ranks, orders, qualities, and degrees, Rulers, Teachers, Priests, and People, Scribes, Lawyers, Doctors, and Disputers of this World, have and do oppose the Light, and such who testifie of it, least their pride, pomp, ambition, lust, tyranny, deceit, covetousness, and other evil deeds, which are rife among them, should be made manifest, and men of all callings hate the Light; for deceit, treachery, unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, hath seated and spread it self over all and taken a domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Earth, and is loath to quit it; and therefore, it puts into the hearts of all its subjects, to oppose the Light, which if it get foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the earth, will put a period to its raign, and finish transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and bring in everlasting Righteousness: And the Devil sets men upon the opposing the Light, least it bind him, and cast him out of his place, and spoile his house, and break his Kingdom, dashing it as a potters vessel into pieces; and the Whore mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> the mother of Fornications hates the Light, and puts into the hearts of the Kings and powers of the earth, to make war with the Lamb, the Light and the Children of it; for that is it which discovers the cup of her Fornications and sorceries unto men, and makes manifest her whorish mire whereby she may be discerned, and when she is known the same Kings and Princes and great ones on the earth, who upheld her, shall come to loath and hate her, and burn her flesh with fire; and now glory to the Lord who hath shewed us Light, and placed it in our hearts, and hath raised and is raising it up, over all opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatsoever in us, and by this Light we have discovered the Whore, the Antichrist, the Beast, the Dragon the subtle Serpent, the false Prophet, with all their subtle workings, and deceivableness
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104192:33"/>
of unrighteousness; we have seen the Land of graven Images, and the wilderness where there is no way; we have so long walked in; hungry, and thirsty, and our souls fainting in us, and our tongue fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thirst; and the light hath given us an out-gate, &amp; shewed us an entrance into the way of life, and path of righteousness &amp; holiness, which the Vultures eye can never reach; &amp; this path at the beginning appeared to us very strait, &amp; narrow &amp; difficult for passage, so that many times sore doubtings and fears arise in us, lest we should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get thereinto, and many temptations have we indured from the suggestions of the great enemy of our salvation; saying to us, it is in vain to attempt an entrance, but now blessed be the God of our salvation, an entrance, yea, an abundant entrance is ministred to us thereinto, and the path is becoming more and more easie and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and delectable, the way of pleasantness, and the path of peace is opened, and opening, wherein the wayfaring man (though a fool) cannot erre or stray; and the Light hath brought us to <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s Well, where we have found an eternal never fading spring of living water streaming forth into our souls and hearts, to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable joy, comfort, and satisfaction; and it hath brought us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Bethel,</hi> the house of God, the house of prayer; and we have been made joyful therein, according to the Lord's promise; and in this house and Temple of God, we have seen the glory of the Lord, and had <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s Vision, beholding him sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filling the Temple; and we have heard the voice, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts, the whole earth is full of his glory; and we have been made to cry, woe is us, for we are undone, because of uncleanness, and fear and trembling hath taken hold of us, so that the posts of the door lyes moved and shaken, at the voice of him that cryed; and the Angel hath flown unto us, having a live coal in his hand, taken in the tongs from off the Altar, and therewith hath touched our lips, saying unto us, your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged; and in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we have talked of the glory of the Lord, and of his loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness one unto another; and we have blessed and praised the Name of the Lord, for his mercy and goodness to the children of men; and we have eat and drunk in the house of our God, in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his holiness have we been entertained with the feast of fat things, full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined; and we have seen the King in his beauty, and bread hath been given to us,

and our water made sure, and it faileth not, which we drink every one out of our own Cestern; and the glorious Lord hath become unto us a place of broad Rivers; and we have been brought to the Shepherds tents, and seen where he feedeth the flock, and causeth it to rest at noon; and we have loved the Pasture dearly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Shepherd that he would make us partake with the flock, and lead us to the green field and Paradice of his pleasure, and to the streams of that river which is full of water, and floweth rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forth, to the continual gladning of the City of God; and we have desired it of him with the earnest of our souls, that we might see the good of his chosen, and be remembred with the favour he bears to his people, and gladned with the joy of his Nation, that we might have whereby to glory with his inheritance; and the Lord hath heard and granted the breathings of our souls; we ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life of him, and he hath given it us, and put a crown of pure gold upon our heads, even a crown of righteousness, and eternal life; and he hath put a new song of praise to him who lives for ever and ever, in our mouths, which none can sing, no nor understand, but such as are redeemed from off the earth; and Palms of Victory in our hands are given to us, and Harps wherewith to harp, and make melody to the God of our life, who hath created us anew in Jesus Christ, unto good works; and Censers full of incense, which are the prayers of the Saints; and the Lord hath not suffered, does not suffer us, to want any good thing, he openeth his hands plentifully, and filleth us with his blessing, and giveth us to drink of the River of his pleasure, and the wine which groweth in our fathers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and how great is his goodness! how great is his beauty! for Corn hath made the young-men glad, and new wine the Maids, as it is written, and the mountains have dropped down the wine, and the Fatts and Wine-presses have overflowed, and the Heavens have opened, and poured down everlasting righteousness, and rained the showers of blessing upon the tender herbs of the Lords planting in the earth; and loe the Winter is past, the rain is over and gone, and the Spring is come, wherein the birds do sweetly sing, and the voice of the Turtle is heard in our Land; and the Fig-tree putteth forth its blossoms, and green figs and others are come, and coming to perfection and maturity; and the Vines with the grapes, give a good and pleasant smell; and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, laid up for our beloved. And the fruit of the

Tree of Life, which beareth twelve manner of fruits, and yieldeth it every month, hath been manifested unto us, the leaves whereof are for the healing of the Nations. And we have seen the Bride, the Lamb's Wife adorned, and trimmed for the approach of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> descending from above, the Holy City coming down from God out of heaven, having the glory of her God, and her light is like unto a stone most precious, like a Jasper, clear as Cristal; and we have seen the frame and proportion of this City, with the walls and gates of it (within which our feet have stood) whose builder and maker is God, and there is nothing of mans work in it, but all purely of him, and we have seen to its foundation, the Light, the Life, the Power, the Wisdom of God, revealed in the hearts of the Sons and Daughters of men, the chief corner, the foundation stone, which the builders among all the Sects and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of the whole earth have rejected, in this night of darkness, whereby instead of building a house or City for God, they have reared up a <hi>Babylon,</hi> which must fall, and is a falling, and shall sink as a mill-stone into the bottom of the Sea, and never rise again, Amen, Hallelujah, glory to the Lamb, whose work it is.</p>
            <p>And now the Lord hath made us Citizens of this City, and stones of this building, even living stones, polished by the power of God, and glewed and knit together by the same power and Spirit of Life, where is the pure perfect unity, and in the unity, the fellowship and communion with God, and his dear Son Jesus Christ, and one with another is witnessed; and the builders are wise builders, standing in the wisdom and power of God, whereby they are taught to lay every stone, and how to polish and square it, and they are but tools and instruments in the hand of God, for the work is his alone, and the Ministry is spiritual, and so are the Ministers; men taught by God, having experience of the saving work of his right hand on their hearts, who speak because they believe, and are indued with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer from on high, and filled with the holy Ghost, whereby they are made able Ministers of the new Testament, having received gifts by the ascending of Christ on high, (even for the rebellious, that he may dwell among them) for the work of the Ministry, to the perfecting of the Saints, and edifying of the body; and such Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster from the Light and from the Life, and from the power and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Word of God, whereby those to whom they Minister, may come into the fellowship of the mystery with themselves, and be

nor yet those of the National Ministry, who give themselves forth for the Ministers of Christ (but are found lyars) they call it a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and delusion, and turn People from it, (which is the only Rock that can save them) yet we know it to be the Word of God, and we have tasted the Heavenly sweetness of it, yea and our very hands have handled that Word of Life, and we have hid it in our hearts as an only Treasure, and we do daily, and hourly, witness the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and worth thereof, for it is the food of our souls, the food of Angels, the living bread, which came down from Heaven, to give life unto the World, the Manna incorruptible, which feedeth us unto life everlasting; and when we are an hungred, it refresheth us, and satisfieth our souls with good things, it's milk to the babes, and flesh to the strong, it's health to our navil, and marrow to our bones, it's the bread which strengthneth mans heart, and the wine which maketh it glad, and oyle which maketh his face to shine, and when we thirst, living water springeth forth from this word of life in our hearts, and ministreth drink unto us, out of the living fountain, and we witness the promise fulfilled, <hi>he that believeth in me</hi> (Christ the Word) <hi>out of his belly shall flow a well spring of liveing water</hi>; and when we are weak, and our hands hang down, and our knees wax feeble, the Word maketh us strong, and lifteth us up as an Eagles wings, so that we run and are not weary, and walk and are not faint, and when we are heavy through sorrow, the Word springeth forth in streams of pure joy and consolation, from the presence of the Lord, which causeth us to forget all our former troubles, and we are comforted in our God, in all our straits and difficulties, and when temptations from the Devil and his Instruments assault us, and the powers of darkness environe and surround us, as if they would swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us up, the Word sendeth forth sweet and comfortable beams of Light, and openeth the eye-lids of the morning upon us, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth through the thick <hi>Egiptian</hi> darkness, as a fiery flaming sword, and divideth asunder, and giveth us victory and deliverance: And when we are hated of the World, the Word saith, peace in us, and causeth it to flow into our souls, like the waves of the Sea, and when Sathan transformes himself (with his Messengers) into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light, that he may deceive us, coming up out of the deep with <hi>Samuels</hi> Mantle, the Word of truth, which searcheth into all the depths of Satan, and to the bottom of the mystery of iniquity discovereth to us the foulers snare, and the voice of the inchanter, so

And now, though the Scriptures declare of this word, yet they are not that Word, more then a Map or description of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> is <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>London</hi>; or the image of <hi>Cesar</hi> is <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> (or bread and wine is the body and blood of Christ) which rude draught, shadow, description, and representation of such things, and the like, may and do borrow the names of the things by them signified or represented; and thus the Scriptures may borrow the name of the Word of God, and may sometimes be so called, as the words or Prophecy of <hi>Isaiah</hi> is called by himself his <hi>Vision,</hi> and the words of <hi>Iohn</hi> is called his <hi>Revelation,</hi> whereas they but signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied these things; and it's my testimony, with thousands, we have found another Word then the Scriptures (which is not repugnant to them, but teacheth the same things, and bears a like testimony with them, in a more excellent way, so that they have a sweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and concord together, yet differing as much from them as bread, wine, corn, oyle, water, light, fire, differing from a verbal description or likeness of those things: And this is no dishonour to the Scriptures, but a putting them in their proper place, as a declaration of the eternal life, which though pointed at by them, yet is not to be found in them, as the Jewish people foolishly thought, (and as Professors think at this day) for which Christ checked them, because they would not come to him to get life, of

And thus much concerning our Ministery, and the object thereof, or thing which is ministred and preached, to wit, Christ the living and eternal Word, nigh, and in the hear: and our Worship and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice we offer up unto God in this Building, House, Temple, City or Church of God; is spiritual prayer, and praise spiritual, even from the pourings forth of the Spirit of Life from God, praying and singing, (and making melody in our hearts, and with our mouths and lips also, as the Lord opens them) with the spirit and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in all things, making our requests known unto God, and giving thanks alwayes for all things, through Jesus Christ our life, at whose Name our knees are bowed down, and our head unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the glory is over all, and the Lord hath turned to us the pure language, and the pure lip, and given us to the throne of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an abundant access, and hath accepted our prayers, and savoured a good savour in them, and hath largely answered the desires of our souls, blessed be his Name; and we witness him a God who heareth prayer, even to the least desire or breathing of the upright heart, and he is worthy to be waited for, who hath come to us in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable time, and prepared our hearts to seek, and his ear to hear, and given us strength and ability to wrestle and prevail with him to the break of day, and we have not let him go till he hath blessed us, and called our name <hi>Israel.</hi> And as the Ministry and Worship of the Church or house of God among us is spiritual, so is the Order, Discipline and Government among us; and we witness the Lord present with us in our Assemblies, and the head Christ in us, (whether few or many) passing sound, righteous, and infallible judgement concerning the particulars that come before us; and we take not that blind, fallible way of the many Sects and Professions in the world, to determine controversies by, <hi>viz. Plurality of Votes,</hi> but we look up to the Lord, and call upon him to decide the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and pass righteous judgement, and he doth it, and each in the measure of the Word of Truth, which they have received, doth perceive the mind of the Lord <hi>therein,</hi> and believeth it, their faith standing in the wisdom and power of God, revealing the thing in and to each particular, and we are manifest in one anothers consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and as Epistles written and read in one anothers hearts; and we are of one mind, and one spirit and life; and here is sweet uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, concord, harmony, and agreement, not like <hi>Babylon</hi>; and where
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104192:36"/>
the Lord goeth not before us, and openeth not the particular, or particulars unto us, we stand still and forbear, till we receive his mind, who never is nor will be wanting to us, in whatsoever exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. And now the power we have is from God alone, and his Son Jesus Christ, and he bears the government on his shoulders, and takes us up into the Throne with himself, according to his promise and maketh us a free people, Kings and Priests to our God, and our power is free and unlimited, as to any mans determination upon the face of the whole earth; and we own no head in our Church, but Christ Jesus; nor can we submit our consciences to any man, or yield to the precepts and commandements of men (out of the will and power of God) in a jot, though to the loss of our very lives; and especially, no man or men is to impose on us the least circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, in the matter of the worship of the living God, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of our consciences therein; but what man or men set up in place of authority, calls us to what is equitable and righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and our neighbour, we are free, and holds our selves bound to give all due obedience for conscience sake thereto; and the Magistrate, who hath his power and authority from God, we dearly own and honour, and the obedience he requires of us, will be answered with the Witness and Word of God in our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which if we should disobey, condemnation from the Lord should fall upon us. And when that which is sinful and unrighteous is urged upon us, then God's witness does arise in our conscience, and forbids us to yield thereto, but to suffer patiently what may be inflicted upon us, for our not bowing under the same, and not at all to resist with any carnal weapon, or outward violence, but to commit our cause to him, who judgeth righteously, and hath said, <hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it</hi>; and so we have sweet peace and content in our sufferings, for our consciences are kept free, and we are redeemed to God, and bought with a price, therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the servants of men, and we seek not any worldly power or force to maintain our Church, it needeth it not (for the gates of hell cannot prevail against the same) nor to propagate our Religion, for it will never do it, and we are to force no mans conscience, nor to lay any punishment upon them, or put any to sufferings, because of their not concurring with us, for we matter no uniformity, but that which is of the Lord's Spirit, perswading the hearts of people to be one with us in principle and practice, and to stand up with
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104192:37"/>
us, living witnesses for the name and truth of the living God, which he is revealing; and we assuredly know all the weapons that are formed either against the truth or the witnesses of it, shall not prosper, and the Lord shall make to himself a glorious name in the earth; and we the people of the Lord, whom he hath formed for himself, shall shew forth his praise, and the Lord will make it manifest, that we are his, and that he hath raised us up, and put his Spirit in us, and that he dwells in and among us, to all the Kindreds and Nations of the Earth, and they who will not see, shall see, and be ashamed, and confounded for their envy at the people whom God hath blessed, and will bless for ever and ever, and no deceit nor violence shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against them.</p>
            <p>And therefore now O ye people of <hi>Scotland</hi> know ye that the day of God is broke up among us, the people of the Lord called by you in derision <hi>Quakers,</hi> but who indeed tremble at the Word of his power, when it is sounded forth from the Throne of Majesty; yea, and the mighty, dreadful, terrible God of strength, power, and Majesty, Victory, and Dominion hath determined to shake the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the Earth, and all the powers thereof, to the utter confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and fall of whatsoever standeth up in opposition against the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of his eternal Kingdom of Righteousness in the hearts of the Children of Men, and the little stone cut out of the Mountain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands, shall grow and fill the earth, and become a Mountain; and it shall dash to pieces the Image of Clay and Iron, Brass, Silver, and Gold, and the Land of graven Images shall be smitten, and all the Gods of the Heathen famished, and all the Idols shall be broken, and cast into the holes of the rock, and <hi>Dagon</hi> shall not be able to stand before the Ark; nor <hi>Babylon,</hi> before the spouse of Christ which is coming forth to face all their enemies, fair as the Sun, and terrible as an Army with banners; yea, cloathed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet. And the Lord is making a work in this day, which shall make all ears to tingle, and every heart to faint and fail that will not bow at the arm of his power stretched forth: The day of the Lord is come, and he is preparing himself to battle as a strong man, as one awakned of out sleep, (who hath long suffered the reign and Kingdom of darkness) and as one that cryeth out in the dread of his strength by reason of Wine; and he is making bare his arme, and covering himself with zeal as with a cloak, <hi>now will I arise, now will I lift up my self,</hi> saith the Lord, and who is able to stand up, and

make war with him? whereof prepare to meet thy God O <hi>Scotland</hi> in the way of his judgments, and repent, repent, repent of your iniquities, from the highest to the lowest, for the controversie of the dreadful God of power, the zealous angry God who will not acquit the guilty, is against the one and the other of you, without respect of persons, because of your abominations, whereby his pure holy Spirit hath been grieved, and provoked against you, Oh <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland,</hi> the cry of thine iniquities, hath come up before God into his throne, and he is weary with forbearing, to execute the fierceness of his wrath upon you, though ye be not weary with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but are drawing iniquity, as with Cart-ropes, and filling up the measure even to the brime; Wherefore a Cup of trembling, trembling, saith the Lord God, shall be put into thy hands, if thou speedily repent not, &amp; thou shall drink &amp; shall not escape, and it shall be more tollerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorab</hi> in the day of judgment, then for you; forasmuch as you have sinned against more Light, and have had more warnings from the Lord, one way, and another, and he hath borne with you long, and strived much with you by his Spirit to reclaim you, and would have healed you, but ye will not be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and oh how have your hearts turned back as a deceitful bow, and shrunk from that measure of simplicity, tenderness and zeal for the Lord, that was once among you, and because yee took up a professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God above all the Nations of the Earth, and have so treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously backslidden therefrom in the day of tryal, therefore is your sin exceedingly aggravated before the Lord, and he will punish you above all the Nations of the earth, if ye break not off from your sins by speedy and unfeigned repentance. And now ye who mock at the quakings and tremblings of the people of God, who feel the load of wrath ready to break out upon you, and sink you down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of Hell, and would faine stand in the gapes, and hold off the wrath, and are in great travel, because of the dreadful day they see coming upon you, and many times are crying unto God for mercy unto you, when ye are adding drunkness to thirst, and persecuting them, and saying, <hi>tush, tush, no evil shall befall us, where is the promise of his coming?</hi> ye shall be made to tremble, and your loyns to shake, and the joynts of your knees with <hi>Belshazar</hi> (reading the hand writing against you) to smite one against another, and paleness shall come up upon your faces, and pangs as of a woman in travel take hold of you, and the Lord will roar out of Zion, against you, and tear in pieces as
<pb facs="tcp:104192:38"/>
a Lyon, and who will then be able to deliver you out of his hand? and that comfort and peace will be far from you, which we the Lords people do witness, after all our fears and tremblings; for the cup we have drunk at his hands is sweetly tempered with mercy and judgment, and in measure he debateth with us, and stayeth his rough wind in the day of his East; and our hearts, which once trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for fear, and dread, and sorrow, are now made to rejoyce with trembling, at the powerful and glorious appearance of him in our souls, so that we have been made to sing unto him that song, we will praise thee O Lord; for though thou wast angry with us, thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is turned away, and we are comforted. And yet now, O <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Lord hath bowels of tender pitty and compassion towards thee, which many times I have felt, and do feel, with many others, and he is much put to it (so to speak) concerning thee, what to do with thee, and his mercy and judgement are at a kind of holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and wrestling about thee; <hi>How shall I give thee up? how shall I deliver thee, O people of</hi> Scotland? <hi>how shall I make thee as</hi> Admah, <hi>and set thee as</hi> Zeboim, <hi>my heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together</hi>; which word hath often sounded through me, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thy Inhabitants, O <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the Lord, who yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the kindness of thy youth, and the love of thy espousals in former dayes, and the tenderness, and simplicity, and uprightness of heart that was among many of you then, with a pure zeal for his Name: And oh, what meltings and breathings of soul was after the living God! and nothing could satisfie but his living presence, which also no doubt hath been in a measure by some enjoyed; but oh, how have ye forsaken your first love, and turned down-right enemies against that which was once your very life, and is the life of those ye are persecuting at this day, and blaspheming, to wit, the revelation of the Light, Life, Power, Love, and Spirit of God in our souls, which filleth us with heavenly comfort, joy unspeakable and full of Glory. Oh, how have ye forsaken the fountain of living waters, and digged to your selves broken Cesterns, that can hold no water! Return, O back-sliding <hi>Scotland,</hi> for this I do declare unto thee, in the name of the Lord; he hath yet thoughts of loving kindness unto thee, and a seed there is in thee, which is very dear and precious unto him, and he cannot forget it, more then the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted mother the fruit of her womb; and though she should forget, yet the Lord will not forget thee; for thou art set as a seal
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104192:38"/>
upon his heart, and writ upon the palms of his hands, O thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved seed, and he will give redemption unto thee, and raise thee up out of the holes and caves of the earth, where thou hast lain so long buried as in the grave, and the Lord hath raised, and is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing up his seed in some already, who are a kind of first fruits unto him; and he hath brought us to walk in the light of his countenance, and rent the vails, and given us to behold his lovely amiable face with joy, and made us an entrance into the blessed Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; and we have eat abundantly of the good of the Land, and the finest of the wheat, and honey out of the Rock hath been given unto us, and we have drunk of the wine, and tasted the Vine-grapes thereof, and the Land is a good Land; and though there be <hi>Giants,</hi> and the sons of <hi>Amaleck</hi> in the way, yet it is conquerable, and we cannot but report well of it; and God hath blessed our te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, and shall bless it to hundreds and thousands, who yet are not able to hear us, nor will they, because of the anguish of soul, under the hard yoak of <hi>Pharoah</hi> in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and house of bondage; but God will break, and is breaking, the yoak of oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from off the neck of his seed, and will give it victory and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all.</p>
            <p>And now blessed are they, who know and hearken unto the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sound of the everlasting Gospel, which publisheth peace, and bringeth good tydings of salvation, and proclaimeth the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in <hi>Sion,</hi> to give them beauty for ashes, the oyle of joy for mourning, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified. And now, O <hi>Scotland,</hi> prize the day of thy visitation, and know the things that belong to thy peace, before they be hid from thine eyes, and the day of grace sett upon thee, and put away thy abominations out of the fight of the holy pure God, which are matter of provocation unto him against thee.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou hast often assayed a Reformation unto the Lord, but it hath never come to be perfect and thorow; and ye have been so far from going forward, that ye have shrunk back, and turned again with the dog to the vomit, wherefore now at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Lord, with whom there is yet mercy, and plenteous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and reform thoroughly unto him, who will not receive
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104192:39"/>
halfes off your hands. And now I will shew you councel from the Lord (which I do declare in bowels of dear, and tender love unto you) what ye shall do in order to a cleanly, perfect, and through Reformation: Above all mind the Light of Christ in your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and heed it diligently in its motion and shinings forth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the darkness, and as ye give obedience to it, in what it reveals unto you for duty, and shun what it discovers to be evil, it will more and more arise and shine forth in pure transparent brightness, from one degree of glory to another, and lay hold upon the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the dispelling of it, and swallowing it up wholly, in the womb of its brightness; and the Light will shew you the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on which ye shall build, Jesus Christ, the Wisdom and Power of God, and the Word of eternal Life, the chief corner stone, from which the Light comes, and it leads to him, and will bring you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to acquaintance with him, and the leadings, and teachings of his Holy Spirit, to which yee shall do well to keep Chast, else the <hi>Serpent</hi> by his subtlety will again ensnare you, and <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi> will bewitch you with the cup of her Fornications: And oh your not keeping chast to the Lord hath often marred the work in your hands, and if ye come not in the future to keep closely and chastly to him, ye shall never prosper in any of your attempts, and all shall be but lost labour. And take up the cross to every thought, desire, imagination, motion, and affection, of your own hearts, and this will steer your course aright, and guide your feet in every step, and stay, and ballance your minds, and hold down every thing which would arise out of the wrong ground, and the pure Light will shine forth in your minds, (thus stayed under the cross) with glorious beams of brightness, and sweetly manifest unto you, all whatsoever the Lord requires of you, and as ye must not be forward in running on without the leadings of Christ the head in you, so be not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nor slow in following after him, nor sit down by the way, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your selves, <hi>thus far will we go and no further</hi>; Oh this hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so been a snare unto you: and mind the pure, holy, living power, more then the form, and wherever the power and Spirit of life doth not move, or appear in the forme, disown it, and stand against it, and whatever form or appearance the living power leads into, or moves in, be for it, and own it, and as ye come, to live and walk in Gods fear, it will beget more and more a discerning in you, to know and feel the power, and distinguish manifestly the dead, dry, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104192:39"/>
life-less form and appearance from the living; and be willing to be searched as with Candles, thoroughly, and hide nothing which the Lord requires to be given up, nor keep up any thing whatsoever, that his controversie and indignation is against, and rid you of all your Idols of silver, and gold, all the wares and pleasant things of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Jewels and ear-rings, ye have of the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> to wit <hi>the many Inventions,</hi> that hath crept in, in the night of Apostacy, to the ensnaring and bewitching of your people, and father nothing upon the Scriptures, nor upon God, but that which is purely of him, and revealed unto you from the Spirit of truth opening and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the Scriptures unto you, which holy men of God did write from the Inspiration of his Spirit, and can only be understood in and from a measure of the same, and put not the name of the Ordinances of Jesus Christ upon <hi>Babylons brats,</hi> which whoso taketh them and dasheth to pieces against the stones, blessed shall they be: And away with all the Wisdom of this World, which God is a confounding, and all consultings and reasonings with flesh and blood, and judging or determining of things, but in the wisdom and councel of God, in the Revelation of the Spirit of truth in each particular, let that be your rule in all things, and ye shall walk surely, and put away this dead, life-less, ignorant, prophane, scandalous Ministry, own no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, but such who is taught of God, &amp; speaks because he believes and ministers from the power and spirit of life, and away with make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any humane gifts or indowments of Learning (which is but flesh, and must die and wither) the qualifications of a Minister, and do not limit the Spirit of the Lord, in chusing or refusing any for the work of the Ministry, they are well fitted whom he enables, though foolish and contemptible to the carnal eye; and by these foolish, weak and despicable things, the Lord hath brought, and is bringing great things to pass; and away with your dead life-less worship, praying and singing, which comes not from the breathings and movings of the spirit of life from God; and away with your mungrel Church, patch'd up of the prophance rable of the World, let such who fear God, separate and come out from among them, and disown them for fellow members of the body whereof Christ is the head, and have no communion with them in their worship which is Idolatry, and away with your sprinklings of Infants, its but of <hi>Babylon</hi>; with many other things, the Light of Christ (as ye heed it) will discover unto you, which in the night of darkness hath passed for Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,

but the day hath discovered them to have the Beasts mark, and superscription; and away with setting Bread and Wine before a prophane wicked multiude (who hath nothing but the bare name of a Christian) telling them its the Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ, it's abomination to God, and away with the carnal, false licentious, unbounded liberty ye take to your selves in words, diet, apparel, and worldly conversation; mind the cross diligently, and it will teach you the golden path of Mediocrity (or Moderation) in all things, and away with all respecting of persons, and the honour which comes not from God, whose service is only to feed the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, and be willing and desirous to see the glory of the pride of all flesh stained, and the Lord alone exalted, honoured, and glorified in and among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men: And away with all Uniformity, which is not of the Lords Spirit; and away with all force, and constraint in the matter of Conscience and Religion; and away with all carnal weapons, either to defend or propagate the truth; away with your Lording and mastering, and monopolizing ministry, who would limit the Spirit of the Lord, and make a monopoly of the gifts of God, away with your distinctions of Clergy and Laicks, and superstitious Habits and attires, for discriminating them, and away with your set and alloted hires, and maintenance for a Ministry, and forcing of people to pay them, which hath been a great snare unto many (and hath lyen nigh all) who from a principle of covetousness (seeing thereby means of a livelihood) hath intruded themselves into the ministerial Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and given poor people to believe they were called of God thereto, whereas generally (it is a thing well known) they get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Parishes by worldly means, they setting their friends and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on work, to sollicite and move the Patrons of the Parishes, or such most concerned therein, to give them entrance; and when the thing is granted, then he called the Minister, steps up into a Pulpit, and sayes thus to the people, <hi>Beloved, by the providence of God I am called to be your Pastor, and a watch-man over you, as one who must give an account for your souls in the day of judgement; and the Lord knows, it's not any other principle, but a vehement desire (thorough love to your souls) to teach and instruct you in the knowledge of God, and to edifie you in the Faith, that hath moved me to come among you. and I have received a talent, and I must improve it, and the ability God hath given me to instruct you, together with the great desire I have to use it for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104192:40"/>
your edification, I take for a sufficient call from God; and I have also the Patrons, and the most considerable in the Parish their call.</hi> Whereas they make it manifestly appear, that covetousness hath set them thereon, for how soon any of their brethren dies, so that another Parish becomes vacant, which hath a greater stipend or maintenance, they fall upon their first trade, of solliciting for an entrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and they stick not to quit the charge of their first Flock, and to give their Wife (to wit, the <hi>Kirk,</hi> which they say they are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to) a Bill of divorce, though oft-times there be no occasion on her part; and it's not the Patrons or people who hath called them, but they first called them; and when the people refuses to pay them their allotted hire, they pursue them with horning and poinding, which shews them to be far from the affection of husbands to their wives or parents to their children, or Pastors to the Flock, all which they pretend to be; and were they good Pastors, their Flock would afford them milk and wool, not of constraint, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, so that they needed not, either squeeze the pap to the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it bleed, or tear the fleece off before the time of casting it, to the pulling the skin in pieces many times; and the ability they talk of, is not of God, but of men, and it's not God's free gift, for it hath cost them both much money and time at Schools to purchase it; and were it the talent of the Lord, it would prove more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to the bettering of the people, which it does not; for at ten, twenty, thirty, forty years end and upwards, they are as bad as at the first coming among them, and in many places much worse; and the vehement desire to do the people good, they tell of, is but a sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion of their deceitful hearts, for they are not come to the Light and Word of Truth, whereby to discern the true, upright, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine desire, from the false and hypocritical: and this thing hath proved also a great share unto the people, who hath heaped up to themselves Teachers after their own hearts lusts, who might speak false peace unto them; and that whereon there is so much stress laid, to wit, the calling of the people, or Patrons, is not of God, but of <hi>Babylon</hi>; for in the state they are in, they will be loth ever to call a good man unto them (supposing he could be found) but such who will wink at their faults, and run with them thereinto; and when at any time they let a reproof fall, it stinks out of their mouths, being guilty of the same things themselves; and away with the education of youth at Universities and Colledges of Philosophy, so

called; I may say of them, which <hi>Luther</hi> stuck not to call them in his day, That <hi>they are the stews of Antichrist</hi>; for out of them comes this ignorant, profane, scandalous Ministry, wherein they learn to talk of things they understand not, and to prate in mans wisdom, which is carnal, earthly, and devillish: And the <hi>Philosophy,</hi> so called, which is taught them, is but meer deceit and pedantry, which even I came to see, when among them; and many of themselves see it, and confess it to be but vanity; and none can teach either the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, or of the creation, but such who come to be indued with a measure of the wisdom of God, which made the creation in number, weight, and measure, according to it's pure holy Law, and neither God nor the work of his hands can be truly known, but in the light, which makes all manifest, which the Doctors and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this world, are strangers unto, and it's follishness to them; and many among themselves have attempted the reformation of their so called Philosophy, and squeezed their brains to find out a new one, but all in vain, it shall never be found out, till they come to the Cross of Christ, and under his cross, denying their own wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) become the disciples of Christ, and learn of him (<hi>in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom &amp; knowledge</hi>) the true Science of the creation (as well as the of the Creator) for the world was made by him, and he can best teach it, and in him manifest in man, the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible things of God, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, which carry up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them indeed the characters of infinite wisdom, goodness, and power, but are a sealed book, no less then the Scriptures, to such who are not come to the teachings of him, who made them, and can only give an eye to read them with a true understanding, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And this I testifie, who have had a tryal and experience, both of the one and the other, the wisdom of man (wherein I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured much and long, and profited above many of my nighbours) and the wisdom of God in which now I see, and for which I truly account that other loss and dung, even for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, the Wisdom which was vvith the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World began, and I certainly know the humane Wisdom or learning is one of the main Bulwarks of Antichrist against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and setting up the Kingdom of Christ in the Earth, and because this is arising, and shall rise, down must the other go, and all who seek to uphold it shall fall therewith.

many Doctrins and opinions yee have drunken from your teachers, who have abused the Scriptures, and you both, giving you to believe they were grounded on Scripture, and are nothing but their own imaginations, which the erring mind through Sathans suggestions, hath begot both in them and you, and rid your selves of all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, yee have taken upon trust, and what yee have not seen and learned, in the openings and manifestation of the Word and Spirit of truth in each particular, and make the revelation of the Spirit of truth in all things the rule and analogy of your faith, believing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less or more, then what is revealed to you therefrom; and where that opens not, keep wholy back from passing any determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for or against: And away with that manner of interpreting Scripture and searching truth by drawing and knitting consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by the fallible erring mind, and natural understanding, keep close in all things to the judgment, and determination of the Spirit of God, and where that leads you (as it did lead Christ to infer upon the Saduces the Resurrection from the dead, from that Scripture, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, and God is not the God of the dead but of the Living,</hi>) to draw a consequence or frame an argument, do it, else forbear: And away with determining of things (as yee have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to done) by <hi>Plurality of Votes,</hi> it's not the way of God, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver further the Lords work or truth, their votes or consents not being in the unity of the Spirit of truth: And away with thinking general Assemblies, Counsils or Parliaments, in the state they stand in, will do you any good, in order to a perfect, and through Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, they will certainly marre it, but never help it forward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Gods wisdom, and its foolishness unto them. And your looking too much to these things in former times hath been a great snare unto you.</p>
            <p>And thus now I have showed you good advice and councel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your becoming a perfect, and thoroughly reformed people, and the witness of God in all your Consciences (as yee heed it) will not fail to answer me to the truth, and expedience of these things I have laid before you: And principally every one mind the through reformation and change of your own hearts and lifes, by turning in your minds, to the Light of Christ in all your consciences, which must do the work, else it never will be done; and as the reformati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

what I have declared unto you (and the manifestation of the Spirit of truth will shew you much more, even the perfect patern of the house of God in the Mount) concerning these things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and expedient, in order to a thorough, cleanly and perfect reformation, we the people of the Lord called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have fallen upon them, being taught and directed thereto, by the wisdom of God, (which buildeth the house, else the building is in vain) and we have found and do find the blessed usefulness of them, as ye shall also find, if ye be followers of us, as we are of Christ: And now ye who say, or shall say, <hi>Tush, all this is but vanity, and folly, we will not daine to take councel from you, we are wiser then your selves, we will not learn at you, and yee but boast of things yee know not, and we expect a glorious comfortable breaking up of the day of God, in order to a more perfect and thorough reformation, then as yet hath been among us, but it shall never come to us through your airth, we can never expect good of you, for yee are but a pack of poor silly deluded brainsick fools, therefore get yee from us, we will none of your councel, the day shall never dawn upon us, if it rise not in another airth then yee tell us of.</hi> To such I say, Oh yee foolish, and unwise, how like are yee to the former generations, (who ever were enemies to the wisdom of God, through their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, earthly, and devilish wisdom) and to the <hi>Iewes</hi> of old, who despised the son of God, and crucified him the Lord of Glory, whom at that very time they were expecting to come, the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> and when he came, they mistook him, and received him not, because of his weak, lowly, contemptible appearance to the carnal eye, but such who had the eye of Faith, saw the glory of the only begotten of God upon him, thorough the vaile which covered him from the sight of others, and he disappointed them in all their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal expectations, and they are yet looking for him, and have looked these sixteen hundred years, but have never seen him, nor shall see him in the way they look for him; as neither shall yee, and your judgment shall be one with theirs; you being shut forth into utter darkness, and plagued with hardness of heart, if yee do not spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily repent. And now whether ye will hear or forbear, this I do declare unto you, in the name and power, and authority of the living God, the day of the Lord is of a truth broken up among us, and ye shall look till your eyes fail you, and rote within your eye-holes, e're ever yee see another day or appearance of Jesus Christ to your

comfort, then what we the people of the Lord called <hi>Quakers,</hi> do witness come, and yet more abundantly coming, and if yee will not hear, my soul shall mourn for you in secret places, and weep before the Lord on your behalf. And yee who in the perverseness, and obstinacy of your hearts gain-stand, and oppose with all your might and power, the appearance of Jesus Christ in this day, and yet are calling for the day of the Lord; To what purpose do yee call for it? (that I may use the Prophets words in the like case) <hi>Wo unto you that desire the day of the Lord,</hi> to what end is it for you? <hi>the day of the Lord is darkness, and not light, as if a man did flee from a Lyon, and a Bear met him, or went unto the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a Serpent bit him</hi>; shall not the day of Lord be darkness, <hi>and not light? even very dark and no brightness in it.</hi>
