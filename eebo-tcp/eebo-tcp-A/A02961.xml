            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For notwithſtanding the ſmall acceſſe that our praiers haue aforetime had vnto your Maieſtie doe almoſt ſtop our mouthes, by taking awaie all hope of other aunſwere then here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tofore we haue receiued, yet ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe your Maieſtie to continue vs in our offices, wee are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to continue in our accuſtomed fidelitie to the diſcharge of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and ours, which nowe with

            <p>If it had pleaſed God that thoſe reaſons which were debated in your preſence concerning the publiſhing of the Edict of Iulie laſt paſt, might haue pearced the eares of that pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence &amp; good affection which your maieſtie was accuſtomed to reſerue to the voice of this companie, wee ſhould not now be driuen to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie: for euen then Sir, you might haue perceiued that thoſe perſons who vnder a verie vncertaine hope of reuniting your ſubiectes to one onelie religion, did paune foorth your authority and conſcience to the moſt aſſured deſtruction of your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: That they had not leagued and vnited themſelues to anie other ende but to diſunite your ſubiectes from your obedience, wherein through an

of happie memorie. Euen an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie which they remit to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an vniuerſall, generall, or Nationall Councel.</p>
            <p>The breach of the Edict of pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hath brought vs forth ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie calamities, as there is no tongue able ſufficientlie to expreſſe them: &amp; it were a harde matter to note one ſole benefite receiued in exchaunge of the ſame, except that it hath a far larger ſcope then was thought for. For thoſe that make ſo cheape mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of the Proteſtants skins, would neuer haue brought you to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, if they could haue imagined the number to haue beene ſo great as at this daie, now that they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to aſſemble themſelues together, it appeareth. And who is hee that with himſelfe can conſpire the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of ſuch a multitude without horror, or that maie conſent therto vnleſſe he abandon all feeling of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie?</p>
            <p>Conſider ſir what affection thoſe men can beare to your ſeruice, when

they thirſt ſo much after your bloud, what fidelitie they bring to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of this ſo fraile and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent eſtate, when they ſoake out that our remainder of force and ſtrength by ſo vnreaſonable bloodletting, that euen thoſe that ſhalbe the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Surgeons, ſhalbe in danger of drowning themſelues. For we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, haue at ouer high a price learned that thirtie or fourtie thouſand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, armed for the defence of their liues, &amp; of whatſoeuer els they hold dere in this world, cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen without the loſſe of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie neere as manie Catholickes, who marching againſt their willes to this warfare, can hardlie counteruaile the forces of thoſe whoſe hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in deſpaire and who haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left but courage and weapons.</p>
            <p>If the Lords vengeance doeth ſo fiercelie purſue vs, who ſhal remaine to obeie this Edict? If both parties once come to fleſh themſelues each vpon other, euen to the vtter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ruine of the one or other

            <p>But what maie the poſteritie ſaie, when it ſhal heare that your court of Parliament hath propounded the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noring of the articles of a league, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled againſt the eſtate: armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the kinges perſon: riſen vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God himſelfe: Yea ſuch a one as ſpiting nature, commaundeth the fathers to bee no longer fathers to their ſonnes: the mothers to be no mothers to their daughters: inuiting one frend to betraie another, &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the murderer to the ſucceſſion of the murdered, with the fatherlie name of your edictes?</p>
            <p>We will no longer ſtand vpon the particularities of the iniquities, and wronges, in an infinite number ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together vnder this forme of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:22807:6"/>
Edict, wherby thoſe that are authors thereof doe hope to be able to winne the Realme, when they haue once put you to loſe it. But wee beſeech your maieſtie not to bee led by their counſailes, which proceede onelie from blinde ambition: but rather as you haue begun, ſo to folowe the ſo renowmed exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the wiſdome &amp; iuſtice of Salomon, for as he, to the end to trie out the true mother from the ſuppoſed, fained to become cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, ſo do we likewiſe hope that your maieſtie hauing made ſhew to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the tirannous deſires of the league, to the ende to diſcouer them, will take heede of fulfilling them, and rather make your profite of the ſame to the preſeruation of your naturall and obedient ſubiects.</p>
            <p>Wee meane not herein, for to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the taking of <hi>Montlymar,</hi> and many other places ſurpriſed by thoſe of the pretended Religion, neither doe we deſire anie thing ſo much, as that a good peace might reſtore ſtrength &amp; authoritie to your lawes,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:22807:7"/>
whereby to doe you right: but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture permitting all men to defende their liues by whatſoeuer meanes, doeth ſomewhat excuſe thoſe that haue beene brought to that neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and contrariwiſe the ſinne of the others is inexcuſable, in that, that they counſaile your Maieſtie to ſo pernicious a warfare, onelie vpon li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couriſhnes of the confiſcation of the Proteſtants goods, whom with ſuch rigors they haue forced to ſeeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of their loſſes at your coſte, and to confiſcate whatſoeuer they maie be able to enterpriſe vpon your maieſtie.</p>
            <p>As for the Bul, the curat findeth the ſtile thereof to be new, vnuſuall, and ſo farre from the modeſtie of former Popes, that it doeth no waie therein acknowledge the order of a Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor to the Apoſtles. And becauſe throughout our recordes, or in anye antiquitie we find not that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Fraunce</hi> haue beene ſubiect to the Popes iuſtice, either that ſubiects haue taken notice of their <hi>Princes</hi> religion,

the Court cannot determine thereupon vntill the Pope can proue his right which he pretendeth in the tranſlation of Realmes eſtabliſhed and ordeined by GOD, before the name of Pope came into the world: Vntil hee hath declared vnto vs by what title he entermedleth in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſsion of a youthfull and ſtrong prince, who by the courſe of nature maie haue his heire in his loines: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath inſtructed our Religion, with what apparance of iuſtice or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie he denieth the lawe of nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſuch as are fallen into hereſie, yea againſt the holie canons and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent decrees, which neuer ſuffer anie to be holden for an heretike, vntil he hath beene freelie heard in his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, admoniſhed by ſundrie ſynodes &amp; iudged by a Councell called and freelie gathered together: Hee muſt teach vs with what kinde of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie &amp; holines he geueth that which is not his owne, or taketh awaie that that lawfullie belongeth to another: That he ſtirreth vp the vaſſals &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes

to mutinies againſt their lords and ſoueraigne Princes, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the foundations of al lawes and polliticke order: To be breefe, he muſt ſhewe vs by what authoritie hee enterpriſeth to condemne your blood to the fire, &amp; as it were, to ſend part of your ſoule into hell.</p>
            <p>But in as much as this newe Pope in lieu of inſtruction, doeth in his bul breathe out nothing but deſtruction and changeth his ſhepheardes ſtaffe into a flaming or fierie torche, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with vtterlie to deſtroie thoſe whom if they be ſtraied, he ought to winne again to the flock of the church. The Court can no longer conſult vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the publication of a Bull ſo pernitious vnto all Chriſtendome, &amp; to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraintie of your crowne, euen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie deeming it worthie no other recompence, then the ſame which one of your Predeceſſors cauſed vs to geue to the like Bul ſent vnto him by one of this Popes predeceſſors: and that was to caſt it into the fire in the preſence of the whole Frenche

            <p>Theſe things are ſo euident, and haue been ſo narowlie ſearched out, that it were in vaine for vs to abuſe your patience with anie larger decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, whereof we doe not hope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie greater effect or vertue then of

            <p>The neceſſitie of your affaires haue manie times heretofore forced vs to winke at ſundrie oppreſsions &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious inuentions.</p>
            <p>The opinion which your maieſtie had conceiued that thoſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended reformed Religion woulde habandon the exerciſe thereof, and that that faction might be oppreſſed without much bloodſhed or deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this eſtate, haue yet receiued ſo much power ouer our aduiſes as to cauſe vs to paſſe the reuocation of

verie manie Edictes, ſo ſolemnlie ſworne vnto.</p>
            <p>We doe now to our great grief and confuſion perceiue how ſmall profite to you our cowardlines hath brought, how hurtfull it hath beene to all your ſubiectes: and how ſhameful to vs and our poſteritie. Our patience can no lenger be obedience, but vnexcuſable aſtoniſhment if it ſtretcheth anie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or proceedeth to careleſneſſe and contempt of all Common welth.</p>
            <p>It is therefore more conuenient for your maieſtie to haue no Courte of Parliament, then to ſee the ſame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable as we are, &amp; it wil be more honorable for vs to returne priuate into our houſes, or in our boſomes to bewaile the publicke calamities with the reſt of our fellow Citizens, then to enthrall the dignitie of our offices to the curſed inuentions of the enemies of your Crowne.</p>

For the peaſant hath skill inough to enhaunce his labour and fruites: the marchant to caſt his accountes &amp; to rayſe the price of his marchandize, the officer by perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to bring in the graunde ſum that he hath disburſed, the atturnie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his lignes and ſet a greater rate of his writing and ſteps. Finallie all of them doe recouer what they haue paide aforehand, and of whome, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth of the gentleman who ſticketh
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:22807:24"/>
to his loſſes, and haue no further or higher degree where to recouer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Concerning our honours, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that in their proteſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhoulde reſtore each thing into his eminencie, lodge euerie one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his degree, cauſe the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to be reſtored to thoſe from whom they pretende them to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, &amp;c. And becauſe ſome men were vexed euen at the heartes to ſee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine gentlemen about the K. which through his fauour and good will had at once atteyned to the greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, this argument did they vſe to poyſon vs with all: but you maie call to mynde that when the peace was concluded, there was no one word ſpoken thereof, neither ſeemed they to reſtore anie one of thoſe for whoſe ſakes they ſeemed to take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. And as for thoſe whome in their vvritinges they ſo mangled, they haue ſince moſt vildlye ſought their fauours and endeuoured by all meanes to binde them to them,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:22807:25"/>
and in deede you and they ſee them both greater and in further auctoritie then euer before. I here meddle not with the kinges choice, I touch not their deſerts, I knowe there is no dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie ſo great, but is opened to the nobilitie, or to which the arme of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue can not reach: but onelie I would haue you marke what prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces they make and howe they doe dallie with vs at pleaſure, alſo that we may know that they vſe our diſpleaſures, our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes and our greefes: and ſo ſone as they haue done with vs, they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber vs no more.</p>
            <p>At the leaſt they haue done good to the Cleargie: They haue done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for the Church, their chiefe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: the Clergie that pauned foorth themſelues and with ſo good a vvill ſould themſelues for them. Let vs ſee, they promiſed to diſperſe the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and now beholde they haue more firmelie vnited them; Marke how they haue reunited and reconciled them with all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Engliſhmen, Frenchmen, Germains,</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:22807:25"/>
               <hi>Danes, Scots, Swethians and Switzers,</hi> ſee alſo how they haue made them to aſſociate themſelues with our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Princes, and the chiefe Lordes of this Realme. The faction of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion groweth to vnion and ours euen manifeſtlie diſperſeth it ſelfe, howe much better had it beene to proceede by holie admonitions, by gentle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, and by good examples, meanes peraduentute too gentle for the vnpatient, but at the leaſt health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and aſſured, peraduenture leſſe agreeable to the pretended Phiſitions of our ſickneſſe, but at the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, but at the leaſt nothing dange<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous to the diſeaſed.</p>
            <p>What had the Cleargie then gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? which of all the Biſhoppes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding whatſoeuer his charges, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaie that he hath bene made whole againe? that he is anie thing amended by their armies? Naie to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, haue not the Lords of <hi>Ambrun, Lodeue, St. Pens,</hi> &amp; others euen of late loſt their Biſhoprickes? How much of their temporalties muſt they ſell for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:22807:26"/>
the recouerie of them by force? Will not all their affection and heate of pledging, ſelling and contributing bee firſt waſted like ſmoke.</p>
            <p>But wil you alſo ſee that it was but a pretence. The capteins of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> league doe ſkirmiſh together as it ſeemeth: For when there was anie ſpeeche of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in France, they wreſted foorth the kings Edict expreſlie to ſtoppe it, yet haue they permitted and conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Gentlemen of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie part, compounding for their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſhal haue free exerciſe of the Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo that from their ſaide houſes they make no warre againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They haue offred the like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to other townes, caſtles and particular perſons, They ſuffer the reiſtres in the middeſt of their armies to haue their miniſters and ſermons, who haue preached in their Churchyards and Churches, yea and celebrated the ſupper openlie in their campe. That which they permit to ſome, whie ſhould not the K. permit to all? Wherefore maie not the K. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that to his Subiectes which the;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:22807:26"/>
ſo voluntarilie doe ſuffer in ſtrangers? Wherefore ſhal that be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>te of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in the king, which in them is zeale of the Church, meritorious or veniall? Wherefore ſhoulde it bee damnable or mortall to their Superior?</p>
            <p>Theſe men haue in the end robbed and polluted the holie places: theſe men haue ſpoiled and ranſommed the preeſtes and monckes: theſe men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of pietie haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 1000 impieties: theſe men vpon a merriment haue ſoaked out all our goods &amp; drowned vs in all miſchiefes. Of ſuch and ſo great inconueniences what good can redound to vs? to the commons? to the nobilitie? to the cleargie particularlie or generallie? And who did euer anie miſchiefe, at the leaſt if he liſt to be obſtinate in it, but for hope of good. But maie I yet ſale more? what good haue they done to themſelues? For God hath in ſuch ſort curſed their actions that in the meane time while they weene to fee their confraries in the Townes vnder pretence of that authoritie that the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:22807:27"/>
warre granteth them: The beſt place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What followeth? Sith this League is vnprofitable to it ſelfe, alſo that was is hurtfull to all: Seeing that in one and twenty moneths, being in greateſt force, it hath done nothing to anie pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe, but in lieu of going forward hath loſt ground, what ſhall wee doe but haue recourſe to ſome other remedie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
