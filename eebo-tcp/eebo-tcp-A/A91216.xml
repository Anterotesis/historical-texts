            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſummoned by King <hi>Charles</hi> his Writ and Authority,

That thoſe Members who continued to ſit ſince the year 1648. untill the twentieth
of</hi> April 1653. <hi>would return to the exerciſe and diſcharge of their truſt.</hi>
Upon which Mr. <hi>PRYN,</hi> if he could enter the Houſe, intended to ſend
for the reſt of the Members walking in the <hi>Hall</hi> to come in unto them: and
to move that all ſurviving Members of this Parliament, might by joynt
conſent particularly be ſent to, and invited to meet and ſit in the Houſe at
a convenient day, before any Vote or Order paſſed by them then ſitting,
thus ſuddainly convened without any notice (which would be interpreted
rather a ſurprize, and un-Parliamentary practiſe, both by the abſent Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and the whole Nation, than any obliging Parliamentary Vote or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the houſe) and more diſcontent then invite or unite the abſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummoned
Members, of that Parliament making the rent greater then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Upon theſe reſolutions alone, and none other, which Mr. P intended
to propoſe to thoſe then ſitting, he went to the <hi>Lobby</hi> door of the <hi>Commons

Mr. <hi>Th. Gewen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charles Rich,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rich. Knightly,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Hungerford,</hi> and one or two more; which being ſhut to keep out the people
crowding on the ſtairs to get in, through whom they could hardly paſs; Mr. P.
knocked twice or thrice, but could get no admittance, till the door being
opened to let out Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> and ſome other Miniſters, Mr, <hi>P.</hi> with Sir <hi>George
Booth</hi> and Mr. <hi>Anneſley,</hi> being formoſt, preſſed into the <hi>Lobby;</hi> and then the
door being ſhut and bolted again, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> unbolted and held it open till the
reſt came in; where they finding Mr. <hi>John</hi> and Mr. <hi>James Herbert</hi> ſtanding
in the Lobby, accquainted them with their intentions to go then into the
Houſe, who reſolved to go in with them. Coming all up to the Houſe
door, which was ſhut and kept Guarded (as it preſently appeared) by ſome
<hi>Officers of the army;</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> required them <hi>to open the door to let them in, being
all Members of the old Parliament;</hi> who thereupon demanded; <hi>Whether they
had continued ſitting in it ſince</hi> 1648. <hi>to</hi> 1653? M. P. and the reſt all anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115465:3"/>
               <hi>That being Members of the old Parliament, they would give no account to
them or any others of their ſitting, but onely to the Houſe it ſelf whereof they were
Members, being contrary to the priviledge of Parliament, which they and others
were obliged inviolably to maintain:</hi> Upon which demanding their names,
they ſaid; <hi>that if they would ſend in a Note of their names to the houſe, and they
ordered them to come in, they ſhould be admitted.</hi> Whereto Mr. <hi>P.</hi> replyed <hi>We
yet knew not who were within the Houſe, nor whether they were yet ſitting, nor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what account they ſate; nor was it agreeable with the cuſtome or priviledge of
Parliament for one Member to ſend tickets to his fellow-Members for free admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
into the Houſe, being all equals, and having an equal right freely to enter
into it at all times, as well as they; nor was it their duty thus to capitulate with
Members, but obey their juſt commands in opening the door:</hi> Which they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing,
Mr. <hi>P.</hi> demanded, <hi>Who and what they were, being all ſtrangers to them?
and by whoſe authority, or order they thus forcibly kept them out?</hi> They anſwered,
<hi>they were Officers of the Army, and had ſufficint authority to keep them out, if
they had not ſate ſince 1640. till</hi> 1653. Mr. <hi>P. demanded,</hi> From whom they
had their warrant, ſince they could have none from thoſe within, being
but newly entred; and none elſe could give them ſuch a warrant, nor they
within before they heard them, and gave good reaſon for it; demanding
them to produce their <hi>Order,</hi> if they had any in writing, that they
mght know by whoſe authority they were thus forcibly kept out; deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their ſeveral names twice or thrice, wherewith they refuſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them. Upon this M <hi>P.</hi> told them, <hi>They doubted of their Authority, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
thus to ſeclude them, becauſe they were either aſhamed or afraid to tell them
their names, when as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y told them theirs: That they knew not whether they were
Officers of the Army, or not, unleſs they knew their names, ſo that they might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the truth of it, or ſaw their Commiſſions: and if they were Army Officers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
they had publiſhed a printed D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cl. in all their names that morning, inviting</hi>
(as they conceiv'd) <hi>all Members they formerly ſecluded, to return &amp; ſit again
in the Houſe to diſcharge their truſts: wherein they profeſſed their former force
upon, and ſecluſion of them, to be a backſliding, and wandring into Unrighteous
Paths;</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ich they ſeemingly repented of; <hi>promiſing</hi> to yield their utmoſt
aſſiſtance to them to ſit in ſafety; and praying for the preſence and bleſſing
of God upon their endeavours: And if now within few hours after this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance</hi>
publiſhed, <hi>they thus highly and publikely violated it in the view of all
there preſent by returning to their former Backſlidings</hi> and unrighteous paths;
<hi>in ſecluding thoſe who were Members a freſh, and violating their own</hi> Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>none would henceforth credit them, or it.</hi> Upon which one of them told Mr.
<hi>P.</hi> He knew he was none of them who ſate ſince 1648. till 1653. therefore
they were not bound to let him in, being not within their Declaration,
who retorted, <hi>he thought their repentance had been univerſal, not partial; of all
their forces upon the Houſe and Members, eſpecially of their greateſt Dec.</hi> 1648.
<hi>when they not onely ſecluded, but ſecured and impriſoned him and forty more in
Hell, and other places, and forced away three 3 times as many more for diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their truſts, and aſſerting the true</hi> Good Old Cauſe; <hi>againſt their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Truſts Proteſtations,</hi> and printed <hi>Remonſtrances; which if they would look
back upon and well conſider</hi> (<hi>as they proclaim they had done in their</hi> New Decl.)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115465:3"/>
               <hi>they would find to be one of their</hi> greateſt Backſlidings where they firſt turned
out of the way, which cauſed God to withdraw his preſence and good ſpirit
from them ever ſince, and give them up to the proſecuting of a new <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Good Old Cauſe, which had brought us into that poſture, and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thoſe viciſſitudes of dangers, and cauſed God in his providence to make
all Eſſayes to ſettle us, utterly ineffectual; to convince them of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
them from their error, which they now purſued afreſh, as vigorouſly
as ever: That for his own part after his impriſonment by them againſt
both Law and Priviledge in 1648. in ſundry places, he was again forcibly
ſeiſed by ſome of the Army in his houſe in 1650. and kept a cloſe priſoner
neer three years under armed guards of Souldiers in three remote Caſtles
far diſtant from thoſe then ſitting: Therefore they could not make their
unrighteous impriſonment of him then without any cauſe or heaving, a
juſt ground to ſeclude him from ſitting now.</p>
            <p>But all theſe expoſtulations of M. P. and others, not prevailing, they
deſired all preſent to take notice and bear witneſs of this high affront and
breach of priviledge in this their forcible ſecluſion: And ſo departing,
Mr. <hi>Knightly</hi> meeting Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> in the Lobby, complained to
him of this forcible ſecluſion, who gave him a civil anſwer to this effect,
That things were now in an hurry, and their entring at this time into the
Houſe might cauſe ſome diſturbance, but doubted not ſuch courſe would be
taken by the Officers of the Army in few daies, that none ſhould be forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſecluded: and ſo they went from the Lobby into the Hall from whence
they came, acquainting thoſe Members they left there with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
            <p>After ſome conference with one another, it was thought fit they ſhould

the mean time that every one ſhould e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>quire, what old ſecluded, or ſecured
Members were now in Town, and how many Members of the Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were yet living, choſen or ſitting before <hi>December</hi> 6. 1648. when
they were firſt forcibly ſecluded by the Army. Some met accordingly, and
upon conference found, there were about eighty ſecluded Members now in
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> being neer double the number of thoſe ſitting that
day, and above three hundred Members of all ſorts yet living, choſen or
ſitting in the Commons Houſe before <hi>December</hi> 1648. over and above thoſe
that now ſate; all which they conceived ought in juſtice to be ſummoned
by the Speakers Letter, freely to meet and ſit in the Houſe at a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
time to be agreed upon: In order whereunto, ſome ten of them met in
the Councel Chamber of <hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi> (where the old Speaker uſed to ſit
in Councel as a Bencher with the reſt of the Benchers concerning the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Society) as the fitteſt place to write down a Catalogue of all
the ſurviving Members names, by the help of their memories, and the
printed Liſt of them; which having finiſhed, they departed, agreeing to
meet in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall about nine of the clock on Munday morning, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
M. P. carried the Liſt of the Names formerly written, digeſted into an
Alphabetical order, to communicate it to other Members.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115465:4"/>
Thoſe that ſate meeting on the Lords day, adiourned their Houſe till
ten of the clock Monday morning: But the Courts not ſitting in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
Hall that day, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> found the Hall very thin, and few Members in it
whiles he was ſtanding in the Hall expecting thoſe who promiſed to meet
there, he was twice informed one after another, that there were no guards
at all at the houſe Door, that any perſon might freely go into it without
any examination, there being but few Members within, &amp; the doors ſtanding
open. Whereupon he ſpake to four or five Members there met to go along
with him into the Houſe, and if they were freely admitted, to give notice
of it to the reſt to follow after if they were pleaſed, ſome of them were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to go being formerly repulſed, thinking it better to make a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of their former forcible ſecluſion on Saturday, and to ſignifie it by a
Letter directed to the Speaker, ſubſcribed with their names, which Mr. <hi>P.</hi>
conceived ſuperfluous, ſince the door now ſtood freely open to all, without
any Guards to ſeclude any, and that as he apprehended in purſuite of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
General <hi>Lamberts</hi> promiſe to Mr. <hi>Knightly;</hi> and it would be idle to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of that force by Letter, wherewith they might now acquaint thoſe
then ſitting by their own mouthes if there were cauſe. Upon which ground,
Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Anneſly,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hungerford</hi> about ten of the Clock went to
the houſe, where the doors of the <hi>Lobby</hi> and <hi>Houſe</hi> were at firſt knock ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to them by the ordinary Door-keepers, upon their telling them they
were Members, (there being no Guard at either door:) who delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to each of them as Members a printed Paper, Intituled, <hi>A Declaration
of the Parliament aſſembled at Weſtminſter, Saturday</hi> 7. May 1659. They found
above nine or ten of thoſe who ſate within the Houſe, who courteouſly
ſaluted them: After ſome ſhort diſcourſes, Mr. <hi>Anſley,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hungerford</hi>
leaving Mr. <hi>P.</hi> in the Houſe, (out of which he reſolved not to ſtir upon
any occaſion for fear of a new forcible ſecluſion) went back into the Hall
to acquaint the Members in it, they might freely enter if they pleaſed:
Mr. <hi>Anneſly</hi> returning, was forcibly kept out from reentring by ſome Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ſent thither (as he conceited) for that purpoſe, wherewith he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Mr. <hi>P.</hi> by a note, deſiring to ſpeak with him at the Houſe door; which
being opened, Mr. <hi>Anneſly</hi> preſſed to go in to ſpeak with him, but was denied
entrance, unleſs he would give his paroll preſently to come out again and
not to ſtay whithin: whereupon he ſaid, though they had often broken their
parolls with him, yet he would not break his paroll but would come forth
ſo ſoon as he had ſpoken with Mr. <hi>P.</hi> which he accordinly performed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, M. <hi>P.</hi> had conference with divers Members as they came in, who
ſaid they were glad to ſee him in health, and meet him there again. The
Houſe being thin Mr. <hi>P.</hi> turned to the ſtatute of 17 <hi>Caroli, C.</hi> 7. reading it
to himſelf, and after that to two other Members, telling them it was a doubt
whether the old Parliament was not determined by the Kings death, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that act which was fit to be firſt freely debated in a full Houſe,
before ought elſe was done. Upon which they demanded, why he came
amongſt them, if he made a ſcruple or thought it to be diſſolved? who
anſwered to have it fully debated and reſolved in a full and free
Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115465:4"/>
After which Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge</hi> coming in, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſaluted and told him,
He was glad to meet him again in this place; who preſently anſwered, He
had nothing to do to ſit there as a Member, being formerly ſecluded.
Whereto he replyed, He had as good right to ſit there as himſelf, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Member whatſoever, upon the account of the old Parliament, if in
being, having acted, written, ſuffered more in defence of the Rights and
Priviledges of Parliament, than himſelf, or any ſitting with him. Upon
which Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> coming in, and ſtepping up to them, ſaid in a mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
manner, Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> What make you here? you ought not to come
into this Houſe, being formerly voted out, I wiſh you as a friend quietly
to depart hence, elſe ſome courſe will be preſently taken with you for your
preſumption: which Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> ſeconded, telling him, if he refuſed, that
there would be a ſpeedy courſe taken, and a charge put in againſt him, for
his meetings on Saturday, and actings againſt the Houſe: To which he
replyed, He had as good, if not a better right to ſit than either of them:
That he knew of no Vote to ſeclude, nor of any there who had right or
power to vote him out, being equally intruſted with themſelves for the
whole Nation, and thoſe he repreſented: That he was never convicted of
any breach of his Parliamentary truſt, and hoped they would have both
the juſtice and patience to hear, before they voted him out: And then he
doubted not to make it appear, themſelves were greater Infringers of their
truſts, and more worthy to be voted out than himſelf. As for their Charge
and menaces, he was no way affrighted with them, it being as free and
lawful for him and other Members, to meet and adviſe together, both as
Members and Freemen of <hi>England,</hi> for preſervation of themſelves, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Rights and Parliaments Priviledges, when forcibly ſecluded, as they
did on Saturd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y; as for themſelves, or the Army Officers to meet private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and publickly, both in and out of the Houſe, to deprive them of their
priviledges, as they had oft times done of late: That theſe high menacing
words, where a very ill performance of their new publiſhed Declaration, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him at the door, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they were reſolved (by the gracious aſſiſtance of Almighty God) to
apply themſelves to the faithfull diſcharge of their legal Truſt; to aſſert,
eſtabliſh and ſecure, the property and Liberty of the people in reference
unto all, both as Men and as Chriſtians.</hi>) which if they ſhould publikely violate
and null by any uniuſt Charge, or proceedings againſt him, who had ſuffered ſo
much, both as an Engliſh Freemen, Chriſtian, and Member too <hi>(by their three
years cloſe impriſonment of him without cauſe or hearing)</hi> under their
new Free-ſtate, when firſt erected, and now again upon their very firſt reviving
of it, though a Member, only for coming into the Houſe and meeting with other
Members, to claim their rights: It would highly reflect upon their intended new
Free-ſtate, and make all out of love with it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>P.</hi> having acquainted ſome ſecluded Members in the Hall with theſe
paſſages in the Houſe; who agreeing to ſend a Letter to the Speaker touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their forcible ſecluſion on Saturday, he returned to <hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi> where
he dined in the Hall: immediately after dinner he repaired to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
with a reſolution to go into the Houſe, if admitted, or proteſt againſt the
force, if ſecluded by the Army Guards there placed; he found an whole
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115465:5"/>
Troop of Horſe in the Palace-yard, and a Company of Foot on the Stairs,
and Court of Requeſts, drawn thither to keep him and other Members out;
whereupon he walked in the Hall till paſt three a clock, expecting the
Speakers coming, with whom he intended to enter: At laſt, being informed
that he went the back way without the Mace, and was gone into the Houſe,
Mr. <hi>P.</hi> to avoid tumult (a company of unknown perſons in the Hall going
after to ſee the iſſue) went purpoſely forth towards the Abby, till all were
gone from the ſteps; and then going up only with one of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
(no Member) he found the door and ſtairs before the Lobby ſtrictly
guarded with <hi>Red-coats,</hi> who with their Halberts croſſed the door and ſteps
ſo thick, that none could paſs: whereupon Mr. <hi>P.</hi> demanded entrance, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he was a Member; and they being ignorant who he was, permitted him
to paſs through their pikes into the Lobby, but ſecluded his friend from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up with him. When he came at the Houſe door to enter, ſeveral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Army there placed (one of them ſitting in a Chair) told him,
That he muſt not enter, and that they had ſpecial Order to keep him out of
the Houſe: Whereupon he proteſted againſt this their forcible double ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
as an high contempt and breach of priviledge, contrary to their
own and the ſitting Members Declaration publiſhed that day, demanding in
the name of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe for whom he was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
free admiſſion for himſelf and other Members they kept out by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
force of Horſe and Foot, which was a worſe and more real levying
of war againſt the Parliament, then the beheaded King or his Party were
guilty of.</p>
            <p>After which one of the Army-Officers told Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> he had deſerted
the Good Old Cauſe: To which he replied, that the true good Cauſe for
which they were firſt raiſed, was only to defend the Kings perſon, Kingdom,
Parliament, all its Members, Priviledges, and ſecure them againſt all force
and violence whatſoever, which cauſe they had not only deſerted, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed,
and fought againſt, contrary to all former Engagements. To which
cauſe he adhered, and deſired admiſſion to maintain it. To which he
anſwered, That indeed was once their Good Old Cauſe, but now it was not
ſo, for ſince they had purſued another Cauſe, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> replied, that then
they were real Back-ſliders therein, and their cauſe neither old nor good,
but bad, new, and deſtructive to the former old one.</p>
