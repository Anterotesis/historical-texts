            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This he did oftentimes, without the leaſt diſcovery who he was, returning home to <hi>White-Hall</hi> early in the morning. Now in his return home through the <hi>Strand,</hi> he took notice of a certain Cobler, who was conſtantly up and at Work, Whiſtling and Singing every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; he therefore reſolved to ſee him, and be acquainted with him; in order to which he immediately knocks off the Heel of his Shooe, by hitting it againſt the Stones: Having ſo done, he bounced at the Coblers Stall; who's there, cries the Cobler? Here is one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid the King. With that the Cobler opened his Stall door, and the King asked him, if he could ſet on his Heel again? Yes that I can, ſays the Cobler.

The King being hardly able to forbear Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the kindneſs of the Cobler, asked him if there was not a Houſe hard by which ſold a Cup of Ale, where the People were up? Yea, (ſaid the Cobler) there is an Inn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the way, where I believe the folk of the houſe are up; for the Carriers go from thence very early in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. With that the King borrowed an old Shooe of the Cobler, and went over to the Inn, deſiring the Cobler to bring his Shooe to him thither, ſo ſoon as he had put the Heel on again; the Cobler promiſed he would. So making what haſte he could to put the Heel on, he carried it over to the King, ſaying; Honeſt Blade, here is thy Shooe again; I'le warrant it will not come oft in haſte. Very well, ſaid the King, What muſt you have for your pains? A Couple of Pence (anſwered the Cobler.) Well, ſaid the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

merry Fellow, here is a Teſter for thee. Come ſit thee down by me, I will drink to thee a whole Pot, here's a good Health to the King: with all my heart, ſaid the Cobler, I will pledge thee were it Water. So the Cobler ſat himſelf down by the King, and was very merry, and drank oft his Liquor very freely. He alſo ſung ſome of his merry Songs and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereat the King Laughed heartily, and was very Pleaſant and Iocuno with the Cobler; telling him withal, that his Name was <hi>Harry Tudor,</hi> and that he belonged to the Court, and if he would come and ſee him there, he would make him very welcome, becauſe he was ſuch pleaſant merry Company, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to be there, and not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his Name, but to ask any one for him about the Court, and they will bring you to him: For (ſaid the King) I am very well known at the Court. Now the Cobler little dream'd that it was the King which ſpoke to him, much leſs that the Kings Name was <hi>Harry Tudor</hi>: Therefore
<pb facs="tcp:37277:5"/>
with a great deal of Confidence, he ſtands up and pulls off his Hat, and makes two or three fine ſcrapes with his Legs, gives the King many thanks, withal telling him, that he was one of the honeſteſt Fellows he ever met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in his Life-time. And though (he had never been at Court) yet it ſhould not be long before he would make a Holiday to come and ſee him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King diſcharging the Houſe for what he had drank, would have taken his leave of the Cobler. But the Cobler taking him by the hand, ſaid, By my faith, you muſt not go yet, you ſhall firſt go and ſee my poor Habitation; I have there a Tub of good Nappy Ale was never Tapt yet, you muſt needs go and taſte of it; for you are the honeſteſt Merrieſt Blade that I ever met withal, and I love an honeſt merry Companion with all my heart.</p>

               </head>
               <p>SO the Cobler took the King with him over the way, where he had a Celler adjoyning to his Stall, which was handſomely and neatly Furniſhed for a poor Man of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: Into this Celler he had the King, there, ſaith he, ſit down, you are Welcome: But I muſt deſire you to ſpeak ſoftly, for fear of wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Wife <hi>Joan,</hi> who lies here hard by (ſhewing the King a cloſe Bed, made neatly up at one corner of the Celler, much like unto a Cloſet) and if ſhe awake, ſhe will up with a Iuniper Lecture, will make your Ears ding again. At which Speech of the Coblers, the King Laugh'd, and told him, He would be mindful to obſerve his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. With that the Cobler kindled a Fire, and fetch'd out his Brown Loaf, from which he cut a
<pb facs="tcp:37277:6"/>
luſty Toaſt, which he ſet a Baking at the Fire; then he brought out his Cheſhire Cheeſe; Come (ſaith the Cobler) will you eat ſome Cheſhire-Cheeſe? there is as good Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Eating, as there is in Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which made the King admire the Honeſt Freedom of the Cobler. So having eat a bit, the Cobler be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a Health to all true hearts and merry Companions: at which the King ſmiled, ſaying, God-a-mercy, Friend, I will pledge you. In this manner they eat together, until it was almoſt break of Day: the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler being very free of his Liquor, and delighting the King with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his Old Stories, inſomuch that the King was highly pleaſed with the manner of the Coblers entertainment. When on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the Coblers Wife <hi>Joan</hi> began to awake: E'faith (ſays the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler) you muſt be gone now my Wife <hi>Joan</hi> begins to Grumble, ſhe will wake preſently, and I would not for half the Shooes in my Shop, ſhe ſhould find you here. So taking

by the Hand, he led him up Stairs, ſaying, Farewel honeſt Blade, it ſhall not be long before I will make a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidy, and come ſee thee at Court: You ſhall be welcome, replyed the King: So they both parted, the King on his way to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and the Cobler to his Celler, putting all things to rights again before his Wife <hi>Joan</hi> aroſe, went to work again, Whiſtling and Singing, as merrily as he uſed to do: Being much ſatisfied that he had happened on ſo good a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and much pleaſing himſelf in his thoughts how Merry he ſhould be when he came to Court.</p>

Whereupon one Evening as they ſat at Supper, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her in a very good humour, he began to lay open his mind to her, telling her the whole Story of his new acquaintance, repeating it over and over again, that he was the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſteſt Fellow that ever he met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Husband (quoth ſhe) becauſe you have been ſo ingenious to tell me the whole truth, I will give you leave to make a Holiday for this once; you ſhall go to the Court, and I will make you as Fine as I can: So it

was agreed that he ſhould go the next day. Whereupon <hi>Joan</hi> aroſe betimes the next morning, to Bruſh up her Husbands Holiday Cloaths, and to make him look as ſmug as ſhe could: She Waſht and Iron'd his Lace Band, and made his Shooes ſhine that he might ſee his Face in 'em. Having done this, ſhe made her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to riſe and pull off his Shirt, then ſhe waſht him with warm Water, from Head to foot, putting him on a clean Shirt, afterwards ſhe dreſſed him in his Holiday Cloaths, pinning on his Lace-Band in Pimlico.</p>

on this body, and that body, as he walkt up and down, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who to ask for <hi>Harry Tudor,</hi> at laſt he eſpyed one as he thought, in the Habit of a Serving-Man, to him he makes his Addreſs, ſaying, Doſt thou hear honeſt Fellow, do you know one <hi>Harry Tudor,</hi> which belongs to the Court? Yes, ſaid the Man, follow me and I will bring you to him: with that he had him preſently up into the Guard-Chamber, telling one of the Yeomen of the Guard there was one that enquired for <hi>Harry Tudor.</hi> Replyed the Yeoman, I know him very well, if you will pleaſe to go along with me, I will bring you to him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. So the Cobler followed the Yeoman, much admiring the Finery of the Rooms he went through, he thought within himſelf, that the Yeoman was miſtaken in the perſon whom he enquired after: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pulled him back by the Coat, and told him, that he did believe he was miſtaken in the Perſon whom he enquired after. For (ſaid he) him
<pb facs="tcp:37277:9"/>
who I look for, is a plain merry ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Fellow, his Name is <hi>Harry Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>: We drank two Pots together, not long ſince, I ſuppoſe he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to ſome Lord or other about the Court. I tell you Friend, replyed the Yeoman, I know him very well, do but follow me, and I ſhall bring you to him ſtraight. So going forward, he came at laſt to the Room where the King was, accompanied with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his Nobles who attended him.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Yeoman had put by the Arras, he ſpoke aloud, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; May it pleaſe your Majeſty, here is one that enquires for <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tudor.</hi> The Cobler hearing this, thought he had committed no leſs than Treaſon, therefore he up with his Heels and run for it. But not being acquainted with the ſeveral turnings and Rooms through which he came, he was ſoon overtaken, and brought before the King, whom the Cobler little thought to be the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he enquired after: Therefore in a trembling condition, he fell down
<pb facs="tcp:37277:9"/>
upon his knees, ſaying; May it pleaſe your Grace, may it pleaſe your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I am a poor Cobler, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for one <hi>Harry Tudor,</hi> who is a very honeſt Fellow, I mended the Heel of his Shooe not long ſince, for which he paid me nobly, and gave me two or three Pots to boot: And I had him over afterwards to my Celler<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where we drank part of a Tub of nappy Ale, and was very Merry, until my Wife <hi>Joan</hi> began to Grumble, which put an end to our Merriment for that time. But I told him, I would come to the Court and ſee him as ſoon as conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently I could. Well, ſaid the King, be not troubled; do you know this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Fellow again if you ſee him? Yea, that I do from a thouſand (replyed the Cobler.) Then ſaid the King, ſtand up and be not afraid, but look well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you, peradventure you may find this honeſt Fellow amongſt this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Whereupon the Cobler aroſe and looked wiſhfully upon the King, and the reſt of his Nobles, but to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no purpoſe. For though he ſaw ſomething in the Kings face which he
<pb facs="tcp:37277:10"/>
thought he had ſeen before, yet he could not imagine him to be <hi>Harry Tudor,</hi> whoſe Heel of his Shooe he had mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and who had been ſo merry with him, both at the Inn and at his own Celler. He therefore told the King, he did not expect to find <hi>Harry Tudor</hi> among ſuch fine Folks as he ſaw there; but that the perſon that he looked for, was a plain honeſt true-hearted fellow. Adding withal, that he was ſure, that did <hi>Harry Tudor</hi> but know that he was come to Court, he would make him welcome. At which Speech of the Coblers, the King had much ado to forbear laughing out-right: But keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Countenance as ſteady as he could, he ſpoke to the Yeomen of the Guard, here (ſaith he) take down this honeſt Cobler into my Celler, and let him drink my Health, I will take order that <hi>Harry Tudor</hi> ſhall come to him preſently; ſo away went the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ready to leap out of his skin for joy, not only that he had come off ſo well, but alſo that he ſhould find his Friend <hi>Harry Tudor.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. V. The Coblers Entertainment in the King's Celler; and how he met with his new Friend <hi>Harry Tudor,</hi> and how he come to know him to be the King.</head>
               <p>THe Cobler had not been long in the King's Celler, before the King came to him in the ſame Habit which he had on when the Cobler mended his Shooe; whereupon the Cobler knew him, and run and embraced him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Honeſt <hi>Harry,</hi> I have made a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liday on purpoſe to come and ſee you; but I had much ado to get leave of my Wife <hi>Joan,</hi> who was loath I ſhould looſe ſo much time from my work; but I was reſolved to ſee you, I therefore made my ſelf as fine as I could. But (i'le tell you <hi>Harry)</hi> when I came to the Court I was in a peck of troubles how to find you out; but at laſt I met with a Man who told me he knew you very well, and that he would bring me to you; but inſtead of doing ſo, he brought me before the King, which had almoſt frightned me out of my ſeven
<pb facs="tcp:37277:11"/>
ſenſes. But in good faith (added the Cobler) I am reſolved to be Merry with you, ſince I have the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to meet with you at laſt. I that you ſhall, replyed the King, we will be as merry as Princes. With that he call'd for a large Glaſs of Wine, and drank to the Cobler the King's good Health. God-a-mercy, ſaid the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, honeſt <hi>Harry,</hi> I will pledge thee with all my heart. Now after the Cobler had drank about four or five good Healths, he began to be Merry, and fell a ſinging his old Songs and Catches, which pleaſed the King very much, and made him laugh heartily. When of a ſudden ſeveral of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles came into the Celler, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rich in Apparel, who all ſtood bare to <hi>Harry Tudor,</hi> which put the Cobler into a great amazement at firſt, but recovering himſelf, he lookt more wiſhfully upon <hi>Harry Tudor</hi>: when preſently he knew him to be the King, which he ſaw in the Preſence-Chamber, tho' in other Habit, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fell down upon his knees, ſaying, May it pleaſe your Grace, may
<pb facs="tcp:37277:11"/>
it pleaſe your Highneſs, I am an honeſt poor Cobler, and mean no harm: No, no, ſaid the King, nor ſhall receive none here. He commanded him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to riſe up, and be as merry as he was before: and though he knew him now to be the King, yet he ſhould uſe the ſame freedom with him, as he did when he mended the Heel of his Shooe. This kind Speech of the Kings, and three or four Glaſſes of Wine more, made the Cobler to be in as good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour as he was before, telling the King ſeveral of his pritty Stories, and ſinging ſome of his beſt Songs; very much to the ſatisfaction of the King and his Nobles.</p>

               <p>NOw the King conſidering the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant humour of the Cobler, how innocently merry he was, and free from any Deſigns, and that he was a perſon that laboured very hard, and took a great deal of pains for a ſmall Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, was pleaſed out of his Princely Grace and favour, to allow him a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Annuity of forty Mark a year, for the better ſupport of his jolly humour, and the maintenance of himſelf and his Wife <hi>Joan</hi>; and that he ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted one of his Court, and that he might have the freedom of his Celler when ever he pleaſed, which being ſo much beyond the Coblers expectation, did highly extenuate the Coblers hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, much to the ſatisfaction of the King. So after a great many Legs and Scrapes, he returned home to his Wife <hi>Joan,</hi> with the joyful News of his kind Reception at Court, which ſo well pleaſed her, that ſhe did not think much at the great pains ſhe took in Tricking him up for that Iourney.</p>
