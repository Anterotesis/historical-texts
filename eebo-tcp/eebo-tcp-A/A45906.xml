            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Introduction.</head>
            <p>THE just Horrour that all honest men conceiv'd at the harsh and unneighbourly Treatment of the Scots Colony at <hi>Darien,</hi> laid the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who have been most active against it, under a necessity of blackening the Reputation of those concern'd in that Settlement. This they thought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in order to prevent any enquiry, that perhaps might be made: Why a Neighbouring Nation united to the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> by Situation, Government, Interest, Religion, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and constant Inter-marriages, should be provok'd and trampl'd upon in such a manner, contrary to their own Laws and Original Constitution, and which may pave the way in time for Treating our Neighbours in the same manner.</p>
            <p>To prevent any such Enquiry, those
<pb facs="tcp:66218:3"/>
Gentlemen that have been pleas'd to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize themselves as much by their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the Scotish Nation, as the latter have signalized their Valour and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for our common Liberty and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have been at pains and expence to save the Libeller <hi>H—s</hi> from the Gallows, by putting a stop to his Trial, and filling his Pockets with Money, on condition that he would bespatter the Reputation of the Scots Colony and their Masters. The Crime is indeed unnatural for a man to turn Renegado and a Traitor to his Country; none but a Monster like <hi>H</hi>— the Surgeon could have entertain'd such a Thought: He sold his God in the Last Reign, by turning Papist, and therefore 'tis no great Wonder he should sell his Country in this, and solemnly renounce his going Northward for ever, provided he might be secur'd against going West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for once.</p>
            <p>This being the Case of the Doughty Evidence, that the Faction have produc'd against the Scots Colony; we leave it to the World to judg what credit ought to
<pb facs="tcp:66218:3"/>
be given to his Testimony, since it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that he hath giv'n it in to save his Life, to gain Money, and to give vent to his Malice. The latter he owns in the beginning of his Book, and repeats it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>p.</hi> 161. where he says he took this way to right himself, because of the Scots here in Town being on his Top, and of some other harsh usage which he receiv'd at the hands of the Scots Company.</p>
            <p>The very manner of giving in his Evidence lays him open to the Lash of the English Law; and it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd that his train of Blasphemies, and constant ridiculing the Text, would have been taken notice of e're now by a certain Court at the West end of <hi>Paul</hi>'s, but that he is protected by some Gentlemen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to a Court at the West end of the Town.</p>
            <p>His invenom'd malice is demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by the sport he makes to himself throughout his Libel at the Calamities and Misery of his Fellow-Creatures and Countrymen; so that never did any man more exactly fill up the Character
<pb facs="tcp:66218:4"/>
of a Renegado than himself: for as those Miscreants stab an Image of our Saviour to the Heart, as a proof of having abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely denied him; <hi>H—s</hi> hath in the same manner done all he could to stab the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his native Country, as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain evidence of his being turn'd a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in Nature; for which even they that imploy him must needs abhor him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they love to see the Image of their own Crimes in his Lovely Features.</p>
            <p>We have not enter'd upon the detail of his malicious Lies with which he hath stuff'd his Book, but have only pointed at the chief of them which are so very noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as may well put his Suborners to the Blush that they should not have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught him his Lesson better, or have seen he had conn'd it more exactly; for they are such gross Contradictions either to common Sense or to what he himself had advanc'd in his Libel, that none but one who had swallow'd Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation could be guilty of the like.</p>
            <p>It's needless to enlarge upon his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, since it's impossible to conceive
<pb facs="tcp:66218:4"/>
a worse Idea of him than all Men of Sense will immediately form to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they know he is a Traitor to his Country.</p>
            <p>He was was formerly a Surgeon in the Fleet, and made some Interest amongst the Officers, by Female Mediation, which was allow'd him by his last Religion (for his Book shews that now he has none.) Hence it is, that he expresses himself so readily in the Dialect of his Office, and talks of <hi>Bullying</hi> Kings in his Dedication, to shew us that he was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with B-dy-house Rhetorick, and they that know his Friends in <hi>Little—B—n,</hi> say he has convey'd his Libel to the World through a very proper Channel.</p>
            <p>Whilst he was a Surgeon in the Fleet, his ill Nature having condemn'd him to perpetual Broyls, he had the Impudence to draw upon his Captain ashore, who wounded him so as 'twas thought might have put a period to his Infamous Life, upon which his Captain was Confin'd, but the Wound not being Morral, the Gentleman was set at Liberty, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on Board, a Council of War was held, by which <hi>H—s</hi> was like to have had an Exit more answerable to his desert, at the Yard-Arm; but that one of our Country-men who Commanded in the Place, sav'd him out of Pity, and whilst he was sculking at <hi>London</hi> to avoid this Prosecution; others of them out of
<pb facs="tcp:66218:5"/>
Compassion hir'd him to go along with their Fleet, for which he hath made his Country such a Grateful Reward, as hath verify'd the Proverb, <hi>That save a R—gue from the Gallows he shall be the first that will cut your Throat.</hi> We leave his Suborners to think on't.</p>
            <p>His Captain being thus disappointed of having Justice executed, was forc'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himself with <hi>Pricking him Run,</hi> that he might not have any claim to his Wages; but since his return from <hi>Darien,</hi> and engaging in the Honourable service of Reviling and Belying his Country, his Suborners out of their innate Bounty and Gratitude, have got him deliver'd from all farther Prosecution, entitled him to his Wages, and given him the opportunity to value himself upon his Corespondence at the Court end of the Town, so that now he thinks himself sure of a Patent for Life, and that he shall never be oblig'd to go up <hi>Holborn</hi>-Hill except his important occasions call him now and then that way, to enable him to pay his present Debts, when some of his Brethren, pass that Road to pay their last.</p>
            <p>It had been easie for us to have given such a History of his Life as would have put his Suborners to the blush, but we reserve that to make use of as we shall see occasion; what's said is enough to let them know how much they are to trust to his Evidence, if they think fit to make further use of him, either by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling his Country, or accusing any of those great Families he threatens in his Dedication.</p>

            <head>AN INQUIRY INTO The Causes of the Miscarriage of the <hi>Scots</hi> Colony at <hi>Darien.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE main design of <hi>H—s</hi> and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orners, is to charge the Miscarriage of the <hi>Scots</hi> Colony upon their own Country, to clear some Gentlemen that perhaps may be found within the Verge of <hi>White-Hall,</hi> from having any hand in it, and to evince the necessity of those Proclamations publish'd against the <hi>Scots</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> so as no Person or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>England</hi> may seem justly chargeable with the ruin of that Colony; a certain Evidence that the Crime is very black, and that they are put to a miserable shift, when those Gentlemen are at such expence of Contrivance and Pains to wipe off the Imputation, and so ready to fall in with any Tool that they think can assist them in so doing.</p>
            <p>Enough has been said already to demonstrate that the evidence of such an infamous Person as <hi>H—s,</hi> and so circumstantiated, would not be admitted in any Court of Judicature in <hi>Europe,</hi> especially against such an honourable Society as the Company of <hi>Scotland</hi> for trading to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> which consists of the very flower of the Nation, and perhaps has more Persons of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66218:6"/>
Birth, Quality and Merit in it, than any trading Company that ever yet was erected in the World. The Directors particularly, whom <hi>H—s</hi> and his Masters have condemned to the Halter, <hi>p.</hi> 46. are most of them Persons of that Quality, Estate, Worth, and untainted Honor, as the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of no one particular Person, tho of never so good Repute, could in justice or decency be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against them, and much less the malicious Calumnies of a Renegado.</p>
            <p>But to set this mater in a clearer Light: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we have only <hi>H—s</hi>'s own word for what he asserts in vindication of his Friends and Suborners; we shall demonstrate against him and them too from undeniable matter of Fact, that some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>England</hi> are justly chargeable with the ruin of that Colony.</p>
            <p>We shall begin with the opposition made to the Scots Act by the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> (to whom the matter was misrepresented) the Answer they obtain'd from the King, and the Prosecution they commenc'd and threatned against English Natives, and <hi>Scots-men</hi> residing in <hi>England,</hi> that should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to the <hi>Scots</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>In the next place we alledg the English Resident's Memorial at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> against that Governments suffering any of their Subjects to subscribe to the <hi>Scots</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>It is likewise well enough known that the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Example of the <hi>English</hi> Court hinder'd the Subscriptions of our Neighbours in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can it be denied but this continued Thread of Opposition from the Court of <hi>England,</hi> must needs hinder the Subscriptions of a great many in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who could not but foresee that a Storm was threatned by so many Clouds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66218:6"/>To this we may add, that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> have not yet forgot the discourting of the Marquiss of <hi>Tweddale</hi> (who was known to be an able States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a true Patriot to his Country) because of his touching that Act, when he had the Honor to represent his Majesty on the Throne.</p>
            <p>Nor was it the least of our Misfortunes, that we lost such an able and faithful Minister of State as Secretary <hi>Iohnston,</hi> and that too upon the account of his affection to his Country in this matter. We are very well satisfied that his Majesty, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd him to that Post for his Merit, and was so well satisfied with his ability and care, would scarcely have parted with a Minister of that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Faithfulness and Penetration, but by the Intrigues of some People at Court.</p>
            <p>Before we proceed any further with the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Opposition made to us, we shall obviate one Objection which some Persons may possibly make, <hi>viz.</hi> That all we have said hitherto is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose, because it does not regard our Colony, but the Company. To which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: 1. That this is so far from being an Excuse to our Opposers, that it highly aggravates our Charge against them, as being a plain demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they were resolv'd to obstruct our Trade in every respect, and whatever it should be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exception. 2. That the opposing of the Company was the direct Method to prevent our ever having a Colony; and by the Laws of God and Man, those who endeavour to destroy the <hi>Embrio,</hi> are chargeable with a design of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Birth. But we shall come closer to the point in a little time, and resume the thread of our Narrative after one or two Observations upon what we have said already, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66218:7"/>
                  <item>(1.) That the greatest of those Difficulties and Disappointments which <hi>H—s</hi> says in his Book, the Company met with as to their Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Payments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may justly be charg'd to the account of that opposition made us from the Court of <hi>England.</hi>

That there is so little reason to upbraid us, that our Efforts were not greater, that it is rather to be wonder'd at that the Company was not dash'd to pieces and crush'd in the bud; and much more that ever they should have been able to weather out the storm of so much Indignation, overcome all those Difficulties, find Mony enough to build Ships, equip out a Fleet, and make a Settlement in <hi>America,</hi> when neither <hi>England,</hi> nor <hi>Scots-men</hi> residing there, <hi>Hamburgh</hi> nor <hi>Holland,</hi> shall dare to assist them without incurring his Majesty of <hi>England</hi>'s displeasure.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But to come directly to the Narrative of the Opposition made to our Colony. It is well enough known that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as many other Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> hath suffered much for three or four years past by bad Harvests, which rendred them uncapable of providing Bread for their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at home, and much more of sending Supplies to their Infant Colony abroad: This was very manifest to some People about <hi>White-hall,</hi> and care was taken we should have none for our Mony from <hi>England,</hi> tho that Nation could have spar'd it, and perhaps we might have pleaded it as our merit, when in Parliament we voted his Majesty a Standing Army, upon his Royal Word that it was necessary, tho we had more need to have sav'd the Mony to have bought Bread for thousands of our People that were starving for want, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us the melancholy prospect of dying by <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>als in our Streets, and have left behind them a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66218:7"/>
reigning Contagion, which hath swept away multitudes more, and God knows where it may end.</p>
            <p>Tho our Country was reduced to this deplorable state, that a generous Enemy would have shew'd us compassion, yet the malice of our Court Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries did not rest here, nor with having follow'd us into <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> but pursues us into <hi>America</hi>; and with angry Proclamations forbids the Subjects there, on pain of his Majesty's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, to afford any manner of assistance to the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Darien</hi>: So that we are starv'd at home and abroad by our Enemies at Court, who having by this means dispossess'd us of our Colony at <hi>Darien,</hi> and knowing that the good People of <hi>England</hi> had reason to cry shame upon them, and might perhaps take their own time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this inhuman Treatment of their Neighbours in <hi>Scotland</hi>; therefore they found it necessary to suppress a Book wrote in defence of the <hi>Scots</hi> Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, and to hire a <hi>Scots</hi> Renegado Surgeon to varnish over the matter, and to represent his Countrymen as Knaves and Fools, that so they might fall unpitied.</p>
            <p>To return again to the Opposition made us in <hi>America</hi>: It is not enough that we are starv'd out of <hi>Darien,</hi> but when we come from thence, and so leave what the Proclamations suppose to be <hi>the Dominions of their Allies,</hi> yet we must not be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the <hi>English</hi> Plantations, nor have Provisions in exchange for our effects, tho our Men be dying for want, on pain of incurring the Displeasure of the Court; and therefore those who are willing to relieve us, must put their Inventions on the rack to find out a way to do that with safety, which common Humanity, and much more Christianity, obliges, them to do to a Turk or a Jew in the like circumstances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:66218:8"/>Nay farther, tho notwithstanding our distress at home, we make shift to send a Convoy to our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony abroad, because our future hopes depended so much upon it, they shall not have leave to put in to any <hi>English</hi> Port to refit, refresh, or stay for any of their company that may be separated from them by storm; and yet our Friends who were so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental in obtaining and publishing those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, must bribe a Renegado to declare to the World in print, that they were no way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the Blood of his Country-men that were starved to death at <hi>Darien.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will appear plain that the Ruin of the Colony is chargeable on the Proclamations, if we consider the Consternation that must needs be among them when they saw themselves condemned, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invaded the Dominions of his Majesty's Allies; so that they had all the reason in the world to think that they were not only precluded from all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of having any further supply or assistance from home, but in danger of being attack'd by his Fleet, as they that advis'd the emitting of those Proclamations must needs think his Majesty was oblig'd in Honour and Justice to order, if he was of opinion that the <hi>Scots</hi> had broken the Alliance betwixt him and <hi>Spain.</hi> Let any reasonable man consider what Anguish and Perplexity these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, join'd to their pinching Wants and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumstances, must occasion in the minds of those poor men, and whether it might not give a handle to those of them that were unwilling to stay, to mutiny against the rest, and put all into disorder, which might be fomented by other ill persons amongst them; for we are not to suppose that with 11 or 1200 men, there went no other ill man but <hi>H—s,</hi> since it's not improbable that they who opposed our Company so much from the very
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66218:8"/>
beginning, might be prompted by the same Malice to send Spies and Traitors amongst our Men on purpose to defeat their Design.</p>
            <p>If it had not been that they were thus discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and brought to their wits-end by those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, they would certainly have had so much Conduct as to have sent away a great part of their Men to <hi>Iamaica,</hi> or any of the <hi>English</hi> Plantations, where they might have subsisted till the arrival of a Convoy from <hi>Scotland</hi>; and so with those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions that were sufficient to carry them as far as <hi>New-York,</hi> and a great deal further if they had not been retarded by Tempests, might have maintain'd a competent number of their Men to keep possession of the Colony till Supplies had arriv'd: but the Proclamations disabled them from taking this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and by consequence are chargeable with the ruin of the Colony.</p>
            <p>In the next place it is undeniable that those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations must needs have incouraged the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and other Enemies in their Opposition against our Colony, and animated them to go on with their Preparations to drive us out. So that had they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted upon no other account but the noise of the great Preparations making against them by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Carthagena, Porto-bello,</hi> &amp;c. as Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Beeston</hi> seem'd to insinuate in his Letter; it makes the Proclamations directly chargeable with the Ruin of the Colony, since they had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to remove from thence when their own Prince had forbid all Commerce with them, and when their Enemies were making formidable Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against them.</p>
            <p>It is likewise plain that those Proclamations must necessarily prevent their having any Supplies from the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Curassaw,</hi> if they had any to spare: for since the Influence of ours and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Court
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66218:9"/>
prevented our Company's having any Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Holland,</hi> it is reasonable to believe it would have the same influence in reference to our Colony, in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Plantations.</p>
            <p>We have likewise all the reason in the world to conclude, that the Influence of those Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might hinder the Natives from giving our Colony those Supplies that it was in their power to have done; for there's no doubt but they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of 'em industriously sent them by some of our Adversaries, when Capt. <hi>Long</hi> was so malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to endeavour at our first arrival to possess them with an opinion that we were nothing but Pirats, and that the K. of <hi>Great Britain</hi> would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own us; and indeed by the event it would seem he had Instructions so to do. It is true that at first the Natives seeing our Men have a Competency of all sorts of Provisions, might not believe his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; but they must needs have been confirm'd in the truth of it afterwards, when they saw them dying for want, and deceiv'd as to their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of further Supplies; and upon that account might think they had sufficient ground to withdraw their Assistance from them, and not further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in favour of a People that they found were not able to do any thing for themselves, and by consequence uncapable to protect them, which was the thing they were to expect from their Alliance.</p>
            <p>Having thus made it evident that the Opposition our Company met with from Court at first, and the Proclamations issued against our Colony at last, are justly to be reputed among the principal Causes of the Miscarriage of that Design, we come in the next place to consider his Majesty's Answer to the Address of the Commons of <hi>England</hi> on that Head, and the Proclamations issued out against us in his Name in the <hi>West Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:66218:9"/>We are sorry that ever there should have been any occasion for such an ungrateful piece of work; but think it a Duty incumbent upon us, and what we owe to the Constitution of our Country, which we have reason to believe is industriously conceal'd from his Majesty, to write freely on this head, that the World may see what just cause we have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
            <p>His Majesty's Answer, <hi>That he had been ill serv'd in</hi> Scotland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is such, as our Ancestors (if we may believe our Historians) would have thought inconsistent with the Trust reposed in a King of <hi>Scots,</hi> a manifest Reflection upon the Justice and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of the Nation, and a discovery of their <hi>Arcana Imperii</hi> to those that were quarrelling with them. We are not to suppose that his Majesty would give an Answer to an Address of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance without Counsel: If he consulted with our <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>English</hi> Opposers, it was the same as if he had consulted our profess'd Enemies; if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted with <hi>Scots</hi>-men, and was advis'd to this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer by any of them, they are Traitors to their Country, and have betray'd its Soveraignty: for they ought to have advis'd him to answer, that as King of <hi>Scots</hi> he was not to give an account to the <hi>English</hi> for any thing transacted in that Kingdom; but if they found themselves any ways aggriev'd, or thought their Trade endanger'd by the <hi>Scots</hi> Act, he should be willing to have the matter debated and adjusted by Commissioners of both Nations, as became the Common Father of both. This could not justly have been look'd upon by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> as a refractory or stubborn Answer, but must have been imputed to his braveness of Temper, and fidelity to his Trust. But at once to give up the Soveraignty of <hi>Scotland,</hi> without demurring upon it, argues that his Majesty was advis'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66218:10"/>
to this Answer by Enemies to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>Our Parliaments have originally a greater Power than that of <hi>England</hi>; for what the States of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> offer'd to the touch of the Scepter, their Kings had no power to refuse; or if they did, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves of the States had the force of a Law not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding. Thus our Reformation was estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in 1560. by an Act of the States; and tho our Queen <hi>Mary</hi> then in <hi>France,</hi> and her Husband the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> afterwards <hi>Francis</hi> I. refus'd to give their consent, it remain'd a firm Law; which Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> when she return'd to <hi>Scotland,</hi> was so far from offering to dispense with, tho she was a great Asserter of her Prerogative, that she was oblig'd to intreat of the States so far to dispense with it themselves, as to suffer her to have Mass in her own Family. We might go further back to the Reign of <hi>Robert</hi> II. who was check'd by the States for making a Truce with the <hi>English</hi> without their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, it not being then in the power of our Kings either to make Peace or War without the States. But the truth of that Maxim laid down by our Historian, <hi>That the supreme Power of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Scotland <hi>is in the States,</hi> is so obvious to every one that reads our History, that it cannot be denied; and hence it is that our old Acts of Parliament are often call'd <hi>the Acts of the States,</hi> and say, <hi>The three States enact,</hi> &amp;c. for by our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Constitution the King is none of the States, but only <hi>Dux belli,</hi> and <hi>Minister publicus</hi>; which was well understood by our Viceroy the E. of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and the other Deputies from the States of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when they acquainted Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in their Memorial, That <hi>the</hi> Scots <hi>created their Kings on that condition, that they might, when they saw cause, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest them of that Power which they receiv'd from the People,</hi> which we have now reasserted in making
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66218:10"/>
               <hi>our Crown forfeitable by the Claim of Right at the last Revolution:</hi> and perhaps that's none of the least Causes why our Ruin is now endeavour'd by the Abettors of a growing Prerogative.</p>
            <p>It were easy for us to enlarge on this, and to shew from our Histories and Acts of Parliaments, that our Kings, according to our antient Constitution (which those Rapes committed on our Liberties in some of the last Reigns can never overturn) were inferior to their Parliaments, who inthron'd and dethron'd them as they saw cause, made them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for their Administration, allow'd them no power of proroguing them without their own consent, nor of hindering their meeting when the <hi>ardua Regni negotia</hi> requir'd it. They could not make Peace or War without them, nor so much as dispose of their Castles, but by their consent. Their Councils were chosen and sworn in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and punishable by the States: Nor had they any Revenue, but what their Parliaments allow'd them. These and many more were the native Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as may be seen in our Histories, the Acts of all the <hi>Iames</hi>'s, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of the States of <hi>Scotland</hi> in 1638. and their Representation of their Proceedings against the Mistakes in the King's Declaration in 1640. And therefore his Majesty had no reason to say he was ill serv'd by the passing of an Act offer'd by the States of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ignorance of those things hath often occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd our being misrepresented by the <hi>English</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, and other Writers, as Rebels, and what not, when we really acted according to our own fundamental Laws. And not only they, but even our own Princes since the Union of the Crowns, have either been kept ignorant of our Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or so incens'd against it by the Abettors of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66218:11"/>
Tyranny, that they have all of 'em, his present Majesty excepted, endeavour'd our Overthrow, as well knowing it to be impossible to bring Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government to perfection, whilst a People who had always breath'd in a free Air, and call'd their Princes to an account when they invaded their Properties, were in any condition to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or assist others against such Princes as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd an absolute Sway. But the Pill being too bitter to be swallowed by it self, there was a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of taking Priestcraft into the Composition. and to gild it over with the specious pretext of bringing the <hi>Scots</hi> to an Uniformity in Religion. The Court knew that this would arm the Zealots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, and that it could never be effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ruin of our Kingdom, whose Religion was so interwoven with our Civil Constitution, that there was no overturning of the one, without sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the other. This will appear plain to those that know, that besides the Sanction of Acts of Parliament, the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is defended by a full Representative of the Clergy and Laity of the Kingdom call'd a General Assembly (which preserves us from being Priest-ridden, as our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments do from being Prince-ridden) where the King by Law had no negative Voice, no more than he formerly had in our Parliaments. This in effect is the Representative of the Nation as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, as the Parliaments are our Representatives as Men; and as to the Laity, many of them are the same individual persons that sit in Parliament. So that those Assemblies being a second Barrier a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Liberties, it was thought fit to run down the Constitution of our Church, as not suted with Monarchy. The Case being thus, we dare refer it to the thoughts of our neighbouring Nation, who have gallantly from time to time stood up for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66218:11"/>
their own Liberties, whether it were not more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous for them to unite with us than to suffer us to be oppress'd and enslav'd.</p>
            <p>There's nothing can be objected to this, but that all these glorious Privileges were swallow'd up by those Acts of Parliament that exalted the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative to such a height in the Reign of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. To which we answer, That the Privileges of a Nation cannot be giv'n away without their own consent; and we are morally certain, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituents even of those pack'd Parliaments did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give any commission to those that represented them, to give away those Liberties. Slavery is repugnant to human Nature; so that it cannot be supposed the Nation exalted the Prerogative on purpose to put themselves in a worse condition than before, or that when they find it applied to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther use than that which they gave it for, they may not reduce it to its antient Boundary. The neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Affairs did sometimes oblige the <hi>Romans</hi> to entrust their Dictators with an extraordinary and absolute Power; but when the occasion ceas'd, they recalled it, and kept to their antient and rational Maxim, that <hi>Salus Populi</hi> is <hi>suprema Lex.</hi> In the like manner the Enemies of our old Constitution may know, if they please, that we have retrieved the main point of making our Crown forfeitable by the Claim of Right; and therefore if they push us too far, it's a thousand to one but we may renew our demands to the rest, or oblige them to cast them into the bargain.</p>
            <p>But to return from this Digression. Tho we had no such peculiar Privileges belonging to us; why might not we expect that his Majesty should be as kind to us as to our Brethren in <hi>England?</hi> He hath once and again declared to them in Parliament, <hi>That he never had, nor never will have an Interest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66218:12"/>
from that of his People.</hi> Then why should not the Interest of the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> be the same with the Interest of the King of <hi>Stots?</hi> And if the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> met in Parliament agreed upon it as their Interest to have that Act past for incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging their Trade, how was it possible that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> could be <hi>ill serv'd</hi> by the passing that Act in <hi>Scotland?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Enemies, and <hi>H — s</hi>'s Suborners have put a sort of an Answer to this in his mouth, <hi>viz.</hi> That the said Act was obtain'd <hi>viis &amp; modis</hi>; but the Falshood and Malice of that Insinuation will appear to the World by the previous Act of 1693. for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of foreign Trade, by which it was sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
<q>That Merchants more or fewer may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and enter into such Societies and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for carrying on Trade, as to any Subject of Goods or Merchandise, to whatsomever King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Countries, or parts of the World, not being in War with his Majesty, where Trade is in use to be or may be follow'd; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, besides the Kingdoms and Countries of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> to the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies,</hi> the <hi>Straits,</hi> and to trade in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> or upon the Coast of <hi>Africa,</hi> or elsewhere, as above. Which So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties and Companies being contracted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into upon the terms, and in the usual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as such Companies are set up—His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty with Consent aforesaid did allow and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, giving and granting to them and each of them, all Powers, Rights and Privileges, as to their Persons, Rules, and Orders, that by the Laws are given to Companies allowed to be erected for Manufactories: And his Majesty for their greater Incouragement, did promise to give to those Companies, and each of them, his Letters Patent under the Great Seal, confirming
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66218:12"/>
to them the whole foresaid Powers and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, with what other incouragement his Majesty should judg needful.</q>
These are the very terms of the Act of 1693. and in pursuance of this Act our Nation being willing to form a Company for trading to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> this Act which hath met with so much opposition in the World, was past <hi>Iune</hi> 26. 1695, which was two years after. Then with what Effrontery can <hi>H—s</hi> and his Suborners suggest, that it was obtain'd <hi>viis &amp; modis,</hi> by surprize or in a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitious manner? But something they must say to justify their unreasonable treatment of us, and to blind the Eyes of the World.</p>
            <p>Thus we see then that the Parliament of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> went on deliberately to advance their Trade, and to make this Act: by which it's evident that they who advis'd his Majesty to say that he was <hi>ill serv'd in</hi> Scotland, impos'd upon him, have laid a Foundation of division betwixt him and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which are the two constituent parts of our Government; and if they be dash'd against one another, the whole frame of it must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be dissolv'd. Hence also it is evident that those Counsellors, if <hi>Scots-men,</hi> ought by our old Constitution to be call'd to an account by the Parliament according to the 12<hi>th</hi> Act of Parl. 2 <hi>Iames</hi> 4. And if they be Englishmen or Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, we have a right to demand Justice against them, as having meddled in our Affairs contrary to the Laws of Nations.</p>
            <p>The Soveraignty of our Nation, and the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of the K. of <hi>Scots</hi> upon the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> being tacitely giv'n up by this Answer; and the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> being possess'd by our Enemies with a false Notion of our Design, they put a stop to our taking Subscriptions from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66218:13"/>
any Residenters in <hi>England</hi>; tho our offering to take in the <hi>English</hi> as Sharers, was a plain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the uprightness of our Intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that Nation. This made it apparent, that we had no design in the least to supplant them in their Trade, but on the contrary to make them Partakers in ours, in order to lay a foundation for a closer Union, and greater Amity betwixt the two Nations; which if it had taken effect, our Trade had not been nipp'd in the bud, as now it is by the frowns of the Court, but might by this time have been improv'd to the advancement of the glory and strength of the Island: Whereas by the opposition made to that noble Design, the Nations are more alienated from one another than before, lessen'd in their Strength and Trade, and <hi>Scotland</hi> for ever lost as to their Friendship, usefulness, and joining with <hi>England</hi> on any occasion whatever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less proper Measures be taken to make up the Breach, and retrieve our lost Honour and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>All that can be said to excuse so false a step in such a wise Nation as <hi>England,</hi> is, that they were impos'd upon by those that are Enemies to the true Liberties of both Nations, and by some of their Traders and ignorant Pretenders, to give advice in matters of Trade, who out of a sordid Principle of Self-interest, preferr'd their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gain to the general advantage of their Country. This would have quickly been seen, had his Majesty and the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> instead of that violent opposition which they made to the <hi>Scots</hi> Act, desir'd a Conference betwixt a Committee of the Parliaments of both Nations; then it would soon have appear'd what our true Design was, and that it was neither our Interest nor Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion immediately to follow an <hi>East-India</hi> Trade,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66218:13"/>
the apprehensions of which did so much alarm the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> That it was not our Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is evident from our rejecting the Proposals of our Countryman Mr. <hi>Douglas,</hi> the <hi>East-India</hi> Merchant, with which <hi>H—s</hi> upbraids us, by which at the same time he discovers his own folly and dishonesty; his Folly in arguing against the Interest of <hi>England,</hi> which he pretends to espouse; and his Dishonesty in proposing our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a Trade, which his new Masters (who have paid him so well for his false Evidence) look upon to be destructive to theirs.</p>
            <p>That it was not our Interest immediately to think of an <hi>East-India</hi> Trade is evident from this, that it would have exported our Mony with which it's known we do not abound, and ruin'd the Linen Manufacture of our Country, upon which so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Poor depend. This we think the City of <hi>London</hi> may be sensible of in a good measure, by the multitudes of their own Silk-Weavers, that are starv'd for want of Imployment; and also by the unsuccessfulness of their own Linen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture in <hi>England,</hi> by reason of the great quantity of Silks, Mullins, Calicoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> brought from the <hi>East-Indies:</hi> from whence some wise Men have been and are still of opinion, that an <hi>East-India</hi> Trade of that sort tends to the general Impoverishment of <hi>Europe,</hi> tho it may enrich particular Persons. These Considerations, together with some Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies that Mr. <hi>Douglas</hi> might have been put upon making us that Proposal, on purpose to divert us from our other Design of an <hi>American</hi> Trade, were the true Reasons of our not hearkening to Mr. <hi>Douglas</hi>'s Advice. This our Neighbours might have known, had they proceeded with us in such a friendly manner as we had reason to expect, when we were so kind as to offer them a share
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66218:14"/>
in the Benefits of our Act. And the Government at the same time might soon have been satisfied, that the sinking of their Customs by our one and twenty years Freedom from that Duty, was a meer bugbear Pretence. It is evident that we could not have spent much <hi>East-India</hi> Goods in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore must have exported them. If we had brought them to <hi>England,</hi> they were liable to Customs there. If we had offer'd to run them over the Border, they could as well have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented that, as the stealing over their own Corn and Wool: and if we had exported them to any other places of <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> by their Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs could have done it in effect as cheap as we. By all which it appears, that there was no solid Foundation for any of those pretended Reasons, why the Government in particular, or the <hi>English</hi> in general, should have oppos'd us: and we wish that upon due inquiry it may not be found to be the effect of Dutch Councils; for that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being jealous of their Trade, and Rivals to <hi>England</hi> on that account, cannot be suppos'd to have sat still and done nothing, when they saw we had obtain'd such an Act, and were resolv'd to take in the <hi>English</hi> to partake in our Trade, which if suffer'd to go on, might endanger theirs, and enable the <hi>English</hi> to outrival them indeed, besides the present loss they foresaw of our Custom, the <hi>Scots</hi> having most of their <hi>East-India</hi> Goods from <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This we have the more reason to suspect, first because tho the <hi>English</hi> have formerly suffered in their Trade by the Incroachments and Intrigues of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but never by the <hi>Scots</hi>; yet they have made no Application to his Majesty, for preventing the like in time to come. If it be said that he is but Stadtholder there, whereas he is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66218:14"/>
K. of <hi>Scots:</hi> We can easily reply, that it appears by what has been said already of our true Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> were as much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to the States of that Nation, as the Dutch Stadtholder is to the States of <hi>Holland.</hi> The 2<hi>d</hi> Reason we have to suspect the Influence of Dutch Councils in this Affair, is this, that 'tis their Interest to keep us and the <hi>English</hi> from uniting, and if possible of forcing us by that means into an Alliance with themselves, to prevent their own ruin, if <hi>England</hi> should after this come to fall out with them upon the account of Trade or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and likewise to have their Privilege of fishing in our Seas continued, which they know to be of such vast Advantage to them, that they are shrewdly suspected of having by Bribes, or other indirect Methods, prevail'd with some great Men, to supplant us as to the Benefits we had just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to expect from the Act of 1661. incouraging our Fishery, the Privileges granted by which, are very considerable, and to continue for ever: nay to put it out of all doubt that they are join'd in this matter against us, <hi>H—s</hi> owns it as beforemention'd.</p>
            <p>Being upon this subject, we cannot but take notice of the difference betwixt the <hi>Spanish</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials about <hi>Darien,</hi> and of those late Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als presented by them to our Court against their meddling with the Succession of that Monarchy, or the cantoning it out into several Parcels in case the King of <hi>Spain</hi> die without issue. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, tho insolent and huffing enough, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd by our Court, therefore calmly digested; and the desire of them effectually answer'd, to the ruin almost of the Scotish Nation: but the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was no sooner presented, than the <hi>Spanish</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66218:15"/>
are disgrac'd in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and forbid both Courts.</p>
            <p>It may therefore deserve the Inquiry of our Neighbours, what this Regulation about the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the dismembring of their Monarchy is, that occasion such outragious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials: for there must needs be something in it that touches the <hi>Spaniards</hi> more sensibly than the business of <hi>Darien,</hi> and which they did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of till they were put upon it; and in like manner touches our Court more sensibly to the quick than any Memorials about that Affair, tho they had not been of their own procurement, were capable of doing. Perhaps upon a narrow Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny into this Affair it will be found, that this keen and uninterrupted Opposition made to the <hi>Scots</hi> Settlement at <hi>Darien,</hi> does not proceed from any foresight of damage that it could do to the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> tho that be the specious Pretext, but from a Cause which touches some People more nearly, crosses their Project of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy, and of having that important Post to their own share; they know that they have a natural as well as politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Interest in some great Courtiers, and make little doubt of obtaining the preheminence before either of those Nations that compose the Empire of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> It concerns our Neighbours so much the more to inquire into this, because it is visible from the Resentments of it by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Court, that this matter is more like to affect the advantageous Trade that <hi>England</hi> drives with <hi>Spain,</hi> than our Settlement in <hi>America</hi> was ever like to do; which tho it be made a Sacrifice to his Catholick Majesty, and perhaps on purpose to make him digest the other Project with more
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66218:15"/>
ease, is like to be of as little advantage to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as was the Sacrifice of the great Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Raleigh formerly,</hi> tho it may be infinitely more to their damage. If our Neighbours have a mind to be fully inform'd of this matter, they know who were imploy'd in those Negotiations, and how to speak with them.</p>
            <p>We come next to consider the Opposition made to our Subscriptions at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> by Sir <hi>Paul Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caut</hi> the English Resident there, in conjunction with his Majesty's Envoy to the Court of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenburg,</hi> who deliver'd in a joint Memorial to the Senate of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> threatning them with the heighth of his Majesty's Displeasure, if they join'd with the <hi>Scots</hi> in any Treaty of Commerce what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. This we shall not need to make any Reflexions upon, the Petitions from the Company to his Majesty and his Privy Council in <hi>Scotland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sufficient for that end.</p>

                  <p>WHEREAS by the 32<hi>d</hi> Act of the 4<hi>th</hi> Session, and by the 8<hi>th</hi> Act of the 5<hi>th</hi> Session of Your Majesty's current Parliament, as well as by Your Majesty's Patent under the Great Seal of this Kingdom, this Company is established with such ample Privileges, as were thought most proper and encouraging both to Natives and Foreigners to join in the carrying on, supporting, and advancement of our Trade: The most considerable of the Nobility, Gentry, Merchants, and whole Body of the Royal Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, have upon the Inducement and publick Faith of Your Majesty, and Act of Parliament, and Letters Patent, contributed as Adventurers in raising a far more considerable joint Stock, than any was ever before raised in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for any publick Undertaking, or Project of Trade whatsoever; which makes it now of so much the more universal a Concern to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And for the better enabling us to accomplish the ends of Your Majesty's said Act of Parliament, and Letters Patent, we have pursuant thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to appointed certain Deputies of our own num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to transact and negotiate our necessary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66218:16"/>
beyond Sea, and at the same time to treat with such Foreigners of any Nation in amity with Your Majesty, as might be inclinable to join with us for the purpose aforesaid. In the prosecution of which Commission to our said Deputies, vested with full Power and Authority according to Law, We are not a little surprized to find, to the great hindrance and obstruction of our Affairs, That your Majesty's Envoy to the Courts of <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> and Resident at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> have under pretence of special Warrant from Your Majesty, given in a joint subscribed Memorial to the Senate of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> expresly invading the Privileges granted to our Company by Your Majesty's said Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent, as by the herewith transmitted Copy may appear.</p>
                  <p>By the which Memorial we sustain great and manifold Prejudices, since both the Senate and Inhabitants of the said City of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> are thereby, contrary to the Law of Nations, expresly threatned with Your Majesty's Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, if they or either of them should counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or join with us in any Treaty of Trade or Commerce whatsoever, which deprives us of the assistance which we had reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from several Inhabitants of that City.</p>
                  <p>For redress whereof we do in all Duty and Humility apply to Your Majesty, not only for the Protection and Maintenance of our Privileges and freedom of Trade, but also for reparation of damage conform to Your Majesty's said Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent. And we further beg leave humbly to represent to Your Majesty, that tho by the said Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent, we conceive our selves legally and sufficiently authorized to treat even with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66218:17"/>
any Soveraign Potentate or State in Amity with Your Majesty for the support and advancement of our Trade; yet we by our said Deputies have only treated with particular and private Merchants of the said City of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever making any the least Proposal to the Senate thereof: and this we humbly conceive to be the natural Right and Privilege of all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants whatsoever, even tho we had wanted the Sanction of so solemn Laws; and without some speedy redress be had therein, not only this Company, but all the individual Merchants of this Kingdom, must from henceforward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all our Rights and Freedoms of Trade are and may be further by our Neighbours vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently wrested out of our hands.</p>
                  <p>We therefore, to prevent the further evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of the said Memorial to our Company in particular, do make our most humble and earnest Request to Your Majesty, That you would be graciously pleased to grant us such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations as in your Royal Wisdom you shall think fit, to render the Senate and Inhabitants of the said City of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and all others that are or may be concerned, secure from the Threatnings and other Suggestions contain'd in the said Memorial, as well as to render us secure under Your Majesty's Protection, in the full Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of our Trade, and free Injoyment of our lawful Rights, Privileges, and Immunities contained in Your Majesty's Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent above-mentioned.</p>

                  <p>'TIS not unknown to your Lordships, how that in several successive Sessions of this current Parliament, his Majesty's Instructions to his respective High Commissioners, and their several Speeches pursuant thereto, have bin full of repeated Assurances of his Majesty's good Inclinations for incouraging the Trade and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories of this Nation: And whereas accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly by the 22<hi>d</hi> Act of the fourth Session, and the 8<hi>th</hi> Act of the fifth Session of the said Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, together with his Majesty's Patent under the Great Seal of this Kingdom, our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is established with such ample Privileges and Immunities as were thought most proper for encouraging both Natives and Foreigners to join in the carrying on, supporting, and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Trade; we in pursuance, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the publick Faith thereof, not only contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted at home a far more considerable joint Stock than ever was yet rais'd in this Nation for any publick Undertaking or Project of Trade
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66218:18"/>
whatsoever, but have also had all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing hopes and prospect of foreign Aid that our hearts could wish, till (to our great surprize) the <hi>English</hi> Ministers at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> have, under pretence of special Warrant from his Majesty, put a stop thereto, by giving in a Memorial to the Senat of that City, threatning both Senat and Inhabitants with the King's utmost Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, if they should countenance or join with us in any Treaty of Trade or Commerce, as by the annexed Copy thereof may appear.</p>
                  <p>Upon due consideration whereof, we have in all duty and humility addressed his Majesty in <hi>Iune</hi> last for redress thereof; in answer to which Address his Majesty was then graciously pleased to signify by his Royal Letter, That upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>England</hi> he would take into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Contents of our said Address, and that in the mean time he would give Orders to the said Ministers at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> not to make use of his Royal Name or Authority for obstructing the Trade of our Company with the Inhabitants of that City. In the full assurance of which we rested secure, and took our measures according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till to our further surprize and unspeakable prejudice, we find by repeated Advices from <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> that the said Resident continues still contumacious; and is so far from giving due O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his Majesty's said Order, that upon application made to him by our Agent in that City, with all the respect due to his Character, he declared, that as yet he had got no such Order on our behalf; which by a further Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress we are now to lay before his Majesty.</p>
                  <p>But whereas we humbly conceive your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships to be more immediatly, under his Majesty, the Guardians of the Laws and Liberties of this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66218:19"/>
Kingdom, We think it our duty to represent to your Lordships the Consequences of the said Memorial, both with relation to our Company in particular, and the Privileges, Interest, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Dignity, and Reputation of the Nation in general.</p>
                  <p>Your Lordships very well know of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Success of this Company is to the whole Kingdom, and that scarce any particular So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety or Corporation within the same can justly boast of so solemn and unanimous a Suffrage or Sanction, as the Acts of Parliament by which this Company is established. So that if effectual measures be not taken for putting an early stop to such an open and violent Infringement of, and Incroachment upon the Privileges of so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn a Constitution, 'tis hard to guess how far it may in after Ages be made use of-as a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for invading and overturning even the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fundamental Rights, natural Liberties, and indisputable Independency of this Kingdom, which by the now open and frequent Practices of our unkind Neighbours, seem to be too shrewdly pointed at. And should this Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (wherein the most considerable of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Gentry, Merchants, and whole Body of the Royal Burroughs are concerned) be so unhappy (which God forbid) as to have its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs rendered unsuccessful through the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable evil Treatments of our said Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; most certain it is that no consideration whatever can hereafter induce this Nation to join in any such other publick Stock, tho never so advantageous an undertaking, as not doubting but to meet with the like or greater Discouragements from those who give such fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and manifest Indications of their Designs to

from <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> that Your Majesty's said Resident continues still contumacious; and is so far from giving due Obedience to Your Majesty's said Order, that upon application made to him for that effect, with all respect due to his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, he pretended, that he had never as yet got any such Order on our behalf: Which we thought fit, in all duty and humility, to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Your Majesty, renewing withal our most humble and earnest Request, that Your Majesty would be now graciously pleas'd to take the Contents of this and our said former Address in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to consideration, and, in Your Royal Wisdom, order some speedy and effectual Redress of our Grievances therein mentioned, and a just Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the manifest Damages which our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany has already sustain'd by reason of the said Memorial: And grant us a Declaration under Your Royal Hand, to render the Senat and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the City of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and all others with whom we may have occasion to enter into Commerce, secure from Threatnings and other false Suggestions contained in the said Memorial, as well as to render us secure under Your Majesty's Protection, in the free En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of our lawful Rights and Privileges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Your Majesty's Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent above mentioned.</p>

               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:66218:21"/>Notwithstanding all this humble Application, there was no stop put to that Opposition: So that the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> dar'd not venture to subscribe; and the Company, after great loss of time, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and leaving two Ships unfinish'd, to the great Dishonour, as well as Disadvantage of the Nation, were oblig'd to recal their Agents, after having spent 30000 <hi>l.</hi> and not receiv'd one Farthing there, tho the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> were so willing to join, that they were sorry there was not room left for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing more than 200000 <hi>l.</hi>

                  <p>WE Your Majesty's most Loyal and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects, the Noblemen, Barons, and Burgesses convened in Parliament, do humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to Your Majesty, That having consider'd a Representation made to us by the Council Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Company trading to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> making mention of several Obstructions they have met with in the prosecution of their Trade; particularly by a Memorial presented to the Senat of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> by Your Majesty's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents in that City, tending to lessen the Credit of the Rights and Privileges granted to the said Company by an Act of this present Parliament:</p>

            <p>By all this it is evident, that the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland</hi> was unanimous in this matter, and proceeded deliberately in it, as that which highly concern'd their Interest: yet we see that all their Endeavours were to no purpose; for our Enemies were so resolute in opposing our Trade, that rather than it should succeed they will not only trample under foot the Laws of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the Laws of Nations, and exactly follow the Pattern set them by the <hi>French,</hi> in huffing and tyrannizing over their Neighbours, when at the same time they pretend to make War upon <hi>Lewis</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:66218:22"/>
XIV. for practices of the same nature; and whilst they cry out upon the Decisions of the Chambers of <hi>Brisac</hi> and <hi>Mets,</hi> and of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris</hi> as tyrannical and unjust for invading the Rights of Neighbouring Princes and Nations, they set up a Cabal at <hi>Whitehall</hi> to do the like by <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh.</hi> Then let the World judg, whether the King of <hi>England</hi> had not less reason to say that he was ill serv'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> than the King of <hi>Scots</hi> had to say that he was ill serv'd in <hi>England,</hi> since one single Address from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> prevail'd with their King to forbid all his Subjects to join with the <hi>Scots</hi>; whereas the repeated Supplications of the Company of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Address of their Parliament, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Law, and his own Letters Patent could not prevail with the King of <hi>Scots</hi> to do Justice to his own Subjects. We wish these Gentlemen would consider this, who were so very angry at the Author of the Defence of the <hi>Scots</hi> Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for saying that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> was detain'd prisoner in <hi>England.</hi> It is very certain, that never any King of <hi>Scotland</hi> before the Union of the Crowns, dar'd thus to trample upon their Laws, or to oppose the General Interest of the Nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or if they attempted to do it, they were quickly made sensible of their being Inferior to the Law, and the States of the Nation assembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who till the Accession of our Princes to the <hi>English</hi> Throne remain'd in an undisputed possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of calling their Kings to an account for Male-administration, and of disposing of their Lives and Liberties as they saw cause. We need not go so far back for Evidence to prove this, as <hi>Eugenius</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi> who was brought to his Tryal on suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of having murder'd his own Wife, and acquitted upon discovery of the real Murderers; or of <hi>Iames</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:66218:22"/>
III. whose Minions, by whose Counsel he govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were taken out of his own Bed-Chamber by the Nobles, and hanged over <hi>Lauder-bridg</hi>; and he himself persisting in those Courses, was killed in flight, after being defeated in Battle by the States, and in the next Parliament was voted to be lawfully slain.</p>
            <p>We have a later Instance, and the Power of our Nation on that Head was largely asserted and accounted for by the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> then Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in that noble Memorial he delivered in to Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Council in defence of our proceedings against Q. <hi>Mary</hi> whom we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron'd, and in her stead set up her Son: so that it is not the principle or practice of any one Party of our Nation (tho it has been of late fix'd upon the Presbyterians as peculiar to them) but was an Hereditary Right conveyed to us all by our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, practised by Papists before the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and justified by those of the Episcopal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion since, particularly by the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> beforemention'd, who was the first that introduc'd Bishops into our Church after the Reformation.</p>
            <p>Those things are not insisted upon with any Design of applying them to his present Majesty, or of incensing the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> to do so, but only to inform those that put his Majesty upon such Courses, that they are his greatest Enemies, and do what in them lies to destroy him. It is the common Right of Mankind to be protected by those they set over them, and to complain of Governors when they find themselves aggriev'd, and their Privileges torn from them by Violence. This Generation has prov'd it beyond possibility of Reply, that the greatest Pretenders to submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Princes, and the most zealous Patrons of Passive Obedience, will resist and dethrone their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66218:23"/>
Kings too, when they find themselves oppressed by them. They that maintain the contrary, are nothing but mean-spirited Flatterers, or such as temporize with Courts, because of their own private Advantage; and be their Quality what it will, are far from being so noble and brave as that poor Woman who told <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> that he ceas'd to be King when he refus'd to hear her Petition. Upon the whole it will appear, that the Author of the Defence of the <hi>Seots</hi> Settlement, made the best Apology for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty that could be made, when he said that he was a Prisoner in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore forc'd to act thus against the Interest and Dignity of his Crown as King of <hi>Scots.</hi> It is demonstrated thus: If his Majesty were in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son upon the Throne of <hi>England,</hi> it is certain his Majesty would have encouraged the Trade of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and resented such practices in the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as contrary to the Laws of Nations, and the Soveraignty of his Crown: If he did not, he would be look'd upon to be mean-spirited and not fit to wear it; and if he took part with the King of <hi>England</hi> against the Dignity of his Crown, and the Interest of his Kingdom, he would not only be looked upon as an Enemy to his Country, but as <hi>felo de se.</hi> From all which it is plain, that as it is the best Apology that can be made for the King of <hi>Scots</hi> when he acts thus, contrary to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Interest of himself and his Country, to say, he is a Prisoner in <hi>England</hi>; so it is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Justification of the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> to refuse Obedience to what he commands by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the <hi>English,</hi> or other Councils, in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their Interest, because they are the Commands of a Captive, and not of the King of <hi>Scots.</hi> If our Enemies say he is no Captive, but at Liberty
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66218:23"/>
to go to <hi>Scotland</hi> if he pleases, it is so far from making his Case better, that it makes it ten times worse; for if his Affections be captivated, we are without remedy, except we either sue for a Divorce, as in case of wilful Desertion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying conjugal Duty, or withdraw from under his roof, and remove to another Family, as God and Man will allow one Sister to do that is oppressed, and denied the Privileges of paternal Love and Protection, whilst another is caressed and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, and has her Fortune raised by diminishing that of the neglected Sister.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iamaica</hi> Proclamation against our Colony at <hi>Darien</hi> comes next to be considered, and is as follows.</p>

                        <p>WHereas I have received Orders from his Majesty by the Right Honourable <hi>Iames Vernon,</hi> one of the Principal Secretaries of State, importing that his Majesty was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Intentions and Designs of the <hi>Scots</hi> in peopling <hi>Darien,</hi> which is contrary to the Peace between his Majesty and his Allies, commanding me not to afford them any Assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: In compliance therewith, in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Name, and by his Order, I do strictly charge and require all and every his Majesty's Subjects, that upon no pretence whatsoever they hold any Correspondence with the <hi>Scots</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66218:24"/>
or give them any Assistance with Arms, Ammunition, Provision, or any thing whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, either by themselves or any other for them; nor assist them with any of their Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or of the <hi>English</hi> Nation's, upon pain of his Majesty's Displeasure, and suffering the severest punishment. Given under my Hand and Seal of Arms, the 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1699. and in the 11<hi>th</hi> year of the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> King of <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Iamaica,</hi> Defender of the Faith.</p>

            <p>It contains a heavy Charge against the <hi>Scots</hi> Company as having settled in <hi>Darien</hi> without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his Majesty, and having thereby broke the Peace betwixt his Majesty and his Allies. As to their not informing his Majesty with their Design, there was neither any need of it, nor had they reason to do it: that there was no need of it, is plain enough from the Act of Parliament impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to settle any where in <hi>Asia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> upon places not inhabited, or any other place, with consent of the Natives, and not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd by any <hi>European</hi> Potentate, Prince or State: So that they were under no Obligation to acquaint him where they design'd to settle, provided they kept to the Terms of the Act. And that they had no cause so to do, is evident from that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable opposition that a Faction at Court had prevailed with him to make to them all along, which gave them just cause to expect the like treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in time to come.</p>
            <p>Then as to the Breach of the Peace betwixt his Majesty and his Allies by the Settlement, they had no reason to think themselves guilty of any such thing, and so much the less, that <hi>Dampier, Wafer,</hi> and all others that wrote of the Country gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66218:24"/>
of the Natives being in possession of their Liberty, and almost in continual Wars with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Besides, it was a rul'd Case in <hi>England,</hi> since Capt. <hi>Sharp</hi> was by Law acquitted in K. <hi>Charles</hi> Il's time, not only for having marched through <hi>Darien</hi> in a Hostile manner, but for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacquing Places that were really in possession of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as St. <hi>Maria</hi> and <hi>Panama,</hi> because he acted by virtue of a Commission from those <hi>Darien</hi> Princes. This, together with their not finding a <hi>Spaniard</hi> or <hi>Spanish</hi> Garison on all that part of the Isthmus, was enough to justify the fairness of the <hi>Scots</hi> Settlement there, and to have put a stop to this hasty Sentence till both sides had been heard.</p>
            <p>But instead of that, the Advisers to this Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation take upon them, in a very Magisterial manner, to declare the <hi>Scots</hi> guilty of a Breach of the Peace betwixt his Majesty and his Allies: which is so much the more remarkable, that this Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is publish'd in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> before ever it was known what the <hi>Scots</hi> could say in their own defence; and sent away before the presenting of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Memorial, which was on the third of <hi>May</hi> 1699. and the Proclamation bears date <hi>April</hi> 9<hi>th</hi> 1699.</p>
            <p>The unfairness of this Proclamation is evident from this, that at the very same time it is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> the Lord President of the Sessions, and his Majesty's Advocate for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> were sent for from hence to see what they could say to justify their Pretensions to <hi>Darien</hi>; which they did by such Arguments as have not yet been answer'd.</p>
            <p>We leave it then to the impartial Thoughts of the good People of <hi>England,</hi> whether we have not occasion to say that our King is in the Hand of our Enemies, since we are thus condemn'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66218:25"/>
a hearing, and our Nation put to the trouble and expence to send Lawyers out of the Kingdom to defend themselves before those that had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready condemned them. And since this is a visible effect of the Union of the Crowns, by which we are every day more and more oppressed; let them speak their Consciences, if we have not all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the World to dissolve that Union, except the Nations be more closely united, and upon a better footing.</p>
            <p>That we were so treated in former Reigns, we had no great cause to wonder, when the Court was engaged in a Conspiracy against our Religion and Liberties. And our Nation being inferior to none in their Zeal for both, it was but natural to think that we should be the first Sacrifice: But to be treated thus by a Prince who hath ventur'd his Life to save us from Popery and Slavery; a Prince who for Courage in War, and Conduct in Peace, is not to be match'd in Story; a Prince who is under God the Great Champion of our Religion, and the bold Asserter of <hi>Europe</hi>'s Liberty; a Prince whose Family we revere, and whose Person we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore; a Prince for whom we have so chearfully ventur'd our Lives, and lost so much of the best Blood in our Veins; to be so treated by such a Prince hath some thing cutting beyond expression, and proves that our Disasters are no way to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, but either by a total Separation, or a closer Union of the two Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>We cannot be so unjust to his Majesty's Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as to think a Prince of his Magnanimity could be guilty of so mean a thing as willingly to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Crown of his Antient Kingdom which he received free, to that of another. We cannot once suffer it to enter into our thoughts, that he who dares to out-brave Death in the Field a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66218:25"/>
times a day, should act so unworthy a part as first to condemn, and then to try us. These and all other things of that sort we must needs charge to the account of our Enemies about him, who misrepresent us, and therefore surprise his Majesty into any thing he does against us.</p>
            <p>As to that positive Sentence of our having acted contrary to the Peace betwixt his Majesty and his Allies, we have all the Reason in the World to complain of it. Is our Kingdom then become so mean and contemptible, that what is transacted according to the Acts of our Parliaments, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of our Kings, is liable to be annull'd, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared illegal, by any Person that has the hap to be made an <hi>English</hi> Secretary of State, Governor of one of their <hi>American</hi> Plantations, or a Member of their Council of Trade? If it be so, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Dignity, as King of <hi>Scots,</hi> is well defended in the mean time, when it is liable thus to be tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon by his own Servants as King of <hi>England.</hi> This does indeed verify what has been said, that our Kings since the Union leave their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Kingdom to the disposal of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: but whether this be agreeable to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation Oaths of our Kings, let them determine that are concern'd to enquire; and perhaps it may be worth the consideration of our Neighbours, whether since we have been govern'd by Servants, they have not for the most part been subject to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that the one does naturally pave the way for the other. So that they are no great gainers by the Bargain.</p>
            <p>If it be answer'd, that the Proclamations are issued by his Majesty's Authority, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Sentence proceeds from his Bar:</p>
            <p>We answer, 1. That there are shrewd Suspitions that a certain Gentleman or two who have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66218:26"/>
all along to shew their Zeal against the <hi>Scots</hi> in this Affair, have push'd this matter beyond their Instructions; for there's no man that knows his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Justice and Wisdom, can admit a thought that he would condemn us before we were heard.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We don't at all question his Majesty's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as King of <hi>England,</hi> to forbid his <hi>English</hi> Subjects to give any manner of Assistance to the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Darien</hi> (tho we might say it was unkind) but we absolutely deny that he has any Authority as King of <hi>England</hi> to condemn the Proceedings of the Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> for any thing they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act without the Dominions of <hi>England.</hi> If it be otherwise, his Majesty, as King of <hi>Scots,</hi> is bound to appear at the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench-bar</hi> in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> for what he hath done as King of <hi>Scots,</hi> upon the Lord Chief Justices Summons; and of what Consequence this may be to himself or his Successors, may be easily judg'd. Had <hi>Oliver,</hi> and the other Regicides, bethought themselves of this, it had been more for the Honour of <hi>England,</hi> and would have taken off a great deal of the odium that is charg'd upon them for cutting off King <hi>Charles,</hi> had they search'd for something Criminal in his Conduct toward the <hi>English</hi> Nation as King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and condemned him for that. Tho they did not think upon this, perhaps others may; and then the <hi>English</hi> will be able to justify themselves as not having cut off their own King, but their Enemy the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> as there's no doubt they would have done by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. had he not made his escape after the battle of <hi>Worcester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may perhaps deserve the thoughts of his present Majesty and others concern'd in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and so much the more that the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> upon that of <hi>England</hi> hath been lately asserted by some <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>

            <p>But to satisfy that Gentleman and others, who please themselves so much in vilifying the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation, they may turn to the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> I. II. and III. and they will quickly find that Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Wallace,</hi> K. <hi>Robert Bruce, Iames</hi> Lord <hi>Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, Thomas Randolph</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> and others that we could name, did so gallantly defend the Soveraignty of <hi>Scotland</hi> against those bold Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to a Superiority over us, that their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors have had no great stomach to pursue their Claim to it since: So that if ever they had any, it is forfeited by Prescription.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oliver</hi>'s imaginary Conquest so much insisted on by the dull Answerer of the <hi>Scots</hi> Defence, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, will be of no use to the Faction in this matter, since that was no National Quarrel, nor did the <hi>English</hi> pretend to any such thing as a Conquest of us, but immediatly withdrew their Forces upon the Restoration. So that <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Conquest, as he calls it, was only the Victory of one Party over another in a Civil War, it being well known that he had Friends in <hi>Scotland</hi> as well as <hi>England,</hi> which (if that Wise Author will have <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Victories to be Conquests) he had conquer'd too before ever he came near <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We don't insist upon this with any design to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the Valour of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, which is known all over the World, but to stop the mouths of those pitiful Scriblers, and to give a <hi>Caveat</hi> to those Gentlemen about Court, who talk so big of conquering <hi>Scotland</hi> upon this present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
            <p>But we wish them to consult beforehand how <hi>England</hi> in general stands affected to such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66218:27"/>
and how they will justify the Lawfulness of it, lest it fare with them as it did with K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. and his Cabal, who not only in Council advis'd, TO REDUCE US TO OUR DUTY BY FORCE RATHER THAN GIVE WAY TO OUR DEMANDS, as may be seen in the <hi>Representation of the States of</hi> Scotland in 1640. but rais'd Money, and levied a formidable Army to carry on their Design; and yet the Hearts of these Bravos fail'd them when they came in view of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who repuls'd them twice with shame, the first time when they encamp'd their great Army near <hi>Barwick,</hi> and the next when we charg'd them at <hi>Newburn.</hi> And at last the best of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England</hi> thought fit to put a stop to those dangerous Proceedings, and follow'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty with a Protestation against them, as well knowing, that if <hi>Scotland</hi> were once subdued, the Liberties of <hi>England</hi> could not be long liv'd.</p>
            <p>That it is the Interest of <hi>England</hi> now to prevent the Ruin of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as much as it was then, will appear by the following Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the present Juncture of Affairs makes it necessary for the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> rather to strengthen themselves by making new Friends than by procuring new Enemies. They are not ignorant that they have a controverted Title to their Crown entail'd upon them, and that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders against those in possession are in the <hi>French</hi> Interest, and under their Protection. Nor can they be ignorant, that to the old National Hatred betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> have added that of the Protestant Religion. Of late years they have declared themselves the most implacable Enemies of it; and their King in all his Triumphs has that ascrib'd to him as his greatest Exploit, that he hath quelled the Monster of Heresy. The case
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66218:27"/>
being thus, it must needs be against the Interest of <hi>England</hi> to suffer any froward and headstrong Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to embroil them with <hi>Scotland,</hi> or to ruin that Kingdom; the Consequence of which will be the exposing themselves as an easier Prey to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the <hi>French</hi> or any other Enemy.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>French</hi> had a hand in fomenting our late Civil Wars, and made use of their Firebrands in all Parties, is beyond dispute; and that it is now more their Interest to divide us than ever, is so palpable that it cannot be denied. Nothing in human probability could have stop'd the impetuous Current of their Arms, but the Interposition of <hi>Great Britain</hi>; and therefore it concerns them, both in point of Interest and Revenge, to dash us against one another: and if the ill Usage that we meet with from the Court of <hi>England</hi> should force us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into a <hi>French</hi> or other Alliance, the World cannot blame us; since the Laws of Nature and Nations are for us. Put the case that a smaller num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christians should be unjustly attack'd by a greater, whom nothing will satisfy but the utter Ruin of the former: Could any man in conscience blame the weaker Party to call in the Assistance of <hi>Iews</hi> and Pagans to preserve their own Lives? Is it not the same case with the <hi>Scots?</hi> have they not ever since the Union of the Crowns been oppressed and tyranniz'd over by a Faction in <hi>England,</hi> who will neither admit of an Union of the Nations, nor leave the <hi>Scots</hi> in possession of their own Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, as Men and Christians? Was it not a Party in <hi>England</hi> that impos'd upon us first in Matters of Religion? Did we send first to oblige them to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the <hi>Geneva</hi> Disciplin, as they call it; or was it they that first imposed their Ceremonies and Forms of Prayer upon us? Was it we who first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded them with an Army to subvert their Civil and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66218:28"/>
Religious Liberties, or did not they first invade us? Was it we who first made Acts against their Trade, or they who made Acts destructive of ours? Did we issue Proclamations against their Colonies, or have they done so by ours? In the name of God then let them declare what they would have us to do. They will not unite with us, nor suffer us to live by our selves: Nor must we have any share of their Trade, or carry on a Trade by our selves. Is it not plain then that the Faction oppress us? and yet we must not complain of this sort of Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the state of Affairs in <hi>Ireland</hi> be consider'd, it will appear to be such, as may make it dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to suffer the <hi>Scots</hi> to be oppressed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd in this manner. It is well enough known that the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> are not very well pleas'd with their Treatment by some in <hi>England.</hi> This, together with the great numbers of <hi>Scots</hi> in the North of that Kingdom, who bear a natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to their Country, and would be very uneasy to see its Ruin, may prove of dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in case of a Rupture with <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It will further appear to be the Interest of <hi>England</hi> not to suffer the <hi>Scots</hi> to be so much run down, if they consider the posture of their own Affairs at home. The Divisions and Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties betwixt the several Parties in <hi>England</hi> are well enough known: So that besides the sport it would afford to the common Enemy of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Country, to see those two Nations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in War, the Enemies of the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would be sure to improve it, and watch for an opportunity to avenge themselves for what has been done against the late K. <hi>Iames,</hi> and his Friends. It is well enough known what hopes they and some People beyond Sea conceive from the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66218:28"/>
Differences that this Treatment of the <hi>Scots</hi> may probably occasion; and as they have an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable Hatred against our Nation, because we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd so generally against the late King, and are so zealous for his present Majesty, there's no doubt but they will foment our Divisions as much as they can, and insinuate themselves with both Parties, in order to set them together by the Ears. They know that so many as fall in <hi>England</hi> of those who adhere to the present Constitution, and so many as fall in <hi>Scotland</hi> for supporting the Trade and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their Country, so many Enemies they are rid of; therefore there's no question but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise themselves a plentiful fishing in such troubled Waters.</p>
            <p>It likewise deserves the consideration of our Neighbours, that they don't stand at present in very good Terms as to Matter of Trade with <hi>France, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi>; nor is it well known what the Issue of the present Controversy with <hi>Spain</hi> about regulating their Succession may be. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending differences betwixt the Northern Crowns may perhaps in a little time imbroil them with one or other of them, and affect their Trade also on that side. All which being consider'd, it would seem to be the Interest of <hi>England,</hi> to assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Friendship of the <hi>Scots,</hi> by treating them in a kind and neighbourly manner.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It will appear in particular not to be the Interest of the Dissenters and sober Churchmen, that the <hi>Scots</hi> should be thus run down, because their own Ruin will be the unavoidable Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it. This they may soon be convinc'd of if they will give themselves leave to consider how they were treated in K. <hi>Charles</hi> the First's time, when the Court did swell with so much Rage against the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> for asserting their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66218:29"/>
then, as they do now. All those Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>-men that could not conform to the Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons brought into the Church by <hi>Laud</hi> and his Party, were treated as Puritans and Schismaticks; and those that appear'd for the Liberties of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the Ship-money and other Arbitrary Impositions of the Court, were treated as Rebels and Traitors. If they look into the two last Reigns, it will appear as plain as the Sun, that when <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was oppress'd, and their Liberties wrested from them, the Dissenters and moderate Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>England</hi> were brought under the lash: the former were depriv'd of their Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the latter expos'd to destruction by Sham-plots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because of their appearing for the Laws of their Country. We need mention no more Instances to put this out of Controversy, than those deplorable ones of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> and Lord <hi>Russel</hi>; to which we may add the shameful and barbarous Treatment of the worthy Mr. <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> Chaplain to the latter, because he so excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended with his Pen the Birth-right and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of all true Englishmen.</p>
            <p>From all this it will appear that <hi>England</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral must suffer by the Ruin of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that those who have all along stood up for the <hi>English</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, must lay their Account to come under the lash, if once our Necks come under the Yoke: therefore we dare appeal to the sober Men of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Whether it be their Interest that a Nation which agrees with them in all the Articles of their Church, those about Discipline excepted, should be destin'd to ruin, because we believe with most of the Reformed Churches, that there is no Office superiour to that of a Presbyter of divine Institution. Must we be denied the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of Men and Christians, because we think
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66218:29"/>
that the Discipline of the Church may be more safely intrusted, and more faithfully administred by the joint Indeavors of the Minister and the Heads of his Congregation, by an Association of neighbouring Ministers, and the Heads of their Parishes, and by Delegates both of the Clergy and Laity of those Associations in a general Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than by another Model? But enough of this Subject. Let any Man peruse the learned Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Vsher</hi>'s Treatise of <hi>Presbytery and Episcopacy reconcil'd,</hi> and there they will find that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is not so great as some People have made it their business to make the World believe. But if nothing less than our destruction will serve those Gentlemen, because our Church is of a different Constitution from that of <hi>England,</hi> and that our political Principles and original Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are diametrically opposite to arbitrary Power, let the Dissenters of <hi>England,</hi> and all those Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that concurr'd in the late Revolution, look to it. When their Neighbour's House is on fire it's time for them to prepare their Bucket's. If this Digression be thought impertinent, <hi>H—s</hi> and the Answerer of the <hi>Scots</hi> Defence must bear the blame of it. They would insinuate to the World that the Affair of our Trade and Colony is a Presbyterian Project, on purpose to render it odious and suspected to the Church of <hi>England</hi>; therefore it was necessary to obviate that false and malicious Suggestion, and to acquaint our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that the Company make no difference as to the matter of Perswasion: and let it be put to the Test when they please, it will be found that those of the Episcopal Opinion are as zealous for the thriving of our Trade, and the Honour of our Nation (both of which are concern'd in this Affair) as any of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:66218:30"/>To wind up this matter, if any Party in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> entertain suspicions of us, the better way to prevent us is to treat us kindly, and enter into an Union with us on such Terms as his Majesty and the Parliament of both Kingdoms shall agree, and so as the Civil and Religious Liberties of both People may be preserved. That will be easier and safer than to relie on the Hopes of an uncertain Conquest; or if they don't think fit to do so, it's but reasonable they should leave us in the undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd possession of our own Liberties: But if they will do neither, let them no more accuse those that complain of this Treatment as Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, but seriously examine whether they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves mayn't with more Justice be accounted Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors.</p>

            <head>PART II. Being a more particular Answer to <hi>H—s</hi>'s Libel.</head>
            <p>WE come in the next place to take a Survey of <hi>H—s</hi> Libel, intituled, <hi>The Defence of the</hi> Scots <hi>abdicating</hi> Darien; and shall speedily shew to how little purpose his Suborners have spent their Pains and Mony on him.</p>
            <p>The first Line of his Performance is a Banter upon his Majesty, whom he charges with <hi>investing our Company with immense Privileges and Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by his Octroy of</hi> 1695. There's no Man can be answerable for more sense than God has given him; but tho <hi>H—s</hi> understood no better, his Masters at <hi>White-hall,</hi> of whom he brags so much, ought to have taken care that he should not run into Nonsense, and an Invective against his Majesty at first dash: To talk of granting us <hi>immense Privileges,</hi> is to impeach his Majesty's Wisdom, as if he had done a thing without paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel, which is directly to incense the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> against him, as some bad People indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to do, when by a Misrepresentation of our Design, they stir'd up the House of Commons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. But had the Surgeon or his Suborners look'd into the Privileges of 21 Years freedom from all manner of Taxes granted to the Dutch <hi>East-India</hi> Company by the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the vast Immunities granted by the French King, the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Brandenburghers</hi> to their Companies for trading to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> or even
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66218:31"/>
to those granted to the English <hi>East-India</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at first, they would have found there was no reason to charge his Majesty with granting us such immense or unparallel'd Privileges, or ascribing it to his not well knowing what he did for the noise of the Guns at <hi>Namur,</hi> as this petulant Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler does. <hi>Dedication, pag.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>H —s</hi> and his Suborners exclaim against our Privileges as immense, they are resolv'd to diminish the Authority by which they were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and call it only by the name of an <hi>Octroy,</hi> which signifies no more than a Patent; whereas our Privileges were granted us by an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which are greater and more sacred than all the <hi>Octroys</hi> in <hi>Europe:</hi> Thus thro Ignorance or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice they think fit to vilify his Majesty's Conduct and Authority, which they pretend to defend.</p>
            <p>Their Malice is further demonstrated by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis <hi>(to be presum'd)</hi> in the 2<hi>d page</hi> of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, where they speak of his Majesty's <hi>Promise to interpose his Royal Authority to do us right in case of disturbance, and that at the publick Charge</hi> (to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd) <hi>of his antient Kingdom.</hi> There might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have been some need of their <hi>presumption,</hi> had all Mankind been indow'd with as little Sense and Honesty as <hi>H—s</hi> and his Suborners; for no other Body could ever presume it to mean any thing else, since our Acts do not oblige <hi>England:</hi> tho if they had presum'd that our Enemies would take care that the said Promise should not be kept, the refusal of lending our Company the 3 Men of War built at the Charge of our own Nation, would soon have convinc'd the World that they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd too true.</p>
            <p>We have accounted for rejecting Mr. <hi>Douglas</hi>'s Proposal elsewhere; nor shall we take notice of <hi>H—s</hi>'s scurrilous Reflections on Mr. <hi>Paterson,</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:66218:31"/>
which only discover his own Temper, but do that honest Man no hurt. As to his charging us with <hi>squandring away</hi> 50000 l. <hi>on</hi> 6 <hi>Hulks at</hi> Amsterdam <hi>and</hi> Hamburgh, <hi>purely to make a noise of our Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> &amp;c. we would desire him and his Suborners to reconcile it with what they say from <hi>p.</hi> 14, to 20. where they own themselves that the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Hamburgers</hi> were both mightily pleas'd with the Design, <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>That the</hi> Dutch <hi>were tickled with the Conceit that they should be Sharers in the</hi> Scots <hi>Trade</hi>; and <hi>p.</hi> 16. they say, <hi>That that which gave the dead stroke to the</hi> Scots <hi>Design, was the</hi> East <hi>and</hi> West-India <hi>Companies running open mouth'd to the Lords of</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam, <hi>shewing what was hatching by the</hi> Scots <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners in their City to ruine the Trade of the Vnit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Provinces.</hi> P. 17. they tell us, <hi>That the</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers <hi>thought it the more their Interest to embrace the Project, the more that the</hi> Dutch <hi>oppos'd it:</hi> P. 18. <hi>That our Affair was generally favour'd by the Burgers of</hi> Hamburg; and <hi>p.</hi> 21. <hi>That the Government of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>sent the Senate of</hi> Hamburgh <hi>a Caution by Sir</hi> Paul Ricaut <hi>to take care how they suffer'd their Burghers to embark with us.</hi> So that here we condemn them from their own mouths: It being plain from those Concessions, that we did not idly squander away our Money at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam</hi>; but that both those trading Cities approv'd our Design, and would have engag'd in it, had not the Court of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> oppos'd it; and therefore what loss of Mony we sustain'd in those places, must be charg'd to their Account; so that <hi>H — s</hi> hath verified the Proverb, That Liars have need of good Memories.</p>
            <p>This is not the only Instance wherein those of <hi>H— s</hi> and his Suborners have giv'n them the slip; for in the 4<hi>th</hi> page of the Dedication, they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66218:32"/>
upbraid the Company with their blind Project, at which the trading part of the World stand amaz'd; yet <hi>p.</hi> 17. they tell us that the Project was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable both on the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Hamburghers</hi> side; and the Reasons they give are these, <hi>That the River on which that City stands is navigable for</hi> 200 <hi>Miles up into</hi> Germany <hi>for flat-bottom'd Vessels of</hi> 70 <hi>or</hi> 80 <hi>Tuns,</hi> which gives them an opportunity of serving all the North Parts of the Empire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All that they can say to salve this Contradiction is, <hi>That the</hi> Hamburghers <hi>knew nothing of</hi> Darien, <hi>but builded altogether on Ships laden with</hi> India <hi>Goods</hi>; but that's a notorious Falshood, for the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> were actually told that our Design was on the Isthmus of <hi>America,</hi> and therefore could not be disappointed in their Expectations of an <hi>East-India</hi> Trade if they had a mind to have follow'd it, since they could not be ignorant that they had thereby an opportunity of shortning the Voyage from <hi>Darien</hi> to the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> But at the same time it is much to be question'd whether the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> were so intent upon an <hi>East-India</hi> Trade, as <hi>H—s</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, since it must visibly prejudice their own Manufacture of Linen.</p>
            <p>We shall conclude this of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> with one Observation, <hi>viz.</hi> that he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 14. That one of the Reasons why the <hi>Dutch</hi> were so much taken with our <hi>East-Indian</hi> Trade, was our Exemption from Duties for 21 years; which serves only to discover his own Folly and Malice, since every Body must necessarily know, that exemption from Duties was only in the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Ports; so that if they were exported from thence into any other Country, they must pay the same Duties in those Countries, as if they had been directly imported from the <hi>East-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inconsistency of <hi>H—s</hi> and his Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66218:32"/>
is further demonstrated, <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>by supposing our buying a couple of second-hand Ships in the</hi> Thames, <hi>and dispatching them to</hi> India <hi>with a sutable Cargo.</hi> As to the buying of second-hand Ships, the Company made that Experiment; but found themselves losers by it, and that it cost them more to sit up a second-hand Vessel for their purpose, than it would have done to have bought a new one. But with what Front can they upbraid us with not buying of Ships in the <hi>Thames</hi> for carrying on an <hi>East-India</hi> Trade, when they own, <hi>p.</hi> 7. <hi>that the House of Commons baulk'd us of our Subscriptions, and repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Subjects of</hi> England <hi>for their foolery?</hi> How is it possible then that they would have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd our buying Ships in the <hi>Thames</hi> for carrying on an <hi>East-India</hi> Trade?</p>
            <p>We have another proof of his Ingenuity and Truth in that same Page, where he tells us, that if <hi>our blind Project</hi> (<hi>meaning that of</hi> Darien) <hi>should mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry by our own ill Management, it is not fair me should snarl at our Neighbours, who have no other Hand in our Misfortune, than that they would not be accessary to any All which the World might judg Felonious, and wherein they could not join without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging themselves in an unreasonable War, and in the end to assist us with Weapons to break our own Heads.</hi> We wish his Masters much joy of their Advocat and Evidence, for we believe they could not have found such another if they had searched through all the Island: He just now own'd that our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours opposed our Subscriptions at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, before they knew any thing of what he calls <hi>our blind Project,</hi> and made us squander away 50000 <hi>l.</hi> to little purpose, which certainly must be a <hi>misfortune,</hi> and that wherein our Neighbours had no small hand, tho the World could not judg our taking Subscriptions in that Honourable
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66218:33"/>
manner to be any way Felonious. We have more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over sufficiently proved it elsewhere, that they have had a hand in our Misfortune by down-right opposition, and unaccountable Proclamations for which they had no Authority; we hope that this will be allow'd to be something more than refusing to be accessary to an Act that neither he nor his Suborners will ever be able to prove Felonious, and which we have already told him, the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have in a parallel, nay much worse case, judg'd to be honest and righteous.</p>
            <p>So that all this Author hath got by his charging us maliciously with Felony, is to prove himself a wilful Felon, for he tells us at the end of his Book of a long dispute betwixt himself and Sir <hi>I. Stewart</hi> his Majesty's Advocat for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Title of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to <hi>Darien</hi>; and if we may believe <hi>H—s,</hi> he baffled the Advocat, and prov'd the Right of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> which proves himself to have engaged in a Design that he thought Felonious, for we do not find, by his own Relation, that he left the place from remorse of Conscience, but only on the Account of a <hi>Malladie Imaginaire,</hi> and want of Provisions; so that we thank him for telling the World, from his own Mouth, that his Evidence against us is that of a Felon.</p>
            <p>As to their engaging themselves in an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable War, and assisting us with Weapons to break their own Heads; we did not desire they should engage in a War for us, but think it very unreasonable the <hi>English</hi> Court should have engaged so far as they have done against us: It had been sufficient for them to have denied us their Assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, without having condemn'd us as guilty of breach of Alliance, which, as all the other parts of the opposition made to us, we are satisfied is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:66218:33"/>
not the Act of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and therefore can create no misunderstanding betwixt them and us, but perhaps may prove a Weapon in time to break the Heads of <hi>H—s</hi> and his Suborners.</p>
            <p>In the 5<hi>th</hi> Page, that his Book may be all of a piece, he advances a forg'd Obligation upon us, from the Union of the Crowns, which is, that we are thereby <hi>deliver'd from the daily Feuds and bloody little Wars that rag'd amongst us for</hi> 1900 <hi>years, which unnatural Massacres our native Princes were unable to suppress,</hi> &amp;c. This is down-right falshood in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact; for those Feuds, as he calls them, ceas'd in the <hi>Lowlands</hi> long before the Union, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue still in the <hi>Highlands,</hi> which we can scarcely think is unknown to our Author who was born so near that Country as <hi>Dumbarton.</hi> The <hi>Macdonalds</hi> have been several times in Arms against the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> since the Restoration, and there's a Feud now depending between the <hi>Frazers</hi> and the <hi>Murrays,</hi> or rather the Family of <hi>Athol.</hi> Nor did we ever hear of any thing that look'd so like an unnatural Massacre in <hi>Scotland</hi> as that committed since the Revolution upon the Inhabitants of <hi>Glenco,</hi> which had it not been for the Union of the Crowns, would not have been suffer'd to go unpunished. But admitting it to be true, that the Union had deliver'd us from those little Feuds, we are no gainers by the Bargain, since it hath occasion'd greater; particularly that unnatural Feud which rag'd so long betwixt the Episcopal Party and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, and had its rise altogether from the Union of the Crowns; the very prospect of which, was the sole cause why the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> (when Regent) set up the first Protestant Bishops in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Into what Couvulsions that Imposition threw the Nation is well enough known; and how besides the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66218:34"/>
bringing down K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. with 30000 Men against our Kingdom, and contributing to engage the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a Civil War, it occasioned King <hi>Charles</hi> II. to plunder the West of <hi>Scotland,</hi> first by Sir <hi>Iames Turner,</hi> which gave rise to the Insurrection at <hi>Pentland</hi>; and twice afterwards by the <hi>Highland</hi> Host, which occasion'd that of <hi>Bothwel-Bridg:</hi> And afterwards the Oppression run so high, that it forc'd some of the Presbyterians into unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Actions, which gave occasion to oppress the whole Party; so that it was made punishable by Death for any of their Ministers to preach, or for the People to hear them. From this indeed, we were totally delivered by the Revolution, tho our freedom in that respect was partly begun by the late King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Declaration. But our Enemies, unwilling that our Nation should be long at ease, have found other Methods to set our Court against us: And because they know that his present Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty has too great a Soul to persecute any man on the account of Conscience; our Enemies have chang'd their Battery, and instead of pointing their Cannon at our Religion, they level them against our Civil Liberties. The Powder they prime their Artillery with, is, That <hi>we are Enemies to Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi> But because this would not go down with the good People of <hi>England,</hi> who are strenuous Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Liberty and Property, they must gild it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with the specious Pretence, that we have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to undermine their Trade, and have unjustly invaded the <hi>Spanish</hi> Dominions. This is the Design of <hi>H—s</hi> and his Suborners; and therefore they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist so much on our Clandestine Declarations, as they call them, that we publish'd in the <hi>English</hi> Plantations, on purpose to drain them of their People; but unhappily overthrow what they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance at the same time, when they tell us, That
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66218:34"/>
               <hi>the</hi> Jamaica <hi>Sloops were Witnesses that we had neither Provisions, nor Money for the sustenance of our own People,</hi> pag. 148. And therefore it cannot reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be suppos'd that we had any such design as he maliciously charges us with, to draw over the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the <hi>English</hi> Plantations, since we had not wherewith to support our own; but more of this anon. Our Author learn'd the Maxim of <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niare audacter &amp; aliquid haerebit,</hi> when he was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist: And if he and his Suborners can be any way instrumental to set the Nations together by the Ears by this Method; or if that fail, if they can but raise Animositys between them, they know it will be a good pretence for some People to put his Majesty upon pressing for a Standing Army, and perhaps for having it enlarg'd, it being necessary, say they, to overaw the <hi>Scots,</hi> but in reality to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect such evil Counsellors from being brought to Justice, that have advis'd to such Measures as visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tend to the disadvantage of both Nations.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be worth the Enquiry of our Neighbours whether this be not the real meaning of this intolerable Oppression exercis'd upon our Nation as to their Trade both at home and abroad, <hi>viz.</hi> that knowing our <hi>praefervidum Ingenium,</hi> as they are pleas'd to call it, to be impatient under Tyranny, the Faction think thereby to provoke us to a resentment that may give occasion for raising an Army against us; which if it have the good hap to subdue us, or force us to digest our Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion without any more to do, shall be made use of afterwards to chastise themselves, and bring them to better Manners, then to limit their Monarchs in their Grants, and leave them no other Troops but their Garisons and Guards. It was the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> whom his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will own to have been a great Statesman, that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66218:35"/>
               <hi>Scotland</hi> is a Door to let in Good or Evil upon <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; which is verified in the latter at least by the whole Course of our History since the Union: for when K. <hi>Iames</hi> I. succeeded in trampling upon us, he quickly began to huff his Parliaments in <hi>England</hi>; and notwithstanding all the Remonstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Church and State, would needs have a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Match for his Son, tho he should sacrifice the Great Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> his own Daughter the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and her Children, together with the Protestant Interest in <hi>Germany,</hi> to make way for it. When <hi>Charles</hi> I. obtain'd footing for his Impositions on the Church and State of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it's well enough known what Methods he took with <hi>England,</hi> and how he sacrific'd the Protestant Interest in <hi>France,</hi> whilst he eagerly pursued an Arbitrary Sway at home. When <hi>Charles</hi> II. got his Prerogative exalted, and an Army at his Call allow'd him in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it's too late to be forgotten how he trod under foot the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> seiz'd the Charters of their Cities, cut off whom he would by Sham-Plots, and pav'd the way for Popery and Arbitrary Power. When K. <hi>Iames</hi> II. did by his absolute Power and unaccountable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority cass and annul all the Laws establishing the Reformation in <hi>Scotland</hi>; it was not long e're he sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the Laws, imprison'd the Bishops, and fill'd with Papists his Council, Army, and Universities in <hi>England.</hi> From all which it is evident that our Neighbours have reason to look to themselves when we are oppress'd; for in all probability their Acts of Parliament will not be long regarded, when ours are annull'd and made void by the Intrigues of the Courtiers, and <hi>West-India</hi> Proclamations. The very Advocats of Tyranny make use of this as their <hi>Herculean</hi> Argument, That the People hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once resign'd their Privileges to the Crown,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66218:35"/>
have no more right to demand them; which tho we will not allow to be any ways concluding, yet we may very well make use of it <hi>ad hominem,</hi> that <hi>a pari ratione,</hi> when once a Prince has touch'd with his Scepter a Law for the benefit of his Subjects, it is not in his power to revoke or counteract it; or if he do, by the same Power that he absolves himself from his Obligation to protect and defend his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he absolves them from all obligation to pay him any Revenue or Allegiance. This is the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of all <hi>Scots</hi>-men; and if our Neighbours in <hi>England</hi> have a mind to sit still, and see us bereft of it, all the benefit they can expect from it, is to have the Privilege of being devour'd last.</p>
            <p>The rest of his Banter upon his native Country serves only to lessen his own credit, and to make even those that set him at work, curse him in thought, not only as a Monster in nature, but as dishonest to them, by depriving them thus of the benefit of his Evidence, for which they have paid him so well; since no body in the world can think a man will have any regard to Truth, that in such an impudent manner breaks thro all the Ties of Nature; and as a just Judgment for so enormous a Crime, is so far depriv'd of his reasoning Faculty, that he is not fensible of his cutting his own Throat, by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting himself almost in every Paragraph. He up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids us in one Page with not having dar'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend into the Plains, and that those gallant Men our Ancestors durst not assemble for Worship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Union, except in a House whose Wall was twelve or 14 foot thick, or to whisper their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or Carrols thro the Cliffs of the Mountains: In the next Page he tells us he has no Inclination to offer any thing in opposition to the Gallantry of our Ancestors; and in some Pages following he imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently ridicules the Valour of our Country in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66218:36"/>
Story of <hi>Baliol,</hi> which he perverts in such a manner, as no man but himself is capable of.</p>
            <p>We don't think it worth while to answer him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Folly, but shall once for all let him know, that the most invective of the <hi>English</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, that wrote in the heat of the War, do us more Justice than this unnatural Renegado. There's no Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> where we have not given proofs of our Valour, nor is there a Court in <hi>Christendom</hi> where <hi>Scots</hi>-men are not valued on that account. <hi>Sam. Daniel,</hi> one of the best of the <hi>English</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, owns that never any People of the World did more gallantly defend their Liberties than we did in that very instance of <hi>Baliol,</hi> when we were without a Head; and from thence infers, what was it we could not have done, had we been then under the conduct of such a Leader as K. <hi>Robert Bruce. Speed,</hi> one of the gravest of the <hi>English</hi> Historians, does generously own, that few great Actions have been perform'd in <hi>Europe,</hi> where the <hi>Scots</hi> have not been with the first and last in the Field.</p>
            <p>We could easily give a proper Reply to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Romance which he brings about <hi>Baliol,</hi> that would tend as much or more to the dishonour of <hi>Edward</hi> I. II. and III. than any thing that he and his Suborners have suggested can tend to the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Nation; but we forbear it, having no design to reflect upon our Neighbours, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the rude Treatment and Provocation that we have had from <hi>H—s,</hi> and others on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. We can, without thinking our selves injur'd, own that the <hi>English</hi> are as brave Men as any in the World, and are satisfied, that such of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as are Men of Honour and Reading, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us the same Character. We perceive it is the design of this Libeller and others to represent the <hi>English</hi> Nation as Enemies to us in this matter, on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66218:36"/>
purpose to set us together by the Ears; but we are satisfied of the contrary, as well knowing that not a few of our good Neighbours are much surpriz'd and displeas'd with our Treatment, and look upon the same to be the effect of such Councils as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to the Interest of both Nations.</p>
            <p>We shall conclude this point with one Observation more upon <hi>H—s</hi>'s Ignorance and Malice, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that the <hi>Scots</hi> expell'd <hi>Baliol</hi> from the Crown, when such a noble Monument of the truth of it, as the original Letter of the States of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is still to be seen in the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and exemplify'd by Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> now Bishop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> in his History of the Reformation; and since it is also plain that our Ancestors chose <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> King during <hi>Baliol</hi>'s Life-time, and that <hi>Baliol</hi> at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd all his Pretensions, confess'd his Fault in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> to that of <hi>England,</hi> own'd that he was deservedly thrust from the Throne for it, congratulated his Kinsman <hi>Robert Bruce</hi>'s Advancement, and that he had restor'd the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> to its antient Honour.</p>
            <p>We take no notice of his profane and atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Banter upon the Religion of our Country, as being satisfied that that will do his Cause no good amongst thinking men, tho it may please those that he is only fit to converse with. As for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious charge on Presbyterians, that they maintain it as their Principle, <hi>That Dominion is founded on Grace</hi>; it's of a piece with the rest of his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. He and his Suborners will be very hard put to it to quote one of their Authors to prove the Assertion, and therefore they may well reject it as a slander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we must tell him that if this be the Principle of the Presbyterians, they have not well answer'd it by their practice; for whenever they had any such thing as <hi>Dominion</hi> at their dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66218:37"/>
they seldom had the good hap to confer it upon those that had <hi>Grace</hi> enough to answer the ends of it. We forbear Instances, because it's too well known both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We come next to examine his Charge upon our Colony on purpose to render them odious to the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and all the World, and shall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it <hi>verbatim,</hi> that the reason of our Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon it may be the more obvious. His words are these.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If your Colony has left <hi>Darien</hi> for Reasons not as yet public to the World, 'tis your fault, Right Worshipful Gentlemen, in undertaking to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage a Project you so little understood, and not of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, whose Interest it is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and preserve their own Colonies, and to keep them from being render'd desolate by the clandestine Artifices of yours, who industriously and tacitely spread their Declarations over all the <hi>English</hi> Islands and Plantations, making use of the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi>'s Name, to give more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the thing: And by those indirect <hi>Manifestos,</hi> such Profits, or rather Plunders were insinuated, that if the Government of <hi>England</hi> had not taken early measures to prevent the ill Consequences, it's to be question'd whether the greatest part of the <hi>English West Indies</hi> had not e're now quitted their Settlements, and been decoyed into your Colony, under a cover'd Notion, that you had a Patent from the King to pick a quarrel with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and to divide the Spoil of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> amongst the Servants and Adventurers of the Company.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed is something to the purpose, and might deserve the Suborners Mony, were there no possibility of proving it false; but we shall see anon what ground there is for this bold Accusation, after observing,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:66218:37"/>That perhaps some Gentlemen at the West end of the Town may find at long-run that their Evidence has blab'd out something more in this Paragraph than it's for their Interest the World should know. We will only ask Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> some civil Questions: What are those Reasons not as yet publick to the World, for which our Colony left <hi>Darien?</hi> Sir <hi>William Beeston</hi>'s Letter acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us that it was for want of Provisions, and for fear of the great Preparations by the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> The Letters we have had since from <hi>New-York</hi> say, that it was for want of Provisions, and because they were brought to their wits end, and did not know what to think of their Case by reason of the <hi>English</hi> Proclamations. Then since the very first of these, and much more all of them together, were reason sufficient, and are publick to the World, What other private reasons can Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> give us for it? We know he boasts of his Interest in those that are concerned in the Secrets of the West End of the Town: Did they tell him then that the Government of <hi>England</hi> took <hi>early Measures</hi> to prevent the ill Consequences of our Colony? If they did so, pray what were those Measures? Was the sending of Capt. <hi>Long</hi> thither to debauch our Men, traduce us to the <hi>Indians</hi> as Pirats, and to tell them his Majesty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> would not protect us, one of those early Measures? Was not their solliciting a foreign Minister to present a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial against our Colony as soon as ever the News of it arriv'd, another? And was not this the reason why they put it upon that Minister, and not upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador, that the latter had been forbid coming to Court, because his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majesty would not admit of <hi>Schonenburg</hi> the the <hi>Iew</hi> as Envoy from the <hi>Dutch</hi>? Were not the Enemies of the <hi>Scots</hi> Company so zealous in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66218:38"/>
that Memorial, that they could not have patience till orders came from <hi>Madrid,</hi> but put the Envoy upon it of themselves? And when a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy happen'd about receiving it signed or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd because of the difference betwixt the two Courts, did not our Enemies agree to it as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, that one of both sorts should be present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Was not this abominable trifling upon a point of Honour, when they were plotting to bereave the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> of their Honour, Men, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Colony all at once? Were not these more clandestine and indirect Artifices to destroy our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, than any he charges upon us to destroy the English Colonies?</p>
            <p>Having ask'd Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> more Questions than he and his Suborners dare positively answer, we come next to deny his Charge upon our Colony, as being malicious and absolutely false; for which their own Declaration shall be our Evidence, and is as follows.</p>

               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:66218:40"/>We dare refer it to the Scrutiny of the nicest Observers, whether this Declaration infer any such thing as <hi>Plunder,</hi> or a Patent from the King to pick a Quarrel with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to divide the Spoil of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi>; what clandestine Artifices are here to be found to drain the English Plantations, and wherein does it interfere with the Interest of <hi>England,</hi> any more than all free Ports must of necessity interfere with their Neighbours? We wish that our Author would inform us how publick Declarations according to Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be call'd clandestine Artifices, and defy him and his Suborners with all their art to find any thing pretended to in this Declaration, but what the Colony has a right to by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The only thing this malicious Scribler can wrest to his Purpose in the Declaration, is the Colony's publishing that all manner of Persons, of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or People soever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should be equally free, and alike capable of the same Privileges with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the express Words of the Act of Parliament; and therefore supposing that the said Declaration should have influenc'd some People to come over to them from the English Plantations, the Colony could not be any ways blam'd for it. <hi>Qui utitur jure suo nil damni facit,</hi> is a known Maxim in Law.</p>
            <p>The Libeller's Malice is not satisfied with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon our Colony, but flies on the face of the greatest part of the <hi>English</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> as if they had so little Honour or Love for their native Country, as to lay their own Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions desolate, and run over to ours. Indeed if most of them be such Persons as himself, there might be some ground for the Reflection; but till it appears to be so, we must beg Mr. <hi>H—s</hi>'s
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66218:40"/>
leave to have a better opinion of them. No Man fo sense can believe that those who found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at ease in the English Plantations, would be fond of removing to a new Colony; but if others who are at their freedom had a mind to do so, we know of no reason they should be hinder'd. The Subjects of <hi>England</hi> are a free People, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to their own Dominions, but have liberty to trade and live elsewhere, if they find their account in it.</p>
            <p>There's no man can blame the <hi>Scots</hi> for publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Declaration throughout the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> the thing being absolutely necessary in it self, and the natural Practice of all new Settlements to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the World with the nature of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and on what Terms they may have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with them. We hope our Author and his Suborners will not say that the Subjects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> might not have traded with them for their own advantage, provided their Title had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable: and seeing the <hi>Scots</hi> had reason to think it so, it was no act of unkindness in them to let the English Plantations know that they should be very welcome to trade to <hi>Darien</hi>; and how this could be done so properly, and with so much effect as by Declaration, our Author would do well to acquaint us.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman and his Friends are very angry that we should have made use of the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi>'s Name to give the more Authority to the thing. We would very fain know their Reasons, why it is not as lawful for the <hi>Scots</hi> to make use of that Name as the <hi>English</hi>; and at the same time must take leave to tell the Renegado and his <hi>Whitehall</hi> Friends, that all this Venom they have spit at the Scots Colony is a virulent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective against his Majesty. He impower'd them
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66218:41"/>
to do what they accuse them for by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: and because our Antagonists have a mind to say that this <hi>Octroy,</hi> as they call it, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves oblig'd to make an Excuse for the King, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the honest Gentleman meant no harm at the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; for it is to be believ'd, that he could scarce bear what was whisper'd for the noise of the</hi> Namur <hi>Guns,</hi> which is in plain English, he gave his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to he knew not what. A noble Defence, for which his Majesty is oblig'd to them! But Banter and Blasphemy they were fully resolv'd on; and so they had but a Subject, they car'd not what. Nor <hi>Adam,</hi> nor <hi>David,</hi> nay nor the Almighty himself shall escape them; but his Commission to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> when they departed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> must come in to make up the profane Jest: thus Heav'n it self shall be charg'd at last with founding Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon Grace, and giving the Elect a Divine Right to the Goods of the Wicked, after its being first thrown as a killing Reflection at the Heads of the poor Presbyterians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>H—s</hi> will needs insist upon it in his Dedication, that our Project on <hi>Darien</hi> was so secretly carried on, that it was not known to <hi>England</hi> till the same Wind that brought the News likewise inform'd the Nation that the <hi>Scots</hi> were march'd over to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama,</hi> and had planted 80 Guns against it; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily forgets himself, and tells us, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. of his Book that <hi>Paterson</hi> communicated it to some select Heads in <hi>England</hi> that were able to bear it. And we can tell him further, that it was so well known to some in <hi>England,</hi> that they sent Capt. <hi>Long</hi> the Quaker on purpose to prevent us, and to do us all the mischief he could; and accordingly he was on that Coast a month before us, tho he did not land any Men till afterwards. As for the news
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66218:41"/>
of the <hi>Scots</hi> having planted 80 Cannon against <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama,</hi> it's the first time we ever heard on't, and therefore must charge it upon the Author amongst the rest of his Forgeries. There was indeed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port brought over by the <hi>Dutch Gazetts,</hi> which we suppose was inserted on purpose by our good Friends in <hi>Holland</hi> to render us odious, that we had plundered <hi>Panama</hi>; but that was a long time after the news of our arrival at <hi>Darien,</hi> and fram'd on purpose, as we have reason to believe, to justify the Proclamations that some Gentlemen at the West end of the Town had sent to the <hi>West-Indies</hi> against us; for we know they can have what they please put in the <hi>Dutch Gazetts,</hi> and that perhaps may be one main reason why they have been altogether silent as to the matter in their own. But that which sufficiently discovers the falshood of this malicious Insinuation, as if we had a design to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque <hi>Panama,</hi> or any other place belonging to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> is, Mr. <hi>Paterson</hi>'s Letter to his Friend at <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> (and sent us thence in print) dated at <hi>Fort St. Andrew</hi> in <hi>Caledonia,</hi> February 18. 1698/9. above fifteen weeks after the arrival of our Colony; wherein he acquaints that Gentleman, <hi>That they had written to the President of</hi> Panama, <hi>giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him an account of our good and peaceable Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to procure a good Vnderstanding and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Letter it self is as follows.</p>

                  <head>An Abstract of a LETTER from a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Eminence and Worth in <hi>Caledonia</hi> to a Friend at <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Have received your kind Letter of the <hi>26</hi>th of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> last, and communicated it to the Gentlemen of the Council here; to whom your kind Sentiments and Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness were very acceptable.</p>
                  <p>Certainly the Work here begun is the most ripened, diges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the best founded, as to Privileges, Place, Time, and other like Advantages, that was ever yet begun in any part of the trading World. We arrived upon this Coast the first, and took possession the third of <hi>November</hi>: Our Situation is about two Leagues to the Southward of <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Island</hi> (by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> called <hi>Guarda</hi>) in one of the best and most defenceable Harbours perhaps in the World. The Country is healthful to a wonder, insomuch that our own Sick, which were many when we arrived, are now generally cured. The Country is exceeding fertil, and the Weather temperate: The Country where we are settled, is dry, and rising ground, Hills but not high; and on the sides, and quite to the tops, three, four or five foot good fat Mould, not a Rock or Stone to be seen. We have but eight or nine Leagues to a River, where Boats may go into the South-Sea. The Natives for fifty Leagues on either side are in intire friendship and correspondence with us; and if we will be at the pains, we can gain those at the greatest distance. For our Neighbour <hi>Indians</hi> are willing to be the joyful Messengers of our Settlement, and good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to their Country-men. As to the innate Riches of the Country, upon the first information, I always believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be very great; but now find it goes beyond all that ever I thought, or conceited in that matter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as we can understand, are very much surprized and alarm'd, and the more that it comes as a Thunder-clap upon them; having had no notice of us, until three days after our arrival. We have written to the President of <hi>Panama,</hi> giving him account of our good and peaceable Intentions, and to procure a good Vnderstanding
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66218:42"/>
and Correspondence; and if that is not condescended to, we are ready for what else he pleases. If Merchants should once erect Factories here, this place will soon become the best and surest Mart in all <hi>America,</hi> both for In-land and Over-land Trade. We want here Sloops and Coasting Vessels; for want of which, and by reason we have all hands at work in fortifying and filting our selves (which is now pretty well over) we have had but little Trade as yet; most of our Goods unsold. We are here a thousand one hundred Men, and expect Supplies every day. We have been exceeding unhappy in losing two Ministers who came with us from <hi>Scotland</hi>; and if <hi>New-England</hi> could supply us in that, it would be a great and lasting Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <p>A farther proof of the Falshood of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation is Capt. <hi>Pennicook</hi>'s Journal sent to the Company over <hi>England,</hi> and dated <hi>Decem.</hi> 28<hi>th,</hi> almost two months before this Letter to <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> wherein they give an account of the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had from several hands, that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> were marching with 900 men from <hi>Panama</hi> to attacque them by Land, whilst their Men of War were to attacque them by Sea; upon which they did all they could to put themselves in a posture of defence against them, so far were they from any design of marching towards <hi>Panama.</hi>

            <p>He goes on to tell us, <hi>That</hi> England <hi>had no reason to go to War with the</hi> Spaniards <hi>on the score of our Company, who besides all the Loss of their Trade, must throw away more</hi> English <hi>pounds (thrice over) than there</hi>'s Scotch <hi>in our Capital Stock; and he will leave it to any Man of half an ounce of Politicks to find out
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66218:43"/>
the Iest on't, save this Hot-headed Author of our Colony's Defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> and his Suborners may please to know, that we neither desir'd nor expected that <hi>England</hi> should go to War with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our Company; and had as little reason to expect that a Faction in <hi>England</hi> (for we will not be so unjust as to charge it upon the Nation) should go to War with us on account of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> before we could be heard in our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; we mean that Proclamations should have been publish'd in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> inferring that the King of <hi>England</hi> has a power to declare that to be a breach of the Peace that is done by the Authority of the King of <hi>Scotland</hi>; that they should thereby forbid their Subjects of <hi>England</hi> to entertain any Commerce with us, refuse us Provisions for Commodities in our distress, except we will bring our Ships under the Guns of their Fort at <hi>New-York</hi>; punish their Subjects for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Commerce with us, and threatning to lay the Commanders of our Ships in Irons if they offer to put in for Refreshment, or to refit after a Storm, as they did to Capt. <hi>Iamison</hi> at <hi>Nevis.</hi> That this wants very little of going to War with the <hi>Scots,</hi> we believe most thinking men are very well satisfied; but whether it be so or not, we will venture to tell the Renegado and his Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that by this kind of Procedure against the <hi>Scots,</hi> as if we were Servants and Subjects to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> some Gentlemen in and about <hi>White-hall</hi> have giv'n the <hi>Spaniards</hi> just occasion to make War upon <hi>England</hi> if they were able, or at least to make Reprisals upon the <hi>English</hi> for the damage they pretend to have suffer'd from the <hi>Scots,</hi> whom the <hi>English</hi> Court by this sort of Treatment have declar'd to be their Subjects; whereas if they had
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66218:43"/>
not invaded the Soveraignty of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could have had no such pretence. Now whether men that had been endow'd with a quarter of an ounce of Politicks would have been guilty of such a false step as this, let our Author's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orners determine. And besides, we must tell them, that the Men whom Capt. <hi>Long</hi> had set ashore with Capt. <hi>Diego</hi> in the Gulph of <hi>Darien,</hi> committed the first Hostility on the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and kill'd seven of them, with a design, for any thing we know, to trapan us into a War with the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> since one of the same Fellows came to our Colony afterwards for Powder and Shot, which our Men wisely deny'd them, and told them they had done what they could not justify.</p>
            <p>The Author of the Defence of the <hi>Scots</hi> Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dos no where advise the <hi>English</hi> to a War with <hi>Spain</hi> on the score of our Company; but gives such Arguments to prove that they had no reason to dread the Effects if <hi>Spain</hi> should make War with them on that Account, and that it was the Interest of <hi>England</hi> to have supported the <hi>Scots</hi> in that Settlement, as have not yet been aswer'd, and therefore we shall say nothing farther of it here.</p>
            <p>Our Author and his Friends are pleas'd to call our apprehensions of the Places being possess'd by the <hi>French</hi> bugbear Stories, because the <hi>French</hi> have another Game to play at present with <hi>Spain,</hi> or might have secur'd <hi>Carthagena</hi> when they had it in their Power; and that if <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> had any such design, they may go sit down within a League of either side of our Colony with as good a Title as ours.</p>
            <p>But that the <hi>French</hi> are generally wiser than to lay out their Mony upon such Tools as this Author appears to be by his way of arguing, one would
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66218:44"/>
be apt to think he had touch'd some <hi>Leuidor's.</hi> Does he conceive that the <hi>French</hi> understood their Interest so little during the War that threatned their Ruine, as to settle a Colony in the <hi>West-Indies</hi> at a time when they stood in more need of them at home to defend their own Country, and cultivate their Ground and Vineyards? Is it not known that their Design was on the <hi>Spanish</hi> Plate, in order to enable them to continue the War, and not on the <hi>Spanish</hi> Plantations, which they were in no Capacity to defend against the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and their Allies if they had at that time seiz'd any of them? Does our Author and his Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners think that <hi>L.</hi> XIV. did not understand his Interest better than to offer at a Settlement in the <hi>Spanish West-Indies,</hi> especially at a place of such Importance as <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and thereby have given the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> an opportunity of settling there themselves by coming to drive him out? Could he think that the two Nations of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> that have the greatest Naval Force, and were most concern'd of any to reduce him to reason, would sit still and suffer him to seize the <hi>Spanish</hi> Treasures, and by that means enable himself to bring all <hi>Europe</hi> under his Yoke? It is impossible such a thought could ever enter into his mind; and therefore he had very good reason to forbear keeping possession of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> since 'twould have been the ready way to have spoil'd his future pretensions to the <hi>West-Indies</hi> in case of the K. of <hi>Spain</hi>'s death, which every body then expected daily. And whenever it happens, if he die without Issue, as there's great odds he will, we stand in need of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Guarantees than <hi>H</hi>— and his Suborners, that the <hi>Fr.</hi> King will not seize the <hi>Spanish West-Indies</hi> and <hi>Darien</hi> into Boot; against which there are
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66218:44"/>
those who have studied Politicks as much as our Author, who are of opinion that the Settlement at <hi>Darien</hi> might have been no contemptible Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier.</p>
            <p>The Scribler takes upon him to pass his word for his Majesty that the <hi>Scots</hi> Crown will receive no blemish or disreputation by his wearing it. We believe his Majesty will scarcely thank him for his Security, and we are satisfied our Nation will as little rely on it. But at the same time we must tell this Gentleman and his Suborners, that we had as little reason to suspect that K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. who was a Native of <hi>Scotland,</hi> would have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour'd our Crown so far as to order it to be brought to <hi>England</hi>; and therefore it is not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for Princes to be over-perswaded by ill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to do such things as are inconsistent with the Honour of their Crowns. And thus some will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to say, that the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> was no ways honour'd, when the <hi>Dutch</hi> Troops took place of the King of <hi>Scots</hi>'s Guards; and when the King of <hi>England</hi> takes upon him to condemn by Proclamations what the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by Act of Parliament and Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>The Scribler comes next to give us a taste of his Skill in the <hi>Brittish</hi> History he brags of so much, by telling us the Fate of some great <hi>Scots</hi> Families that swell'd beyond their Proportion. His Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Cummins</hi> and <hi>Gouries</hi> sufficiently disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Ignorance of the <hi>Scotish</hi> History. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was indeed a very great Family, but are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auspicious instance for him and those of his kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, their ruin not being occasion'd by their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but by joyning with the Enemies of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this Renegado does.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:66218:45"/>As for his Application of his Instances, it serves to discover the malicious Designs of himself and Suborners against the two greatest Families that are now left in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The kind treatment this Author met with from one of these great Men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his arrival, after having deserted our Colony, would have oblig'd any but a Monster of Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to have forborn such a causeless and invenom'd Reflection, which nothing but ingrain'd Malice can suggest.</p>
            <p>We come in the next place to take a view of the Book it self. In the very first Page he owns <hi>he is no Friend to the</hi> Scots <hi>Company, and alledges he has more reason for it than those Skeletons that are starved to death.</hi> This we hope is sufficient to shew what credit is to be given to his Narrative, wherein tho he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to keep close to matter of Fact, he abounds with blasphemous and impertinent Digressions: One of the first we shall take notice of, is his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly Reflection on the City of <hi>London,</hi> pag. 3. <hi>as a place where Matter is never wanting to exercise plodding Heads.</hi> Which is so near a kin to the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Faction that in the late Reigns aim'd at the destruction of that Noble Emporium, which deserves to be the Mistress of the Universe, that we cannot in the least doubt but it proceeds from the same Spirit. Of the same nature is his reflection, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. upon the <hi>London</hi> Subscribers, who came in so fast to the <hi>Scots</hi> Company, <hi>that he thought himself the happiest man that could get his Name first down in our Books:</hi> Which is a plain demonstration that those eager Subscribers thought the Design no way prejudicial to the Interest of their Country; for upon enquiry it will be found, that most of them were such as had zealously appear'd for its Liberty in former Reigns.</p>

               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:66218:45"/>His malicious Reflection in that same Page, as if the Company had promis'd 20000 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>Paterson, Smith,</hi> and <hi>Lodg,</hi> to engage Subscriptions in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the <hi>Hans</hi>-Towns, is notoriously false: they had not one Farthing promis'd them, tho to be sure the Company would have rewarded them for their Pains and Service, as it was reasonable they should; besides, it appears by the eagerness of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hamburgers</hi> to subscribe, until they were prevented by their respective Governments, that there was no occasion for such a Bribe to bring in Subscriptions.</p>
            <p>His Reflection, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. of our printing the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress of the Commons at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but not the King's Answer, admitting it to be true, is so far from being criminal, that it rather argues the greatest respect imaginable for his Majesty, whom we would not lessen in the esteem of the People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who knew they had a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right to claim and expect his Protection. His owning in that same Page, that the Company's Books had not been long open'd in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> till 400000 <hi>l.</hi> was sign'd, and that all sorts of People (whom he is pleas'd to express under the scurrilous denomination of poor, blind and lame) crouded in with their Subscriptions, serves to confute his foregoing and following Reflections, <hi>That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was obliged to promise</hi> 20000 <hi>l. to procure Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, and to go where the Money lay,</hi> viz <hi>to</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and the</hi> Hans-<hi>Towns</hi>; especially since he owns himself, <hi>p.</hi> 10, 19. That <hi>they were baulk'd of their Subscriptions in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Holland, <hi>and had not one Groat of the</hi> Hamburgers <hi>Money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Reflection upon Mr. <hi>Paterson,</hi> pag. 8. whom he blasphemously calls <hi>the Man Paterson,</hi> alluding to the Apostles calling our Saviour <hi>the Man Christ,</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:66218:46"/>
is altogether false: he always propos'd the paying half the Subscriptions, and most of the Subscribers were resolved to pay the whole; as it appears they have already a considerable part of it, by their having sent away three Convoys, and being busy in preparing a fourth. His Irreligious and Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical temper appears further by his reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their expecting good Returns by the <hi>old Cant of God's Blessing,</hi> as if it were possible to look for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in any thing without the Divine Benediction, or ridiculous to express our dependency on it. But it seems his Suborners are resolv'd that our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall be huff'd, banter'd, and blasphem'd out of all their Rights as Men and Christians.</p>
            <p>His next Reflection, <hi>p.</hi> 9. of our sending Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to build six Ships of fifty Guns a piece at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> to prepossess the <hi>Dutchmen</hi> with a kind opinion of the Company, and thereby make it appear how willing we were to extend the warm Rays of our Octroy to people who deserv'd it better than our ungrateful Neighbours, is mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the highest degree. He and his Suborners very well know, that we could neither build nor buy in <hi>England,</hi> because of the opposition made to us there; and since 'tis known that they can build cheaper in <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> than in <hi>England,</hi> our offering first to lay out our Money with our Neighbours, and not going beyond Sea till we were compell'd to it, is a proof from his own Mouth, that we had no other but friendly Intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>English</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>His Insinuation of the Difference betwixt the Kirk and Church Parties, about each of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying their own Instruments, shews more Malice than Wisdom; since admitting People of different Perswasions into Companies is practised in all trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66218:46"/>
parts of the World, and particularly in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where the Dissenters have no small share in all their Funds and Companies: but by this they may see what fair Treatment they are to expect, if <hi>H — s</hi> and his Suborners could get their wills. The old Popish Maxim would soon be brought into practice, that no man should have Leave to buy or sell, but he that is of the public Religion.</p>
            <p>His next Story of our Debate about entrusting any man that was fed on <hi>English</hi> Beef and Pudding with 20000 <hi>l.</hi> for the use of our Delegates abroad, is equally scurrilous and false. We trusted no man but Mr. <hi>Paterson</hi> with that Money, and did not think it fit that every Subscriber, but that only a special Committee should know how that Money was to be imploy'd. Nor can this be charg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us as a piece of foolish Considence in Mr. <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> whom the Scribler owns <hi>P.</hi> 4. to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with laying the Foundation of the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> tho ill rewarded for it. His malicious Calumny, that Mr. <hi>Paterson</hi> did afterwards form the <hi>Darien</hi> Project to be reveng'd on the <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is sufficiently falsified by his and our first Offers to take in the <hi>English</hi> as joint Subscribers, after the said Project was actually form'd, and imparted to some select Heads, as he himself owns <hi>P.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Smith</hi>'s cheating us of 8500 <hi>l.</hi> it was our Misfortune, not our Crime, as is manifest from our Diligence in recovering 4500 <hi>l.</hi> of it. This Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's saying <hi>P.</hi> 11. that <hi>Smith</hi> deservedly bubled us, argues himself to be as great a Cheat as <hi>Smith</hi>; and there's little reason to doubt, but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded the Company as far as opportunity would allow him, when instrusted as Purser with their Stores from <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and elsewhere, which he seems to own himself when he boasts of his bringing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:66218:47"/>
home as much Gold-dust from <hi>Darien,</hi> as any of the Counsellors, <hi>P.</hi> 149.</p>
            <p>His Assertion <hi>P.</hi> 14. that Capt. <hi>Gibson</hi> was cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the 2 <hi>per Cent</hi> Commission Money, is a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Falshood; the Captain was satisfied, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded to his own content.</p>
            <p>The next proof we have of the Ingenuity of this Renegado and his Suborners, is <hi>P.</hi> 15. where he tells us that <hi>Paterson</hi> being in Drink, babbled out a Secret of the Company at <hi>Camphire,</hi> viz. <hi>That their Act empowered them to give Commissions to any kind of People (without asking their Nation) to trade to the</hi> Indies <hi>under</hi> Scots <hi>Colours; and that such People might dispose of their</hi> India <hi>Goods where they pleas'd, providing they made a sham Entry in</hi> Scotland. To say that this was a <hi>Secret of the Company,</hi> and in the same breath to inform the World that Mr. <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> said, <hi>they were impowered to do so by their Act,</hi> which was every where publick, and in print, is like the rest of the Libeller's Inconsistencies: But his Suborners and he were so far transported with Malice, that they resolv'd to dress our Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament throughout in the disguise of a Cheat, and charge it upon the Company as secret Intrigues, without ever considering that the Act it self would discover their Falshood and Malice. The Clause of the Act is as follows:
<q>And that the said Company may, by virtue hereof, grant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate such Rights, Properties, Powers and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, and permit and allow such sort of Trade, Commerce, and Navigation into their Plantations, Colonies, Cities, Towns, or Places of their Possession, as the said Company shall from time to time judg fit and convenient.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These being the very words of the Act, the <hi>Dutch</hi> could not be impos'd upon in that manner by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:66218:47"/>
Mr. <hi>Paterson,</hi> if he had been so minded; or had he been drunk, as the Libeller says, when he told the story, they must have been very weak men, that would offer to sign upon the words of a drunken man, without seeing the Act it self. It is not to be doubted but this Clause impowers the Company to allow such a Trade as <hi>H—s</hi> mentions; and therefore it might be proper enough for Mr. <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> to urge it as an Argument to engage Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: but that he could do it in these Terms that <hi>H—s</hi> here sets down, there's no ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and therefore his Answer to those that would not sign but on that bottom, <hi>that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had no occasion to make use of that Power at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> was very proper. The Story of the sham Entry in <hi>Scotland,</hi> paying 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and thereby underselling the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> 17 <hi>per Cent.</hi> is so void of all sense, that it would seem the Libeller and his Suborners were drunk when they suggested it. The Act does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed oblige such Ships as were imploy'd by the Company to break bulk in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but lays no such Obligation upon those that they might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power to trade to their Colony: And considering what has been already said of the Drawbacks, that the Cargo of the said Ships was Custom-free no where but in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession they were to pay 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> at least to the Company, how was it possible they could undersel the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> 17 <hi>per Cent.</hi> especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the vast Quantities that those two Companies buy at a time, and by consequence were like to have the prime Cost easier than our Infant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany?</p>
            <p>After all this sham Story, he happens to tell the main reason of the Miscarriage of our Design in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66218:48"/>
               <hi>Holland,</hi> and perhaps of its doing so in <hi>England. The</hi> Dutch East <hi>and</hi> West India <hi>Companies,</hi> says he, <hi>complain'd to the Lords of</hi> Amsterdam <hi>that the</hi> Scots <hi>Commissioners were designing the ruin of their Trade.</hi> Which by the way shews that the Project of an <hi>American</hi> Trade was discours'd of by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners; which the Libeller, it's probable, would not have mention'd, had not his Memory given him the slip, and that he forgot he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly told us that the <hi>Darien</hi> Project was still kept secret. Why then should the <hi>Dutch West-India</hi> Company be so much concerned at our taking Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions there, but that they knew we had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign on the Isthmus of <hi>America?</hi> and therefore their <hi>East-India</hi> Company knowing also, that we being once Masters of a good Settlement there, it would have abridg'd the way, and made Voyages speedier to <hi>China, Iapan,</hi> the <hi>Philippine</hi> Islands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where their Trade lies, they thought it might in time be dangerous for them, if that <hi>Isthmus</hi> should be possess'd by the Subjects of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> So that there's no reason to doubt but they found Interest enough at the West end of the Town to lay as many rubs in our way as was possible to be done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 17. The Libellers give us another Evidence of their Candor and Ingenuity, when they tell us,
<q>The <hi>Hamburghers</hi> knew nothing of <hi>Darien,</hi> but builded altogether on Ships laden with <hi>India</hi> Goods, whereof their City and Port was to be the Receptacle and Mart, whilst <hi>Paterson</hi> wanted only Mony to raise Forces to overrun <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru.</hi>
               </q>
But our Author and his Suborners ought to have consider'd, that since they have told us of the Fears of the <hi>Dutch West-India</hi> Company, we could easily infer, that the Project of the <hi>Isthmus</hi> could not be long conceal'd from the <hi>Hamburghers:</hi> That the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66218:48"/>
Act it self would satisfy the Subscribers there, that the Company's Ships must break bulk in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and therefore they could not expect to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle and Mart of our Stores: whatever they might hope for as to conveying the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize to the Inland Places of <hi>Germany,</hi> they could not but think that we had Shipping of our own to carry our Goods to the Ports on the <hi>Baltick</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Sea.</p>
            <p>In that same Page they give us another hint to confirm our Suspicion that it is more from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of our lessening the <hi>Dutch</hi> than the <hi>English</hi> Trade, that the Court have so violently oppos'd us, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>that the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> by joining with the <hi>Scots</hi> had a prospect of worming the <hi>Hollander</hi> out of a good part of the <hi>German</hi> Trade.</q>
Which admitting to be true, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had none but themselves to blame for it, since we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to take them in as joint Subscribers before we made any Proposal to the <hi>Hamburghers</hi>; nor is it any ways unreasonable in it self that <hi>Germans</hi> should have the preference of other Nations in trading with <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a great deal of prophane Banter and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculing the sacred Text, he tells us that the Human Reason of our Disappointment was an unnecessary Paragraph in our <hi>Octroy, which occasion'd a great many</hi> English <hi>and</hi> Holland <hi>Speculations,</hi> viz. <hi>That in case the Company should be interrupted in their Trade,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the King had ingaged to interpose the Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to do them right, and that at the public Charge</hi>; which, says he, <hi>Paterson</hi> and the rest insinuated in all Companies, <hi>That the King was to assist and defend them with his Ships of War, or otherwise, if there was occasion, and that out of his own Pocket, which they did not question to be</hi> English <hi>Coin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:66218:49"/>There's no reasonable Man will think it unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that a Prince should protect his Subjects in their Trade, either by his Men of War or otherwise; and therefore this being a Clause of the Act of Parliament, it was no ways unnecessary to be put into the Patent: and we will adventure to tell <hi>H</hi> — and his Suborners that they who advis'd his Majesty to refuse our Company the three Men of War built at our own Charge, when they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to be at the expence of maintaining them, have advis'd him to act contrary to the Trust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in him as King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and to contravene this very Act of Parliament, and that which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd those Ships to be built for defence of Trade; than which there cannot be a more false step in Government: for when once People perceive that Princes have no regard to the Laws made for the protection and welfare of the Subject, they will naturally think themselves absolv'd from such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their Allegiance, and support of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. That Mr. <hi>Paterson,</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny should insinuate from the <hi>Octroy</hi> that we were to be assisted or defended by <hi>English</hi> Men of War or Money, is nothing but a mixture of Falshood and Malice. The Libeller owns that the Words of our Act cannot bear it, and the World knows that our Parliaments never pretend to dispose of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Ships or Mony; and therefore no man of sense will believe this Renegado, when he says the <hi>Scots</hi> Company put that Gloss on the Text for their own advantage, since that had been directly to expose themselves. For we are not to suppose they could think the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Hamburghers</hi> so weak, as not to peruse the Act it self, which would soon have undeceived them: Therefore all those Reflections, which he pretends the <hi>English</hi> Traders to <hi>India</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:66218:49"/>
made upon it, must vanish of course, as having no manner of Foundation.</p>
            <p>Much less can they serve to justify the Memorial given in at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> by Sir <hi>Paul Ricaut</hi> against our taking Subscriptions there: Which Memorial, tho minc'd by our Libeller, yet ev'n as he represents it, is against the Law of Nations, and indeed scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconcileable to good sense; in the first place to call our Agents private Men, who acted by the Company's Authority, and according to Act of Parliament; and in the next place to suppose that the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> could possibly join with us in hopes of <hi>English</hi> Protection, when the Opposition made to us by the Court of <hi>England</hi> was known all over <hi>Europe:</hi> nay the Scribler himself owns, <hi>P.</hi> 17. <hi>That the more Opposition the</hi> English <hi>and</hi> Dutch <hi>offer'd to the Project, the more the</hi> Hamburghers <hi>thought it their Interest to embrace it.</hi> This is sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Suborners that the next time they hire a Scribler to belie the <hi>Scots</hi> Company, they must be sure to pitch upon one that has a better Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>His next Reflections <hi>P.</hi> 22, 23. <hi>That our Ships were neither fit for Trade nor War, that our Cargo was not proper, that our main Design was the Buccaneer Trade, that above</hi> 10000 l. <hi>was deficient of the first Payments, and most of the Subscribers not able to raise their</hi> Quota, are equally false with the rest. The Ships for their Burden and Size, are as fit either for Trade or War as any in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Cargo of Cloth, Stuffs, Shoes, Stockins, Slippers, and Wigs, must needs be proper for a Country where the Natives go naked for want of Apparel, and fit to be exchanged for other Commodities, either in the <hi>English, Dutch, French,</hi> or <hi>Spanish</hi> Plantations.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66218:50"/>
For Bibles we suppose our Libeller would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we had carried Mass Books; yet others will be of opinion, that 1500 of 'em was no unfit Cargo: Our own Colony might have dispens'd with that number in a little time; nor were they unfit to have been put into the hands of such of the Natives, especially of the younger sort, that might learn our Language. For Hoes, Axes, Macheet Knives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for our selves, and a Commodity much valued by the Natives. Fifteen hundred square Buccaneer Pieces, and proportionable Ammunition, was no such extraordinary Store for eleven or twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men: and whereas he maliciously insinuates that Buccaneering was our main Design, the Event hath prov'd it to be false; had that been our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, we might easily have invaded the <hi>Spanish</hi> Plantations at both ends of the <hi>Isthmus; Sancta Maria,</hi> nor <hi>Panama</hi> it self, could never have been able to withstand such a force, when a few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disciplin'd Buccaneers did so easily take them. It's well enough known there was a parcel of as brave Men that went with our Fleet as perhaps <hi>Great Britain</hi> could afford, many of 'em inur'd to War and Fatigues, and knew how to look an Enemy in the Face without being daunted. They had giv'n proofs enough of that in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where no men alive could fight with more Bravery and Zeal than they did for the Common Cause, tho some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have since thought fit to starve them. That there was above 10000 <hi>l.</hi> of the 100000 <hi>l.</hi> not paid in, is false; there was not above 2000 <hi>l.</hi> wanting. For those great men that thought their Countenance enough, and therefore refus'd to pay in their Subscriptions, he shall have our leave to name
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66218:50"/>
them; but perhaps his Suborners will not care to have their Friends so much expos'd. That most of the Subscribers were unable to raise their <hi>Quota,</hi> is demonstrably false, by our sending away two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys since, the thirds being greater by far than the first, and that we are now preparing a fourth. As to the Companies charging 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> advance on every Article of the 19000 <hi>l.</hi> Stock, it's well enough known that so much Advance is thought nothing in a <hi>West-India</hi> Trade; it was all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the Company was to have, and only charged in the Books by way of Formality, that the Colony might know what they were indebted to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>His Story, <hi>p.</hi> 23. of its being propos'd in the Company <hi>to sell off their Ships and Cargo, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Product amongst the Subscribers,</hi> is nothing to our dishonour, nor at all to be wondred at, considering the unreasonable opposition we had met with from Court. That <hi>we rejected it as inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> argues still that we are not so mean-spirited as he elsewhere represents us. His base Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>p.</hi> 24. on the Company, as if they had despair'd of the design, and sent their men to Sea on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to perish; and on <hi>Drummellier, that he order'd the Colony to get Mony honestly if they could, but be sure to get it; and if they came home without it, then the Devil get them all,</hi> serve only to discover his own Temper, and that he thinks all men act and speak like himself. We have said enough already to demonstrate the Honesty of both Company and Colony: Had their design been to get Mony with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to Honesty, they would not have been starv'd to death by the Proclamations, and other opposition made them at Court; they could quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66218:51"/>
have possessed themselves of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Mines, which the Scribler owns, <hi>p.</hi> 164. were within twelve Leagues of them, and with much more ease of the 40000 <hi>l.</hi> that was sunk in the <hi>French</hi> Ship. But he serves the Suborners for their Mony much at the same rate he did the <hi>Scots</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>His Reflection <hi>p.</hi> 25. that Mr. <hi>Stratford</hi> was oblig'd to arrest our Ships at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> for 800 <hi>l. Flemish,</hi> as they were fitting out, serves only to discover his own malice and folly; Mr. <hi>Stratford</hi> had very good Security for 800 <hi>l. Flemish</hi> when he had four Ships in Port not yet fitted out; and his receiving his Mony in a fortnight or three weeks, as the Libeller owns in the same Paragraph, shows he had no ill Paymasters to deal with. It were well for <hi>England</hi> if all those that have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Royal Navy could say as much by his Suborners and their Friends. As for our discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Stratford</hi> to be any longer our Cashier, there's no need of assigning any other Cause for it, but that Sr. <hi>Paul Ricaut</hi>'s Memorial render'd it needless; and to that same account we must charge the two Ships that were left there to rot in their Ouse. But at the same time we will tell him we had no great reason to be satisfied with Mr. <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s Conduct, and believe we have less now than ever since this Libeller defends him.</p>
            <p>His Story <hi>p.</hi> 26. of Mr. <hi>Henderson</hi>'s arresting another of our Ships for 3000 <hi>l.</hi> is sufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd by himself, when he tells us, that he and his Partners fail'd in their Subscriptions, which was a just debt due to the Company, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had reason to demand and expect it, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially he being a <hi>Scots</hi>-man: yet the Company
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66218:51"/>
dealt very kindly with him on that account; and so much the more, that they consider'd his being a Residenter in <hi>Holland,</hi> where he was liable both to the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Court, to whose account the Libeller must also charge this Affront, and the Loss we sustain'd at <hi>Amsterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What he says of our Seamen, <hi>p.</hi> 27, 28. is a manifest untruth. They were immediately paid, extreamly well satisfied; and we had such choice of able Seamen who were willing to go in the Expedition, that we turn'd several ashoar after they had embarqu'd, as having no occasion for them. As to his Reflection on Mr. <hi>Robert Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> for pinching them of their Wages, and <hi>p.</hi> 46. for cheating them as to their Provisions; that Gentleman is now at <hi>London,</hi> where we leave <hi>H—s</hi> and him to account for it. We doubt not but Mr. <hi>Blackwood</hi> may have Justice done him in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-hall</hi> if he thinks fit to sue for it; but so much we think our selves oblig'd to say in his Vindication during his absence, that he was never charg'd with any such thing by the Company.</p>
            <p>His next Reflections on the Transfer, <hi>p.</hi> 29. by which he would impose on the World as if it had been a Trick of the Company to cheat the Seamen of their Wages, are so much the less to be credited, that he himself is a Party, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd the Suit he talks of in <hi>Doctors Commons</hi>; which tho that Court may perhaps have determin'd in his favour, because the Bargain was made with him in <hi>London,</hi> and those that made it were on the Spot, and for other Causes best known to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, it is nothing at all to the matter in hand; our Courts have no reason to take them for a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and our Company has as little to allow the Libeller any Wages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:66218:52"/>But to come to the Transfer, which he so foully misrepresents. It was so far from being a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine practice, that it was agreed on in publick Council, and but highly reasonable that the Colony should be accountable to the Company for the Stock they intrusted them with. The Libeller on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betrays his own Folly and Malice, and imposes upon his Suborners, when he says the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who gave their joint Bond to the Company for 70000 <hi>l.</hi> were not worth so many English Pence; for, admitting they had not been worth one penny of personal Estate, they were intrusted by the Company with 19000 <hi>l.</hi> Cargo, and Ships, Provisions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to make it up 70000 <hi>l.</hi> which was not charg'd upon them as their personal Debt, but upon the Colony as a Corporation, till the same was paid. What he says as to the Seamen is a malicious Untruth. It was indeed agreed that the Colony should pay them; but if they did not, the Company was to do it: and besides, the two months advance which the Libeller owns was paid them, the Company was to pay to them, or to those that had their Powers, or Letters of Attorny, a Month in six, and have accordingly paid them. As to the Seamens being made believe that assoon as they had set the Landmen on shoar, they were to proceed on a trading Voyage, and return to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to be paid, it is equally false, they being to stay out whilst the Company pleas'd.</p>
            <p>Then as to the Transfer in general, it was so far from being clandestine, or a Trick, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was impower'd to make it by the Act of Parliament which gave them their Original, as any Person may see by turning to the Act it self,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66218:52"/>
which authorizes them to <hi>transfer their joint Stock, or Capital Fund, or any Estate real or personal, Ships, Goods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>belonging to the Company, under such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions, Rules, Conditions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as the said Company shall by writing in and upon their Books,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Landmen, whom he will also have to be impos'd upon, they knew what they had to relie on, and were very well satisfied with it; and as to the Companys levying Souldiers under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Planters, without asking leave of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Council, admitting it to be true, they are not at all to be blam'd for it, since they had no reason to think that the Faction at Court, which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traven'd Acts of Parliament by opposing their Subscriptions, and denying them the Men of War built for the protection of our Trade, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to levy Souldiers under that Name. But the truth of the matter is this, they were really design'd for Planters, and not at all for Military Business; tho it was highly necessary the Colony should have as many Officers and disciplin'd Men as they could, that they might be the more able to defend themselves in case of Attaque: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his railing against the Colony for offering to punish Deserters and other Criminals, <hi>pag.</hi> 31. on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovers his own ignorance and malice; for by the Act of Parliament they had the whole Power, Civil and Military, conferr'd upon them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly might exercise their Power upon all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons belonging to the Company as they saw cause; so that this is again a libelling of the Act of Parliament thro the Company's sides.</p>
            <p>His Representation of the seven Men chosen for Counsellors, <hi>page</hi> 34. is false and malicious to the highest degree. The liberty given to add other
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66218:53"/>
six to those seven, was not, as he spitefully insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates, for <hi>English</hi> or <hi>French</hi>-men of Substance that should join them from the <hi>West-India</hi> Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but for such of their own number as they might think fit to assume afterwards. It cannot once enter into the thoughts of any man of sense, that the Colony should at first entrust Foreigners, and especially <hi>French</hi> Papists in their Government, or that the Company had any design they should do so; but he and his Suborners think it their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to make us odious to the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> by accusing us of a design to drain their Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
            <p>As to Mr. <hi>Paterson,</hi> whom he hath all along a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd, he happens now thro Inadvertency to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate him from his own Calumnies; he formerly charg'd him as being Partner with <hi>Smith</hi> in cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Company of 8500 <hi>l.</hi> and now he tells us that Mr. <hi>Paterson</hi> was brought to this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> either to go aboard the Fleet bound for <hi>Caledonia</hi> as a Volunteer, or to go to Prison at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for Debt; which, had he cheated the Company of so much Mony as this Libeller pretends there had been no occasion for, he might have paid his Debts, and gone where he would: and besides, the Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler vindicates the Company at the same time from his former Charge of their being bewitch'd by <hi>Paterson</hi>'s golden Dreams, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for had they relied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so much upon him as the Libeller alledges, they would never have shew'd that indifference for him which here he ridicules him with. Such has been the hard Fate of the Suborners, that their Tool has not the sense to make his Evidence consistent, but every where cuts his own Throat by Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:66218:53"/>To sum up the Matter according to the Libeller's own Evidence. In the Council there were some Men of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that had been bred to the Sword and the Law, others had been Officers both by Sea and Land, and some that had gain'd Experience in Merchandizing, and several Trades.</p>
            <p>His Banter on the death of the Ministers and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous abuse of Scripture, <hi>P.</hi> 37. smell so rank of the Atheist and Libertine, and do so evidently prove that he hath lost all sense of Humanity and Religion, that we are satisfied it will do his Masters and their Cause more hurt than Service; and therefore we pass it over.</p>
            <p>The next Proof we have of his Falshood and Malice, is his long Story about Mr. <hi>Wafer,</hi> from <hi>Page</hi> 38 to 45, wherein he does so blend Truth with Falshood, as shews he had a mind at any rate to bespatter the Reputation of the Committee of the Company: the said Committee knew nothing of those Gentlemens treating with <hi>Wafer</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> till they acquainted them with it, and it was only upon their Recommendation that they sent for him: As to their Collecting any Guineas at <hi>Pontack</hi>'s for Mr. <hi>Wafer,</hi> it is altogether false. The Articles were drawn by Mr. <hi>Iames Campbel</hi> the Merchant, now in <hi>London,</hi> and wrote by Mr. <hi>Fitz Gerald</hi> an Irish Merchant, who both can testify that this Matter is foully misrepresented; for Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> had an Alternative propos'd to him, which he agreed to, <hi>viz.</hi> to have so much if the Company thought fit to imploy him, and so much for his trouble and pains if they did not; the Company was so far from standing in any need of his Book, that they had a Manuscript of it before ever they saw him, which was altogether unknown to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that treated with him at <hi>London</hi>; this he himself knows to be true, and that to his no small surprize, they repeated several Passages out of it to him, and indeed the Manuscript is more particular than his Book, whatever Cause he hath since had to make any Alterations in it we know not. The Company upon the whole, finding that he could inform them of no thing considerable more than what was in the Manuscript, and that he could do them no great Service, left him at his Liberty to publish his Book when he pleas'd, gave him about 100 <hi>l.</hi> first and last for his Pains and Expence, with which he was very well
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66218:54"/>
satisfied, and hath declared several times since that the Company dealt very honourably with him, tho Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> took a great deal of pains to make him publish a Memoire to the contrary, which by his honest Friend Mr. <hi>Fitz Gerald</hi>'s Advice he desisted from doing. As to the Libeller's malicious Insinuation that they had no further Service for him when once he had discovered the place where the <hi>Nicaragua-Wood</hi> grew, It is absolutely false, for the Manuscript they had was very particular in that. This Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> knows to be true, and if he have but a just resentment, he is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd to vindicate himself; for, the Libeller reflects as much upon him as upon the Company, when he charges him with putting a Cheat upon them, as to their <hi>Nicaragua-Wood, P.</hi> 44. which <hi>H—s</hi> says he and others went in search of for several Miles along the Ceast, but could find none; and yet he magnifies <hi>Wafer</hi>'s Freedom, and being ingenious by informing them so particularly, as to the place where the <hi>Nicaragua-Wood</hi> grew, <hi>P.</hi> 41. So perpetually does this malicious Libeller contradict himself. — As to the other parts of his Story of Mr. <hi>Wafers</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd near <hi>Haddington,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; it was no more than what Prudence would have directed any Men to do in the like Circumstances: the Company not knowing till after having discours'd him whether he could do them any Service or not; it was not their Wisdom to expose him to publick View; and having sound that he could not serve them, it was equally prudent in them to keep him at an uncertainty as to their design; they being under no obligation to acquaint him with it. As to the Story of Admiral <hi>Bembo</hi>'s waiting their motion; if they did say so, the Event hath made it but too probable; he hath waited so long in those Parts till our Colony hath left <hi>Darien:</hi> what Orders he had concerning it, or what Part he hath acted in it, Time must determine; but if all that we have heard of large Bills being return'd him, and of his Offers by his Sloops to draw our Men from our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony be true, there's reason to suspect that he was sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with no design for our advantage: However that may be we know not; but this we know, that if our Enemies at Court had been as zealous to protect us as they have been to ruin us the Admiral would certainly have had Orders to have made Reprisals on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for detaining
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:66218:54"/>
Capt. <hi>Pincarton</hi> his Ship and Men, contrary to Treaty with the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> when forc'd a-shoar by a Storm under the Walls of <hi>Carthagena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He tells us, <hi>P.</hi> 45,
<q>That two thirds of the Provision were spent e're the Fleet sail'd, that there was none to be had in <hi>Scotland</hi> at that time, and if there had, there was no Money; the 100000 <hi>l.</hi> being sunk, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's Credit not worth 2 <hi>d.</hi> and that they had stuck there, had it not been for some few Pillars of the <hi>Scots</hi> Company who mortgag'd their Estates; for which the Company made over three of their Ships to them for their Security.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That there was no Provisions to be had then in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> will readily be allow'd him, is sufficient to answer all his malicious Clamour against the Company, and to confute his own Objection, <hi>P.</hi> 155. in defence of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, against the Company, for not sending them Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. That there was no Money, and that the Company's Credit was not worth 2 <hi>d.</hi> is confuted by himself, when he owns that a few of the Pillars rais'd 5000 <hi>l.</hi> and took three of the Company's Ships for Security. For that a few of the Pillars could raise 5000 <hi>l.</hi> and the Company have three new Ships, one of them of 70 Guns to give for Security; and yet the Company's Credit not to be worth 2 <hi>d.</hi> is a palpable Contradiction.</p>
            <p>That any of the Company Mortgaged their Estates to raise Money, is false; they advanc'd it on their own Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, as they might well do, it being well known there are several of them who have as much yearly Estate as the Sum he speaks of: Nor did they desire the Company's Ships in security, but only a Bond which it was reasonable they should have.</p>
            <p>He comes next to give us an Account of the shortness of the Provisions, <hi>P.</hi> 46. and of his own Honesty in the mean time, in not acquainting the Commadore with it till they were three days at Sea; perhaps he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezel'd them himself, or Pocketed some of the Money, for he own that he had some time before been concerned in the Victualling part, and therefore dar'd not to say any thing of it on Shore, left it might have been prov'd upon him; but however that is, this we are sure of, that the Company had Letters from their Ships at the <hi>Mideras,</hi> that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66218:55"/>
they had Twelve Months Provisions of all sorts, at sharp Allowance, and that if any thing fell short, it was likely to be their Bread: That they thought this to be true, may be reasonably concluded from his own Narrative, where he says the Council upon his Representation, design'd to send an Express from the <hi>Orkneys,</hi> to acquaint the Company with the shortness of their Provisions, which to be sure they would have done, had they been sensible that they were so short as he alledges: Besides, he owns they had full Eleven Months Allowance of Stock-fish at four Days in the Week; whence it is probable that they had other things in proportion.</p>
            <p>The Reason why they had no more Beer but Ten Tun, was that the Seamen could not depend on the Beer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it spoils, they had great store of very good Water, and a very great quantity of Brandy which the Libeller takes no notice of. As for the Company's promising them Credit at the <hi>Maderas,</hi> it is false; nor was there any need of it, they had Pipe Staves and other Goods, which were thought proper for the <hi>Maderas,</hi> but if it did not answer so well as 'twas expected, 'twas but the common Misfortune of Merchants, who many times meet with such disappointments. Nor is it to be expected that a Nation of so little Experience in Trade as ours, should at first setting out, be free from Mistakes or Mismanagement, especially since we have such Invective Enemies to deal with, who make it their business to get ill Men amongst us every where, on purpose to break our Design.</p>
            <p>His next Reflection is on the small Allowance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money, which is sufficiently answer'd when we tell him their Cargo was reckon'd instead of it, and as has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy said, must needs be conceiv'd to be very proper for a Country where People go naked for want of Apparel. They had a great deal of Butter, and excellent Beef, of Scots Breed, by which we gain'd an Experiment contrary to the common Notion; for upon trial it was found to be better than the Irish, and therefore our Men resolv'd to keep it last. His Objection as to its having been Eighteen Months in Salt is frivolous. Seamen think nothing of that, when they can carry Beef to the <hi>East Indies</hi> and back again, and keep it good all the while. His Charge upon <hi>Drummelier</hi> as having bought damnified Wheat for their
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66218:55"/>
Bread, and put the Money in his Poket, is malicious and false: There's no Man but one of the Renegadoes Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that can suspect that Worthy Gentleman to be capable of any such thing. Besides, the Bread was extraordinary good.</p>
            <p>His Story, p. 50. about <hi>Crab-Island,</hi> is false; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany gave no positive Orders to leave any Men there, and its equally false that the <hi>Danes</hi> prevented our taking Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it, our Men were there before the <hi>Danes</hi> came from Sr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Governour of which suspecting our Design, upon the arrival of the <hi>Vnicorn</hi> there, sent an Officer and Fifteen Men to Assert the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Right, after our Men went off from the Place, they saw the Danish Sloop in another Bay of the same Island call'd <hi>French-Man</hi>'s <hi>Bay,</hi> and a Tent ashore with Danish Colours on it; upon which Captain <hi>Pennicook</hi> Landed again, told them we were Possessed before them, against which they offer'd their Protest to please the Court of <hi>Denmark,</hi> but wish'd with all their Hearts we might settle there, for we should be a good Bulwark to them against the Spaniards of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to-Rico,</hi> who are very troublesome Neighbours.</p>
            <p>It is false what he says p. 54. That Captain <hi>Andreas,</hi> after looking upon us at first Landing, did not come near us in three or four Weeks, for he came aboard us at first with some of his Men on the 2d of <hi>November,</hi> and brought his Travelling Wife with him on the 3d of <hi>November,</hi> when he came on Board again, and was very well satisfied with us: and on the 10th of the same Month, he and his Son, Wife and Sister, Din'd on Board us. And on the 30th of <hi>November</hi> he was invited on Board, handsomly Treated, and after having given a Rational Vindication of himself, as to the Matter suggested against him by the other <hi>Darien</hi> Captains or Princes; and being inform'd of our real De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, which before he suspected to be Piracy, he desir'd a Commission from us, which was readily Granted and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Accepted; and he solemnly promis'd to Defend us to the last drop of his Blood. That his Commission was left behind him in the Locker of the Round-House, cram'd in amongst empty Bottles, we have nothing but this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negado's Word for it: but admitting it to be so, it does not therefore necessarily follow, that it was left there by <hi>Andreas,</hi> or his Order; it is not to be suppos'd that a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:66218:56"/>
Person of his Note, could creep into the Round-House un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discover'd: and perhaps it may be no unreasonable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, to think that it was stole from him, and lodg'd there by this Renegado; for he owns that it was himself that found it, and he knows the Proverb, <hi>He that hides knows best where to find.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Story about <hi>Andreas</hi>'s <hi>Exit, P.</hi> 60. That he fell, or was thrown down the Main Hatch-way of the <hi>Caledonia</hi> in the Night time, after a Quarrel with <hi>Ambrosio,</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of those <hi>Indian</hi> Captains, has such an Air of Malice and Falshood, that it requires better Evidence than that of a self-contradicting Libeller, before it can obtain belief with any Rational Man, or allowing it to be true, that he was actually tumbled down the Hatch-way in the Night time, it looks more like the Practice of such a Quarrelsome ill natur'd Person as himself, than of any Body else. They that know his Behaviour to his own Captain, when he was Surgeon on Board one of the King's Ships, his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with Captain <hi>Pennicook,</hi> Commadore of our Ships that went to <hi>Darien,</hi> and the whole Tenor of his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, cannot think this any uncharitable Reflection. His unnatural Rancor against his Native Country, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Malice against the <hi>Scots</hi> Company, make it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable enough that he might do such a thing on purpose to render the Natives Enemies to the Colony, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted himself about a Month after: And this is so much the more probable, because he exclaims against those on Board, for not taking care of <hi>Andreas,</hi> nor letting him blood after his fall, since none was so proper to do it as himself, who was a Surgeon, and on Board the Ship at the time.</p>
            <p>It is needless to insist any further on his Train of Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods and Inconsistencies in his Account of the Country, which being contrary, not only to all that have wrote of it, but also to the Journals and Letters sent from our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. We have better reason to say, that his Description is Calculated to the Humour of our Enemies, and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orners, than that the Colony's and Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi>'s Accounts were Calculated to the Meridian of the <hi>Scots</hi> Company. To put this Matter out of all doubt, we stall here subjoin the first Letter sent from <hi>Caledonia</hi> by the Council of the Colony to the Company, which is the Testimony of six against one.</p>

                     </gap>k. The account of the remaining part of our Voyage, together with the most material Transactions since, you may know by the enclosed Iournal or Diary of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
                  <p>We now send you our Letters and Dispatches by Mr. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Hamilton</hi> Merchant, who takes the opportunity of pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you by the way of <hi>Jamaica</hi> over <hi>England,</hi> to whom we desire you would order Forty Shillings Sterling to be paid Weekly, towards his Expences, during the time he shall stay with you negotiating our Affairs.</p>
                  <p>The Wealth, Fruitfulness, Health and good Situation of the Country proves for the better, much above our greatest Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which God Almighty seems to have wonderfully reserv'd for this Occasion, and now to have prepar'd our Way, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the <hi>Indies</hi> to that purpose. In our Passage hither seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of our Number have been taken from us by Death (whose Names we have herewith sent you) and whereof the loss of our two Ministers is the most sensible to us. We therefore intreat you would use your utmost endeavours with the General Assembly, for procuring others so supply that great want: As to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we find it very healthful; for although we arriv'd here in the Rainy Season, from which we had little or no shelter for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Weeks together, and many Sick among us, yet they are so far recover'd, and in so good a State of Health as could hardly any where be expected among such a number of Men together; nor know we any thing here of those several dangerous and mortal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers so prevalent in the English and other American Islands.</p>
                  <p>In Fruitfulness this Country seems not to give place to any in the World: For we have seen several of the Fruits, as <hi>Cocoa-Nuts,</hi> whereof Chocolate is made, <hi>Bonellos, Sugar-Canes, Maize, Oranges, Plantains, Mangoe, Yams,</hi> and several others, all of them of the best of their kind any where found.</p>
                  <p>Nay there is hardly a Spot of Ground here but what may be cultivated: For even upon the very tops and sides of the Hills and Mountains, there is commonly three or four foot deep of rich
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66218:57"/>
Earth, without so much as a Stone to be found therein. Here is good Hunting and Fowling, and excellent Fishing in the Bays and Creeks of the Coast; so that could we improve the Season of the Year just now begun, we should soon be able to subsist of our selves; but fortifying and building will lose us a whole Years planting.</p>
                  <p>By the want of Sloops, or small Coasting Vessels, we have hitherto had no opportunity of disposing any part of the Cargo, or doing other needful things.</p>
                  <p>Since the loss of the French Ship mentioned in the Iournal, we understand that the Captain had an underhand Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in tampering with some of the Natives whom he intended to carry away with him, which hightens our Iealousy that the French have a design upon this Place, or at least to make a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement hereabout. And we heartily wish that our Most Gracious King were truly informed of what Consequence it will be both to his Greatness and Security, to countenance and encourage us his Loyal and Dutiful Subjects here, that our Prince and Country be not only depriv'd of so valuable a Iewel, but least the same should fall a Prey to some of our Rival Neighbours. This will be the Companies part to notice after these Dispatches shall come to hand,</p>
                  <p>You have inclosed a List of several Goods and Merchandises vendable and proper for this Place; our Situation being incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable for the Trade of the Coast, where (besides our Inland Trade) there is commonly but <hi>2</hi> or <hi>3,</hi> or at most but <hi>8</hi> or <hi>10</hi> days sail to the best Places of Trade upon the Coast, and to the outmost considerable Islands adjoining. And we desire that particular Merchants in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and elsewhere, may be incouraged to trade and correspond hither; in which we hope they will suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently find their Account.</p>
                  <p>We have also sent you a state of what Supplies of Provisions, Stores, and Merchant Goods are absolutely necessary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent support of the Colony; referring it to the Company to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what reasonable Consideration they will have for the Sums that shall be advanced for that purpose: And we entreat, that all possible Expedition may be us'd in sending us these needful Supplies; for without that we shall not only be incapable of making you suteable Returns, but this hopeful Vndertaking, together with our selves will run no small risque of being inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably lost. But however it be (by the help of God) we shall not fall to do our utmost in making speedy and suteable Returns;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66218:57"/>
and shall always account it our greatest Honour to expose our Persons, and all that's most near and dear unto us, in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this hopeful Design, as not only promising Profit and Glory to the Company, and all who are concern'd with them, but as being the likeliest means that ever yet presented towards the inabling our Countrymen to revive, recover, transmit to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the Virtue, Lustre, and wonted Glory of their Renown'd Ancestors: And to lay a Foundation of Wealth, Security, and Greatness to our Mother Kingdom for the present and succeeding Ages. In which we can no way doubt of your most hearty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and utmost Support. So praying Almighty God would bless and prosper the Company in all their Vndertakings. We Remain,</p>

            <p>This being from Men who knew the Misrepresentation of the Affair, must needs Issue in their own Ruin, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be suspected the disingenuity; and therefore must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly over-balance the Evidence of a Renegado, who owns that he writes out of Malice.</p>
            <p>The first defence he puts in the Company's Mouth is, their being baulk'd of Foreign Subscriptions, which made them lose Time and Money, whereby they could not send out such a number of Men and quantity of Provisions as the Project would have required. This is litterally true, let <hi>H—s</hi> and his Suborners answer it if they can. As for his Question, Why did they prodigally throw away 50000 <hi>l.</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> purely to make a Blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:66218:58"/>
there; and why did they trust to another Man's Purse till such time as they are sure of it? We shall answer by asking him another Question, <hi>viz.</hi> Since he pretends to know the Secrets of the West end of the Town, why did our Government oppose our taking Foreign Subscriptions, since they had impowered us by Acts of Parliament, and Letters Pattent to take them, and since 'twas such a thing as the like perhaps was never done; what reason had we to suspect being baulk'd of our Foreign Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? He himself own'd that the Hollanders and Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers were fond of our Project, till our Government oppos'd us; and therefore, by his own Confession, they are to blame for those disappointments. As to our taking Subscriptions in <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> We had reason to engage as many of our Protestant Neighbours in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign as we could, that we might be the more able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our selves in case of Opposition; which is neither ill Policy, nor inconsistent with Honesty.</p>
            <p>The 2d Defence he puts in their Mouth, That their Ships were Man'd, no Provisions to be had in <hi>Scotland,</hi> more were providing abroad, and no more Money to be had from the Subscribers till once the Ships were Sail'd, is such as he and his Suborners will never be able to answer; What could the Company do more, than take care to have Provisions abroad, when none were to be had at home? And if the Subscribers would pay no more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney till the Ships put to Sea, there was a necessity of Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His Objection as to the shortness of their Provisions, we have answer'd already, and shall add which he mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously conceals; That we sent a Ship with Provisions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, which was cast away in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> for which we cannot be answerable; and he himself owns we sent another Convoy in <hi>May</hi>; Then since the Colony sent us Advice from the <hi>Maderas,</hi> dated <hi>Aug.</hi> 29. That they had still 8 Months large, and twelve Months short Allowance: The Company cannot justly be accus'd of supine Neglect, when they sent away one Ship with Provisions four Months after this notice, and two more in five Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, considering that they had no Provisions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the Libeller himself owns; and that the Colony had a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go which might have bought them Provisions either from the Natives, if they had any to spare, which we could not doubt of by Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi>'s Description, or from the English Colonies, had it not not been for the Proclamation, which
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66218:58"/>
we had no reason to suspect would be issued at all, and much less in such a manner, in the Name of our own Prince, who was oblig'd to Protect us.</p>
            <p>To the Causes he assigns for the Sailing of our Fleet without a greater quantity of Provisions, we shall add one more, <hi>viz.</hi> That we had reason to fear that our Enemies might prevent us; which Captain <hi>Long</hi>'s being on those Coasts a Month before us, shews was not without Ground; no more than our Suspicion, that endeavours were used to surprize us into a War with the Spaniards, by <hi>Long</hi>'s Men killing seven of them, as hath been already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; and of his doing all he could to make us odious to the Natives, by telling them we were Pirates, and disobliging both <hi>Ambrosio</hi> and <hi>Diego,</hi> by sordid little Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his own, as Captain <hi>Pennicook</hi> gave us an Accoun in his Journal. A Grave Member of the Committee of Trade can give a more full Account of this, if he pleases; and when his hand is in, he would do well to assign us a Reason why that barbarous Murder committed by <hi>Long</hi>'s Men, was never yet taken notice of by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, since they have published such angry Memorials against us, who committed no Hostilities upon them.</p>
            <p>His Objection to the third and fourth Reason relating to the Honesty of our Design, and the Cargoes not being proper, we have answer'd already. As for that of our Goods being seizable in <hi>Iamaica</hi> and other English Plantations, by the Act of Navigation, it's one of the Hardships we justly complain of, that was put upon us by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our Nation in <hi>Charles</hi> II's Reign. But allowing it to be reasonable, it cannot have so much Equity in it, as the Laws which make it punishable by Death, to Rob and Murder. Yet the Execution of those are many times dispenc'd with in favour of Criminals, by his Majesty; and indeed a Power to dispence with the Execution of Law sometimes, to save the Life of a Subject, is one of the most Innocent Branches of the Prerogative; but we had much more reason to have expected a Dispensation in this Case, to save the Lives of so many of his Subjects, who had generously venter'd them for himself.</p>
            <p>His owning, <hi>p.</hi> 148. and 154. That a Cargo of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions brought by two <hi>Iamaica</hi> Sloops, was bought by the Colony, besides as many Turtle as came to 100 and odd Pounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for which he owns the Colony paid 'em; not only
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66218:59"/>
contradicts what he says almost in the same breath, <hi>That there was neither Money no Moneys worth to be had in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony</hi>; and that they laid out all their Stock of Ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for Wine at <hi>Maderas, p.</hi> 48. but may, together with their having both Provisions and Money when they came to <hi>New York,</hi> justly confirm our Suspicion, that there was a Mismanagement of the Provisions; since two Sloop's Cargo of Provision, 27 Pipes of Wine, 100 Pounds worth of Turtle, the Fish Plantains, Bonanoes, Potatoes, Indian Corn, Sojours, or Land Crabs, which he says were plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful at first' added to their former Provisions which they own'd they had at the <hi>Maderas</hi>; together with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of their Number of Men by Death was not enough to keep their Colony from starving for Nine Months. We have still the more reason to suspect this, because the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from <hi>New York,</hi> which brought us the first certain Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Disaster of our Colony, hinted as if <hi>there might be some Work for the Hangman.</hi> That there were more ill Men in the Colony than <hi>H—s</hi> is probable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: and particularly that <hi>Pennicook</hi> was brib'd to raise Divisions in the Colony, and put all in disorder by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence: which falling in with the Proclamations that were concerted for our Destruction, gave a handle to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ill Men to foment the Divisions, and compleat the Ruin of the Colony by a total Desertion.</p>
            <p>His Insinuation, <hi>P.</hi> 154, That two <hi>Iamaica</hi> Sloops with Provisions return'd from the Colony without breaking bulk, because there was neither Money nor Market Goods there; deserves better Evidence than his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it obtain Credit. We have indeed heard of one Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel with Provisions, which insisted on such extravagant Rates, that the Colony would not incourage them to do the like in time to come; and therefore would not deal with them: hoping that their own Convoy might speedily come up; but this was before they knew any thing of the Ploclamation, which cut off all their future hopes, ev'n from <hi>Scotland.</hi> We have also Letters from <hi>New York,</hi> that the Government of that Place seem'd to intend them no good; of which their desiring our Ships to come and Anchor under the Guns of the Castle, is a clear Proof; and the reason of this unkind Treatment is also explain'd to us, <hi>viz.</hi> That they suspected our Men had a design to return back as soon as they got Provisions. Nay, we
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66218:59"/>
have had advice, that their Gold Dust was actually refus'd at <hi>Iamaica,</hi> because of the Proclamations which we have reason enough to believe: since we cannot think that the Inhabitants there would be willing to incurr the height of His Majesty's Displeasure to oblige the Scots. That our Men had Gold Dust from the Natives for Powder, Shot, and speckled Shifts: the Libeller owns himself, <hi>P.</hi> 149, and there he brags of it, that he brought off more him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at 3 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Ounce, (how he came by it, is worth the inquiry) than most of the Councellors that are come home since; and by Letters from <hi>New York,</hi> we have heard there was Money amongst them: By all which 'tis evident, That want of Money or Goods was not the sole Cause of their being denied Provisions from the English Plantations. His Insinuation, that the French and Dutch Islands would have supplied us if we had had Money or Goods, is ridiculous; when the Government of both those Nations had so expresly declared themselves against us.</p>
            <p>His Allegation in that same Page, that His Majesty knew nothing of the Colonies Settlement at <hi>Darien,</hi> but what he had at second hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till the Spanish Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur told him from his Master, is so notoriously false, that none but a Person of his Forehead could have advanced it, when the World knows that the Proclamation against us was publish'd in the <hi>West-Indies</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> and the Spanish Memorial was not deliver'd till <hi>May</hi> following. We should indeed be very glad to find that His Majesty knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of those Proclamations; and that his Name was made use of without his Consent; as some say his Grandfathers was in the Irish Massacre: for then we might reasonably expect speedy Justice upon those bold Offenders, who dar'd to publish such Proclamations in His Majesty's Name, wherein we are condemned; as having invaded the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Dominions before ever it was heard what we could say for our selves, or without giving us any notice of those Proclamations, that we might have taken care to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd our Men from being starv'd to death by them: By which they have made our Prince to act more like our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Enemy, than one that we had constantly lov'd and rever'd as Father of his Country: and that which is yet more cutting; they still prevail to mislead him, so as he continues his unnatural Opposition to us: For besides the Proclamations formerly mentioned, another has been since
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66218:60"/>
publish'd against us in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> dated <hi>Sept.</hi> 15, which is so much the more unaccountable; considering the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial given in by our President and Advocate, justifying our Pretensions which the Spaniards have never yet offered to answer. By means of this Proclamation, the St. <hi>Andrew</hi> was denied Relief when she fell in with Admirel <hi>Bembo,</hi> who told her, tho they should all starve he could allow them none, and the like answer they had from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Iamaica,</hi> tho they offer'd Goods in Exchange; the like Opposition is also continued against us at home; for tho the Company have address'd His Majesty, yet 'tis without effect. After a full Representation of their Losses, they did wisely and dutifully desire the Parliament might meet, that being the properest way to have the sinking Honour of the Company supported; but His Majesty instead of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their reasonable desires, was prevail'd upon by those who are Enemies to our Country, to prorogue it further at the very time when they knew the Address was coming up, and all the Answer thought fit to give them, is, <hi>That His Majesty is sorry for the loss of his Ancient Kingdom and of the Company, that they shall have the same liberty to trade to the</hi> West-Indies <hi>as formerly; and that he will call the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament when he thinks the good of the Nation requires it,</hi> or to that effect. It may easily be judged, that this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer could be no way satisfactory to the Company in such a Juncture: nor are we to wonder, if instead of cheering their Spirits, it struck them dumb, and fill'd them with Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We wish that those who advise His Majesty to such a Conduct towards the People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been backward in testifying their Loyalty and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Person and Government; would consider that this is a downright Violation of our Constitution. It's certain that none are so proper to give his Majesty advice, when a Parliament is necessary as our own Nobility Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Burrowghs, who are most of them concern'd in our Company: and therefore their Address ought to haye been more regarded than the advice of any particular Persons.</p>
            <p>This false Method of Government hath ruin'd many of our Princes, and we wish that those who put his Majesty upon such Measures, may not have his ruin in prospect. It is certain they can be none of his Friends, who put him upon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging of the whole Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> in this manner.</p>
            <p>We come next to the Libeller's Defence of the Spanish
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66218:60"/>
Title to <hi>Darien,</hi> p. 163. His first Argument, That the Spaniards Title to that Country was never hitherto dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any Prince or State, is a downright Falshood. The <hi>Darien</hi> Princes themselves controverted it always, and their Plea was allow'd to be good by the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> as we have been forc'd to tell this Renegado and his Suborners again and again. The Title of the Spaniards as Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to any part of <hi>America,</hi> is not only doubted by the Bishop of <hi>Cheapo, Don Bartholomew de Los Casas,</hi> mention'd in the Defence of the Scots Settlement, but strenuously argu'd against and maintain'd to be unlawful, in his Propositions concerning the Title of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>America,</hi> propos'd to the Consideration of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> himself. In his ninth Proposition he asserts,
<q>That when Christian Princes apply their Endeavours to propagate the Faith, they ought to have no Consideration for any thing but the Service of God— Or if they can do any thing for the advantage of their Dominions while they augment the Kingdom of Christ: It ought to be without any considerable prejudice to the Infidels or the Princes that Govern them— <hi>Prop.</hi> 10. He asserts, They have their own lawful Kings and Princes, who have a Right to to make Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— For the good Government of their respective Dominions, so that they cannot be expell'd out of 'em, or depriv'd of what they possess, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Violence to the Laws of God as well as the Law of Nations. <hi>Prop.</hi> 26. Seeing the Spaniards have not been supported either by the Authority of their Prince, or any lawful Reason to make War against the Indians, who liv'd peaceably in their own Countty, and had done the Spaniard no wrong; all such Conquests that have been or may hereafter be made in the <hi>Indies,</hi> are to be accounted Unjust, Tyranical and Null, being condemned by all the Laws of God and Men.</q>
Its true he supposes the K. of <hi>Spain</hi> to have a Title to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of the Indies, by the Popes Grant; but it is with such Restrictions as those he mentions; and in his 16 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position says the Pope, has power to revoke it, if it be found prejudicial to the Establishment of the Faith; and he expresly declares throughout his Book, that all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods taken by the Spaniards were such, so that here's one strond Evidence of their own against them. —<hi>Dominicus de Soto</hi>; the K. of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Confessor at the time seems by his summing up the Dispute betwixt this Bishop and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66218:61"/>
Dr. <hi>Sepulveda</hi> to have been of the same Opinion; and <hi>Sepulveda</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Books, maintaining the contrary were suppress'd by the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V.</p>
            <p>Of the same Opinion, and indeed more express against the Methods, by which the Spaniards acquir'd their Dominions in the Indies, is, <hi>Franciscus a Victoria,</hi> chief Professor of Divinity, in the University of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> (whom the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. consulted in Cases of Conscience, and in this amongst others) as may be seen in his <hi>Relectiones, Theologicae, Relectione</hi> 5. <hi>de Indis</hi> where he argues the Point at large, and in <hi>Relect.</hi> 7. <hi>de jure bell,</hi> lays down this as a Maxim, <hi>That an Injury receiv'd is the only just Cause of making War.</hi> So that it being plain from Matter of Fact that the Indians did no manner of Injury to the Spaniards; their War upon them must of necessity by this Argumnt be unlawful. More has been said already in Vindication of our Title, in the defence of the Scots Settlement, than the Renegado and his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borners can answer; therefore we shall wind up this Matter in a few Words more.</p>
            <p>His alledging we might as well land in <hi>Iamaica,</hi> where the wild Negroes have deserted their Masters, or in <hi>Tobago, &amp;c.</hi> serve only to discover his own Folly. There's no unconquer'd Natives, who have their own Princes to govern them in either of those Islands, nor are the Titles of the English, and D. of <hi>Curland,</hi> to those Places question'd. The Irish having admitted French Troops into their Kingdom is as little to the purpose, since they have had no shadow of Government or Sovereignty, left them for several Ages, have from time to time submitted to the Government of <hi>England,</hi> and admitted those Troops in defence of the late K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Title, which he derives from <hi>Hen.</hi> II. that Conquer'd them. Besides, the Libeller himself owns, p. 54. that the Natives themselves were pleas'd with the hopes of being restor'd by us to their Ancient Liberty and Greatness; and p. 55. That <hi>Ambrosio</hi> one of their greatest Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, was at War with the Spaniards before our Arrival. His al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging that Cap. <hi>Andreas</hi> was a Spanish Captain at the time of our Landing, needs better proof than his assertion: that he might be then at Peace with the Spaniards, and have some respect for them because of his being bred among them, as <hi>H</hi>— says he was, p. 60. and that they then gave him a Commission as a Captain, does not at all argue that he was in the Spanish Interest when we Landed, or any way subject to the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi>; if he himself promised subjection, it does not divest his Subjects of their Right, and that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas</hi>'s Successor and they were no Friends to the Spaniards, is evident from the Libeller's own Story, that they gave our Colony notice of the Spanish Party that came to view them, and led them to the place where they were: We have likwise the Testimony of all that have writ of this Place, against the Renegado, besides that of the Journals of our own Colony, which give an Account that <hi>Ambrosio</hi> had engag'd all his Neighbouring Princes in a League a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Spaniard, before our Arrival.</p>
