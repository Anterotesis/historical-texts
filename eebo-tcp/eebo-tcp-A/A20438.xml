            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

belongeth to the maintaining of true religion,

with bold my pen anie longer, from refuting so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and damnable an opinion. It is a greeuous
thing by sinnes of infirmitie to offend Almightie God:
but openly and obstinately to affirme, that palpable
darkenes is cleare light: that euill is good, and good is
euill: that sacrilegious deadly sinne, is godly zeale, &amp;
that openly before the face of his aeternall Maiestie: Is
the true inheritance of that treble woe oft denounced
in the Scriptures. This mooued me (Right honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
<pb facs="tcp:5627:3"/>
in regard of mine humble dutie to your Honour,
and the publike commoditie of manie Christian soules
(which once tasting this sweete baite, might easilie be
entised to eat vp sinne as it were bread) to forewarne
all those, which shall read this plaine simple treatise,
that they wash their secrete thoughts, from this most
heinous sinne: which who so practiseth, with bloudie
heart he offereth violent hands euen vnto the bosome
of the sacred spouse of Iesu Christ. Amongest all the
creatures of this world, God hath giuen man onely an
vnder standing soule adorned with sundrie heauenly
vertues, of which there is none greater, none more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and diuine, more acceptable to God, more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
in the sight of men, than is his holy worshippe,
religiously celebrated in his holy Temple. Ouer the
which place, his care hath beene alwaies such, his eie
so vigilant, his prouidence so continuall: that neither
the sweet intising cups of worldly pleasure could at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
time bewitch it, nor the deuouring sword of firie
persecution consume it. But as the little ship, whilom
welneere perished with the outragious tempest, at the
voice of our Sauior, was presently safe in quiet calme;
euen so when subtle worldlings seeke either by force or
pollicie to ouerthrow the little Church of Christ: The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

Name and Nature do yeeld a sweet consent to support

in the fire of subtle pollicie, so to darken the cleare son
of true Christianity, that the house of God may nomore
bee seene, and that all the fountaines belonging to the
same, in one day may be cleane dryed vp.</p>
            <p>Sith then the glistering cloud of sacrilegious zeale
hath spred it selfe so larglie ouer our horizon, and so

sometimes in giuing attentiue eare to the sweetstrains of melodious

man the goulden mean is that sure rule, by which the wise do passe

it be but meanly regarded of the most: yet it is and alwaies hath bin

If you wil listen, the note is sweete, and the dittie resoundeth the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Church of Iesu Christ. Though my musike bee verie simple, and
I not practised in the art, though the song bee plaine truth, and the

vnto vs the dauning of the latter daie: For our soules health I
thought it expedient to shew vnto those which shall read this rudely

how loath some in the eies of all true christians to detract any thing

that my purpose is to profit the good, and so little as I may to offend
the euill, I hope (God willing) to shewe the truth so plainely, so briefly,
and so truely, as that the well disposed may vouchsafe to read, and
the euill may desire to learne. To the end that this little fountaine
might flow more abundantlie, and therewith deriue it selfe into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

it good rather to present my friend with it, as a priuate token of my

what wee are, and what wee ought to bee:

and furthermore perusing the holie fathers (by the

store of testimonies out of them, to witnesse with
mee, that this my affirmation in this matter, is a

this radiant sunne of light the word of God, and the

cleare beames thereof, though the trueth appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
plainelie in them both, yet their testimonies
concerning thinges once dedicated to holie vse,
seemed to mee neither so manie as I expected, nor
so plaine. Herein hauing made some spence of time
in seeking that which was not so plainely figured in
the fathers as I hoped, and as it was truely meant: at

most plainelie to my cogitation, which was: that as
that auncient <hi>Solon,</hi>

which should kil his own father, supposing that the

imagine that out of this earthlie yron age of ours,
there should spring anie so barbarous, so cruell, so
wicked, that would attempt to take awaie any thing

bee it man, beast, or field, it cannot bee solde or
reuoked againe, because whatsoeuer is once dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

not like vnto the meere vegitable creatures, the

               <p>In which course, who so hath begunne, let him

building pompous pallaces heere on earth (whose

the handes of our almightie creatour, our merciful
redeemer, our heauenlie comforter. This is the olde
christian way to the kingdome of heauen through
the armies of pleasures, of temptations, of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of punishments, of the spiritual powers of this
world: which who so refuseth, hoping to saue his

               <p>If this be thus, then what manner of men ought

is he displeased with those, who ether diminish or

where his name dwelleth? In this respect (gentle

               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:5627:15"/>This is one true plaine christian way, leading to one

which is that his glorie should be onely, and wholy
to himselfe, as it is written: <hi>gloriam meam alteri non
dabo,</hi> I will not giue my glorie to an other. The truth
of this conclusion telleth vs, that we must serue him
onely,<note place="margin">Esaie, 42.</note> not onely first, but him onelie. Which if we
did ponder wisely with our selues, and thereunto
frame our liues and daily dooinges, wee would not
take the squared stones of the temple, to builde our
pompous pallaces withall, but we would rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that olde saying: accursed is that house,
which hath any stone in it, belonging to the
church. We would not chang the names of church
landes, and call them by our owne names, our lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,

to the heauens, to the which both we and they are
dedicated, wee would soone loath that which wee

In like manner also the third councell of
Rome: If any man couet or take away any reuenews
belonging to the Church, or if any of the Priestes
consent there to:<note place="margin">Consil. Rom.</note> let them be accursed. The reason
followeth in the fift councel alleadged in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
for it is a great iniurie and an vntollerable sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that what so euer any man bestoweth on the
church of Christ, should be altered or translated to
any other vse, especially by those men, who of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought to maintaine the Church, as be christian
Kings, Princes, and Prelates. Furthermore, that it
might be manifest to all those, which dutifully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
and reuerence the spouse of Iesu Christ,
howe wicked an enterprise it is, and what mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
daunger to the soules of all them, which shall
presume heerein, the same Councell hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene
the daunger and set downe the sentence of
eternall trueth in these wordes. Hee which shall
not wiselie foresee this euident daunger of eternall
damnarion to his owne soule, and contrarie to
this sentence, take awaie the goods and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
once giuen to the Church, or vniustlye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
the same, vnlesse hee make present restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:5627:18"/>
to the church so soone as he can, let him be
strucken with the curse, which the wrathfull iudge
of all the world, shall inflict on all the soules of the
wicked at the day of doome, and let these goods
bee a curse to him which gaue them from the
Church, which receaued them, and which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
them.</p>
               <p>Neither let him finde anye protection for his
crime, before the tribunall seate of Iesu Christ,
because without all feare of God, and regard of
his holie worshippe, against lawe and right, hee
hath taken awaie the goods of the Church gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to maintaine the holie worship of the Lord,
and to feede the hungrie bodies and soules of the
poore innocent people. Generallie saith the same
Councell, whosoeuer, shall presume to confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
to spoyle, or to take anie thing consecrated,
to holie vse, or belonging to the Church, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
hee truelie repenting correct and amend
his wicked facte, so soone as hee can, and that
by restitution to the same Church, let him bee
subiect to the greeuous curse and censure of the
Church. Likewise those which enter on the goods
of the Church, and detaine them through the
gifte, the authoritie, the commission of Kinges,
and Princes, obtaining them by tirannicall force
from the Church, leauing them to theyr heyres
and posteritie as though they were theyr owne
inheritaunce, vnlesse with speedie repentaunce they
restore the Lords possession vnto his Church being
first admonished by the holy Bishop, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5627:19"/>
for euer, and accounted as an infidell, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that commandement of our sauiour Christ:
if he will not heare the Church,<note place="margin">Math, 18</note> let him be to thee as
an heathen, or as an infidell, therefore (saith the
councell) it is not lawfull for the Emperour or anie
true christian, to attempt anie thing contrarie to the
commaundementes of God, neither to doe anie
thing repugnant to the rules of the holy Prophets,
the Apostles and Euangelists.<note place="margin">Iohn, 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Those which bee my sheepe, saith our Sauiour
Christ they heare my voice, and those which be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
children of the Church, their hart will melte
when they heare the voice of their mother, crying
in the streetes. Our heauenly father he hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
vs in the spirite, and our spirituall mother, shee
nourisheth vs, with the sweete milke of the word
of life. Shee vttereth her voyce often, and cryeth
alowde in many places of the world, but neuer
so manifestly as when shee sheweth her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
openlie to all the world, in open generall
councell, gathered together in the holie Ghost.
You haue heard her voyce whileare, and the sound
thereof hath gone into all landes saying: touch
not mine annointed, neither anie thing once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to my holie worship. <hi>Sponsus sponsam amat:</hi>
the bridegroome doth loue his spouse intirely. Hee
sheweth her his brest, and reuealeth to her the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of his hart, his wil is apparant vnto her, &amp; she
hath reuealed it at sundry times vnto her children.
Which times though they were diuers yet <hi>veritatis
simplex est oratio:</hi> her voice was &amp; is alwaies the same,
as appeareth by the councell of <hi>Aurialens,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Consit. Aurial.</note> whose
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:5627:19"/>
wordes though they differre from the former,
yet the sence and sentence is the same: first forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
her eldest children of this grieuous sinne, and
then the other in their order, after this manner: <hi>Let
no Clarke</hi> or spirituall pastour, alienate any goodes
belonging to the Church: and least it should seeme
true which some obiect, that those which giue to the
Church, may also take away: the same councel doth
meete with that obiection in the 19. chapter in these
wordes: It is not lawfull for him which giueth anie
thing to the Church, or for his heires, once for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it backe again. In like maner the second coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
â˜œ of <hi>Spale:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Consil. Spalens,</note> Those Churches which by tumultes
and warres haue beene disturbed, shal altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the selfe same liberties, which they had before,
with all the possessions, whether they bee possessed
by any other Church, or any others whatsoeuer.
The first councell of <hi>Paris</hi> hath giuen this resolute
iudgement concerning Bishops goodes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the goods of the Church, because the goods and
possessions of Bishops, are knowne to be the goods
and possessions of the Church.<note place="margin">Consil. Paris.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man shall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
intrude himselfe</hi> into them, or by violence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
them, let him bee stroken with the curse of the
holie Canon, that he which would not followe the
motion of his owne conscience, at the least maye
bee reclaimed by the holie constitutions of the
Church. Which offence least it shold seeme a smal
sinne in the eyes of worldlye men, or that the
gaine gotten thereby, might seeme to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
the losse; no man is so simple which seeth not
plainely, that this is a pleasaunt sinnefull thought,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:5627:20"/>
leading to a bitter end, as appeareth by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the same councell following. <hi>Let no man
be so farre from the seeking</hi> of his owne soules health,
or so willing to seeke eternall death, that he should
once desire, enter, or possesse any goods, landes
or commodities belonging to the church. Though
the councell of <hi>Magnutium</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Consil. Magunt.</note> seeme in the beginning
by gentle words to mittigate the haynousnesse of
the fact, yet indeede the meaning is the same, and
in conclusion of the same weight, as appeareth
by their style in this manner: <hi>If anie man doe presume
to retaine, diminish or take</hi> anie goodes, landes, or
profites, belonging to anie Church, Colledge,
or any holie place, let him bee excommunicated
as a spoyler of the Church, not once allowed to
come neere the Church doore.</p>
               <p>These milde wordes, least they should animate
the wicked, they drawe a more fearefull iudgement
after them, as appeareth afterward in the same
councell, concluding thus; If anie man diminish
any thing belonging to the Church: as a cruell
murtherer of the poore, let him bee accursed
for euer. This was the voice of the mother, and her
children haue learned to pronounce the same.

a most grieuous sinne to take any thing from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Church, sith first it is giuen to maintaine the
holie worshippe of God there. Secondlie to feed

the goods of the Church are the gold of <hi>Tolossan,</hi>
which breedeth his distruction that possesseth it.</p>
               <p>Therefore though the churches, their goods &amp;
landes, were abused by Monkes and Friers: yet
there is no cause why Christian Princes should
thinke that reformation good and religious, which
pulleth down the churches, and turneth the church
goods to the vse and possessions of laie men, for
they were not first giuen to this end, kinges, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:5627:22"/>
princes, and magistrates haue their reuenewes,
their tributes, their fines, their customes, their
publique treasures appointed for their vses: but as
for the goods of the church, they were first giuen
for the maintenance of students in humanitie, and
diuinitie, for the maintaining of Bishops and hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie,
for the relieuing of the poore widowes,
stangers and captiues, and those which are in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie:
and a certaine portion was appointed
for the repairing of Churches.</p>
               <p>Let them restore such sufficiencie of goods to
the Church, as will fullie suffice for the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of all the premisses, before they take one

               <p>In that case it is a doubtfull question, in answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
the which I had rather incline to that point,
that if the prince or magistrate should take awaie
the goods of the church, no man ought violentlie

               <p>Concluding, that vnlesse it be in cases set down

               <p>To this generall consent of scriptures, counsels,

the great and dangerous punishments which

the Lorde sendeth on all them, that take any thing
from his holie temple, of which who so mindeth
but to sippe, and take a bare tast, let him marke these
examples, plainely propounded in these fewe lines
following: but if hee will haue more store, and is
minded to wade further, let him enter the dissuasiue
it selfe, consisting more of example then rule, and
<hi>Celsus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Celsus.</note> of <hi>Verona</hi> his dissuasiue thereunto adioyned.
There he shall finde it true by record of sundry histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which is written in holie scriptures, concerning
those which either take or deteine anie thing once
vowed and giuen to the holy Church. And what is
that? wee reade in the Actes of the Apostles, that
<hi>Ananias</hi> &amp; <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife consented to keepe backe
some of the money which they had once giuen to
the Lord.<note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> Which how haynous a crime it was, let all

reasoning with them and saying on this maner: was

why then doe you tempt the holy Ghost, sith the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

that after it is once giuen or appointed to holie vse,

and then that which is bodilie. The bodie
is quickned last and dieth first: but the spirite
is that which is first and laste. As the spirituall
is first, so wee ought first of all to walke after
the spirit, and not after the flesh: to become like our
spirituall father, and to nourish our spirituall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and brethren redeemed with the same spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
sacrifice: renewed with the same spirituall grace:
confirmed by the same spiritual pastours, vnto sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony
&amp; holines of life, reading first, &amp; aboue al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowledge, science contemplacions and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
the true heauenlie doctrine of the spirit. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

keepe the volumes, the pastours, the temples of the
spirituall worship of the Lord, where the breade of
life is broken to those which hunger and thirst after

righteousnes, and the spirituall foode of the soule.
After the body followeth the shadowe, and next to
this spirituall foode of the soule, the food of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
bodie is to be prouided. Both are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie,
but the former first. Therefore let vs not seeke
after the foode which perisheth, but seeke the foode
which preserueth both bodie and soule vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life, knowing that (as our sauiout Christ saith)
man liueth not by bread onely, but by euerie worde
which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.<note place="margin">Math, 3.</note> This
word is the conduit of the spirit, whose substaunce
is perfect trueth: this word was in the beginning, &amp;

the spiriual grace of the heauenly fountaine infused

to offend his maker, to leaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauenly spirit, &amp; to

               <p>This is the key of knowledge, whereby wee must

spirituall, and earthly, of a spirituall father, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of heauen and earth,<note place="margin">Act, 2.</note> a spirituall mother, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>So we must first and principally apply our selues
to the maintaining of the health, peace and safety,
the reuerence renowne and glory of this spirituall
father and mother, leauing our earthly father and
our earthly mother in regard of them, because hee
created, redeemed and sanctified vs vnto himselfe,
&amp; our holy mother. She nourisheth vs with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:5627:31"/>
milke of the holy ghost, that wee should be
an holie religious generation vnto the Lord.</p>
               <p>Therefore after wee haue truelie confessed, that
wee beleeue in the most holie, blessed, and glorious
trinitie, three persons and one God, next vnto our
heauenlie Father, wee acknowledge our spirituall
mother, the holie catholique Church: in whose cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie
at his departing out of this world, he left his
will and testament plainlie written and subscribed
with his owne hand, and the handes of manie faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
witnesses, surelie sealed with his most precious

that therwith the speres did shrinke in the heauens,
the Moone against nature retired from the East,<note place="margin">Dionys. Areop.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the holy church, a sure seale and pledge of eternall

As is the loue of her husband, so is hirs: for she hath
it giuen her of him, euen breathed from his owne

heauens shall waxe old like a garment,<note place="margin">Pet. 2.</note> the Sun shal

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:5627:32"/>
of the prophet; when father and mother forsaketh

our spiritual mother aboue all other things both in

the spirit, euen by the spirite of life, and she through
his great grace doth nurse vs vp with the same food:
she taketh vs vp out of the mirie waies of this sinful

wherewith wee are almost smothered, she openeth
our mouth, applying thereto her tender teats, from
whence she distilleth the drops of spiritual life into
our hearts, wherby our soules be fed, our bodies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
our vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ding increased, our eies cleared,
our faith perfected; so that we see most plainly how
we should loath the world, &amp; learne to loue our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to leaue the cleare Sunne, &amp; to waite on shadowes:
or possible to serue God &amp; Mammon, this world &amp;

if you cannot see so far before you, by reason of the

through the wildernes of this wicked world, before

elsewhere is wisely written: <hi>Terra imbrobitatis est
prouincia,</hi> the earth is a prouince full of naughtines,
through which who so mindeth to walke safelie,
hee must bee verie circumspect, taking heede to

of this waie vnto eternall life, is to loue

                  <note place="margin">Lex. Nat.</note> Do vnto others as yee

               <p>This rule is generall the meaning large, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance
thereof hard and tedious: therfore before
I post forward too fast vnto the ende, I will make
some litle small spence of time in opening the first
beginning thereof: and which is that? as it is said in
the rule of christian faith, next to the blessed trinitie
is ioyned the holie catholique church: as also in the
table of the ten commaundements, next to those
which wholie concerne the worship of God: in the
first place and before all the rest, is placed. Honor
thy father and thy mother, and that with a blessing:
which who so mindeth to be partaker of, hee must
not onelie honor his naturall father and mother, but
he must vnderstand truelie, that as the spiritual part
soule of man, is before the flesh: so first and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallie
wee must honor our heauenlie father, which
hath begotten vs of the true spiritual immortal seed,
wherby as saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi>

&amp; next to this our spiritual father, aboue all

the holy catholique church, whose children we
are before we haue our perfect beeing in the flesh<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
according to the saying of <hi>Euaristus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euaristus.</note> in his decrees.
<hi>Scimus Christum esse caput, cuius nos membra sumus, ipse
est sponsus, &amp; ecclesia est sponsa cuius filii nos sumus,</hi> wee
trulie know that Christ is the head of his Church,
whose members we are: for he is the husband and the

               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:5627:33"/>Therefore before wee looke at our naturall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
we must most christianly apply our selues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the honour and reuerence of our spirituall father
and our spirituall mother. Nay we must forsake both
goods and landes, honour and dignitie, frendes, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
brethren, yea our naturall father and mother,
and cleaue vnto our spirituall mother the holie
Church, according to that most christian aunswere
of that learned <hi>Tritemius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tritemius</note> to his naturall mother. To
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> after she had signified by diuers louing letters,
that she most earnestly desired to see him face to

<hi>Melchisedech,</hi> without father, without mother, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
kindred: I haue no father but God, neither anie
mother besides the holy Church. In these words he
signifieth thus much: that who hath created vs first
and loued vs most, wee ought to seeke him first, and
most to loue him, and therfore sith our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

sith there is no loue comparable to his, which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

               <p>This is a cleare glasse, in which a christian maye
beholde the degrees, by which wee must passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
this vale of miserie, vnto the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and the rule is like vnto it, for the first rule or
direction of a christian soule vnto heauen, is, aboue
all thinges to meditate with himselfe whether he be
in the true way of eternall life or no. And therewith
to consider with himselfe, what he hath done, what
hee hath not doone, and what hee ought to doe:
which who so wiselie weigheth, hee shall finde it
true, that before all care and prouision of our sinfull
bodies, we ought most painefully to prouide for the
health of our soules, knowing assuredly that we must
passe this earthly pilgrimage, with suche religious
care of our spirituall father and mother, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
wee must restraine our affections, from the
woonted wishes of the worlde, and weane them so
from fleshlie corruptions, with the true discipline
of our spiritual nurse, that neyther riches, nor goods,

               <p>This is the way easie to bee found out of all those
which heede the same. The ground is euen, the
path is plaine, the degrees not many, the passage

easie. O that the foote could bee content to follow
the direction of the eye, that the handmayd would
be obedient to her mistrisse, or that the flesh would
but cease a little to resist the good motions of the
spirite.</p>
               <p>If wee could but a little, yea I saye but a little se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quester
our selues from this worldly securitie, which
with her manifold charming pleasures, hath lulled
vs so long in the cradle of the flesh, that wee are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

If the Lorde of his great mercie would but once o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

               <p>These two contrary desires bee the cause of mans

destroieth the other: that which delighteth the one
displeaseth the other: that which exalteth the one,

he. Sith this little sparke of heathen fire, hath ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
the candle euen of christian princes, let not
our harts be so ouer grown with the choking weeds
of this mortalitie. Neither let the God of this world
either so blinde our eyes, or dimme our sight, that
wee professing the name of Christians, with our
mouth, shold be like the heathen people in our life.
Herein let vs learne to distinguish the cleere light
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:5627:36"/>
of a christian candle, from the smoking snuffe of the
heathen. Hee which is the king of kinges, and onely
ruler ouer all, hee said plainlie, my kingdome is not
of this world. Neither those which onely bende
themselues to the fleshlie course of this worlde, to
attaine highe stile, dominion and rule: the fat of the
field, or riches of the Citty, are the truest christians.
For what is a christian? or what difference doe wee
make betwixte the worthie dignitie of christian
princes, and the tirannicall empire of the heathen?
Theyr strength is the cursed confidence of flesh and
bloud.<note place="margin">Psal, 31.</note> Though an horse be but a vaine thing to saue
a man, though all fleshe is grasse, and the glorie
thereof is as the flower of the fielde, which flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
to day and to morrow is cast into the furnace,
though euerie man liuing,<note place="margin">Esay, 40.</note> and all the liuing of man,
is but meere vanitie, yea lighter then vanitie it selfe:
yet the heathen and worldly man will disquiet
himselfe in vaine, hee will make fleshe his arme
and the compasse of the earth his dominion: hee
will plante his foote in the sea, and his armie in the
highest hils, he will displaie his banner before the
clowdes, and compare his glory to the golden tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
sunne. The swelling of sinfull fleshe is aboue
measure and desire of rule seeth not God. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
kinges they set the glorie of God before theyr
eyes, and not their owne glorie, they first of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their spirituall father, and their spirituall

But the Kings and rulers of the heathen, they are <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lii
terrae,</hi> the sonnes of the earth. Their desire, their life
their looue, their greatest glory and rule, is in the
earth alone, and came from the earth, they knowe
not their heauenly father, and therefore ofte times
they spoile their spirituall mother. Such as they be,
such is their rule, not for the glory of God, or the
safetie of his church, for they defie her, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
her, they pill and poll her, but they rule for
their owne glory, their owne peace and safetie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their owne humour,<note place="margin">Daniel, 5.</note> as it is plainely des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
by the mouth of Daniell speaking vnto <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thasar</hi>

him and feared him greatly. Whom he would,
he killed, whom he would he did strike, whome hee

in the schoole of Christianitie, and by her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
out of the booke of life, in the fayth, feare,

without exception of heauen and earth.</p>
               <p>They thinke themselues to be Gods, making the
ende of their power and rule, to bee the extolling of
their owne honour and dignitie. They regard not
iustice, that they should doe no iniurie: nor the

their brethren, that they might seeme naturall: nor
their inferiours, that they might appeare humble:
nor the goods, the landes, the peace, the priuiledge,
the honour, the glorie of God, or man, that there
might appeare some sparke of Godly life in them.
But without regard of God, of pietie or pittie, they

all other thinges, and loue him alone; not in

in our outward life and conuersation. Can wee taste

drinke of the liquor, and not touch the cuppe with
our lippes? can we taste of the sweete drops of his
most pretious bloud, and not kisse the sonne of our
saluation, the spring of eternall life, the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

               <p>Then leauing heathnish glory, &amp; the rule of flesh &amp;

ought not to be disposed, and for the establishing of
their owne kingdome, or for the aduauncement of
their owne honour, or for the safetie of their owne

for the seruice &amp; kingdome of Christ: their
power, their men, their armour, their goods, their

and courtiers, are to be imploied in the seruice and
obedience of the church of Iesu Christ.</p>
               <p>Thus proceeding in the waie of life, let them not
barely imagine, that God is aboue all the rulers in
the world; but that he is carefullie and dutifullie to
bee serued euerie daie, and that the howre of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
seruice is not to bee appointed at our will, but
at his wil, and when it shall bee thought most meet,
by them which are truelie religious.</p>
               <p>Herein wee ought to be so resolutelie bent to serue

they regarded not the basenesse of the house, nor

Childe was: but acknowledging great maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
to lye here couered in low humilitie, they
cast downe the glorie of their kingdomes at his

offered to him, gould, mirre, and frankensence, the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:5627:43"/>
first fruits of true christianitie. Wherein wee haue
a plaine example propounded to all christian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

Lorde of wisedome, euen the wisedome of the God
of heauen and earth (leauing our owne natural wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and denying our selues) wee ought to followe
this cleare light, which shineth thorow Christ from
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. Though they be noble Princes as these were,
yet they ought to acknowledge him to bee king of
kings, and Lord of Lords, of whom it was forshew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<note place="margin">Esay 9.</note> that he should walke vpon the lyon and the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon:
that all nations should doe him seruice, that
his kingdome shall haue none ende. And who shall
declare his generation? though the mightie of this
world bee of high honour and dignitie as they were,
yet their humble kneeling and obedience, sheweth
that christian Princes are not to rule ouer their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
like the heathen, for their owne pompe, their
owne honour, their owne magnificent glorie, for the
safetie of their owne life, regiment &amp; kingdome: but
that with the princely maiestie of the annointed of
the Lord, they should leaue the care of their earthly
kingdome, and follow the cleare star of Iesu Christ,
which lightneth the grossest darkenes. They should
bowe their bodies, and bende their whole strength
before Iesu Christ and his holie Church. Though
worldly men, Potentates and Princes, liue in greate
plentie of honour, freedome, and all abundance, yet
knowing that without God, is without all: let them
leaue the loue of their owne houses, the delight and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:5627:43"/>
glorie of their pompous pallaces, let them forsake
their owne fathers house, their goodes, and landes,
and cimery with the faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 20.</note> and bestowe
their whole substance, honour, and riches, on the
Lord Iesu, and his louing spowse the holy Church.
Remembring that he created them poore wretches
when they were nothing, and that of nothing: (as
it is saide) he hath loued them without their desert,
and that with a most entire surpassing loue. Hee fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them in their mothers wombe, and openeth
their mouthes, that they should breath. Hee preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
them from all the daungers of their infancie, &amp;
euerie minute maintaineth them in their kingdoms,
holding vp the scepter in their handes, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
<hi>Per me reges regnant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 8.</note> by my permission kinges
doe rule vppon earth. They rule by him, and him
alone, for if hee doe but alienate the mindes of the
subiectes, the princes seate dooth shrinke vnder
him. If hee doe but a while restraine the dewe of
heauen,<note place="margin">Reg 3.</note> as hee did at the praier of <hi>Elias</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
of the Lorde, both prince and people famish
together.</p>
               <p>Though hee giue store of foode, though it bee
well prepared, and by the counsell of good phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
drest finely for the kinges owne mouth; yet if
the Lord do not blesse it in his mouth, as he chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, in the throate as it descendeth, in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
as it concocteth, in the passage from thence
as it digesteth, his meate is his bane, or at the least
hee falleth sicke after the tast thereof, and lyeth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
groaning vppon his pillowe: If the Lorde
dooth with-hold but the least of his benefits a little,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:5627:44"/>
the fire from roasting, the sunne from shining, the
corne from riping, the tong from tasting, the lungs
from breathing but one minute of an houre, though
he be the mightiest king in the world, forthwith hee
perisheth from the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>Therefore let all kings and princes,<note place="margin">Psal. 67.</note> all people and
nations, acknowledge the great power of the Lord,
euen in the least of his benefits. Let them leaue
off the delight of worldly vanities, wherewith they
are puffed vp, their honours, landes, and goodes.
Let them affect the true honour and maiestie, the
glorious triumph and perfect pleasure, which well
beseemeth a christian prince, euen the annointed
of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Neither are wee carried with the fruitlesse winde
of scisme, that we should condemne those pleasures
which bee lawfull: knowing that as the Lorde hath
giuen man a bodie together with his soule, so it is
as necessarie that he looke for the sustenaunce, the
defence, the delight, or recreation of his body, as
of his soule, and that in most honourable, pleasant,
triumphant manner, if time and place permit. But
yet first and principally wee must seeke to feede our
soule with the foode that neuer perisheth, and then
the body.</p>
               <p>Those which doe blesse the Lorde of heauen,
and loue him aboue all the fading ioyes of the earth:
they shall receyue from aboue blessing for blessing,
grace for grace, loue for loue, to their endlesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in the great day of his visitation,<note place="margin">Cor. 1.</note> they shall flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
like the fruitfull vine, their children shall stande
like oliue braunches round about their table, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:5627:44"/>
they shall neuer want one to sit vppon their seate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

together with the temples and good woorkes
of their owne handes. They shall reioyce therein,
because their memorie shall neuer perish from the
face of the earth: but especially because this oyle
which they haue in their lampes, shall giue a light
to their eyes: a direction to their feete: a comfort
to their heart and conscience, in the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>This is the sentence of holy scripture, and the
example is like vnto the same.<note place="margin">Psal. 36.</note> Looke ouer the
booke of God: peruse it diligently, and tell mee, if

of God, and the righteousnesse thereof, whiche
built temples to his holie name, maintaining his
praise and glorie in the same, they had all good bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
powred on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> left his owne country, willing to haue
sacrificed his onely sonne, at the voice of the Lord:
and therefore hee had this assuraunce by the voyce
of an Aungell from heauen:<note place="margin">Gen. 26.</note> By my selfe haue I
sworne (saith the Lorde) that in thy seed shall all the
nations of the earth be blessed.</p>
               <p>Which blessing continued in <hi>Isaac,</hi> the fruits ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
began to budde in <hi>Iacob,</hi> whose willing minde
well knowen vnto the Lord concerning his house:
in his sleepe there appeared vnto him a ladder, the
foote whereof stood on the earth, but the top did
reach vnto the heauens, by which the angels did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:5627:45"/>
and descend, and the Lord leaning on the top
of this ladder, said vnto him. I am the Lord the God
of thy father <hi>Abraham</hi> and thy father <hi>Isaac,</hi> the land
in which thou art now will I giue thee, and to thy
seed, and thy seed shall bee as the dust of the earth.
Thou shalt increase from the East to the West, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
the North to the South, and in thy seed shall all the
nations of the earth be blessed. When Iacob awaked
out of his sleepe, he said, of a truth the Lord is in
this place, &amp; I knew not: and trembling he said fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<note place="margin">Gen. 28.</note> O how terrible is this place? this is none other
place, but euen the house of God, and the gate of
heauen.</p>
               <p>Forthwith rising in the morning, hee tooke the
stone which lay vnder his head all night, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it an ende, he powred oile vppon it: making a
vow and saying: if the Lord will bee with mee &amp;c.
the Lord shall be my God, and this stone which I
haue here set an ende, shalbe called the house of
God. and I will giue him the tenth of all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
which hee shall giue me. After the sparks of
heauenlie fire new kindled in the breast of the holie
patriarch: the flame brake forth at his mouth, and
so fructified together with his true pietie, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
hee was wonderfull rich in seruants, goods,
and cattel, in beeing a ioyfull father of manie good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie-children,
liuing to a good olde age, seeing his
childrens children, laying his hand on them, &amp; that
which passeth all, though his graundfather <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
did make an alter in the same place, proceeding
to offer the bloud of his onelie sonne vnto the
Lord (which was a perfect figure of Christ) yet the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:5627:45"/>
latter light did shine the clearer, and the Lord did
so multiplie the blessings promised to <hi>Abraham</hi> in
his sonnes <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 28.</note> that long before the time
of the reuelation of that holie one, to him and in
him, he vncouered the vale so much, that he shewed
his louing regard to his elect here vppon earth, in
looking downe on Iacob, and leaning on the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
in sending his Angels vp and downe to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,
full of grace. Who when his eies were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
and he did see as it is said: <hi>Gratia gratiam peperit.</hi>
Grace brought foorth grace.</p>
               <p>For to the end that hee and his posteritie might
more easilie clime this ladder, and for our example
hee trembled when hee perceyued that the Lord
was there, hee gaue the title, and ioyned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
thereunto: saying, out of all doubt, this
is the house of God, and the gate of heauen: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding,
it shall be called the house of God.</p>
               <p>Which his zealous speech and dooings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the fruitelesse zeale of our age, for when
hee perceiued that hee was once in the house of
God, with a reuerent feare hee trembled. Not
dispairing, but beleeuing in heart, hee looked vp:
confessing with the mouth, hee promised and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourming
in deede, hee reared vp the corner stone,
on which euen in the same place, the holie tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

was afterwards built:<note place="margin">Act. 4.</note> which though it was refused
of the cunning builders, in latter times, yet bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once annointed with holy oile, it became the

the prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> that the fire was kindled in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
and the flame broke forth in Israel, not for

it was suppressed in that watrish Aegipt) but it
shined so cleare out of the darke Cloude in the

Neither could the desartes of Synaie or sinne, or

               <p>When the Arke (the true figure of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)

thus brought, and placed neere the propper

               <p>And <hi>Dauid</hi> also the seruaunt of the Lord, taken

               <p>Now for our example let vs marke howe this

               <p>The Arke hauing bene long before neglected
by <hi>Saul</hi> (which appeared by his ende) <hi>Dauid</hi> hee

               <p>'First placing it in the house <hi>Obededom,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes,
seeing the great blessinges which the

when hee had conquered all his enemies

followed not the swelling humour of flesh &amp; bloud,
which ruleth most in those that are the lowest born,
and the basest minded, according to that auncient
saying: <hi>Asperius nihil est humili cum surgit in altum:</hi> but
that which is the dutie of a godly prince, hee called
the prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> vnto him and saide. Do you not

of the king, or of anie man, should bee more faire,
more sumptuous, more honourable and maiesticall,
than the house of God.</p>
               <p>And therefore hee purposed fully with himselfe,
to builde a temple vnto the Lorde, which hee hath
perfourmed with dutifull endeuour in good time,
but that the Lord by the mouth of his holy prophet
signified, that his good intent was accepted, and
therefore the Lorde would blesse him on all sides,<note place="margin">2. Kings. 7.</note>
promising that hee would giue him peace and rest,
from his enemies, that he would place him quietlie
in his owne pallace, and when his yeares were come

the godly sleepe with his fathers, the Lord promised
that hee would raise vp a sonne vnto him, in whome
he would establish the kingdome of <hi>Dauid</hi> for euer,
and which should builde an holie temple vnto the

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:5627:47"/>Heere vppon the kinglie Prophet did magnifie the

penned manie Godlie himnes, to bee musicallie

Though hee was an heathen, and cheefe

                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> began to builde the temple of the Lorde,

               <p>O that the Christian Princes of our time,
would but looke a little vnto the vnfayned looue,
which those heathen Monarches shewed to the
God of heauen, and his holy temple. I would
they did not onely possesse the name of Christ
and loue of his church, but that in euery particular
law, in euery action, in euery deede of liberalitye, it
might plainely appeare before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> face of God &amp; man
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:5627:51"/>
their first and chiefest loue is the prosperitie of the
church of Iesu Christ: and not onely the generall
name of profession, but that after the example of
those heathen kinges, they would loue it indeed, and
the ministers thereof,<note place="margin">Paralip. 2.</note> that they would giue wood &amp;
stone, yron and lead, gold, and siluer, to the building
of the Lordes house, to the celebrating of his diuine
seruice, to the good and honourable maintaining of
his ministers. And not only in making general laws,
which may seeme to acknowledge this calling to be
good, nor in taking, but in giuing to the Lorde, and
the maintenance of his holie worship, the first fruits
of their harts and mindes, which is more than I can
briefly comprehend.</p>
               <p>Neither should this charitie bee shut vp onely in
the heart, but the fountaines thereof (if it be right)
are oftentimes so pierced with the finger of God,
that the riuers of this charitable and heauenly oyle,
runneth downe not onely into the church it self, but
into the bosomes and bones of the officers, the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
the porters, and the lowest minister of the
church, in such sorte, that no vniust lawe, commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
payment, punishment or incumbrance whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
shall hinder them from their, good, lawfull, and
daily administration in the Church of God. And if
they should: yet if the crie of the poore disciple of
Iesu Christ once come to the princes eare: no doubt
he sitting in the place of God, will also breake out &amp;
saye in the person of God: touch not mine annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
but let them be free,<note place="margin">Paralip. 1.</note> for the Lord which placed
mee in my throne, hee hath put the worde in my
mouth. Haue not I said it? it is written in the volume
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:5627:52"/>
of his booke, that I should doe his will, and shall I
not come? he hath commaunded, and shall I not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey?
hee hath alwaies blessed those which loued his
temple, and shall not I be partaker of the same? This
blessing aboue all others of the Lorde, is so manifest,
that euerie nation, euerie kindred, yea euen the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
if they haue but a little sparke of the reuerence
of his holie name, they haue greatly prospered ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               <p>It was the manner of the auncient Graecians,<note place="margin">Grecians.</note> to
builde temples, and amongst all other they solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
the temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> endowing it with great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
freedome, landes and possessions, after which
customable beneuolence, shewed vnto their God,
they prospered so greatlye, more than they were
woont, that they woonne manie great battailes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Persians,</hi> with such exceeding glorie, that

though it were for sauing of a kingdome.</p>
               <p>This appeareth plainely by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great,
who was wisely instructed of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> after the
manner of the Philosophers, that he should first
feare God, and aboue all thinges keepe his hands
from the spoile of temples dedicated to the Gods.
Therefore when hee wanted frankensence to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
hee would not take it out of the temple at
home, or exact it of <hi>Apolloes</hi> Priestes (who had
great store) but after greate warres and manie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
exploites, hee brought it out of farre
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:5627:52"/>
countries: and then bestowed it in sacrificing most
plentifully, saying; that to the Gods hee would
not bee a niggard. With this good minde he pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered

alwaies obserued this rule, that aboue all other
thinges, they begunne with the reuerence of their
Gods, their temples, their sacrifices, and both in
peace and warre, their chiefest end was the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ianus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ianus,</note> was the first that made temples to the Gods
in <hi>Italie,</hi> appointing sacrifices and other rites there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto

                  <note place="margin">Tully.</note> saith, in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
hee is alwaies remembred in the beginning
of their praiers. Such as hee sowed, such did hee
reape, for the posterity much celebrated his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
for this fact, &amp; built a most solemn temple in his
name. By which religious mind, they thought that
they flourished more in peace, and had greater vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
in the warres, than anie other people. In
which their exceeding great victories, according to
the rites and religion of their nation, they imitated
that well disposed <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who hauing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:5627:53"/>
woon the citie of Thebes, &amp; sackt it to the ground,
destroying, captyuating, and banishing of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitantes
thereof aboue 4000. Hee spared none
saue onelie the priestes of that citie, those which
were strangers there of Macedonia, and all the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of that learned poet <hi>Pyndarus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much like to this was that of the Romanes, who
when they had conquered that faire auncient Citie
<hi>Alba:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">T. Liuius.</note> they destroyed all the buildinges thereof, saue
onely the temples and churches: beeing afraid least
if they should take anie thing from the temples of
the gods, they should thereby make them their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
and so not onlie they should come to some
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>, but also their whole common wealth
should bee brought to vtter ruine and destruction.
That this was their resolute religious opinion, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in sundry places of their histories. For when
<hi>Tullus Hostillius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">T. Hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> had conquered the Sabynes, destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the faire buildings of that citie, and caried the
people thereof vnto Rome) as it is plainly shewed in
that historie) onely the churches remained vntou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and vnuiolated, as holy houses on which they
durst not presume to lay their handes: which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
done to the religious houses of the gentils,
sith it was done by the aforenamed king it seemed
that it rather proceeded of the wise pollicie, and
rule of regiment, left to him by that worthie ruler
<hi>Numa Pompilius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">N. Pom.</note> his predecessor, then of anie great
deuotion which hee had towardes the gods or their
holie temples, in that it is written of him, that hee
accounted nothing lesse honourable or princely,
then to apply himselfe to the honor of religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:5627:53"/>Therfore his fierce, wild, desperate mind: was so
daunted and throughlie pierced with deadlie ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and shaking fare, that of a neglector of religion,
and religious houses, sodainly he left all other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
whatsoeuer, most earnestlie and superstitiouslie
fulfilling euen the least ceremonies of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But because hee became religious rather for
feare than for loue (through the wrath of God)
hee and his house together were burned, and cleane
consumed with lightning from heauen. So farre
were the people of that age from spoiling the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of their owne gods, that when they conquered
any nation, they feared to laie handes on the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
or anie other thing. Nay it seemed to them
great sacriledge &amp; a thing alwaies punished by God
to alter or translate the holie rites, or anie thing
thereunto belonging, as appeareth in the same his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Tullus</hi> had conquered the Sabynes, &amp; sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
their citie, beeing now in his maiestie, reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with honor &amp; all kind of kinglie abundance:
of a sodaine, newes came to the court that it rained
stones in the mount Albaine.<note place="margin">Albani.</note> Whither when they
had sent messengers and found it so, there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a voice heard in the mount crying aloud, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that Albines should vse their owne Countrie
Religion which they had left, when they left their
temples behinde them desolate, and lost their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>With this the Romanes were also much moued,
so that for memorie of this they appointed certaine
solemne feast daies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:5627:54"/>Nether was this religious minde onely proper to
the Romanes, who in this point of all people were
most religious. But common also to other people,
euen by the law and instinct of nature, as appeareth
by the legats of Locris sent to the Senate of Rome
who (as it is partlie recorded of <hi>Celsus</hi> of <hi>Verona,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
manie great iniuries and violences offered to
them and their Countrie, they repeated this as the
chiefest, saying.</p>
               <p>There is one thing (O worthie senate) of which
euen that Religion, which nature hath infixed in
euerie mans minde doth will vs to complaine:
wee know right well how deuoutlie and ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie
you embrace, not onelie your owne gods,
but how fauourably you entreate and vse the gods
of other nations. We haue a temple dedicated vnto
<hi>Proserpina.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proserp.</note> Amongest other his abhominable facts,
your Legat <hi>Pleminius</hi> did take away the treasure of
this Temple,<note place="margin">Temp.</note> hee shipped it and hoisted vp saile,
but the winde blew, the tempestes did arise, the
waues tossed, the surges fomed, the sea roared in
such sort, that the shippes were violentlie reuersed
to the shore from which they went, and spletted
on the sands, where the treasure was found, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to the temple againe. Nether did anie thing
euer prosper which he took in hand after that deed,
so that being driuen from Italie, he entring Greece,
in the night, he died a shameful, &amp; an vnlucky death.</p>
               <p>After this, your legat and the tribunes of soldiers,
presumed so far also as to laie violent handes on the
treasure belonging to the same temple, therewith
defiling themselues and their houses. Which fact (o
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:5627:54"/>
worthie Senate) vnlesse you will by your religious
mind reforme, without doubt ye shal haue no good
succesie in your affairs either in Italie or in Affrick:
but their bloud shall bee spilt, and your common
wealth hazarded also in lue of that fact. And to saie
the truth euen at this instant, the wrathful reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the goddesse doth light vpon your captains
&amp; soldiers: we our selues hane lately seen how they
run violently together with banners displayed one
part against another: the captaine of one part is <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pleminius</note>
of the other the two tribunes. Thus they dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
fight together most cruelly, most barbarouslie,
most deadlie. Many of the soldiers be oft in a phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy:
&amp; think you that the goddes hath let the captains
goe scotfree? no she punisheth them surely. The
Tribunes were, take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> by the Legat, &amp; whipped with
rods. Also the Legat at length apprehended by the
pollicie of the Tribunes, his bodie all rent, and torn
with sundrie torments, his nose &amp; his ears cut off: he
was left bleeding almost to the death. Afterwardes
the Legat recouering cast the Tribunes into prison,

wil she cease to torment them all and euerie of
them with innumerable plagues and punishments,
til the treasure take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> from her temple be restored to it
againe. This was the speach of the Legats of Locris
vnto the senat of Rome: which sheweth plainly, that
as wel the Gretians as the Romans counted it a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

               <p>Nay they themselues not onely tooke this wise
and sure way in the establishing of their common-wealth,
but also in euerie particular action whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
they had a special eye &amp; regard vnto the Gods,
their religion, their reuerence, their worship, their
temples.</p>
               <p>And surely if we looke into the Romane histories
we may see most plainly, that they obserued the rule
of their owne Poet, <hi>A Ioue principium musae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Maro.</note> they first
of all regarded the temples of their Gods, and then
their common-wealth. By which safe rule they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
east by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and farre west by <hi>Iulius Caesar:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caesar.</note>
who at the first was most of all men in that age, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to the maintaining of temples &amp; their Gods.
Whereby hee did gather such strength, and rose so
high, that neither Prince nor king could retyre the
force of his army, or subdue him in the battaile. Till
at the length, through daily practise of shedding
bloud, by force of armes, his heart was so hardened,
that vnnaturally he drew out his sworde, and lifte vp
his armes against his owne country, from whence
he had his chiefe beginning. But afterwardes when
he had helde foorth his swoorde against his mother
(which gaue him it first into his handes) and had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
the most famous and renowned state of the
Romane Senate, and by force made himselfe Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
or <hi>Rome.</hi> That which is the desteny of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

secretly in his heart, that in perfect zeale he shewed
his louing heart vnto the Christians: hee stretched
foorth his handes, and most hartily embraced the
poore orphane Christians, dispersed, persecuted,
weakened, discomfited. Hee nursed and nourished
them, he called them togither into one place, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the milke of good and wholesome councell, willing
them in the name of God to foresee what was the
truth, to seeke that, to discusse that, &amp; with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

libertie of calling a generall councell, hee supplyed
with yearely commodities the wants of those which
had illuminated his hart, with the glad tidings of the
God of heauen: &amp; after innumerable great charges,
gifts, &amp; endowments, bestowed on the church (that
which is an example for all Christian princes) hee
spent all his time in meditating vpon the law of the
Lorde, in studiyng &amp; deuising howe hee might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the religion &amp; true faith of Iesu Christ. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
considering that we cannot possesse our soules in
this life, without bodies, nor bodies without meate,
nor meate without money, nor money vnlesse it bee
giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>: with great ioy &amp; loue he laid the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>dations of

height,<note place="margin">Eusebius.</note> in the honour of Christ; endowing them
with great store of lands and possessions, therewith
giuing great freedome vnto those places, and all the
ministers of Christ, to whome they belonged. Hee
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:5627:57"/>
built a verie solemne and sumptuous temple, in the
place where our sauiour did rise againe, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that it should farre passe all other temples of
the worlde in exceeding faire walles and marble
pillers, adorning it within most richly, with princely
ornamentes, more sumptuous than can bee expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in a fewe wordes: adding thereto solemne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of gold, siluer, and almost infinite numbers

               <p>Neither was his loue as is the loue of man, soone
hote and soone colde: or as is the loue of these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
daies, in which wee surely looke for the greate
day of doome: but hee proceeded in building and
founding of temples, and religious places, for the
maintaining of the poore disciples of Iesu Christ.
At <hi>Bethlem</hi> also where our sauiour was borne, hee
builded a temple, and that at the motion of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute
woman the Ladye <hi>Helina</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Helina.</note> the Empresse his

on the toppe of Mount Olyuet (from whence he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
vp into heauen) euen in the very top there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
founding a sanctuarie for the Church of Christ,
and at the bottome of the same mount,<note place="margin">Euseb vit.</note> in that place
where our sauiour was woont to resorte with his
Disciples,<note place="margin">Constant.</note> shee erected a verie fayre Church,
shewing vnto her sonne the waye wherein hee
should walke: not onely in founding temples for
the woorship of the Lorde, but in giuing vnto the
poore, in redeeming captiues, in clothing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with hir owne hands, in visiting the poore sicke
Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:5627:58"/>The cleare candle which this vertuous woman
held in her hand, gaue such light vnto the most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
Emperour her sonne, that imediatly after his
mothers death hee builded temples in all prouinces,
making them much more faire than they were
before.</p>
               <p>Also he built many faire and sumptuous temples
in Constantinople, he retired backe againe into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia
euen to Nicomedia, the first and chiefest citie in
Bithinia, where he built an exceeding large temple,
and no lesse beautifull; adioyning to it on all sides
verie high and faire Cloisters, within he erected a
sanctuarie of an infinit height, being in forme eight-angled,
with verie huge pillers, sumptuous arches,
bossinges and monumentes, all adorned with great
plentie of gold, brasse and other pretious mettell.</p>
               <p>Though the church of Christ and his profession
was now but yong amongest the gentils: yet he had
a special regard to the faithful patriarches of old. He
looked farre backe, and sith his sight was good hee
beheld his forefather <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; remembring that
heauenlie apparation of the holie, blessed and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Trinitie vnder the oke of the valley of Mambrie:
vnto the patriarch (for a monument) he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a faire Church to be built in the same place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edified
all the decayed Temples and monumentes,
building them verie high, and faire, destroying the
Idols of the gentils, pulling downe their altars, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie
defacing their superstitious religion, and all
other worldly states whatsoeuer were a hindrance
or disgrace to the church of Christ.</p>
               <p>It is plainle shewed by the ecclesiastical writers, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:5627:58"/>
so soone as hee had ouercomed the enemies of the
Church, hee imployed himselfe and all which hee
could do, by word, by worke, by letter and example
to reedifie the churches of the christians, or else to
build them new, leauing a most perfect patterne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
him, which all true christians ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</p>
               <p>When hee had vanquished his enemies, all the
world ouer, and was placed in the throne of the
empire, with great honor, triumph, glorie, maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
abundance of health, of wealth, of libertie to
commaund what he list: he did not swell in his hart,
with pride, but in all humilitie fell downe before the
crosse of Christ Iesus yeelding himselfe Christ his
soldier, vnder whose banner this most renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Emperour marched forwarde. Hee was not
so base minded, as to looke about him how hee
might raise great summes from the poore people, or
how hee might vnder some good pretence, exact
some paiment from the church, though his enemies
were manie &amp; mighty, his warre great, his troubles
innumerable, his charges infinite: yet hee did not
molest any one person belonging to the church,
nether would he suffer the mightiest of his princes,
once to meddle with them.</p>
               <p>He could not possiblie be perswaded to increase
his treasure with any penny which came from the
Church, or his honour, with their prerogatiue, or
his securitie with their trouble, or his credit with
their disgrace.</p>
               <p>But this foster father of the poore dispersed lambs
of Iesu Christ: he bestowed, he founded, he erected,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:5627:59"/>
on high, he reedified those temples which the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes
had pulled downe: hee restored the landes
which they had taken awaie: when hee tooke it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his handes, he did not giue one halfe to God, &amp;
kept the other halfe to himselfe, saying: I haue two
eies, the one to looke to my kingdome, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the church: But beeing a good true christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
philosopher, hee knew, that though wee haue
two eies, yet we must looke but one way, nor see but
one marke at once.<note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> We cannot at once loue both
God and Mammon, sinne and righteousnesse, the
kingdome of this world, and heauen. But hee
knew it truelie, and wayed it wisely in his hart, that
the high God of heauen did create him, that hee
blessed him, preserued him, exalted him, &amp; gaue
him all that he had.</p>
               <p>And therefore hee rendred vnto him and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
spouse, all honor, freedome, peace, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
Hee was taught by the holie fathers out of
the booke of life, that the Lord is a ielous God, he
will not part stakes with any, nor giue his honor to
any other: but of him it is said, and of him onelie:
Thine is thy kingdome, thy power, and thy glorie
for euer and euer,<note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> Amen.</p>
               <p>When the good Emperour beheld this perfect
stile of Iesu Christ, &amp; did see the ensigne, on which
it was described, together with the church of Christ
cast downe to the bare earth: hee drawing neere as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> did to the altar,<note place="margin">Act. 17. Iohn. 19.</note> wherein was written <hi>ignoto deo:</hi>
beholding but foure bare letters <hi>I. N. R. I.</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
that this was the ensigne of the vnknowen
God, not acknowledged amongest men: forthwith
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:5627:59"/>
hee humbled himselfe in the flesh, and reioiced in
the spirit, that the vnknowen God, the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
&amp; of earth, had vouchsafed him that speciall
grace to reueale himselfe vnto him. He cast downe
his banner and tooke vp the crosse of Iesu Christ
crucified: hee cast all dignities, courts, commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and kingdomes aside, and laid his honor in the
dust, in regard of the true honor of Iesus Christ, (as
wee haue mentioned) hee imploied all the giftes
which hee had giuen him, euen of mind, bodie and
goods, especially in founding, erecting, beautifying,
perfecting, adorning, priuiledging, and freeing the
church of Christ: as <hi>Eusebius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eusebius.</note> testifyeth most plainlie
in these words: <hi>Ecclesias vero Dei, incredibile est &amp; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra
omnem opinionem, &amp;c.</hi> It is incredible, and far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all mens opinions to recount what giftes and
ornamentes hee bestowed on the church of God,
what freedome, what plentie of maintenance, what
honors he gaue to them which had wholy bent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to serue the Lord in his holy temple, daily to
pray for the safety of the lande, for the honour of
the King, and the sinnes of the people.</p>
               <p>This was the expressed pietie of that first and
most Christian Emperour, and the Lord of his
great mercie redoubled his kindnesse euen into his
bosome: for hee not onely shewed him the scale
which Iacob saw, and the gate of heauen opened at
the top therereof: but hee gaue him that great and
rare gift of perseuerance in his deuout deedes, euen
vnto the end.</p>
               <p>Therfore the Lord blessed him in his pallace,<note place="margin">Deut. 16.</note> &amp; in
the field,<note place="margin">Psalm. 90.</note> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the arow which flieth in the wars abroad
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:5627:60"/>
and from false friends at home, and in such plentiful
manner, that all things which he tooke in hande did
prosper wonderfully. His victories are compared
with the conquests of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but his end was much
more happie, for when he had most honourablye
passed the full course of the life of man, &amp; enioyed
all the blessings of the earth, aboue the space of six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
yeares, not once troubled with any sicknesse of
bodie or vexation of minde, but in wisedome and
true christian loue, florished continuallye like the
greene bay tree, whose fruite doth comfort the hart
of man:<note place="margin">Psal. 103.</note> like the spreading vine, &amp; like the fat Oliue
braunch, which maketh him to haue a ioyfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance:
sith hee distilled these sweete drops of his
sincere loue, into the bosomes of the poore distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
christians of his daies: the Lord he kindled the
sparke of true christian loue in his heart, and made
him glad with the ioy of his countenance. Hee had
alwaies victorie against his enemies, conquering
from <hi>Scythia</hi> in the east, to this Ile of <hi>Britaine</hi> in the
west.</p>
               <p>Neither was the loue of the Lord extended vnto
this good Emperour in his life onely, but to the end
all men may knowe that the loue of the Lorde is not
fained, that his iustice neuer changeth, that his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
endureth for euer;<note place="margin">Gen. 17.</note> hee departed out of this life,
being full of yeares in his ripe olde age, euen about
the feast of the ascension of our sauiour Christ; and
the descension of the holy Ghost, at high noone. At
which instant (his soule leauing the mortall body
heere on earth) hee was no doubt receiued vp into

so much as the compasse of the heauens, (whose

exceedeth the earth,<note place="margin">Gen, 1. 7.</note> in giuing him his hartes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
(which is eternall blisse and felicitie) but that
which the Lord recounteth to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and

what fruite the braunch beareth in the top, but
if we be good simplicians, we will haue recourse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the roote, from whence the first life and naturall

               <p>Wherefore the Lorde of his exceeding mercy,
blessed her with a long, a prosperous, and blessed

If your owne euils will not mooue you, because
they be familiar: then once againe do but loke backe
vnto this mother vine, let the roote alone, nowe
marke the passage of her bows, &amp; the goodly sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of her branches: and you shall see manie fayre,
well plumped clusters of grapes, which though thou
canst not reache, yet disdaine not to beholde the
fruitfulnes of the vine. Though it growe beyond the
seas, yet giue it the due commendation: though the
roote thereof bee founded in simplicitie, yet it
beareth holesome beries in the toppe: though the
Lord thereof was derided with a crowne of simple
thornes: Yet the kings and princes of the earth, did
raigne by his permission. All knees shal bow to him,
who was the planter of this vine. All christian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
shall honour him: and though the wilde Bore
haue broke downe the hedge, though he haue spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the garden, &amp; rooted vp the vine, so that no one
braunch therof dooth now appeare: yet the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Emperors will not passe by, no they count more
of this wasted peece, then of all the kingdoms in the
world.<note place="margin">Exod, 3.</note> They wil put of their shooes when they enter
it, because it is holy ground: they wil cast down their
crownes of golde, from their heades, because in that
place it was said before the face of many witnesses,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:5627:62"/>
to him whose kingdome endureth for euer. Haile
King of the Iewes. Therfore <hi>Godfrie</hi> that worthy Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liner,
the king of Fraunce,<note place="margin">Iohn, 19. Godfrie Bullin.</note> after he had won the holy
land, being offered a crowne of gold to be set vpon
his head, he vtterly refused it, saying: it dooth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
me to weare a crown of gold, where my Lord
and sauiour, the Lord of lords, the king of kings, the
God of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> &amp; earth, did were a crown of thornes.
Herein we may behold the true image of a right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hart,<note place="margin">Mic, Ritius</note> for if we looke about vs, and beholde the
common sorte of base minded men, all their desire
is, not so much by vertue and prowes to attaine the
victorie (which this noble <hi>Godfrie</hi> did, first entring
the wall himselfe) as to haue the aboundant wealth
of the place, the maiesty of the crowne, the glorie of
the triumphe. Of these men it is not so, commonlie
said, as truelie verified: he which hath the most shew
without, oft times hath least within, &amp; truely manie
puppies in the world, if they were but a little seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
from the pompe and pride which they showe
without in glorious manner, themselues were ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then a feather, which is carried away with euerie
blast of winde, &amp; when it falleth down, is troden vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foote. Therefore because they haue it not within,
they are very carefull to magnify themselues, with
the outward appearaunce of that maiesty, which in
deede they haue not. These base sorte of men if they
had ouerpassed the walles with such good lucke, &amp;
once beene set on horse backe, they would haue gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped
ouer the bodies, of their poore yelding aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
they would haue beene most fierce &amp; cruell:
they would haue bathed their swords in their bloud,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:5627:63"/>
they would haue sought great glory by barbarous
cruelty, and their cheefe desire would haue beene,
with the golden cote on their backe, the scepter in
their hand, the crowne on their head, the applause
of the people, to sit in the throne of maiesty. This did
not the noble <hi>Godfrie</hi> of Bulle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, he did not so, but pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
the true treasure of right valure,<note place="margin">Adricom.</note> and perfect
vertue in his hart, he cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ted not his saftie to stand in
the death of his enemies, nor his cheefe possession
in worldly riches, nor his honor in glistering show,
nor his triumphe in magnificent troupes of noble
men, nor his maiestie in a crowne of molten mettal.
This he might haue had, but he would not, <hi>si quidem
posse &amp; nolle nobile,</hi> the noble minde ofte may, but wil
not. The vertue of the minde was his possession, and
wisedome was his guide, in this famous victorie. He
was studied in bookes of arte and wisedome, hee red
the Poet and liked his heroicall verse full well:<note place="margin">Virgilius.</note> 
                  <hi>Sice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides
musae, paulo maior a canemus: non omnes arbusta iuuant
humilesque myricae.</hi> His minde was great indeede, he
could not glorie in fleshly pleasures. He sawe this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Cittie, was but a heape of lime and sand, built
with the handes of manie poore slauishe worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
the riches, like glistering poison, infused with
the wine into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cup of gold, the whole kingdome of
Iudea, he saw was earthlie, and easie to be won at al
times, with a sworde of iron and steele. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee counted the glorie of the crowne and
scepter but a toye. And what was that then which
hee counted off? euen that for which hee came, by
which hee conquered, in which hee meant to dwell.
Ierusalem. Not that Ierusalem whose, <hi>desolata est,</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:5627:63"/>
did raise a most sweete pleasaunt note, from the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
penne: not the figured, but the perfigured,
euen the Church of Christ, and also that which is
figured by it, the heauenlie Ierusalem, the true holy
cittie, the place of eternall rest, of the true glory of
perfect triumphe, where hee might safelie and euer
saie vnto his owne soule:<note place="margin">Iudge, 4.</note> O my soule thou hast mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
valiantlie. Hee counted not of glorie, which
riseth out of the earth, and therefore most wisely,
he fixed his hart and minde, on true eternitie, which
dwelleth onely in the heauens. Hauing conquered,
he did not ascend the chaire of maiestye, that hee
might showe himselfe vnto the people, with great
glorie: but as that holie and victorious conquerour
<hi>Henrie</hi> the fifte, king of England, when with a fewe
thousands of men hee had vanquished <hi>Charles</hi> the
Dolphin of <hi>Fraunce</hi> strengthened with a royall army
(wherein was most of his nobility) he with all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
kneled downe in the feeld,<note place="margin">psal, 114.</note> holding vp his hands
to heauen, singing &amp; saying, <hi>Non nobis Dominenon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis:
sed nomini tuo da gloriam,</hi> not vnto vs O Lord, not
vnto vs, but giue the glory to thy holy name. Euen
so, this worthy conqueror of Ierusalem, though not
with the same words, yet with the like deuotion hee
humbled himselfe before the Lord: for the space of
seuen daies, walking on foote in Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, beholding
the places, where our sauiour Christ was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>uersant,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he liued here on earth, where he was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, wher
he was examined, where he was whipped &amp; scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
&amp; despitefully spit on, derided with a reed in his
hand &amp; a crown of thorns on his head. The mighty
conquerour did behold all these with his eies, and
his heart melted within him. Hee often kneeled
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:5627:64"/>
down and kissed the places where our sauiour Christ
had beene. With weeping eyes, hee looked vp into
the heauens, and his soule desired to see the Lord of
light. That the Lord of his mercie would regard him
he daily prayed with great humilitie, liberallye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
on the poore<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> In the place where the temple
was, founding a most solemne colledge for religious
men, giuing them great and large liuinges: calling
them Prebends, building them many faire houses
neere vnto the Church, for them to dwell in. These
and innumerable such like, where the fruites of this
noble minde, which beeing cleare in the sight of
God, of Angels, and of men, the Lord blessed &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered
him wonderfully, in so much that in regard of
his high prowesse and victorious conquests, to his
eternall fame, with all posteritie, he is reputed one
of the nine worthies of the world. The fountaine of
this perfect glory did first breake foorth in Fraunce,
flying ouer the highest Alpes, euen to Ierusalem,
where by the way, if wee will but diuert a little, into
Spaine, amongst some good, some bad, we shall see
one most excellent famous noble woman, a great
freend, &amp; true louer of the church. The best &amp; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
chronicles, giue her this stile. <hi>Serenissima, ac catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica
domina,<note place="margin">Ludouic. Brunus.</note> Elizabetha, Hispaniaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, ac vtriusque Siciliae, ac
Ierusalem Regina, &amp;c.</hi> The most vertuous, catholicke
lady, Elizabeth Queene of Sapine, Sicily, &amp; Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
&amp;c. This vertuous woman much like the godly
<hi>Helina,</hi> mother of <hi>Constantinus,</hi> was so greatly esprised
with the loue of Iesu Christ &amp; his church so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shee
bent all her muse &amp; cogitation, seeking daily &amp; dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlie,
how she might beate downe the heathenish
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:5627:64"/>
power of the Turkes, and infidels, therewith to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
the kingdome of Christ, and the dominions of
the Christians, to the ende that her vertuous intent
might the better prosper, she began this worke with
fasting, and often praying, with almes-deedes, and
founding of many godly temples, not leauing anie
worke vndone, which shee thought was acceptable
in the sight of God, nor any meanes vntried, which
might procure the fauour of Iesu Christ, her louing
sauiour. She turned her euery way, and looked dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
on all sides, howe and where she might best
bestow the fruitfull seed of her charitable deuotion:
her heart was so enflamed with this heauenly desire,
that she could not containe her selfe anie longer in
her pallace. In great desire she founde no rest. And
what followed? with the consent of her princely <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando,</hi>
shee mustered her men of warre, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together the power of a mightie prince, like the
auncient <hi>Debora,</hi> shee marched forwardes into the
kingdome of <hi>Granata,</hi> the greatest part whereof had
beene inhabited by the <hi>Ismaelites</hi> aboue seuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares, &amp; defended by them a warlike people
continually against the Christians: which kingdom
paid tribute to the crowne of <hi>Spaine</hi> 800000 crowns
by yeare: she counted not of the force of so huge &amp;
strong a people, neyther once regarded the greate
reuenewe which came into her treasurie that waye.
The winters diuers times were so extreme cold, that
her captains &amp; soldiers requested her most instantly
to breake vp her campe, till a more seasonable time
of the yeare: yet she answering that this was the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie
of Sathan, to hinder the woorke of the Lord,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:5627:65"/>
warred continually for the space of three yeares, till
the enemies of Christ cleane ouercome, shee made
that whole realme christian, bestowing very liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the poore,<note place="margin">M. Ritius.</note> the maimed, the captiues, the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
that were in anie distresse. In the same realme
founding and erecting many goodly churches, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and hospitals, for the poore maymed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortles
people. Wee may see by the large spreading
and plentifull yeeld, that this fruitfull braunch, did
spring from <hi>Helynaes</hi> roote. For she not onely adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
her owne person in mightie warres against the
Infidels, farther than that sexe dooth commonly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord:
but she sent into the wide west Ocean sea, to
the 7 fortunate Ilands, &amp; to the <hi>Atlantich</hi> Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
far north &amp; by west, gaining them all &amp; their
people to the christian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, which neuer heard of
Christ before. In which Ilandes, to the end that after
they had tasted the sweete milke of the Gospell of
Christ, they might be fed with stronger meat: hauing
built and erected many parish churches, besides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
goodly colledges, she founded and erected in
<hi>Granata,</hi> foure Cathedrall churches; in the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Ilandes, two: in the Indian Ilandes, three: in
Affrike she wonne <hi>Mellam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">L. Brunus.</note> a most strong defenced
towne: she wonne from the Turke the Iland <hi>Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena,</hi>
sometimes <hi>Vlisses</hi> inheritance, amongst the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians:</hi>
and most louingly she restored it to the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
whose sometimes it was. Shee wonne the Citie
and tower of <hi>Ostia,</hi> violently deteined from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
by a tyrant: restoring it vnto the Bishop of
<hi>Rome:</hi> she enacted that there should bee but one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in her dominions, one faith, one forme of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:5627:65"/>
diuine worship, and thervpon, notwithstanding the
great tribute, which came yearely into her treasurie
from the Iewes, she expelled from her dominions
all the Iewes which dwelt there, euen to the number
of six hundred thousands, also shee offered to all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasins
and Mahometists, either freely to depart out
of her dominions, or to become Christians. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
after some time and diligent preaching, within
one yeare, of the Sarasins, there were conuerted and
baptised aboue twentie hundred thousand. Lastly,
shee gaue to the adorning of the temple, built ouer
the sepulcher of our sauiour Christ, foure costly syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dones,
which whilest she was with child, she did spin
&amp; weaued afterward with hir own hands, in token of
her dutifull obedience towards him. O most fruitful
and vertuous Lady, which shunned neither colde
nor heat, nor wars, nor weapons, nor wearying of hir
selfe, nor spending her treasure, her time, her life, so
that she might increase the church of Christ, and
make his name known amongst the Gentils. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord looked down from heauen vpon her,
with his louing countenance, giuing her all that her
heart desired heere vppon earth, with most happie
successe: till at the length after her long, prosperous,
and victorious raigne, shee which had leade her life
most vertuously, yeelded her soule into the hands of
Iesu Christ, most willingly. After whose most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
death, her childrens children were raised by the
Lord, vnto the seate and title of Earles, Dukes, Kings
and Emperours.</p>
               <p>This right renowned Lady, was born in the yere of
our Lord 1448, &amp; departed this life 1504, at which
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:5627:66"/>
time also florished in England, that most vertuous
Princesse, the Ladie Margaret Countesse of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
and Darbie, mother to king Henrie the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth.</p>
               <p>This deuout Princesse beeing replenished
with heauenlie graces, well knowing that the high
honor of flesh and bloud is but a glistering cloude
of vanitie, leauing the transitorie delights of the
world, shee betooke her selfe wholly to the seruice
and worship of God. Shee fell downe often on her
knees secretlie in her closet, &amp; bowed her selfe most
humbly before him in his holie Temple, powring
out her complaints together with the penetentiall
Psalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> humblie requesting the Lord in
her prayers, that hee would looke downe with his
louing compassion on his holie Church, merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forgiuing the sinnes of his people. This shee did
daily, ordinarily, faithfully, &amp; sincerely. To her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
meditations, she adioyned often fastings, with
many thousands of mercifull deedes to the poore,
hearing their crie: willing that they might haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
vnto her, helping them to their right against
the mightiest of their Countrie, of what calling,
place, honor, or office soeuer they were. Her house
most princely and solemnly ordered, her vertuous
statutes set downe by her godly Counsel, and signed
with her owne hand (as it is to be seene at this day)
the Chappell was most reuerently regarded, of all
other places, and not of her alone, but of all her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
retinue: her hower appointed for praier,
no pleasure, no businesse, no embassage, no King
nor Keisar could once interrupt. No oth within her
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:5627:66"/>
dores, nor any word or deed which might offend the
King of heauen.</p>
               <p>And yet those vsuall recreations which might
verie well beseeme the better sort of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>Her house thus wel reformed, according to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posion
of her heauenlie mind, though she waxed in
years, yet shee walked forth of her doores into the
haruest of the Lord, wherby the way looking vp, she
viewed the height &amp; fairnes of the temples: wel thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in her wise and Godlie meditation, that there
were many goodly places, deuoid of worthy persons
and many faire walles,<note place="margin">Marh. 9.</note> but not so many well learned
as they should be. Her thought was good, her intent
godlie, her successe was happy. And what was that?
shee seeing the haruest great, and the laborers few,
forthwith shee thought to send more laborers into
the field of the Lord. And how? Shee pulled not
downe manie litle Celles to build vp one great Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
(as did the Cardinall, who liued not to see the
end of his worke once begon) but wisely waying the
great inconuenience of walles without men, men
without religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> without knowledge, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
without spirituall pastors: she founded an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
colledge in our vniuersit of Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>bridge, after
the name &amp; number of Christ and his xii. Apostles,
endowing it with goodly landes &amp; possessions, with
statutes and rules of vertuous life, to the end, that by
her meanes many good and skilf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll workmen might
goe forth into the haruest of the Lord. This branch
of true christian charitie increased so much, &amp; was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:5627:67"/>
so acceptable in the sight of God, that by the view
therof she framed a more solemne portraiture in her
breast: for not long after she stil meditating how she
might best gratify the Lord of light, who had put
downe her foes, and replenished her hart with
ioy and gladnes, according to the true rule of profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the schole of Christ, she went from vertue to
vertue, &amp; from strength to strength, euen a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her death, raising vp a most solmne &amp; sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
colledge, by her will founding therein seauenty
fellowes according to the number of the seauentie
Disciples sent out by our Sauiour Christ into the
world to preach the Gospel, for the good weale and
prosperous maintenance whereof shee gaue very
rich, ancient, faire, and good lands. Shee left them
holsome and worthie statutes, whereby a vertuous
life might bee practised, and all knowledge, aswel of
tongues as of sciences, might by her godly deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
bee more happily attained. Lastly hauing besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
great landes &amp; possessions for the maintenance
of lectures in Hebrewe, in Greeke, in Latine, in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethmetike,
Rhetorike, Logicke, Philosophie, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie,
Mathematick, Phisick, Astronomy, Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and such disputations, with other profitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
belonging to the same. She cleaped this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
colledge by the name of that Disciple whom the

many other gratious deeds elsewhere. To these good

beames so plentifully, that the ground thereof is
fresh and greene, the flowers faire, the smell sweete,
the fruit most plentiful and verie wholesom. Which
because it yeeldeth the first and sweetest taste, vnto
the spowse of Iesu Christ, hee hath blessed it as yee
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:5627:68"/>
haue heard, and it shall be blessed. And though I bee
the vnworthiest of many thousandes, to walke tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
this orchard of the Lorde: Yet if it shall please
you of your curtesie to accompany mee vnto the of
ther side,<note place="margin">Psal. 36.</note> ye shall see by the way, that wee must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
from euill, and doe good: that on this side of
the orchyard bee many faire and large trees, whose
bowes be faire, the leaues be greene, the fruit is well
seeming, but yet it hangeth so high, that it will not
come downe, the bowes are so stiffe, and the trees so
vntractable, that they will not once bend themselues
vnto the hande of the most louing spowse of Iesus
Christ.</p>
               <p>And therefore as the Lord of his mercie hath bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
those abundantly, which loue his spouse, &amp; nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
his children: so on the contrary, hee maketh
those trees barren,<note place="margin">Toby 13.</note> which yeeld him no fruite. He ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the iuice from them, so that their bowes wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
their leaues fall from them: the bodie dieth: the
tree is cut downe with his sharpe axe, or else with
great force pulled vp by the roote, and cast into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
fire.<note place="margin">Math. 3.</note> But if the ranke root of the euill tree, be
so full of naturall corruption, and venimous posion,
that it sucke out the iuice from the good trees neere
adioining thereto, which yeelde wholesome fruites
vnto all his saints, then the Lorde he sendeth forth
his spirite of mighty force and tempest, which brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the bowes,<note place="margin">Psal. 25.</note> and rendeth the tree in sunder. Hee
prepareth most exquisite tormentes, and vntolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
dolours, for all those which impouerish
his Church, which disgrace the shepheardes of his
flocke, which treade downe the sides of his simple

springeth, the vncertaine and the wretched cares of
mans life: in that euery one is set on fire, with the
sparks of infinite desires. Beeing once tottered in the
chariot of this vncertaintie: man walketh in a vayne
shadow, &amp; disquieteth himselfe in vaine. His hart is
set on vanitie, and all his purchase is the sorrowfull
fruits of the flesh. Though honor and riches haue no
stabilitie.<note place="margin">S. Bernard</note> though the strength of man is like a brused

yet man, sinful man, presumptuous, disobedient, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable
man: though his eies be weake and dim, yet
will he aduenture to looke against the radiant sunne:
though he be blind, yet will he walke: though he bee

though he be naked, yet will he offer himselfe, to the
stroke of death: though the drinke be deadly poison:
yet because the colour is good, the cup pleasant, the

               <p>Concerning this conclusion, I minde onely to

mother the holie church? pilling and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
her of her iewels, ornamentes, auncient liberties
&amp; large possessions, making her loathsome euen in

               <p>If thy louing mother tooke thee vp out of the
wildernesse, from the mouthes of manie wilde
beastes: if shee brought thee in her louing armes
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:5627:72"/>
into her house, and lapped thee warme in her owne

she sustained many great losses,<note place="margin">Honorius Solitarius,</note> &amp; harde aduentures
in bringing thee vp: if she suffered many troubles &amp;
daungers in defending thee: nay if shee haue beene
most greeuously persecuted, once, twise, thrise, nay
more than tenne times for thy sake: is it not barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
crueltie for thee when thy mother is olde, to
take her iewels from her necke, her clothes from hir
backe, her house ouer her head, her meate out of hir
hande? Wilt thou scratch the teate that gaue thee
sucke? or diminish the liuing of the Church, which
giueth the spirituall foode for the soule? though the
holy scripture had not once mentioned it, yet the
law of nature dooth threaten a dreadfull doome, to
all those which destroy their owne parents: &amp; God
the Creator of nature it selfe, dooth neuer leaue it
vnpunished.</p>
               <p>Let vs propound vnto our selues, the life, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
the dignitie, the blessed memorie, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
glorie, of those worthie princes already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.
And on the contrary the sinister beginnings,
the euill successe, the miserable endes of all those,
which neglected the glorie of God, and the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
estate of his Church,<note place="margin">Reg. 4.</note> which of all Christians,
especially of all true nobilitie, ought most to bee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred.
Doe but lift vp your eie, and looke at tbose
which haue shaked their head at Sion, &amp; by shaking

little,<note place="margin">Athanasius.</note> on those gracelesse ympes, &amp; after many great
plagues and destructions sent on them, ye shall see
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:5627:72"/>
the clowde cleane vanished, and in the house of the
wicked no man lefte. His habitation shalbe voide,
and there shall no man remaine to saie, with the
olde Prophet, alas my brother, alas my vnckle, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
my loouing father. Nowe hauing bent our eyes
vnto the viewe of sundrie examples, let vs looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ages past, and see if euer the Godly were vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie
destitute, or that the enemies of the Church
of God, euer continued long in honour, or if those
which anie waie impared the Church, prospered
afterwardes in their generations. Come and see: nay
I pray you reede and vnderstand, that the Lord hath
alwaies beene most ielous, ouer his beloued spouse.
Tell mee if you bee so olde, or your memorie so
good, can you name anie what so euer, which at
anie time in anie nation, diminished the state, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
the honour, the safetie of the church of Christ,
and scaped the handes of the almightie? Dauids
eating of the shewe breade, in the dayes of <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
the high Preest, is aunswered by the Lord of
truth, extreame necessitie droue him therevnto: and
yet (as the learned write) hee might more safely doe
it, because he was both a Prophet and a king, herein
prefiguring the person of a sauiour Christ, who was
a king, a preest, and a Prophet. But let vs proceede,
plainly saying the sooth of our conclusion. The Lord
in executing his iudgementes, hath no respecte of
persons neither pardoneth he this greeuous volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
sinne, of detracting from the Church, so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
as hee dooth other sinnes of infirmitie.</p>
               <p>But rather hee sheweth his most seuere iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
against those which take the liuing of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:5627:73"/>
from the Church, and impropriate the same vnto
themselues, their wiues and their children. Ely was a
goodlie old Priest aud verie learned.<note place="margin">Ely.</note> He was so belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of the Lord, that by the mouth of God, hee and
his seede, were appointed to minister in the house of
God, hee had the freedome and prerogatiue of the
Priests: and he onelie had the disposing of the Arke,
the house, the sacrifice of God in his daies. Till at the
length together with the vse of holie rites, thorough
the hope of small gaine, hee suffered great abuse to
enter into the house of God: in that the sonnes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forgetting God, &amp; the due reuerence which they
ought vnto his holy sacrifice: applied the vse thereof
more to the feeding of their owne selues, then to the
solemne and reuerend pacifying of the Lord, for the
sinnes of the people. They seldome offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
&amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> any of the people came to offer vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, whilest the meat was boiling the Priests
boy came, &amp; hauing a fleshhook in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d, he thrust
it deep into the caudron, &amp; what piece soeuer came
vp, that the Priest tooke to himself. This did they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all the people of Israel, which came to sacrifice in
the house of God at Silo. Yea, &amp; before they burnt
the fat, the priestes boy came to him which offered,
saying: giue me a portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, that I may rost for the priest,
I will not stay to take boiled flesh at thine hands: but
I must haue it rawe. To whom when he which offred
vnto the Lorde, answered not so, but (according to
the custome) let the fat be burnt first, &amp; take then at
your pleasure. To whome the boy replied, nay but if
thou wilt not giue it me presentlie, I will take it whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou wilt or no. Herevpon the sins of the sonnes
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:5627:73"/>
of Elie, was grieuous in the sight of God, because
they being sinfull flesh, tooke to their owne vse, that
which was bestowed on the sacrifice of the God of
heauen. Elie heard all those things of his sonnes, and
more then that: and he said vnto them verie mildlie:
howe is it my sonnes that I heare of such wickednes
committed by you against the Lord? doe so no more
my sonnes, doe so no more. <hi>Consuetudo peccandi, tollit
sensum peccati.</hi> They sinned still by dailie custome
without regard: they offended the Lord without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse:
the old father spake to his sonnes sometimes,
but so louing lie, that hee hated his children: that hee
fed their humour, and nourished them in their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
wickednes, forgetting that truth which he spake
with his lips: If one man sinne against another, God
may be pacified for them both, but if man sin against
God, who shal intreat for him, or make sufficient sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>?
This mild old man waxed towards his end.
As is the vse of natural fathers, he loued his sons too
much, too vehementlie, &amp; too childishlie, in that he
was loather to loose their fauning looks, then the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
of the Lord. Alas (say some) you must beare with
nature, he was verie old, and his greatest ioy was his
sons. Was his ioy here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> earth? And did he reioice
more in his fleshly childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, then in the true seruice of
the Lord? because he loued the issu of his flesh more
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the glory of God; &amp; maintained his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> with
y<hi rend="sup">â€¢</hi> which was bestowed on the worship of god, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t a doble embassage vnto him. First y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
man of God told him plainly after this maner: Thus
saith the lord: did not I plainly appear vnto y<hi rend="sup">â€¢</hi> house of
thy father, when he was in Egypt in Pharaos house,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:5627:74"/>
and chose him out of all the tribes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> of Israell, to
bee my Preest, to offer vpon mine alter, and to burne
incense,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.</note> and to weare an Ephod before mee? and I
gaue vnto the house of thy father, all the burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes,
made to mee by fire, of the children of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell.
Wherefore haue you kicked against my sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and mine offeringe which I commaunded in
my tabernacle: and honourest thy children aboue
mee, to make your selues fatte of the first fruites of
all the offeringes of my people Israell? Wherefore
the Lord God of Israell saith: I saide that thine
house, and the house of thy father should walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mee for euer. But nowe the Lord saieth: it shal
not bee so, for them which honour me, them I will
honour. And they which despise mee, shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised.
Beholde the day shall come that I will cut of
thine arme, and the arme of thy fathers house, and
there shall not bee an olde man in thine house, and
thou shalt see thine enimie, in the habitation of the
Lord &amp;c. And this shall bee a signe vnto thee: thy
two sonnes <hi>Ophney</hi> and <hi>Phinees,</hi> shall both die in one
daie. This was the first Embassage, and the second
was like vnto it, denounced by the childe Samuell
in this manner: Behold I will doe a thing in Israell,
that the eares of all which heare it, shall tingle. In
that day, I wil bring all the plagues against Elie, and
against his house, which I haue already determined:
and I will iudge his house for eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r and the iniquitie
of his house shal not be done away, with offeringes
and oblations for euer. Which when Elie heard, he
being stricken with greese of hart, hee saide: it is the
Lord, let him doe as it seemeth best in his eies. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:5627:74"/>
after these offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ces of the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s of Ely, against
the Lord &amp; his holy worship, &amp; the prophaning of
the tabernale, which was a figure of the church: the
Philistnes moued battail against Israel, they won the
field, they tooke the arke of the Lord: &amp; in the same
day <hi>Oppney</hi> and <hi>Phines</hi> the sons of Elye were slaine in
the battaile. At which time, Ely sitting vppon a cell,
trembling for feare of the arke, then gone forth into
the battaile, he beeing blind, in the euening he hard
a sorowfull noise, through out the whole cittie, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
&amp; mourning &amp; great lamentation: euen in such
sorte, that he sent presently to know the cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
In the same instant a messenger came running
from the feelde in hast, telling him that all Israel was
that day discomfited in the battaile: great effusion of
bloud in the middest of Israell, with the death of his

of the Lord against those, which take awaie

But if man sin against God, if he diminish the glory

his father,<note place="margin">Exod: 20.</note> his bretheren, his citie, his countrie, where
his wickednes is suffred, shal be grieuouslie punished
by the hand of God in peace, &amp; vanquished by the

which light on those, that diminish or alter the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
&amp; godlie deuotions which true christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

on the Church. Though their hearts be so harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that they doe not feare, and their conscience so
brauned that they cry to those, which shew forth the
dreadfull iudgements of the Lord, in this case: Talke
on, giue me the goods: &amp; therein take the fat of the
Church liuings, and leaue the leane for those which
minister at the Altar of the Lord: Yet let them assure
themselues,<note place="margin">S. Pet: 2.</note> that the Lord wil come, &amp; wil not defer,
and till he come he hath laid vp a heauie iudgement
for them, against the daie of distresse. In the battaile
they shall be discomforted, their sonnes shall perish
with the sword, themselues shall die the same night,
&amp; they shal know that it is the Lord. He wil be serued
first, &amp; none but he. He wil haue the best of our lands
goods &amp; children, &amp; none but he. He will haue the
Kingdome, the power, &amp; the glorie, &amp; none but he.
There shall no iniquity remain in his house. Neither
is he like to sinful man, that he wil grant childish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations,
contrarie to his own laws. He hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no priuiledge of euil life, to anie person whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
If the King offend, hee spareth not his goods, his
lands, his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, his life, his honor. If the people sin,
he raiseth a strong &amp; strange people against them in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:5627:75"/>
war, or sendeth a secret pestilence to destroy them at
home in peace. If the priest conuert the offerings of
the Lords worship, vnto the maintenance of his wife
&amp; children, though it be that good old man Elie, yet
the people for whom he praieth shal flie before their
enemies, his sons shall die on the edge of the sword,
he shal break his neck down backward, the ark of the
Lord shal be taken by the vncircu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cised Philistines, &amp;
(that which is the core of this most grieuous plague
sore) the glory of the Lord shal depart from the land.

that he had some conscience, in taking some of the
vessels &amp; not all, &amp; in vsing them only in the temple
of his gods, not in his owne house. He was a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Emperor, &amp; as his dominions were greater then
those of other princes, so was his hart lift vp in prid,
aboue all other men: therefore the Lord he put the
mighty man from his seate,<note place="margin">Daniel 4.</note> hee disarmed him of all
his power, he made him naked of al his glory, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued
the crowne of golde from his head, &amp; that
which argueth what manner of men they be, which
laie violent handes on the temple of God, he tooke
from out his brest, the vnderstanding hart of man, &amp;
placed therein a brutishe beastly heart together with
the shape of an Oxe, which hath hornes and hoofs,
and eateth haie. After this hee tooke him from the
princely pallace, and turned him lose into the wilde
soile, euen amongst the beasts of the wood. His bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was wet with the dewe of heauen, his drinke was
the water of the puddle: &amp; his solace was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

                  </gap>ad brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the

                  </hi> should be brought into him: that
he &amp; his princes, his nobles, wiues &amp; concubines, in
a brauery might drinke in them. It was so don. They
did eate and drinke in the vessels, belonging to the
temple of the Lorde: they praised their idoll Gods:
but by the way, the wine which tasted sweete to his
lips, came cold to his hart. For in the same moment
as hee was drinking: right ouer against the candle
standing on the table: there appeared the fingers of
a mans hand, writing on the wal: which once discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by the king himselfe: hee beheld it with a gastly
looke, and fearefully esprised with the letters, which
appeared in his sight, his colour chaunged, his heart
panted, his spirit was troubled, his raines were loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and his legs shrunke vnder him. Straightway in
great hast hee sent for <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Daniel. 5.</note> who read the writing,
which was this: <hi>Mane, Techel, Phares:</hi> expounding
these three words in this manner: <hi>Mane,</hi> that is, God
hath numbred thy kingdom, &amp; broght it to an end:
<hi>Techel,</hi> thou art weighed in the ballaunce, &amp; thou art
found too light: <hi>Phares,</hi> thy kingdome is diuided, &amp;
giuen to the <hi>Medes</hi> &amp; <hi>Persians.</hi> This was the sentence
of the Lord against that mightie king, for translating
his vessels appointed for his holy sacrifice, vnto
prophane vse: &amp; the execution was not long defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
for the selfe same night in which he presumed
to drinke in those holy vessels, hee was slaine in his
owne house. Though the Lord do not alwaies sende
such manifest &amp; speedy reuenge on all those, which
take the goods of the holy church vnto their priuate
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:5627:77"/>
vses: yet let them which are guiltie thereof beware,
that they abuse not too much, the merciful &amp; louing
patience of the Lord, for his sword is sharpe, &amp; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
swiftly, betwixt the soule and the spirit, like the
lightning breaking out of the clowd. Think not that
he is forgetfull, because the fact is nowe past: or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust,
because vengeance yet lieth hid: or partial, that
without repentance he should suffer any sin to scape
vnpunished, in any person whatsoeuer, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world vnto this day. <hi>Dauid</hi> was a holy
and a kingly prophet, a man euen according to Gods
owne hart: his eies beheld the vaine beautie of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
wherewith his hart was straight inflamed, and
set on fire within his brest: hee tooke his poore sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
wife, and sent her husband to wars, where hee
was slaine: he loued, he killed, and after that he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
the woman, &amp; had by hir a goodly boy. What
followeth in the text of holy scripture? the prophet
<hi>Nathan</hi> brought him a heauie message fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the Lord,
saying: it is euen thou; thou hast sinned against
the Lord and thy poore subiect: thou hast slaine <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi>
the <hi>Hethite,</hi> and married his wife: wherefore the
sworde shall not departe from thine house for euer.
This was the defiance of the Lorde sounded against
king <hi>Dauid,</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Nathan</hi> the prophet, to
which the great alarum was not vnlike. For the Lord
did visite the little childe, which he had by <hi>Vrias</hi> wife
with sicknesse. For whom <hi>Dauid</hi> prayed vnto the
Lorde most instauntly, that hee would spare the
childe. Hee prayed long, hee fasted religiously,
hee mourned, hee remained in the darke; hee put
on sackecloth and ashes; hee lay vppon the colde
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:5627:77"/>
ground; his noble counsellors could not intreate
him to take any meate for seuen dayes, in the ende
whereof, the Lord tooke away the fruit of his sinfull
delight, euen the childe vnlawfully begotten, which
he so entirely loued.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, though the Lorde blessed him with
<hi>Salomon,</hi> yet to shewe that the fight of the rereward,
should bee no lesse mortall than the sodaine alarum,
giuen before to the maine battaile: the Lorde stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp his owne sonne in armes against him, and
armed the people so stoutly with rebellious heartes,
in desire of his destruction: that it was saide plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
before the king: that all Israell were vp in armes
against him, and sought to destroy him.</p>
               <p>This tumult of the people was so sodaine, so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent,
and so outragious, for the time, that the
king for feare, fledde out of his owne pallace, and
durst not staye therein, though hee had shewed
great signes of hartie repentaunce: and the Lorde
had sayde, that hee would remember his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
promised vnto him: the retreate was not fully
sounded, but the Lorde punished the sinnes of the
king together with the death of seuentie thousand
of his subiects, destroyed with the plague which
hee sent amongst them. Whereby all men maye
learne to feare the Lorde, knowing that hee is
iust and holie, immutable, and not as man is, to
bee pleased with a faire worde: but euen amongst
his chosen children, hee sendeth his deuouring
sworde to cut of the roote of their sinnes: and not to
them onely, but to their children and childrens chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:5627:78"/>Concerning this wee haue a cleare example in
<hi>Achab</hi> king of Israell, who when hee could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
poore <hi>Naboth</hi> to depart vnto him his vineyard
and the inheritance of his forefathers: hee lay down
on his bed, all sick with griefe turning his face from
the companie towards the wall, he sighed sorrowful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but the phisition was at his elbow. For there was a
commission presently sent forth, a court called, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
examined, <hi>Naboth</hi> condemned, brought forth,
executed.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Achab</hi> heard of this, he rose from his bed,
he descended and tooke possession. But the Lord he
sounded forth his trompet of defiance against him
by the mouth of <hi>Helias</hi> saying,<note place="margin">Regum 3.</note> hast thou killed and
taken possession? behold, in the same place where
the dogges licked the bloud of <hi>Naboth,</hi> they shall also
licke thy bloud, and I will cut of the line of thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie,
so that I will destroy from <hi>Achab</hi> euery one
that maketh water against the wall, <hi>Achab</hi> hearing
this, was wonderfullie sorie and vexed in his hart, so
that he rent his garment, fasting and praying in sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
and ashes. Therefore the Lord had an eie to
his penitent sorrow, and recomforted him by the
mouth of <hi>Helias,</hi> saying. Because thou hast humbled
thy selfe at my voice, this euill shall not come in thy
daies, but in thy sonnes daies; and yet not one iot of
the word of the Lord failed, concerning his death.
For after three years, there arose great wars betwixt
Israel and the Ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ians, in which king <hi>Achab</hi> being
sore wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ded vnder the side with an arrow, the bloud
ran down into the chariot, and he died: and they wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
the Chariot in the poole of Samaria, and the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:5627:78"/>
dogs licked his bloud, in the selfe same place, where
hee spilt the bloud of the innocent <hi>Naboth.</hi> His el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
sonne <hi>Ioram</hi> was partaker of this punishment
sent from God,<note place="margin">Reg. 4.</note> for hee was shot betwixt the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by the handes of <hi>Iehu,</hi> being cast out of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot

               <p>When she should haue bin taken vp, there was

               <p>Lastly (that wee may behold the seuere iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord against those which take away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of Children behind him, euen 70. sonnes in Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria:
so that it seemed verie likely in the eie of man,
that hee should neuer want issue to sitte vppon

destroyed them all:<note place="margin">Reg. 4.</note> their heads were cut of at his

not to trust in the multitude of their landes, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
and riches, or to hope too much in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of their carnal bodie: but to way the seuere
iudgementes of the Lord against all those which
neglect his honour, and which through a greedie
desire of earthly possession, with the hasard of their

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:5627:79"/>
and bretheren, for whom the Lord Iesu the

wisely, and way this conclusion truly in their hart,
that if the Lord did so seuerely punish <hi>Achab</hi> (and
yet not the thousand part which hee deserued) for
the taking away of one of his subiectes vineyardes,
which lay verie commodiouslie for him: that hee
died vnfortunately in the battaile, his Queene was
eaten with dogges, his children euen 70. be headed
all in one day: what grieuous punishment hath hee
prepared for those which take the house &amp; vineyards
of his beloued spouse? which impouerish his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of whom he hath said, hee which hurteth you,

the exceeding great blessings which the Lord
continuallie powreth on them that mainteine his

those, which either decay his holy church, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish

               <p>Me thinks our eies should not be so dim in this

so fleshlie that wee should not vnderstand and the will of

that man is created for the glory of God, not for his

that the goods of the church, came to vs by the

to vs &amp; our succession. We gaue you them

Who presenteth a noble man with a saire horse, or
a goodly dogge, &amp; after the acceptance of the same
with hartie thanks, challengeth his gift again for his
owne? If his manners faile thus farre, yet is it right
or reason so to doe? But if wee giue vnto the Lorde

the same with worde and deede, with witnes, hande

that before the Lordes face, and in the sight of all
his saints, we will say: giue me my goodes; or these

thou breakest that, which will not bend: leauing the
good country simplicitie; entring the vsual course of
this flattering worlde, forgetting the plaine honest

very well learned: thou canst the rule to catch on all

With these two wings of violence, of a sodain

the highest temples and mightiest mountaines, to
which before thou durst scarce lift vp thine eyes,

groundes adioyning to the same. There be liuinges
good store, saith one, &amp; if the learned wil seek, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

way, if it were so plaine as it seemeth short. But what

if the best hownd in the whole kennell, bee not the

death of the Hare. And yet in our moral, the course
is not so hard, nor halfe so vncertaine. For when the

atchieued, who so hard harted that will not bestow
it on the best. Is it <hi>detur meliori,</hi> or <hi>detur pulchriori?</hi> I

Gladly would I learne that kinde of seeking. If his
wished preferment lye in the court, he must prouide
a friend in the court, who is alwaies better than the
pennie in purse. What if it be in the countrie? these
things haue all one certaine rule. But as the giuer is,
so is the way of obtaining. Then the learned are in
worse case than they were before, because the way is
more vncertaine: for hee must sometimes sue to the
good, honest Farmer in the Countrey, who kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
a golden angell better than a Latine word,
sometimes to the gentleman in the Citie, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to his wife, his sonne, his daughter, his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin,
his steward, his factor: sometimes to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

come to the matter. And when he hath done,
if hee bee not so well seene in secret Philosophie,
that hee can talke learnedlie with the secretarie:
his studying at the Vniuersitie so many yeares, his
riding into the countrie, the citie, the court, his

               <p>Is this the seeking which you meane? and must

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:5627:84"/>
wee shall soone perceiue great riuers flowing
from the same. For first of all in the daies of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ; let vs marke what was concerning the
Church: what ought to haue beene, and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
The Lord of light was made a man; he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
amongst vs in the habit of man; he was vsed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
hardly;<note place="margin">Phil. 2<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </note> he liued in very meane estate; he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiled,
persecuted, whipped, despited, with mockings
&amp; mowings, with spittings, with a reede in his hand,
and a crowne of thornes on his head, And lastlie with
a most bitter and cursed death for our sakes, and for
our saluation. Likewise also the Disciples; though
they preached the glad tidinges of the Gospell, with
the great power, vertue, and Maiestie of the holie
Ghost; yet concerning the worlde, they were poore,
simple, contemptible, persecuted men. In so lowe a
valley, it pleased the Lord, to sow the first seed of his
Gospel, and to the end that the Roofe of the Church
might afterwardes rise farre and high aboue, first of
all, he laid the foundation in great humilitie farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe.
Thus it was then, and worldlie minded men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
more the prosperitie of their bodies, then
the health of their soules, and the safetie of the holie
church: misconstruing that voice of truth, <hi>Vos autem
non sic:</hi> say, that as the simplicitie of the Church was
then;<note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> euen so it ought to bee now in the flourishing
state of the Gospel. Wherein I wish them to beware
that they looke not on this Christall mirrour too
much, or that they hold it not too neere, for fear lest
their fleshlie breath doe dimme the same. Remooue
the sight of the glasse a little, and let vs see what was
then, and what ought to haue beene; they contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:5627:85"/>
the Gospell of grace: they crucified the Lord of
light, and cruelly persecuted his disciples: what were
these?<note place="margin">Acts. 2.</note> according to the prophecy, the Kings and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of the earth, euen Pontius Pilat, high deputie of
Iurie: Herode the Tetrarch, of Galilee: with the high
priests, the Iudges, the scribes and the pharises, and
the whole multitude of the Iewes: so that in these
daies, the Church was trodden downe, the poore
Ministers contemned, afflicted, persecuted, by that
faithlesse generation. But nowe you which so much
allude, to those darke daies of persecution in the
Church. Doe but alter the case a little, and suppose
that the Emperour, and Pontius Pilate his deputie;
Annas and Caiphas, with the rest of the Rulers in
those daies, had beleeued in Christ, and confessed
plainely that he was the Sauiour of the world: that he
created them, that he came to redeeme them, that he
nourished them in their mothers wombe: that hee
perserued the breath in their nostrels,<note place="margin">Iohn 1.</note> and that it was
he, by whom they shoulde bee either exalted or put
downe, either accepted or reiected, either saued or
condemned in the daie of iudgement. If this had bin
so: let vs thinke what a strange metamorphosis, had
followed in their doings: how would they haue falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
downe before the Lorde? with what humilitie would
they haue cast down their crownes, &amp; scepters at his
feete? with what ioy woulde they haue exalted the
Lord of light? what honour &amp; magnificence would
they haue yeelded to that heauenly bridegrome, and
the children of the marriage? what great freedomes
and foundations, would they haue bestowed on his
Church &amp; litle flocke for euer? No say some, though
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:5627:85"/>
Iupiters priests, with the whole City (when they did
see the mighty woorking of the holy Ghost, by the
hands of Paul &amp; Barnabas) would haue sacrificed to
them, &amp; giuen them the honour &amp; title of gods. Yet
they refused it, knowing that the true worshippers
would worship him in truth an spirit: outwardly yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him but meane reuerence, belonging to simpler
state. Neither would he or his disciples, haue accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of any worldly honour,<note place="margin">Iohn. 18.</note> sith he said plainely, my
kingdome is not of this worlde. As was the roote of
humilitie, so were the braunches, springing from the
same. As the Lord though he would not openly bee
proclaimed a king, yet he had ordained in his secrete
counsell, that the Church shoulde haue hir time of
infancie, of childhoode, of strong age, of florishing,
and decaying: Euen so it pleased him, that this seede,
shoulde not bee both sowne and reaped in one daie:
that it should not first spring and bring foorth seede
in one houre: and that the Church shoulde not bee
founded and perfected, both in one minute. Though
by diuine prouidence the Church was in the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
that time of our Sauiours beeing heere on earth
and his Apostles, and though the space of three

them but marke a litle, what the first Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

care he had of their good estate, and prosperitie: not
that they shoulde goe vp and downe in his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on foote in threed bare coates: But he gaue them
freedome, title and honour, and to the ende that it
might endure when he was dead and rotten (an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
for all christian Princes, which shoulde suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede

them with large and ample possessions: with
a christian care he reedified the temples which were
wasted by the heretiques and Infidels: building and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:5627:86"/>
raising them an exceeding great height. He establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
all thinges concerning Christian religion, and
the professours of the same,<note place="margin">Const. M.</note> in most honourable and

most aboundantlie, with perfect health, with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

al which he did desire in this world, and in the world
to come, with euerlasting felicitie. If the life of this

plaine resembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce of the end of the world. As it was
in those daies, euen so it shall be immediatelie before
the ending of the world: they cried awaie with him,
they tooke away his coate, and parted his raiment:
they crucified him, and all those which professed his
name:<note place="margin">Acts 7.</note> they stoned Saint Steeuen the Archdeacon,
and Iames the Cosin of our Lorde: who after he had
beene placed Bishop of Ierusalem, manie yeares,
most rebelliouslie they pulled him out of his chaire,
casting him downe from a pinacle of the Citie wall,
and when hee laie gasping on the earth, most barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouslie
they dasht out his braines with a Fullers
clubbe.</p>
               <p>These were the first which sought the decaie of
the Church of Christ.<note place="margin">Euseb. 2,</note> And what destenie followed
this euill aduenture? The Lorde brought a huge Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
into their Citie, with a destroying plague, and
consuming famine, with ciuill sedition, slayings and
wastings, domesticall murders, inward anguish bred
by ciuill discord, so that through feare without, and
deadlie anguish within, there died manie thousands,
nay hundreth thousandes, within the walles of that
Citie. Many thousands laie gasping in the streete for
breath of life: many laie groning ruthfully in their
houses: many as they were putting vp their hands to
their mouth to feed themselues, were slaine with the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:5627:87"/>
deuouring sword of the seditious, which destroied so
on al sides of the City, that the bloud of those which
were slaine within by themselues, came running out
at the gutters of the gates, and out at the sinkes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
the walles. The noble men were fain to eat
their owne flesh from off their armes: and that good
auncient gentlewoman which when the wars began
fled to that Citie for succor, with hir litle infant suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
on hir brest, after hir house had been often ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacked
&amp; spoiled by the seditious,<note place="margin">Iosep. Bel. Iu.</note> hir men &amp; maides
slaine in hir house, hir victuals cleane consumed, hir
colour wan, hir milke and bloude dried vp, hir bodie
fainting with hunger: shee was compelled to thinke
an vnnaturall thought in hir heart, and to execute a
deadly deuise with hir hands: shee tooke hir litle boy
now sucking on hir breast: she held it a part from hir
with both hir handes, beholding the sweete counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of hir prety childe: the boy smiled: but alas the
mothers teares did shewe hir heauy cheare, it were
too much griefe to rehearse the mothers sorrowfull
voice, in this wofull distresse, vttered to hir sonne.
Shee laid the litle infant on the table before hir face:
hir trickling teares redoubled their course enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably:
after many distillations sent down from
hir weeping eies, shee saith vnto hir litle infant: my
little boy, the childe of mee a most vnfortunate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
I nourished thee within my wombe, and haue
fedde thee a long time with the milke of my breasts:
and nowe thou must bee meate for mee thy wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and most distressed mother. With these
words, hir knife infixed into the breast and bowels of
hir little infant, the bloud springing vp into hir face,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:5627:88"/>
shee dismembred, shee rosted, shee eate of him: the
smell whereof beeing once entered the nostrels of
those seditious souldiers; they brake open the dore,
they came rushing in: running into hir, they pulled
the meate violently out of hir hande, eating it most
greedily.<note place="margin">Daniel. 9.</note> Of which because shee had no more store
ready, they cruelly murthered that poore old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman.
To this and a hundred thowsand like mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
seldome heard of, succeeded the destruction of
the whole nation, with the vtter destruction of the
City, the walles, the Temple, and all the auncient
Monumentes of the most famous Kinges of Israell.
Though no Christian hart can take pleasure in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this way, yet sith wee are entered into it, let vs
passe on a litle further, and wee shall easilie see that
this sinne of defacing of the profession of Iesu Christ
and his holy Temples here on earth, is so hainous, so
contumelious, so heathenish in the sight of God;
that he neuer suffreth it to lie long vnpunished. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be the plagues and punishments sent vpon the
earth, for this sinne of spoiling the Temples of the
Lorde due to ordinary or common infirmities, inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by the course of nature vnto man: but as it is a
much more hainous and grieuous offence, for the
child, vnnaturally to despoile his owne father which
begot him into this light, and cruelly with bloudy
handes to take his life from him: euen so, sith the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
from the Church, is the despoiling of God our
Creatour: The punishment sent on such offendours
must needs be much more grieuous then that which
vsually is sent to man, for his vsuall and naturall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.

the open enemies, which sought with force of

Christ, had shewed their force against the church:
stoning some, and imprisoning others, whipping,
scourging,<note place="margin">Acts 5.</note> banishing, cruelly persecuting the rest:
Then Sathan striking saile, &amp; drawing in his ensigne
of open warre, and defiance, sought by pollicie to
keepe down the church of Christ, now springing in
the east. He raised sundry damnable heresies, which
increased so long, &amp; intangled so many poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:
that the church of Christ which whilom did
shine most cleare and bright, by the mistie cloudes

               <p>This opinion entred the Christian flocke, infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

Surely those men were worldly wise men, and in

               <p>This may wel be true (say some) &amp; yet the sequel
not so sure, sith this irreligious Emperour, most
Atheisticallie opposed himselfe against Christ, and
in defiance of him spoiled his pore flocke, and
the holie church, which they tooke for a sanctuarie.
But to destroy the temples of the heathen, &amp; to fier
the churches of heretickes, and those which are
not of a good Religion, that is no such offence
before God. But rather I thinke wee ought to pull
them downe.</p>
               <p>You thinke, yea, and I do constantly affirme the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:5627:90"/>
contrary. In this difference of opinions, let the art of
Logicke bee the framer of our arguments, and the
rules of eternall truth, our direction to the same.
Let selfe wil bath her selfe in her owne bloud. Let
arrogancie drownd her selfe in the deep: let ignorant

               <p>And what be they? In great mislike of many good

               <p>In mine opinion Byshops, Deanes, cathedrall
churches, &amp;c. are not to be allowed, sith they sauour
of the constitutions of men, and are not commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the word. If you will ioyne reason with true
iudgement, and let iudgement guide the vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of opinion, you shal easily perceaue, that in mine
opinion is no great good argument. Looke into
true art, and you shall soone see, that as vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
is the internall beginning of the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratiue
syllogisme (whose conclusion is <hi>aeternae veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi>
vnpossible to be refuted) and as fansie is the
internal beginning of Sophistical arguments (which
flie at the presence of the former, euen as the shadow

               <p>Now let the Reader iudge which of these two
argumentes is the stronger.</p>
               <p>The absurditie of this conclusion flowing from
the fountaine of ignorant arrogancie, teacheth vs,
that these mens opinions is more than the truth:

               <p>Herein wee must vnderstand that opinion is their

               <p>Therefore the constitutions of Byshoppes, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
Deanes, Cathedrall Churches, &amp;c. and
all other Discipline, orders, constitutions, and

               <p>This is a plaine vndoubted truth, and the gates

                  <note place="margin">S. Angust.</note> saith Saint <hi>Augustine:</hi> Not the words, but

               <p>Therfore these subtill deceiuers which cry out for

disclaime the regiment set downe by our most grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Princesse: they do therein most presumptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abuse her maiestie, and all her subiectes. This fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
error is not content with bare saying, but it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
proceedeth to defending and prouing, after this
manner: Things once abused by superstition and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie,
ought not to bee vsed in the woorship of
Christ: therefore Churches &amp;c. ought to be pulled
downe, and vtterly abolished. When I heare this
principle so often repeated by them, I think on that
prouerbe: <hi>Facile quae cupimus, credimus:</hi> and when I
confer therewith the manner of their reasoning, I
remember <hi>Tindarus</hi> his short salutation to his master
<hi>Salue,<note place="margin">Plautus.</note> atque vale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So when I behold their false propositions, which
they take as granted, and their vntagged arguments
therevnto annexed: I cannot imagine, that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
entered further into the Logicke schooles, than
the threshould: or beeing there; that euer they did
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:5627:92"/>
once behold that mistresse of Arts and Sciences: or
if they did once see her grace and countenance, yet
they neuer saluted her: or if they did salute her, it
was but <hi>Salue atque vale. Ex vnguibus leonem:</hi> the first
view of this daungerous error, doth discouer the vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
of the monster.</p>
               <p>Suppose these seeming saints were so indeede, &amp;
their opinion true: yet doe but view a while, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
taile which she draweth after her, and you shall
soone espie a thousand <hi>Hidraes</hi> heades arising out of

               <p>If you be so hard harted, that you will not beleeue
vnlesse you see; then cast away the blinking eyes of
fonde opinion, and with the cleare sight of true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
behold that mirrour of heauenly truth,
which by the beautifull shew of sundry portraitures,
teacheth vs plainely, that things abused by supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
may be well, wisely, and religiously vsed in the
church of God. The Gentiles they had their gods, to
whome they built solemne temples, offered daily sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
many praiers, &amp; petitions. Therfore should
not <hi>Salomon</hi> builde a most solemne temple vnto the
God of heauen and earth? The example confirmeth
that rule: <hi>Quarum rerum est vsus, earum etiam est abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
&amp; contra.</hi> Things well vsed, may bee abused: and
things abused, may be well vsed.</p>
               <p>The truth of this generall is euident by sundrie

most truly in these words: <hi>Omnis Christi actio est nostra
instructio,</hi> that which our sauiour Christ did in this
case, that ought to bee our example. And what did
he? when the fulnes of time was come, that the vaile
should be remoued, &amp; that the sacrifice of the Iewes
should cease: because the light, the body, the thing
it selfe, by that prefigured, was now come; and that
it was impietie now any longer to bee circumcised:
the Lord of light did not destroy the temple, pulling
off the lead, breaking downe the wals, the glasse, the
timber, thrusting out the Scribes &amp; Pharises, taking
their lands &amp; liuings into his own hands,<note place="margin">Math. 21.</note> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the abuses thereof, hee whipped the money

do not read that euer he once persuaded them to pul
downe the great huge temple of <hi>Diana.</hi> And yet
that the Gospell was therein preached, it is manifest
by sundry histories: as also in that it is recorded, that
this Apostle euen when he was so old that he could
scarce goe, being taken vpon mens shoulders, least
the throng of people should oppresse him, and to the
ende his voice might be heard the better, as he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

Nether is this thing strange, or any whit to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
sith it hath bene the manner of all Christians, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
from the Apostles time to this daie, to saue and
not to destroy, to conuert, and not to subuert, to
reduce those temples to the seruice of the true
God, and not to subduce them into our owne
purses. If the matter were doubtfull, I might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alledge diuers testimonies out of the auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and latter writers for the same. But in that
I studie rather to edifie the well disposed, than to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie

&amp; their Disciples. And not onely the Iewish syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
but in the temples of the heathen, at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,

which after it was woonne and inhabited by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasins
aboue sixtie yeares, and the church thereof
polluted,<note place="margin">A drico</note> with their Mahometicall idolatrie al that

               <p>Afterward it was conuerted to the vse of true

concerning the louers &amp; the neglecters of holy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
most plainly? nay in both of them, or else in
which you will? <hi>Cirus</hi> in the beginning of his age
was desirous to build vp the temple of Ierusalem, &amp;
he prospered wonderfully, conquering in al his wars:
he forgot the Lord &amp; his holie Temple, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

<hi>Alexander,</hi> whilest he loued his gods &amp; their temples,
he prospered wonderfully: but when he fel from that
his first loue, he left his chiefest safetie, &amp; in that cup
wherin he tooke much pleasure,<note place="margin">Eccles. 16.</note> hee lost his life. So
that those which loue the Lord, and so long as they
striue to lead a holy, vertuous, &amp; godly life, he mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
rewardeth them according to their faithfull

our Sauiour Christ meaneth, when hee saith: yee
fooles, whether is the golde holie or the Temple,
which sanctifieth the golde? and whether is the gift
holie, or the Altar which sanctifieth the gift? If the
Temple make the ornaments holie, then the walles,
the woode, the stone, of the which the Temple doth
consist, is holie: if the Altar doe sanctifie the gift,
then that which belongeth to the maintaining of the
Altar, is sanctified, &amp; they which minister ther at, are
to be reputed holy. If by our sauior Christ his speach,
those things be true: then they be holie men, which
build vp the Lords house, and they be wicked which
pull downe the same, according to that old verse.</p>

neither that his beginning is meere naturall as is
the stone, the flower, the tree, the oxe, the asse: but
that he is indued with a soule of heauenly and ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall

was framed vpright, and his countenance erected to
the heauens, to the ende that aboue all thinges, hee

who dwelleth in the heauen aboue, and a speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
vnto his diuine worshippe, which hee hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

that in obseruing the same is life,<note place="margin">Deut. 33.</note> and in neglecting

or looke once aside from this present comfort,
the redemption of all the godly. Resolue thy selfe to

               <p>Lift vp your eies, and you shall see, that long

and waxen olde like a garment. If you yet doubt,
that the world is not at the point to bee dissolued, or
that there is no such present appearance, why wee

               <p>There bee but twelue houres in the day, and if ye

                  <note place="margin">S. Ierome.</note> arise ye deade, and

should remaine six thousand yeares, and after that,
should succeede the eternall sabaoth of our soules.
Fiue ages by all mens computation are past, &amp; now
we liue in the sixt, whose 1589 yeares nowe already
past, argue, that the sequell of the sixt is also at an
ende. Of those six thousand, which long since the
learned aimed at, already bee expired 5562, and hee
which with his word did create the world, and at his

for his elect &amp; chosen childrens sake, which seemeth
likely that the day is euen now appearing in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens.
If wee looke a little into the deepe visions and

which hath seene the rising of the sunne, and marked

               <p>These trigones as they alwaies passed after the

other trigons, whose particular proceedings if I
should declare with the whole course of the successe
&amp; effect of that which followed here vppon earth:
shewing, that as the constellations changed in the
heauens, so commonlie there followed alterations
of kingdomes, of states, of prosperity, and aduersity,
of famin &amp; plenty, of alteration of lawes, rules, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and nations, the rising continuing and ending of
Monarches, &amp; mighty Empyres: it were a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiue,
and forcible way. But because it is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to shew this course perticularly from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world vnto this day. As for example.
When <hi>Orifiell</hi> began his dominion ouer the world
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:5627:103"/>
first, then men were naked, rude, liuing abroad. To
whom when <hi>Arael</hi> the spirit of <hi>Venus</hi> succeeded, then
began they to bee more handsome, and to loue one
another. After him <hi>Zachariell</hi> the spirit of Iupiter
succeeded, vnder whom men began to build and to
rule one ouer another. To this <hi>Raphael</hi> succeeded the
spirit of <hi>Mercurie,</hi> vnder whom caracters, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s were first inuented.
To this succeeded <hi>Samal</hi> the spirit of <hi>Mars:</hi> vnder
whom though the Hebrewes accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t that the flood
was,<note place="margin">Hebraei</note> yet according to the account of the <hi>septuaginta,

by the same rule of multiplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>) the flood was
afterward vnder the dominion of <hi>Gabriel,</hi> the spirit of
the Moone. Because it were both obscure and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
to shew from the beginning of the world vnto
this day, euery course of these trigones in the zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,
and euerie dominion of these planetical spirits,
with the effectes which followed here on earth, to
the end that wee may vnderstand a secret truth suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to warne euery one which loueth the Lord, to
be ready, sith his day and comming seemeth neere
at hand: I will onely shew some effects of the watry
trigone: especially what followed when it ended, as
it did lately in the tayle of Pisces, with the appliance
of the effects of <hi>Gabriell</hi> the spirit of the Moone, who
last of all begun his dominion ouer the world, the
yeare of our Sauiour his incarnation 1525. and shal
rule (vnlesse the Lord shal cut off those euill effects)
til the year one thousand eight hundred seaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ty nine,
&amp; eleuen months. For the more inciting of vs vnto
the consideration of our state, and this present age in
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:5627:103"/>
which wee liue: let vs call to minde the words of our
Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ: who when he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
his Disciples of the last day of doome,
(which now hangeth ouer our heads:) then (saith
hee) looke vp, for your redemption is at hand. He
which biddeth vs looke vp, hee first created man
vpright, to behould the heauens, not minding to
make vs gase at nothing, but hee hath set some
cleere obiect for vs to behold aboue. And because
heauen is aboue, and earth below, looke vp vnto
the heauens,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> and behold the starres which (as the
Scripture faith) are fixed therein for signes, &amp; times,
for years and dayes: sith the Lord himselfe in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the starres appointed them for signes and
seasons: and sith the Son of God hath bid vs looke
vp to them. Let vs not regard the coloured speeches
of the ignorant: (who beeing a ridiculous generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
would faine seeme that which they are not.)</p>
               <p>But let vs looke vp, &amp; we shall see straunge signes
in the heauens, such signes as hath not bene since
the beginning of the world vnto this day, and were
not, nor could not well haue bene found out of vs,
if wee had not had cunning, and expert Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
amongest vs.</p>
               <p>The apparance of these prodigious sights in the
heauens: do bid vs consider, that the sixe thousand
years are almost ended, that the sixt age of the world
is inclining it selfe into the graue: that the fourth
Monarch (though Liberatie verie learnedly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a short defensiue for the same) is now lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing.</p>
               <p>The starres were appointed for signes &amp; seasons:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:5627:104"/>
&amp; this is a great signe of the decaying of the fourth
monarch, in that the watrie Trigone is now expired
vnder the which the fourth monarch had the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
The same two great planets <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
being conioined in <hi>Scorpio, Iulius Caesar</hi> being then in
the height of his imperiall pride,<note place="margin">Iul. C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

seuen yeres before Christ. That learned <hi>Liberatie</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
strongly on the contrary, &amp; to an other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
than I will name; affirming that no constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
decaieth his owne proper effect. <hi>Ciprianus Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouitius</hi>
coniectureth a shorter conclusion from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
It is lawful for all men to beleeue what seemeth
most likely, and when all is doone, the conclusion is
meere coniecturall, but yet by many probabilities.</p>
               <p>This for our instruction let vs mark, after the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of these six thousand yeares, six ages, foure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marches,
and now the fourth Trigone newly ended;
that the world also is drawing towards and end. With
this lette vs consider, howe often this constellation
hath had issue from the beginning of the world, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the dominion of <hi>Gabriell</hi> the spirit of the
Moone, who ruleth now. And therewith let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the effectes which followed them. <hi>Anno mundi,</hi>
2242, the watrie Trigone drawing to an end, <hi>Gabriel</hi>
the angell of the moone, began his dominion ouer
the world, and what followed? men being then giuen
to pride and lecherie, to feeding their bodies and not
their soules; to regard the kingdoms of the earth, &amp;
not the kingdome of heauen: not regarding that
learned <hi>Noe,</hi> the seruaunt of the Lorde: the cloudes
were dissolued aboue;<note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> the fountaines of the earth
were opened below; the seas were let loose abroade;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:5627:104"/>
the waters flowed outragiously ouer the whole
earth, and drowned all worms and beasts, all fowles,
all men, women, and children, all liuing creatures
of the earth, except <hi>Noe,</hi> and those which hee tooke
with him into the Arke.</p>
               <p>After this general destruction of the whole world
in the ende of <hi>Pisces,</hi> the spirites of the planets toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Trigones, proceeded successiuely, till
at the length, in the ende of the dominion of <hi>Samaell</hi>
the spirit of <hi>Mars</hi> (vnder whome the destruction of
<hi>Troy</hi> was complete) <hi>Gabriel</hi> the angell of the moone
beganne the second time to rule,<note place="margin">Troy.</note> in the ende of the

therefore after so many generall courses,<note place="margin">Mercator.</note> of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gones,
of the monarches, of the dominion of the

signes of his comming in the ayre, in the water, in
the earth: and lastly aboue all, hath held out his hand
in the heauens, shewing vs that he is nowe opening
the doores of heauen, and comming to iudgement:
and that the doome of all creatures is now dawning.
Let vs wisely weigh &amp; consider, the exceeding great
power and maiestie, wherewith the Lorde of hostes
shall come to iudge the earth. Though he was made
man for our sakes, and for our saluation: yet bee yee
not so carnall in your cogitation, or so bewitched
with the delaying fancie of sensuality, that you shuld
imagine his power to be compact after the manner
of men:<note place="margin">Enoch.</note> that when hee is mustering his thousandes

bee. Hee is not like to the earthly princes, that hee
should sende his harbinger before. But I am is he:
most monderful, most holie, most mightie, in whose
presence the angels are not pure, and the heauens
corruptible. Hee spake the word, and they were all
made: and at the sownd thereof they shall all be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed.
He shall kindle the fire of his heauy displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
against the sinners of the earth. Hee shal cleaue
the heauens asunder, and the flame shal breake forth
like a furnesse. As were the dayes of <hi>Noe,</hi> a generall

heauen most ruthfully, firing, wasting, burning,
destroying, and sincking those wicked cities: so shal
bee the comming of the sonne of man.</p>

masking vnder the smooth visure of good will and

they blinde the eies of those which beholde them,
they intangle them, and they intrappe euery one not

that they cannot possiblie discerne what is good

offences doe proceede, sith heereby they remaine in

            <p>NOt many daies since (most Noble Prince)
trauailing through many Countries and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
I spake with many rare &amp; excellent men,
many famous &amp; mighty Princes. In the midst of our
talke oft times wee fell into the selfe same speaches,
which are now common in euerie mans mouth: that
is concerning the prosperous successe of the warres
of the great Turke, a most wicked and professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
euen to the name of a Christian. With which
warres he persecuteth, vexeth, and cruelly tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the Christians, with which hee striueth day and
night, to root out the auncient Catholique faith. In
which thing we see plainely, that he hath preuailed,
so long and so strongly, that hee hath leuied such
strength of soldiers, both by sea and by land, that hee
hath so furnished himselfe, with warlike power, and
to conclude that he hath prepared as great an armie
against the Christians (nay Italie it selfe) as euer
<hi>Zerxes</hi> that great Potentate brought against the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
whose armie (as it is recorded) almost coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:5627:110"/>
the Seas with ships, and the land with footmen,
wherefore the hugenes of such great preparation &amp;
incredible power, must needes be great terrour to vs
all. Many such like matters, passed and ouerpassed,
whilest we were talking. At length our speach drew
to that conclusion, how great, how lamentable, and
how sorrowfull was the losse of your Iland <hi>Euboea,</hi> &amp;
not to bee named without teares: then the which,
there coulde not haue chaunced a greater, a more
sorrowfull, a more lamentable losse, either to you or
to the state of all Christendome. For thereby most
cruell warre, and extreame daunger is threatned,
not onely to you and to your dominions bordering
on the seas: but likewise to Italie it selfe, and to our
Catholique faith, a most grieuous euersion and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
destruction is attempted. Wherefore wee haue
great cause to feare, lest the name of Christendome
be now in daunger to be vtterly extinguished, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Catholique faith, confirmed with so
many labours, with so much bloud, with such and so
many agonies of Iesus Christ. For nowe the axe is
laide to the roote of the tree, our cruell enemies are
before the dore: now the shores resound againe with
the great force of warres which approch them by
Seas. Nowe (vnlesse it please God to helpe vs from
heauen) death and destruction doe come vppon vs.
Who is able to represse the cruell force of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
beast? who shall disanull his deadly attempt?
who is able to terrifie him from his purpose, alreadie
puffed vp with the hope of victorie. Through the
multitude of his people, and the greatnes of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
he counteth his dominions to litle<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for desire
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:5627:111"/>
of rule and Empire hath no meane. But howe much
the larger the dominion is, so much more the desire
of rule encreaseth. Wherefore hee will easily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
that in time, hee may also obtaine the whole
dominion of Italie. In truth this is the full height of
his wish: he euen gapeth after this most greedily; to
this purpose he frameth all his studie, all his cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
all his counsell, all his deuise and pollicie. The
same occasion which mooued Alexander of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donie
or Iulius Cesar (whome hee propoundeth to
follow before all others in higher sort then is the lot
of mortall man) to seeke the conquest of the whole
worlde, mooueth this man also most earnestly, thus
to seeke the inlarging of his dominions, &amp; through
his victorious acts, to become famous with al poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
which hath been no small prouokement, to the
most ingenuous &amp; excellent mindes, to attempt the
greatest &amp; hardest aduentures. Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> by emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
of their glorie, he indeuoureth to shew himselfe like
vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, &amp; through the example of their renoume,
&amp; desire of praise, he seemeth daily more &amp; more to
be inflamed; which hee so much the more earnestly
desireth, how much the waie is broader, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
easier, through this his last victorie. In which
respect (as it seemeth to many) this death &amp; calamity
of your Euripus, is the greatest &amp; most to be lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of all others: the which many thinke and affirme
that God of his righteous and iust iudgement, hath
brought vpon you: for your insolent taxing and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of holy thinges, belonging to the Church, and
your iniurious troubling of the state of religion. It
likewise hapned not long since, to that most famous

world, which in time past was the sea of the Romain

               </gap>mpire, but (as I remember) for a greater crime. For
although without great grief we cannot wel remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that vnfortunate slaughter: yet all men can well
witnes, that their lamentable calamity, &amp; miserable
destruction came vpon them by the iust iudgement
of almighty God, for the long &amp; obstinate discord, &amp;
departing of the Grecians, from the true faith. What
signifieth the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the Pisans which in times
past gloried that they were of so great power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion?
did not all things prosper well with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>? was
not their kingdome safe, &amp; sure both by sea &amp; land, so
long as they imbraced religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> with great reuerence?
but afterwards whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> they laied wicked &amp; violent ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds
on the Church, and the Ministers of the high God,
then they were brought into many aduersities, many
great losses, many miserable calamities, so that they
did not only lose their dominion &amp; rule, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
bondslaues to their enimies. Where, let no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
maruel if of late it hath hapned in like miserable sort,
to your Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d <hi>Eubo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>a,</hi> for it is the saying of all people &amp;
nations that your expeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of Achaia, had so lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
&amp; so vnhappy a conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> for your diminishing
and taxing of the liuinges belonging to the Church.
And in like sort all men account that the death of
your Euripus was the iust iudgement of God for
your iniuries and polling of the Church. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we will waie this matter wiselie, if with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wee will looke into our owne doings, we haue
great cause, I say wee haue great cause to feare (that
if you remaine in this minde and disposition still)
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:5627:112"/>
the rest of your Ilands and Cities shall be subiect to
the same calamities and destruction. Neither can we
hope that our afflicted state shall bee repaired, so
long as the iust cause of our ruine, still remaineth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
vs. These thinges, and such like, are often
heard in euery place, which were too long to repeat,
at this present. Now this one thing is sufficient to be
heere mentioned, that many thinges are reported a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade,
not vncertainly, nor obscurely, to the great
discredit and disgrace of your most famous Senate,
by reason of your great compilation and pilling of
holy things. Wherefore to say the truth in regard of
that singuler good will, &amp; obseruance, which I beare
vnto your honorable Senate: I doe not a litle lament
your estate, in that I am desirous to hear those things
of you and your happie estate, which belong to high
praise, to great glory and renoume. I cannot but bee
greatly grieued, when I consider how low that great
honour and worthy fame of you is fallen, which (and
that worthily) thorough out the whole world, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the furthest nations, was thought incredible.
For euen as in times past, this most famous Citie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
all others, in abundance of wealth, in plenty of
all thinges, in high glory, in great dignitie: so also in
honestie of maners, in holines of life, in iustice, faith,
pietie, religion, and other vertues it far past them all.
Which good and vertuous practises, after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
to be forgotten, euen so likewise that auncient
glorie and dignitie of your name, by litle and litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to diminish: by litle and litle it began to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured
and therewith also distinguished. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I am greatly grieued, when I see so manie
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:5627:112"/>
slaughters, so many calamities, so many and such ill
proceedings, so many and so great disgracings of
of your auncient dignitie, which are well knowne
throughout all <hi>Italie:</hi> yet I am of this opinion (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your correction be it said) which thinke that this
new and vnusuall tasking and tolling of the Church,
is the chiefe cause of your ill and vnhappie successe
in those things which ye tooke in hand. For when I
weigh with my selfe, and consider the course of
times past, I am easily induced to bee of their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and to speake plainely, that which I haue good
cause to thinke, It seemeth that all your great losse
and aduersities, proceed from hence as from a most
corrupt and poisoned fountaine. And that it is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
it appeareth plainely to all men, which will
recorde the most excellent and famous factes of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
time, &amp; now to repeat the beginnings of your
auncient exploits. Who is so vnskilful? who so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and so ignorant in all matters whatsoeuer, which
knoweth not the beginning of this your common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth?
how wonderfull, howe famous, how diuine
it was, how greatly and in most ample manner it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
aboue the customable manner and course of
all other Cities. For all things fell out so luckily, and
had so good successe; that all things therein seemed
to increase, and therein also to flourish.</p>
            <p>For in short space it became famous throughout
the whole worlde, not onely in abundance of most
pretious iewels, in sumptuous and magnificent buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
in great strength and store of shippes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
ye inlarged your dominions farre and neere, both
by sea and by land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:5627:113"/>And through your excellent wisedome, and the
wise forsight of your ancestors, ye haue entirely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
the same. So that the force &amp; power of Italie
(somtimes the Queen &amp; mistris of the whole world)
could not at any time vanquish the same. What
then was the true cause of such great prosperitie and
happie successe, vnlesse it were because there was
neuer any Citie, in which either religion was more
imbraced, or true iustice longer or more religiously
preserued? I hope it may be spoken without suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of flatterie, for I seeke to speake little in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the thing, and the weight of the matter dooth
passe beyond the bounds of my speech.</p>
            <p>Who will not greatly commend the sincere and
singular loue which your auncestors bare vnto reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
the great and inuiolable obseruance of iustice
and holines? their exceeding great charitie and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie
towards the poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>bers of Iesus Christ?
their inestimable bounty towards the adorning and
beautifiyng of holy temples, euen vnto this present
day?</p>
            <p>This thing is manifest, both by the fresh memory
of deuout me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, &amp; also by our temples richly adorned;
and by our ample churches ful of holy monuments,
which (as it is apparent) were built in times of olde,
onely by the oblations and charitable deuotions of
your auncestors. For although they were alwayes
accounted liberall and deuoute, concerning those
things which appertaine to the worshippe of God,
and their seruice towards religion: Yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
when they began to bee oppressed with these
calamities, and were so sore distressed: then especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:5627:113"/>
by their good woorkes they earnestly required
helpe from heauen: then euen with great distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of almes, with great faith, with great deuotion,
they did striue to please and pacifie God the giuer of
all good things. What diuers seasons, &amp; how vnlike
or rather plaine contrarie obseruance of religion &amp;
holy worship haue succeeded, I had rather other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
should iudge than I: for the thing is so plaine &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that he which hath but halfe an eye may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see it. But concerning this hereafter. Now I return
vnto the ages of your auncestors, who, as wee haue
shewed, being so well strengthned, waged batraile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their enemies, in defence of their dominions.
They went forth into the field, and valiantly ioyned
battaile: neither did they returne home againe, till
their enemies were discomfited &amp; ouercome. They
obtained the victory, &amp; deuided the spoile. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Camillus</hi> deserued immortall fame, which (as <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie</hi>
writeth) oftentimes and earnestly exhorted the
people herevnto. Behold (saith he) O ye worthy Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
either the prosperous or the afflicteed state
of <hi>Rome</hi> in these yeares, and ye shall find most surely,
that whilest we were religious, all thinges went well
with vs: but when wee once neglected our dutie to
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, all things went against vs. And now (O wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
prince) howe much better were it with your
whole commonwelth, if you would propound vnto
your selues the most excellent discipline of your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
and their worthy lawes concerning religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>?
how much more wisely &amp; excellently were the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwelth
ruled, if by the example of their high wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and noble actes you would waxe more warie;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:5627:114"/>
Out of question you should not be molested, with so
many discommodities, so many warres, so many
dangers: but as in times of old with the vanquishing
of your enemies, you should obtaine victorie with
great triumph.</p>
            <p>But if you haue worse successe in these daies, than
you looke for, or would desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e, no maruell when as
the godly lawes of your auncestors by little and litle
are cleane forgotten, when religion it selfe, and the
reuerence of holy priests is lesse practised than it was
wont, and lesse than reason would it should be.</p>
            <p>Pardon mee I pray you, if I speake plainly: for
most men, nay, almost all which are ruled by reason,
are of the same opinion. I speake all this to doe
you good, &amp; therefore you may more easily pardon
mee.</p>
            <p>And now let vs returne to that from whence wee
haue digressed. Those thinges were vnwisely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
of you, which wee spake of before, and that
truely: for those were the onely thinges which in
times past aduaunced you &amp; your common wealth
to such dignities, such glory, such happie fame.
Wherfore not without good cause, your happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
your famous spoils, your victorious triumphs,
are come to an end: and now your great fame and
glorie, the great auctority &amp; maiestie of your name,
which hath resownded most famously through the
whole world: which seemed wonderful to all people,
princes, kindreds, and nations, is in hazard now to
be extinguished. Count yee nothing of this (O yee
most famous Venetians? do you not thinke of these
things? do you not magnifie all these? Marke I pray
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:5627:114"/>
you this one thing wisely: way and consider this one
thing euen in your owne conscience, way this one
thing truely. How many victories, how many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questes,
how many spoiles haue you atchieued, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
your enemies? how many happy euents haue
you had in these so long warres, since you inuented
this strange and pestilent councell? in that you feare
nothing at all to lay violent hands on church goods,
and holy things dedicated to God almightie: which
impietie (beleeue me) will not helpe you one whit
in these your great daungers, and extreame neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie.
And although peraduenture it seeme not so
to many: yet without all doubt as a most fierce &amp;
piercing poyson, which with the deadlie contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof, is woont to infect and poison all things,
which come neere it. Euen so your great strength
and preparation to warre by your former impietie
towardes the Church, is like (which God forbid)
to bee cleane vanquished and destroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> would neuer haue admitted such wicked
councel,<note place="margin">Iulius Caesar.</note> though he were an heathen: who (as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
in his life) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he entred by chaunce into Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernia,
the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of that countrie pointed to the sword
of <hi>Caesar</hi> hanging in their Church, as it were a spoile
got from the Emperour by force of armes. <hi>Caesar</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
the Church seeing the sword, he smiled to him
selfe, saying nothing: and when his frendes willed
that it should bee pulled downe: <hi>Caesar</hi> in any wise
would not suffer it. Out of question hee did both
wisely and religiously, for hee accounted the sword
and all thinges else dedicated to holy vse to bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
thinges, therefore he thought it vnlawfull to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:5627:115"/>
touch them any more with carnal hands, or to haue
them in any wise employed in humaine affairs.</p>
            <p>Also your auncestors would neuer haue done
so, they would neuer haue imagined any such thing.
Those ancient rulers much renowmed for their great
wisedome: which being free from all danger, from
aduersitie, from all extremitie, they would neuer
haue hearkened to such counsell, nor haue accepted
of any such subsidie. And that most wisely, for they
knew full well, that the best kinde of gouerment
by which a common wealth is preserued, augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and encreased be two, especially: Religion, and
Iustice. Which when they are maintained, the
common wealth is safe and sure: but if they faile, it
must needes also decay. With these kinde of artes
and orders rather then by force of armes, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
this ample dominion, which is enlarged by
sea and land.</p>
            <p>But so soon as these excellent artes began to waxe
out of vse, forthwith rhe Empire it selfe began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
and come to ruine. Which thinges if you will
consider aright, ought to forewarne and stirre you
vp into a greater deuotion, and more dutifull obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of Religion and holy thinges.</p>
            <p>Neither ought these examples of your owne
countrie affaires (which haue fallen out vnlucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
onelie bee a warning vnto you, but also that
great care and dutifull deuotion, which your aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
continuallie, and plentif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>lly yeelded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
diuine thinges, and vnto them whose functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was to attend vppon the same.<note place="margin">Religio Aegyptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> Amongest the
Aegyptians (as <hi>Diodorus</hi> affirmeth) all the yearly
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:5627:115"/>
reuenues of the land, were deuided equallie into
three partes.</p>
            <p>The first part the Priestes did challenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
who were of such auctoritie amongest them,
that al things were gouerned by their councell and
wise foresight, &amp; being free from al burdens &amp; taxes,
they had the second place of the rule and dignitie
next the king.<note place="margin">Indians.</note> Also the Indians diuiding the whole
common wealth into seauen tribes, constituted the
tribe of the priests in the first place, free from all bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
&amp; seruice, yeelding them great honor &amp; reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
But yet in mine opinion concerning worship
and dutie towards God,<note place="margin">Aethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> the Aethiopians did farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
all others. For with them the priestes and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of their temples were in such great honour, that
they onely were the men, whom they thought eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to bee their kinges: and that which seemeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
they were of such auctoritie and credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
them: that when they thought good, they
gaue notice to the kinges, that they should die, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that it was the sentence of their gods: which
was the cause that al their Kinges til the time of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi>
the second, obeyed the edict of the priestes, and
willingly tooke their death at their appointment, not
constrained but euen by old custome, being loth to
alter the superstition.</p>
            <p>Wherefore they boast, that they haue reaped
this fruit and reward for that their great pietie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
their goddes, that the inuasions of all their
enemies, and that crueltie could neuer do them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
harme, and that they were neuer conquered or
subiect to any forraine nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:5627:116"/>For <hi>Cambyses</hi> that most mightie king of the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<note place="margin">Cambises.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he once assaulted them with a most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
armie; most of his souldiers being destroied, with
great ignominie he lost almost his whole armie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Dionisius</hi> hauing trauailed through
the whole world,<note place="margin">Hercules. Dionysius</note> would not once trouble the Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians,
in respect that they were so religious. The
same thing also appeareth in the holy Bible. For in
the booke of <hi>Genesis</hi> we read, that in the dayes of old
there was so great &amp; so strange a famin through the
whole world, that corne and victuals were scarcelie
to be had in any place. The fiercenes of this famine
was especially in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> &amp; pinched them sorer than
other nations: insomuch that the inhabitants of the
lande were compelled to sell their farmes, their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions,
and their houses, nay their houshold stuffe
for victuals. Which when they began to faile them,
through the long and harde famine; at length, least
through hunger they should die straungely, &amp; most
miserably, they gaue themselues also into the kings
hands.</p>
            <p>Wherefore that religious steward of the king,<note place="margin">Ioseph the patr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>arch.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
laid vp exceeding great store of prouision euen
of purpose. He bought the whole land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> (the
possessions of the Priests excepted) and their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
into the hands of king <hi>Pharao.</hi> From which time
vntill <hi>Moses</hi> (as the scripture witnesseth) the fift part
of the increase of <hi>Aegypt</hi> was paid vnto the king. But
those thinges which appertained to the priests, and
the keepers of the temples, they were safe from this
lawe; for <hi>Pharao</hi> did not onely giue them faire and
large possessions, but also hee appointed that they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:5627:116"/>
should be duly fed and nourished all the time of the
famine, by the common store and prouision, which
was the cause that they sold not their possessions and
goods as the other people did. What should I heere
make mention of the Romans? did not they appoint
a most solemne priesthood to the ministers of holie
thinges?<note place="margin">The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Priests.</note> did they not alwaies imploie their greatest
studies and paines in preseruing and increasing reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
For (as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> saith) that citie preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
religion aboue all other things whatsoeuer, so
that the highest and chiefest magistrates did willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
yeeld themselues and their seruice vnto holy rites,
hoping assuredly, that they should attaine the chiefe
rule and magistracie of the worlde, if they humbled
themselues deuoutly vnto the heauenly power.</p>
            <p>But to what end doe I shewe these things, sith all
bookes that euer was written, either diuine or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
are full of these examples and cleare monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and therefore read you those books, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
them diligently. Neither thinke you that the
priests and ministers of God (as some talke) should
now be poore &amp; physitions, as they were somtimes.
But on the contrarie you shall easilie see, that in no
age, in no time past, they were vsed so beggerlie, and
so vnworthilie. But if in auncient time men were so
religious in their errour: howe deuout thinke you
they would haue bene in the sincere worship of the
true euer liuing God? Such manner of men ought
we to be, which doe not worship fained idols or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
(as they did) but that great creator, the maker of
heauen &amp; earth, &amp; all things therein. Wherefore I
desire (O most noble prince) I desire most earnestly,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:5627:117"/>
euen for that great goodwill which I beare to you &amp;
your commonwelth, that you and those which be of
your opinion, would alter your minds, and take bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
councell, concerning the church, the clergie, the
landes and goodes once dedicated to the same. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
you are not moued with those examples of
your ancestors, yet at the least, let your late losses, &amp;
present calamites ioined with ill successe, be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
warning vnto you. For I doubt, &amp; of my truth
am sore afraid; least if you go on with the same mind
and purpose as you haue begun, you shal suffer grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
aduersities, euen as those which are of a farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
disposition, haue plainly foreshewed vnto you.</p>
            <p>In like manner (as it is recorded) it hath fallen out

writeth in his booke intituled <hi>De ciuitate Dei,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Augustiue</note>
there was a great plague in <hi>Rome,</hi> both of women and
of beastes, so that through the huge number of those
which died, they doubted that all liuing creatures
would finallie perish: and further also that winter
was so exceeding colde, that the snowe (which was
extraordinarie) laye of a great deapth euen in the
market place, for the space of fortie daies, and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
was frozen ouer verie harde and thicke: Then
(they saie) it was aunswered, that the cause of the
plague was, in that many priuate men possessed, and
dwelt in manie religious houses: which being short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
after restored to their true vse, foorthwith that
great and wonderfull plague ceased.</p>

               <note place="margin">Q. Fuluius Flaccus.</note> as <hi>Valerius</hi> writeth, left a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
example behind him, euen an example to all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie,
concerning the contempt of religion. For
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:5627:117"/>
this man, though he were the controler of the citie,
yet he scaped not vnpunished, in that (while he was
in office) he tooke the marble pillers of <hi>Iunoes</hi> temple
in the citie <hi>Locrine,</hi> and wickedly placed them in that
house which he built at <hi>Rome.</hi> For immediately after
this fact, he fel into a phrensie, and was starke madde
euer after, with fierce mad passions still consuming:
till at the length hee hearing that of his two sonnes,
which were soldiers in <hi>Ilirium,</hi> the one was dead, the
other most grieuously sicke, he died most miserably.
By which great daunger the Senate and people of
<hi>Rome</hi> not a little mooued, decreed presently, that the
marble pillers should bee carried to <hi>Iunoes</hi> temple,
from whence they came, that thereby the impious
fact of the Censour might be corrected, and by that
excellent example they might note vnto their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
that whatsoeuer is once dedicated to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
God, cannot without great impietie be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in anie wise; though it bee imployed to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
honest and very good vses.</p>
            <p>And if anie should bee so wicked and irreligious,
that they should attempt to violate &amp; prophane ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

would take it greeuously, &amp; that they would be
fully reuenged of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> for the same, euen vnto death.

it reason that the immortall God ought to bee

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:5627:118"/>
and deuout persons, euen amongest his enemies, he
would not suffer them in any wise to bee molested:
for he said it was vnreasonable and a most barbarous
crueltie, to take any one thing from the Temples,
and holy Churches, or that the priestes should bee
at any charges, or losse in any respect. Wherefore
hee hated such wicked church-robbers euen vnto
the death, hoping thereby to vanquish his enemies,
and to strengthen his owne power, the which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
prooued true, as appeareth by that which is
excellently written of <hi>Mithridates</hi> in the life of <hi>Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
translated out of Greeke into Latine by <hi>Leonard
Iustinian</hi> that noble conncellor and father of your

Rome, and that with an exceeding great power,
both by sea and lande, by and by a sodaine tempest
rising, and his victualles failing, hee was vtterlie
vanquished by <hi>Lucullus:</hi> the greatest part of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
being spoiled and destroied in the fight.</p>
            <p>Afterward, when he thought to saue his life on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by flying, againe hee was so afflicted with a
straunge sodayne tempest, that leauing the ship
in which hee was, which through the outragious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the tempest, was almost readie to sincke:
hee was constrained to yeelde himselfe into the
handes of pirats.</p>
            <p>They report that <hi>Diana</hi> worthily afflicted him
with that great ouerthrowe and calamitie (which
they accounted a goddesse) because most iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie
and irreligiouslie, euen with wicked handes,
hee spoiled her temple, and presumed to take her

            <p>No lesse horrible chaunce there was amongest
the Romane armie euen on the like occasion. For
when Carthage a professed enemie to the Romanes
at length was woon of them by force of armes, a
certaine Romane Souldier (contemning Religion)
in the spoiling of the Citie was not afraide to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte
sacriledge, taking away the goulden vesture
from <hi>Apollo,</hi> who was woorshipped as a GOD,
of all men: but he escaped not long vnpunished,
for that wicked fact, in that the most righteous
God of his iust iudgement, brought it so to passe
that the handes of this church-robber, were found
cutte off amongest the peeces of the vesture: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
other afterwardes might bee taught, how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
wee ought to keepe our handes from violating
holie thinges.</p>
            <p>Wee may alledge manie such like examples out
of holie Scriptures, especiallie as it is written in
the booke of the <hi>Machabees,<note place="margin">Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</note> Antiochus</hi> that wicked
king yeeldeth vs a plaine example: which vaunted
himselfe so prowdlie, and so arrogantlie aboue all
measure, that hee seemed to himselfe as though
hee could commaund the flowing of the seas, and
reach the heauens with his finger. This man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
the holie religion of the true and eternall
God, was not afraide with wicked and prophane
handes to spoile that faire and famous Temple of
the Iewes. Though hee hoped to escape the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of God, yet he escaped not long: for of a
sodaine hee was stricken with so daungerous &amp; hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
plague, that out of his bodie there issued abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:5627:119"/>
of woormes, and with most horrible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to him, they issued out of his flesh, hee yet
liuing. Hee beeing woonderfully mooued with
this plaine and manifest punishment sent from
God, at the length hee remembred himselfe: and
at the last, when hee could not abide his owne
stinke, it is meete (saith hee) to bee obedient vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, and for a mortall man not to seeme
a God vnto himselfe.</p>
            <p>Furthermore hee promised, that hee would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne
the Temple (whose ornamentes and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
plate hee had taken away a little before most
wickedlie) with many and wonderfull giftes: and
that hee would abundantlie, supply all the charges
belonging to the sacrifice with his owne reuenewes:
and to conclude, that hee would be circumcised.</p>
            <p>But when after so manie barbarous mischiefes
and outragious spoilings of the Church, hee see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
vnworthie of mercie, he ended his wicked life
as he was worthie.</p>
            <p>The like also happened to <hi>Heli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they were amazed, and cleane confounded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heliodorus</hi> (a sodaine sight appearing vnto him

verie sore wounded in sundrie places of his bodie:

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:5627:119"/>
thronging about him with a few he was drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
out of the place halfe dead, which imediatly before
hee entred with great pride and hawtinesse: by and
by through the prayers of the priestes, he recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
hauing vowed manie thinges, his commission
not executed, hee returned with his armie vnto
the king, where when hee had priuatlie and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
signified the apparition which hee had from
heauen, and which hee had felt in himselfe through
the handy worke of God, the king asked him what
messenger hee thought meetest to goe againe to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
on this businesse. Saith hee, if you haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
enemie or traitor to your person, send him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
for though he escape aliue, yet he shall returne
well whipped, sith in that place there is some diuine
power and Godheade: for the most mightie Creator
of heauen and earth, which ruleth and disposeth all
thinges by his great prouidence &amp; wisedome, is the
sure keeper &amp; safe defendor of that place. Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
therefore without respect of religion shall offer

to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ape vnpunished: for hee pursueth them in such
sort, &amp; afflicteth them with so great calamities &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
torments, vntil they suffer iust punishment
for their deserts. Of this matter you neede none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
witnesse than my selfe, which made triall not
not long since in mine owne person. I am afraid (O
most noble Prince) least that which (as I said) did
lately chance vnto <hi>Heliodorus</hi> may also be the sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
lot of those which exact tribute fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> religious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

if they were wise they should kede themselues free.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:5627:120"/>
but especially, because some men rush vpon it outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously,
without al respect of religion, or their poore
estate.</p>
            <p>I am perswaded it is farre inough from the intent
and purpose of your noble &amp; most wise Senate; that
through these exactions the priests and ministers of
God, which are continually busied in diuine functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the soules health of all men, should suffer any
iniurie. But yet in priuate conferences, I haue rather
obserued it, that by this meanes and vnhonest ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor,
they seek to gratifie your noble Senate. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their actions seeme too austere, too cruell, and
vnreasonable. For vnles their money be ready euen
at the appointed daye; presently there commeth in
the vnmercifull receiuers of such exactors, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
force and violence to the poore priests, they raile
on them, they miscall them, they wound them with
contumelious and opprobrious speeches, they vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
take away their goodes and houshold stuffe,
they prise it, they sell it, their gaine is almost more
than the value of the paiment. O wonderfull impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
before this age neuer once heard of. O great cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie
woorthie to bee reuenged with great punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Those which doe these things, are they to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Christians? can we perswade our selues that God
will forget such haynous offences? other sinnes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be greeuous; yet the Lords wrath being
once pacified, by true repentaunce they are put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
But if thou haue once lifted vp thine handes to
spoile holie thinges, then, then it is high time for
thee to tremble before the face of the wrathful God,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:5627:120"/>
the reuenger of all impietie, will come sodainely, he
will take full punishment on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, euen in his straight
and fearefull iudgement: and now for the better and
more certaine knowledge of this thing, we may well
remember that most vnhappie death and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Cn<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Pompeius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cn. Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius.</note> on whom fortune at the first blush
did laugh so fauourablie that (as Tullie saith) there is
no man to be thought so fond, which within himself
would wish such and so many high honours as God
himselfe bestowed most plentifullie on Pompey, and
yet because (as <hi>Liuie</hi> writeth and <hi>Iosephus</hi> the most
cleare &amp; excellent historiographer of the Hebrews)
he went about to take away the riches &amp; costly iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
out of the temple: he purchased a miserable death
vnto himself. For how sore a battail, and how vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
successe, had hee euer after against <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> in
<hi>Thesalia,</hi> and other places, &amp; also how miserably his
head was strucke off, by <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> being but a boy (in
whom hee reposed great hope) it is verie plaine and
manifest. The like euils or (as I may saie) sisters vnto
these;<note place="margin">M. Crassus<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </note> were those which happened to <hi>M. Crassus,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to warre against the Parthians: who were profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
enimies to the Romaines. He going to war when
by the waie he had spoiled the foresaid temple of the
Iewes, and (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth) amongst other things
had taken the golden piller out of the temple, which
waied an hundred and fiftie pound waight in massie
gold: and had broke it in pieces, and most wickedlie
paid his souldiers therewith: afterward he fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Parthians with so hard and euill successe,
that amongst al the great losses and ill aduentures of
the Romaines, his is also numbred and recorded. For
first of all, his deare sonne, whom he loued tenderly,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:5627:121"/>
was slaine in the battaile before his face, and manie
legions of the Romaine Soldiers euen the flower of
their chiualrie were then also most pittifullie slaine,
manie of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> ensignes were taken by the enemie,
the rest of that armie which scaped the slaughter of
the battaile by flight, were scattered into <hi>Armenia, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licea,
Syria.</hi> At the length <hi>Crassus</hi> himselfe by the iust
iudgement of almightie God being taken of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
chose rather to kill himselfe then to be captiue
to the barbarous people. For he thrusting the riding
wand (wherewith he did beat his horse) deep in at his
eie, with that strange kinde of death, ended his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
life. Afterward his wretched head and his right
hande once cut off by the barbarous people, and
brought to the king <hi>Aristonicus,</hi> his enimies made an
open scoffe of it, and they poured liquid golde into
his mouth, as a man concerning religion of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
most vnworthie: signifying thereby that hee
whose minde was inflamed with the feruent desire
of gold, should haue his dead bodie euen burnt and
scorched therewith, being poured red hot into him.
These be the rewaids, these be the presents, these bee
the gaines and fruits of them which presume to take
religious thinges vnto themselues, or vnder any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
whatsoeuer, to conuert them to other vses. And
as we reade that the Lord punished these men most
grieuouslie for their contempt of religion: so also we
finde it plainelie written, that to the deuout, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
God of his iustice hath giuen great benefites
and prosperous successe in all things which they
tooke in hand. For it is written of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great
(a most inuincible king) that concerning diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and orders of the Church, hee was alwaies most
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:5627:121"/>
liberall. For when he was yet but a young man, and in
the midst of his sacrifice, he took both his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds ful of
frankensence and sweet odors for offerings: <hi>Leonides</hi>
said vnto him, O <hi>Alexander,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> you shall once haue
conquered those lands, which beare those odours &amp;
frankensence, then you may sacrifice largely, but
now more wiselie &amp; sparingly. <hi>Alexander</hi> answered, O
<hi>Leonides</hi> I pray thee, when thou desirest prosperous
successe, deale not niggardlie with the gods. Of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
we reade in <hi>Iosephus,</hi> as also in other auncient histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that he bestowed many excellent great gifts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that holie temple of Ierusalem, and that with his
owne hands he sacrificed vnto our God. He so reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
<hi>Iadde</hi> the high priest of the temple, that lying
prostrate on the earth, hee adored him: he also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that the priests and ministers of the temple,
should boldly &amp; freely require what they would: and
among other magnificent giftes, hee graunted them
this one thing, that it should be lawfull for that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to liue by their owne lawes for euer, and also that
seauen yeares, all the Countries of the Iewes, should
be free from all kinde of tribute. Lastlie he decreed,
that what Iewe soeuer would goe to warre with him,
should be verie gently and honourably intreated. He
hauing done all this in so good order, as a man
strengthened by God, with a good courage he passed
forwarde with his armie towardes the <hi>Indians,</hi> verie
stronglie, and with great expedition most victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie
he conquered <hi>Porrus,</hi> that mightie and almost
inuincible king of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>not but wonderfully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mend that worthie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <hi>Themistocles,</hi> who notwithstandig the rest of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
&amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t vertues, yet he excelled especiallie in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:5627:122"/>
giuing due reuerence vnto religion: of whom it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
that (publique affaires laid aside) if he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
leisure,<note place="margin">Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> hee would bestowe that in beholding the
beautifull furniture of the Church, &amp; in viewing the
gifts and offeringes which were in the holie houses.
Wherefore he was verie careful lest any man should
pull down or deface any thing there, or lest any thing
should be wanting, which he knew did appertaine to
religion. And if these men nowe mentioned were so
deuout, and superstitiously religious in seruing their
false gods, how much more ought we Christians so
to doe, which retaine the knowledge of the true and
eternall God? with what care, with what diligence,
with what studie, with what indeuour, with what pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie
and reuerence, ought we to imbrace the true &amp;
vnfained religion, with which the true Creatour of
heauen and earth is truelie worshipped, which not
onelie giueth vs these earthly and temporall goods,
and prosperous successe in our offaires, without the
helpe of anie other, but also after this life, giueth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
blisse, and happines vnto the soule, if so be we
haue liued here well: which benefites the gods of
the gentiles could not only, not giue to them, which
worshipped them, but they could neither profit nor
hinder them in anie thing, without the assistance of
God. If we read that anie time they haue either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
or disprofited men, we must thinke that it came
by the permission of God, and that so much more
righteous, as it were more secrete. Neither can there
bee anie thing done iu the worlde without his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
who is the fountaine, the spring, the
roote, and beginning of all things, and who onely ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
moueth, and preserueth the world. Wherefore
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:5627:122"/>
if you desire to inioie the fauour of God, the giuer of
all good things, you must indeuour your selues with
great care studie and diligence, that in anie wise the
integritie of holie worship and religion, bee more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouslie
regarded and kept. That there be no impiety
committed against the holie Temple, and goods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to God. That there be no vnworthie fact co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
on your parts, against the priests &amp; ministers
of God. Into which kind of impietie if at anie time
wee shall fall, let vs assure our selues that God will
bring vppon vs the same plagues and punishments,
which those false gods, or rather the true God sent
by them vnto those which despised them: &amp; so much
more grieuoulie and seuerelly as the offence and sin
committed against the true and high God, is greater
and more hainous then that which is committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
false gods and deuils. Wherefore now marke
diligentlie<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> O ye noble <hi>Venetians.</hi> I beseech you mark
and see most clearelie how prosperouslie all thinges
succeeded with them, which reuerenced God truely
and the holie things dedicated to his worship: what
miserable ends they had, which contemned or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned
them. Neither is it maruaile if your affaires
scarce prosper, if you sustain many discommodities,
dangers, calamities, and ouerthrowes, for your exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and pollings of the Church are not such, that
they doe deserue anie helpe from God, they are not
such, that they can turne awaie his vengeance and
displeasure, which nowe hangeth ouer your heads,
out of doubt they are not such that they can promise
you good successe or victorie in your warres. Your
opinion doth greatlie deceiue you, if you thinke so.
If you bee so perswaded, beleeue mee, you kill your
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:5627:123"/>
selfe with your owne sword. Neither doe these exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

               </gap>e detriments, dangers, &amp;
losses ensue thereof. To conclude those do not mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate
the wrath of God nowe kindled against you,
but rather they prouoke and call for it dailie. Wee
reade in <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> (a most eloquent man, and
of great authoritie) that one of the kings of Fraunce
called <hi>Brennus,</hi> when he had conquered the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
by force of armes (as though earthlie spoiles
were of no account with him (he turned his force to
the spoilings of the temples of the gods. In scoffing
manner answering that the rich gods, ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
on mortall men. And therefore when he made
expedition towards <hi>Delphos,</hi> minding there to spoile
Apolloes temple (where there was great store of
gold &amp; siluer) of a sodain there arose an Earthquake,
with which a great part of the mountaine rushed
downe, which destroied almost the whole armie of
the Frenchmen. And <hi>Brennus</hi> himselfe beeing sore
wounded in many places, and not able to indure the
paines and exceeding anguish of his wounds, he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himself with his owne dagger: and so for his bold
attempts, he had his deserts by deserued death. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

But what should I speake anie more of these things?
for I feare me that if I should comprehend all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:5627:123"/>
of auncient times, appliable to this purpose,
in this treatie, that I shoulde keepe no meane in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the same, for they bee so manie that they
can scarce bee numbered, I omitte the example of
<hi>Qu Cipio</hi> who beeing Consull, when hee had sacked
the Towne <hi>Tholosam,</hi> and that there was found much
golde and siluer in the Temples of the same Towne:
whosoeuer presumed to touch anie of that golde in
that spoile, in lue of his deserts, hee died therefore in
most horrible griefe and anguish. I omit <hi>Xerxes</hi> the
king of the Persians, which sent foure thousand sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to Delphos to destroy Apollos Temple, which
companie was cleane destroied with lightning and
tempest: that <hi>Xerxes</hi> might vnderstande thereby,
the greater iniurie hee offered to God, so much
the lesse his force shoulde bee to resist. Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
truelie may bee applied to these our daies,
for wee haue seene it oftentimes chaunce in like
sort vnto you, euen in these daies, since you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to take the goods of the Church into your
owne handes, and to paie Souldiers wages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
            <p>For (as you your selues can witnesse verie well)
not onelie your Shippes full fraughted with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
for warre, were destroied with diuerse tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestes,
with thundering and lightning from heauen:
but also manie thousandes of souldiers afflicted with
diuers calamities died most miserablie: so that none
or verie fewe which you sent vnto the warre, came
safe home againe. Tell me (O most renoumed <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians)</hi>
how should these strange ouerthrowes, these
strange slaughters and destructions of men, these
manie calamities and miseries come? but that this
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:5627:124"/>
your warre is not onelie against man, but also against
God, and his true worship? a worde in this matter is
inough. Now I mind to applie my speach vnto these
our times, and to couclude with domesticall exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examples,
for we must not content our selues, with
the examples of auncient times, if our owne bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable
also hereunto. Especiallie sith manie will saie
vnto me, why doe you propound vnto vs, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Pagans temples, and their wicked gods?
why doe you rehearse their reuengementes against
their enimies? sith by the hand of God at length they
were all taken away? To whome I may well answere
&amp; in good time: that I make mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of those heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
gods, to the end we might thereby vnderstand, how
seuere a reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ger our God (eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the God of all Gods)
of his iustice ought to bee vnto those, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
wickedly to take away the goods of the church
and transport them vnto other vses: sith that those
which were falselie called gods, and which indeede
were no gods, (or rather God himselfe by them) sent
such cruell plagues and punishmentes for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of their religion. The cause why the most righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
God permitted, that they which were rather
deuils then gods, should so grieuouslie punish men,
was, because forasmuch as they knew they contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the true religion, and the true God. Sith those i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
were most wickedly contemned of them, which
(though falselie) yet the whole people tooke them to
be true gods, and they seemed to these men, which
spoiled them so wickedlie, to bee true gods indeede.
Wherefore God himselfe brought iust punishment
vpon them for this contempt of that which they
faithfullie beleeued to bee God. And nowe in these
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:5627:124"/>
daies that cloud of ignorance beeing cleane remoued:
sith he is more barbarously contemned of vs, surely he
will punish vs more seuerely &amp; greeuously. But nowe
(from whence wee digressed) let vs returne vnto these
of our time, to tell what great death &amp; slaughter chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to that wicked <hi>Fredericke</hi> the second, for violating
the libertie of the church. I shall not need many words,
for that is plaine inough to those which read the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
For when he was made Emperor by <hi>Innocentius</hi> the
third, and had taken the crosse in his hande against the
enemies of the Christians: then (euen vnto his owne
vndooing) deuising most vnhappily with himself, how
he might take away the goodes of the church now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to holy vse: he was not afraid to take them wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly,
and to imploy them prophanely: herevpon hee
became so blinde in his owne opinion, that hee made a
sacrilegious pact with the mightie king of <hi>Aegypt</hi> the
Soldan, concerning the suppressing of religion &amp; reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
houses, and concluded that, from which a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
man ought especially to abhorre. But hee did not
long escape the iust vengeance of God. For after that
he had spoiled many cities, after many dissentions had
with the church of <hi>Rome:</hi> after that hee had deuoured
many temples, after many most cruel &amp; barbarous sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crileges:
hauing his own sonne in a ielousie, that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
his Empire, he shut him vp in most filthie dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
til he died. And he feeling the great &amp; grieuous
censure of the church (as the righteous God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed)
he was strangled of his own sonne <hi>Manfredus</hi>
most cursedly. Here I will not omit the like calamities
of the princes of <hi>Carraria</hi> in the like impietie: for when
they began once wickedly to challenge to themselues
the ordering of those things, which belong only to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:5627:125"/>
function, by reason of the pestilent councell which
they had taken: very soone after they lost that famous
citie <hi>Patauium,</hi> most strong both by situation &amp; force,
which was thought almost to be inuincible. Neyther
fained he which wrote that saying; <hi>Vnlesse the Lord keepe
the citie,</hi> the watchmen watch but in vaine. And vnlesse
the Lord of hostes doe helpe, truly he laboureth but in
vaine, which leadeth the armie forth, trusting onely to
his owne wit and pollicie. So also did that holy woman
<hi>Iudith</hi> sing before the Lorde, when she cut off the head
of the insolent <hi>Holifernes</hi> with his owne sworde, she did
sing most excellently in this manner: <hi>O Lorde thy power
consisteth not in the multitude of an host,</hi> neither in the
strength of an horse; but the praier of the humble and
meeke, was alwaies acceptable before thee. Wherfore
if you put your confidence in your strong and mightie
nauie of goodly ships, and do not seeke to please God
with good works, and more diligent deuotion in your
religion: ye haue good cause to feare least (whilest yee
haue offended him) hoping for victorie, yee striue in
vaine; when according to the heuenly saying of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
wee must rather put our whole trust and confidence in
the Lord: these be his wordes: <hi>Some trust in chariots, and
some in horses, but in the name of the Lord our God wee
shall obtaine the victorie.</hi> With this force your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
did ouercome their enemies both by sea and
land most victoriously: with this kind of fight they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
many victories and glorious conquests. But yet
they neuer tooke councel once to touch holy thinges,
&amp; the goods of religious men, that they might imploy
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> on warlike affaires. Read your histories of auncient
time, &amp; reuise your old monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts, you shal neuer find
that they sought any waies to strengthen themselues
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:5627:125"/>
with the goods of the church. Lastly propound vnto
your selues the late example of <hi>Philip. Maria:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philippus Maria.</note> who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
he had good successe in al his affairs, &amp; al things fel out
with him aswell as he would wish: at length he gaue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
himselfe vnto such madnes, that al feare laid apart,
he challenged church goods vnto himselfe. But marke
howe duely he suffered worthy punishment: for being
wearied with continuall warres, he not only lost a great
part of his dominions, his enemies besieging him eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
hard vnto his walles; but also he suffered dangerous &amp;
grieuous diseases in his bodie, so that hee being blinde,
lead a most sorrowfull life a long time after: but what
became of his Empire, and by what meanes his noble
family is now cleane extinguished, &amp; no succession left
at all, it may easily appeare to euery man, the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
yet so fresh in memorie. To what ende (say some)
haue you set downe so many examples, of Gentils, of
Pagans, &amp; of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s? I haue briefly gathered al these
together (O most noble prince, &amp; you most renowned
Venetians) for that goodwil and dutie which I owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, &amp; to your commonwelth, to the end that they
which are addicted to this opinion of spoiling holie
things, might both by auncient examples, and also by
their ill successe, he moued to take better cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cel, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that euery man may know right well, that there was
neuer anie (not onely in our time, but in the times of
olde) found, which stretched out wicked handes vnto
holie things, who prospered any long time after, and
suffered not the present punishment therof: the which
I pray God to turn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> you &amp; your dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, by which
exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ples (least I should be too long) be ye afraid (O most
worthy Venetians) if ye persist any longer in this your
purpose, feare and tremble, least so many daungers
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:5627:126"/>
hanging ouer your heades, yee bee compelled to suffer
greater &amp; greeuouser. Thinke not that God wil leaue it
vnpunished in you rather than in others. The wrath of
God proceedeth gently vnto reuenge, but hee recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penseth
the slownes of his wrath, with the greeuousnes
of his punishment.</p>
            <p>Neuer was there any excellent ruler in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon wealth
commended for dwelling too long in the selfe
same opinion, but as in sailing if you cannot attaine the
hauen, it is the point of art to yeeld to the course of the
tempest: But when you can attaine the hauen, hauing
turned saile, it is a follie and meere madnes, to followe
that daungerous course, in which ye were before; so
ought wee to doe in the gouernment of the commonwelth;
neither ought wee alwaies to followe the same
councell and aduise, but that which wee are sure brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
honest and profitable, good and happie successe
to the commonwelth, that is to be followed, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
to bee retained most constantly. But if it be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to bee hurtfull to the commonwealth, all men
knowe that it is follie and rashnes to followe that with
daunger, which we may easily leaue with safety &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
Nowe (O worthie Venetians) harken vnto mee a
man most desirous of your prosperous estate, take bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
councell for the safetie of your selues and your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
retaine ye the name of <hi>Venece</hi> (most famous tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout
the whole world) in more religious manner
than ye do: Remoue these diuers and tempestuous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
(which are ready to fall vpon you) with more
wholesome means, that with such councel &amp; wisdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
