            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

GOD incited

the Booke of Psalmes,
may well carry this stile,
<hi>A booke after Gods owne
heart,</hi> in that nothing is

GOD, nothing wherein
hee takes more delight
then <hi>Devotion.</hi> And no
<pb facs="tcp:19893:3"/>
booke of sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
fuller of <hi>Devotion</hi>
then that booke. Most of
the Psalmes wholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
of <hi>Prayers</hi> or <hi>Praises:</hi>
very few, if any at all,
wherein there are not
some divine raptures,<note place="margin">Devotio<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> est pius &amp; humilia affectus in <hi>DEVM</hi> humilis ex conscientia infirmita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis pro priae: pius ex consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratione divinae clementiae Aug<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de Spir. &amp; Anima Cap 50.</note>
and such heavenly ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
as manifest an
heart full of <hi>Devotion.</hi>
For <hi>Devotion is a pious
and humble affection to
God-wards. Humble
through conscience of a
mans owne infirmity. Pious
through a due consideration
of the divine clemency.</hi>
Such <hi>Devotion</hi> is never
more fully and to the
<pb facs="tcp:19893:4"/>
life manifested then in
Prayers and Praises. For
in these divine duties, if
rightly performed, the
soule presents it selfe
before GOD, and that in
a speciall manner, being
after a sort even rapt
out of the body. Then,
if ever, doth the soule,
so farre as it is capable,
with an holy admiration
apprehend the divine
Majesty, Purity, Justice,
Wisdome, Power, yea
Mercy, Goodnesse, and
other excellencies wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
GOD is decked.
Then, if ever is the
soule brought throughly
<pb facs="tcp:19893:4"/>

He that liveth in
a darke dungeon, will be
enamoured with the
bright shining of the
Sun, when hee can have
liberty to see it. And hee
that hath long lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
bright Sun-shine,
more thorowly discernes
the horrour and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of darknesse. Now
GOD and man are in
<pb facs="tcp:19893:5"/>
many respects directly
opposite each to other:
This opposition is best
discerned in our most
serious contemplations
of Gods excellencies and
due consideration of our
owne manifold infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which is most to
purpose done in acts and
exercises of Devotion.
In this respect this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Treatise is worthy
of all acceptation, even
for the subject matter
whereof it consisteth,
which is <hi>divine Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Herein you shall
observe GOD most
highly advanced; and
<pb facs="tcp:19893:5"/>
man most lowly deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
GOD advanced
above the highest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
Man dejected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the lowest parts of
the earth. GOD mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
in his mercies, and
justified in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
Man judged and
condemned according
to his just deserts. If the
Author of a Worke add
any thing to the worth
of a Worke, the Author
of this Worke must
needs add much to the
worth of it. For he was
a man of a profound
judgement, and a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
spirit: which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
<pb facs="tcp:19893:6"/>
are most fit for
matters of <hi>Devotion. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi>
must have fire in
it, in which respect a
zealous spirit is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite.
<hi>Devotion</hi> hath
an especiall reference to
GOD, in which respect
solid judgement is also
requisite. As all the true
genuine Workes of this
Author give evidence
of his more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

That fire which once
came from the LORD
being continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
all things which
required fier in the
Tabernacle were to bee
fired therewith, as all
manner of sacrifice, and
incense. Such a fire, a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall,
a divine fire,
which must needs come
from the LORD, set on
fire the spirituall sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and sacred incense
which this Priest of the
LORD, the Author of
<pb facs="tcp:19893:7"/>
this Treatise, offered up
to his GOD. We ought
therefore to give the
more earnest heed heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
and to helpe our
owne devotion, and to
quicken and enflame
our own spirits thereby.
Without all question the
Modells of some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
persons Devotion,
may be a singular helpe
to others Devotion.
Every one that hath this
divine fier of Devotion
in his soule, cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
readily bring fit
fuell to make it flame
forth. But when fuell
is brought by others, it
<pb facs="tcp:19893:7"/>
will soone take, and
quickly flame out. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is this (as some too
weakly, though very
violently cavill) to stint
the spirit of supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For the worke of
the Spirit consists not
so much in the words
and phrases whereby
the matter of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is expressed, as in
the intention of the
heart, and in the intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and earnestnesse of
the affection, wherin the
very forme, soule and
life of true Devotion
consisteth. Otherwise,
the spirit of all GODS
<pb facs="tcp:19893:8"/>
people in all publicke
Liturgies, and formes of
prayer would be stinted:
yea by this reason the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of every one that joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
with another in
prayer (except his spirit
onely who conceiveth
and uttereth the prayer)
would be stinted. And
if so, then away with
publick assemblies for
prayer: away with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
meetings to call
upon GOD: away with
all meetings of two
or three together in
CHRISTS name, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
CHRISTS
promise of being in the

midst of them (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.

Psalme beares this title,
<hi>A Prayer for the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
when he is overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and powreth out his
<pb facs="tcp:19893:9"/>
complaint before the
LORD.</hi> This title appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
sheweth that the
Prophet who first pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this Psalme, did it
in the persons and for the
use of any poore distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
servant of GOD. So
as we thereby are taught
what to pray when our
sins lie heavy upon us, or
when we are in any other
distresse. It is expressely
said that <hi>Iohn taught his
Disciples to pray, Luke</hi> 11.
1. This questionlesse was
done by prescribing unto
them a forme of prayer.
Whereupon when a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of CHRIST said
<pb facs="tcp:19893:9"/>
unto him, <hi>LORD teach
us to pray as</hi> John <hi>also
taught his Disciples, he
said unto them, when ye
pray, say Our Father which
art in Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> As
<hi>Iohn</hi> had prescribed a
forme to his Disciples, so
CHRIST doth to his:
and so teacheth them to
pray, as <hi>Iohn</hi> did his. Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
formes of prayers
were by the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
composed for the
Churches in their daies.
In like manner have all
Christian Churches in
succeeding ages, had
their particular formes.
Never had any age, or
<pb facs="tcp:19893:10"/>
countrey more pious,
pithy formes then ours,
some for publick, others
for private use, among
which the forme here
tendered unto thee hath
its excellency. As it is
lawfull to have such
helpe, so may such an
helpe be very usefull.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> Eternall God,
most holy
and most
Glorious,
which dwellest in the
highest heavens, and
with righteousnesse and
truth swayest the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the whole world,
thou that art unto the
wicked and rebellious
wretches a terrible
Judge and a consuming
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19893:13"/>
fire, but to the humble
and repentant sinners a
strong tower of defence,
and their exceeding great
reward. We the most
miserable and wretched
of all thy creatures,
though the most noble
by creation; for they in
their kinds and severall
conditions doe thee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and service, but we
whom thou hast plac'd
in this world for a more
singular and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
glorifying of thee;
have not onely made our
selves more vile then the
basest creatures, and
more sencelesse in thy
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19893:13"/>
service then the beasts
that perish; but have
even combin'd with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
with hell and with
all the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to blaspheme and
dishonour thy great
name, to profane thy
Sabbaths, to breake all
thy holy Lawes &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.
O LORD
wee thus sinfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
are here asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and confounded in
thy presence; for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
are increased over
our heads, and our tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
are growne up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the heavens, so that
if now in thy just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19893:14"/>
thou shouldst come
against us, as wee have
many times, and doe
daily most justly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
thee, it had beene
farre better for us wee
had never beene borne;
Satan would challenge
us for his, we should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
see thy face againe,
nor the heavens, nor
the earth, nor all the
goodnesse which thou
hast prepared for man.
From the foule polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Originall sinne,
which hath universally
infected and possest all
the powers and parts
both of our soules and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19893:14"/>
bodies as from a filthy
puddle, have issued all
kindes of impurities,
many workes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and fearefull trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
both in our
thoughts, words and
actions. Much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanesse
and hardnesse of
heart, pride and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
contempt of the
power of godlinesse and
godly men, a sencelesse
neglect of thy word and
judgements, of the way
to Heaven and the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our owne soules.
Even the best of us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our calling, weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our selves in the vaine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19893:15"/>
pleasures and sinnefull
fashions of this wretched
world, being detain'd
by the policies of hell,
either in notorious sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnesse,
or onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
hypocrisie. Wee
walked with boldnesse
in the way of darknesse
and of death, after the
devices and desires of
our owne wicked hearts,
in much bitternesse and
malice against thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and their sincerity.
Nay and since it hath
pleased thee to illighten
our understandings with
saving knowledge, and
to pull us by the power
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19893:15"/>
of thy good Spirit out
of the slaverie of sinne
and Satan into the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
liberty of thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
Our best actions
and thy good graces in
us, have beene fouly
stain'd by privie pride
and secret hypocrisie;
wee many times stay
thy blessings from us
by our dullnesse and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardnesse
at religious
exercises, and by reason
wee doe not faithfully
those good things which
wee know, wee have
the knowledge of many
evill things kept from us
which wee unadvisedly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19893:16"/>
commit. And whereas
heretofore in our new
birth, the sins of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneration
have woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vext and disquieted
our consciences; yet such
is the wretchednesse of
our corrupted nature, that
wee have sometimes
looked back upon them
even with delight, if we
have escap'd relapse and
backsliding, we doe not
with that thankfullnesse
and cheerefullnesse, as
we ought, embrace in
this happy time of grace
and peace, those good
meanes which thou hast
ordained for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19893:16"/>
and salvation; So
that indeed wee walke
not worthy of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vocation whereunto
wee are called, but by
our many slips, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and carelesnesse,
wee bring much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort
upon our soules,
disgrace to our Christian
profession, dishonour to
thy Majesty, and offence
to our brethren. O LORD
wee beseech thee for
thy holy names sake,
and for thy rich mercies
in CHRIST JESVS to
pardon us all these our
offences, and to forgive
us all our sinnes knowne
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19893:17"/>
and unknowne, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or whensoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
since or before
our calling, and to bury
them in the death and
Passion of our blessed
SAVIOVR, and to hide
them in His righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for evermore.
There is no comfort to
be expected to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
wounded with
the terrour of sinne, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Heaven or in
Earth, in Angell, Saint,
or mortall man, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the spotlesse justice
of thy deare Sonne. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
therefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee, upon a good
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19893:17"/>
ground, with plentifull
assurance every one of
our soules, that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
blood was shed for
our sins in particular, that
wee may sensibly feele
the forgivenesse of our
sinnes and rejoyce in the
hope of eternall life.</p>
            <p>And for the time to
come wee humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
thee, to mortifie
in us all sinfull affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
unruly lusts, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
desires, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
in us the power of
sinne, and every corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereby Satan
keepes us any way in his
slaverie, or at any time
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19893:18"/>
gets the dominion over
us. Save us we beseech
thee from idlenesse,
worldlinesse, profanesse,
security and all occasions
whereby thy good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is grieved in us, our
graces weakned, and thy
great Name dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Vouchsafe us the
Spirit of judgement,
that wee may discerne
betwixt the short span of
this wretched life, and
the length and breadth
of immortality, that we
never preferre the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of sinne for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a little glory
and preferment in this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19893:18"/>
world, before the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
waight of glory laid
up in Heaven for all thy
children. Make us faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and conscionable in
our Callings, zealous
and sincere in all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
duties and services,
and wisely resolute to
stand for thy honour and
truth against all opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
either by divels or
wicked men. And so
direct, we beseech thee,
and sanctifie all our
courses, that for a few
and evill daies in this
vale of teares, wee may
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19893:19"/>
so store our selves with
spirituall comfort, with
a sound heart, with a
strong faith and a good
conscience, that we may
stand firme and sure at
the day of our visitation,
and when upon our
deaths bed we shall bee
set upon, by the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our owne flesh,
the terrors of death, the
fearefullnes of the grave,
and the firiest darts of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
we may comfortably
passe thorow them all, in
the name and power of
thy Son, and be receiv'd
with joyfulnes &amp; triumph
into those sacred mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19893:19"/>
which he hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
made ready in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for all those that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love and feare thee.</p>
            <p>In his blessed name
we powre out our soules
in thankfullnesse, for all
those many blessings and
comforts which thou
hast vouchsafed us, both
upon our soules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
both for this life and
a better. For our health,
wealth and liberty, our
peace, plenty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
our food, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
and preservation
from our infancy to this
very hower, and for all
the good meanes of all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19893:20"/>
these. For the free passage
of thy glorious Gospell
now so many yeares
amongst us. But amongst
all other temporall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of our times, let us
never forget, nor we, nor
all our posterity for ever,
how it pleased thee in
our daies miraculously
to magnifie the glory of
thy mercy in our won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
deliverance from
the most secret, bloody,
and fiery plot of the
Gun-powder Treason,
that great astonishment
of men and Angels. All
these outward comforts
both publicke and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19893:20"/>
are excellent and
pretious; yet they are
such as wee have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with the reprobates
and those that shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
see thy face with
comfort, but after a short
time spent in the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pleasures of this
vaine world, shall bee
turn'd to hell and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
fire. Wee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
more especially
magnifie thy great name
for the more speciall
pledges and tokens of
thy infinite love, for that
it hath pleased thee to
confirme and seale unto
us by our effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19893:21"/>
and the earnest of
thy good Spirit, our
Election to eternall life
from all eternity, our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Redemption from
the powers of hell by the
death of thy Sonne, and
an undoubted assurance
of the joyes of Heaven
in the world to come.
Increase in us good
LORD, wee beseech
thee, daily more and
more this blessed assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
which we infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
esteeme more deare
then tenne thousand
worlds, by making us
to grow in repentance
and faith, and spirituall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19893:21"/>
wisedome, and framing
us to the obedience of
thy Sonne in all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
love and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Furthermore gracious
Father, wee humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
thee, with the
bowels of thy tenderest
compassions to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
unto thy whole
Church and every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thereof. Fence it
mightily wee pray thee
with the Spirit of truth,
knowledge, and zeale
and constancy, that in
these worst and last daies
it may make a strong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
against the great
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19893:22"/>
maine floods of Popery,
Schisme, profanesse and
Atheisme.</p>
            <p>Be gracious unto this

thereof.</p>

            <p>Enrich we pray thee

discharge of
their duties, the many
multitudes in this Land
that lie in darknesse, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
profanesse, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and Schisme may
be brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

            <p>Lastly, gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

wee have now in

the glorious instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which thou hast
appointed for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19893:25"/>
and salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the soules of

wretches it hath
beene many times tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the barrennesse of
our hearts, the secret and
deceitfull corruptions of
our nature, much sleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and drowsinesse,
but as water spilt on the
ground, and even the
breath of thy Ministers
scattered in the aire. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
us deare Father all

irreverence and

holy exercises; and now
at length before we goe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19893:26"/>
downe into our graves,
into black and cruell ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations,

            <p>O LORD our GOD,
we pray thee bee

up we beseech thee our
dull hearts, out of a true
sence of our sinnes and
miseries, and a lively
faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in CHRIST
JESVS, and his preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

up our soules in prayers
and praises unto thee.</p>
            <p>O LORD how are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19893:27"/>
we bound to magnifie
thy great Name, for all
the loving kindnesse and
great mercies vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
us; for preserving
us this night past from
the ills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dangers,
which no doubt have
befallen many of our
brethren, as good by
nature as our selves; for
refreshing our fraile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
with quiet rest and
sleepe, and bringing us
in health, in strength, and
vigour of body to see
the light of this day;
for that it hath pleased
thee to reveale unto us
the mysteries of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19893:28"/>
and some measure
of saving truth, which
thou hast hid from many
thousands of the greatest
and wisest of the world;
For that thou hast pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
us from many
fearefull transgressions
and excesses of iniquity,
to which our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
would otherwise
have led us. For giving
us the being of reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
creatures, and being
borne in this blessed
time and part of the
world, when and where
thy glorious Gospell is
on foot, for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of our health and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19893:28"/>
strength of body, for the
usefullnesse and vigour
of the powers of our
soules and sences, of
which for abusing them,
we have deserv'd ere
this, to have beene feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
deprived. For our
ingenuous and godly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
for our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
company and good
counsell we have many
times by thy mercies
enjoyed. For thy Word
and Sacraments, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
meanes of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
and continuance
in grace. For many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
mercies, by which
thou hast laboured gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19893:29"/>
and fairely to draw us
unto thee. For those

hast sent to humble us,
and to bring us to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
For the inlarging
of our time for storing
our selves with Grace,
and comfort against the
day of our visitation.
For our freedome from
many miseries, crosses
and vexations which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
other our brethren

For that it hath pleased

save us from many
thousand others which

the world to come. For
preventing and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us with thy saving

            <p>O LORD, we pray
thee, to open our eyes
daily more and more, to
see and acknowledge
these thy great and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
mercies upon us;
and to enlarge our hearts
sincerely and feelingly
to magnifie thy great
Name for the same. And
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19893:30"/>
as wee humbly intreate
thee upon the knees of
our soules for pardon
and remission of all other
sinnes, so especially for
our monstrous and hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ingratitude for thy
great and many mercies
towards us most wicked
and sinfull creatures. We
are ashamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
that so much
favour, and mercy, and
long forbearance should
bee extended to such
rebellious and carnall
wretches as we are. For
besides that naturall pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
we drew from the
loines of our sinnefull
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19893:30"/>
parents, wee have heapt
up a great measure of
actuall sinnes, since we
had the use and exercise
of reason, and power and
ability to sinne. O
LORD our GOD, wee
humbly beseech thee to
give us a full sight of
them all, and a true sence
of thy great wrath &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
against them.
Let us have remorse and
compunction in our
hearts and consciences
for them all, in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
a perfect hate
and detestation of the
least corruptions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.
And bee thou
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19893:31"/>
pleas'd, gracious Father,
thorowly to purge and
wash our soules with the
precious blood of thy
deare Sonne, deliver
us quite, wee beseech
thee, from the guilt,
horrour and damnation
due unto them. And
grant that hereafter wee
may walke consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and carefully in all
our waies, that we suffer
no more our poore soules
to bee stained with these
foule pollutions we have
formerly delighted in.
Wee confesse and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to our shame
and confusion, that wee
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19893:31"/>
have many times vowed
betwixt thee and our
owne soules, that wee
would watch more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
over our owne
hearts, least they should
breed and nourish pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane,
idle and wandering
thoughts and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
over ourtalke, least
wee should offend with
our tongue, that wee
would be more zealous
and faithfull in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of our calling, in
sanctifying thy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
receiving thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
hearing thy
Word, in Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
company, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19893:32"/>
and all other
holy duties: but alas, all
these good purposes
have beene but as the
morning dew, we have
even in short time bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
our vowes, growne
cold againe, dull and
formall, to the much
greefe of thy good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and discomfort of
our owne soules. Now
LORD wee pray thee
deale mercifully with
us in this point, forgive
our many frailties and
infirmities herein; and
at length thorowly san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
us, draw our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
from the false glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19893:32"/>
and sinfull pleasures
of this vaine world, and
fasten them there, where
true, sound and lasting
comfort is to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Give us wise and
understanding hearts,
that we may see and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
those things that
belong to thy glory and
the salvation of our own
soules, and sanctified
wills and holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to follow and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
them with all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse,
zeale and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
of spirit. Let us
even this day get some
ground against Satan,
and forwardnesse in the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19893:33"/>
course of Sanctification.
Let us store our selves
with some new godly
purposes and holy reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
to doe thy will,
and keepe thy righteous
commandements. Fill
our hearts daily more
and more with all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
graces and the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of CHRIST JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS.
Cause us perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
to keepe in minde,
and consider that we are
but as pilgrims and
strangers here in this
world, that wee must
shortly depart hence, and
never returne againe,
but presently come to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19893:33"/>
judgement, and receive
an everlasting reward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our workes.
Weaken wee beseech
thee daily more and
more the power of sinne
in us, let us feele it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
and loose its hold
and haunt in us, and
strengthen in us the
power of grace, the new
man, and all spirituall
comforts.</p>
            <p>Neither pray wee for
our selves onely, but for
all thy deare children,
fellow heires with us of
everlasting happinesse in
what part of the world
soever they be. LORD
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19893:34"/>
we pray thee to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
present with
them with all thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and mercies, let
thy good Spirit leade
them into all truth, let
the wings of thy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and protection
stretch over them all.
And such as yet lie in
profanesse and under the
shadow of death, hasten
their conversion, reveale
unto them the glorious
comforts of grace, and
let the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
hold them no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>LORD be mercifull
unto this sinnefull King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19893:34"/>
wherein we live,
and enter not into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the horrible

abominations thereof.
Stay the rage of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanesse
that fearefully
overflowes in all places,
to thy great dishonour
and griefe of thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Stop the crying
sinnes of the time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
thine owne glory
out of the hands of

they be. Glorifie thine

for they in their

doe thee honour

Wee O LORD
thus wretched and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy

thee in our vocations,
whereas they should be
knit fast unto thy blessed

are for the most part

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19893:41"/>
The vanity
of our talke condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

words should be spent in
defending thy honour
and truth, in reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the horrible sinnes
of those amongst whom
wee live, in giving grace
to those that heare
us, they are for the most

worldlinesse and lying.
The wickednesse of our
deeds cry continually
for vengeance and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
upon us; for besides
our many and grosse sins,
even our best actions are
fearefully infected with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19893:41"/>
privy pride and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
whereas they

great want of due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,

In our prayers that

In all other good duties

want that courage, zeale
and spirituall wisdome,
which those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
mercies thou hast
vouchsafed us require at
our hands. O LORD
for thy great mercies
sake forgive us these
great sinnes. When we
looke upon the vilenesse
of our soules, by reason
of these many transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
we see nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes but thy
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19893:42"/>
heavy wrath, and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
curse, the torments
of hell and endlesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion;
but yet herein
standeth our comfort,
wee know that to them
which truly thirst after
thy kingdome, which
is righteousnesse and
peace and joy in the HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY
GHOST, which
faithfully desire to serve
thee in sincerity, though
they bee encompassed
with many weakenesses,
Thou art a Father of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
mercies and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
compassions, and
wilt passe by many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of thy deare chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19893:43"/>
Wee humbly
therefore beseech thee,
most gracious Father, to
bury all our sinnes both
before and since our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the grave of
CHRIST JESVS,
and hide them in his
righteousnesse for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.
There is no helpe
or comfort to be had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Heaven or in
Earth, in Angels, Saints,
or mortall men to our
wounded consciences,
but onely in the spotlesse
justice of thy deare Son.
Give assurance therefore
we beseech thee to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of our soules,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19893:43"/>
that his pretious bloud
was shed for our sinnes
in particular, that wee
may sensibly feele the

and rejoyce in the hope
of eternall life.</p>
            <p>In His blessed name
we give thee all possible
thankes, for those many
mercies and comforts
which thou hast plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

most unworthy wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>We thanke thee deare
Father for our health,
wealth and liberty; for
our peace, plenty and
prosperity; for our food
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19893:44"/>
and apparell; for our
preservation from our
cradle to this howre,
and all the good meanes
of these; but more es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
for the more
speciall tokens of thy
great love; for these we
have common with the
reprobates, and those
which shall never see
thy face with comfort,
but after a short time
spent in the miserable
pleasures of this vaine
world, shall be turn'd to
hell and everlasting fire.
We thanke thee for chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
us before all worlds
to be heires of Heaven
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19893:44"/>
and Citizens with thy

for confirming unto us
our Election by our effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall

when thy good Spirit
put the first motions into

all true joy and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
O most loving

with the worke of
this our New-birth that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19893:45"/>

never take away thy
hand unto the day of

Thou hast promised,
that whom thou hast lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
once, thou wilt
love for ever, and thou
art without all shadow
of change, and sooner
shall the mountaines bee
cast into the Sea before
one jot of thy gracious
promise fall unto the
ground, or one title of
thy Word be unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht.
Take from us
therefore wee beseech
thee all privy pride and
hypocrisie, all vanity
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19893:45"/>
and vaine-glory, all dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
backwardnesse
and security in thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
which hang so fast
on, which cleave so close
unto our soules, and
fearefully hinder us in
the course of godlinesse,
but above all things let
us never fall backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
into the grosse and
horrible sinnes of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneration.
Reveale
unto us we beseech thee
all our sinnes, give us

thy battells either

to every one a spirit to
his calling. Leade them
all into thy Sanctuary,
and teach them out of
thy holy Word first
and chiefly those things
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19893:47"/>
which concerne thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

depend upon them, and
lastly the salvation and

day of judgement, when
they shall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.
Enrich wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech

the Ministers and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers

Touch the hearts of the

and so be delivered out
of the tyranny and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:19893:49"/>
But especially as we
are bound at this time,
we humbly intreate thy
loving kindnesse and
tender mercies, for our
poore afflicted brethren
and sisters here about us
in <hi>London, Oxford,</hi> and
many other places of
this Land. O LORD
stay thy revenging hand;
Though wee bee but
wormes and dust, yet
thou art our Creator, and
we the worke of thy
hands. Thou art our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and wee thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Thou art our Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
and we thy sheep,
Thou art our Redeemer
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19893:50"/>
and wee the people
whom thou hast bought,
Thou art our GOD, and
we thine inheritance.
Forget not therefore O
LORD to be gracious,
and shut not up thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
kindnesse in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure;
turne thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
at the last, and bee
gracious unto thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>And grant wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee that these
great judgements may
effect and worke that
for which they were
sent, even true humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and undissembled
repentance, that we all
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19893:50"/>
turning unto thee in
truth and sincerity, thou
maist turne unto us with
thy mercies and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
compassions. And
whereas we whom of
thy great goodnesse thou
hast thus long time spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
are as deepe as
those whom the Plague
hath consumed. Wee
beseech thee make us
wise by their afflictions,
and so informe us in thy
feare, that we may frame
the rest of our life in all
holy obedience accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to thy will.</p>
            <p>Lastly most gracious
LORD, wee humbly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19893:51"/>
beseech thee to take us
this day under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of thy wings. Let
thy Omnipotency be a
brazen wall unto us, let
thy mighty hand and
stretched out arme en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compasse
us, let thy care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
providence watch
over us, and thy blessed
Angels pitch about us.
And sith wee now enter
into the affaires of this
day, let not we beseech
thee the delights, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
and honours of this
life ensnare our soules, or
make a breach into our
consciences: for these
weake and carnall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19893:51"/>
will never follow
us unto the darke places,
but when wee shall sit
downe in the dust, and
say unto corruption thou
art our father, and to the
worme thou art our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and sister, then they
will all leave us; nay
they will turne to
worme-wood and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse.
Sanctifie we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee our thoughts,
knit them fast unto thy
holy Word, and the
necessary businesses of
our vocation. Keepe,
we pray thee, in a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
moderation all
the affections of our
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19893:52"/>
hearts, and stirre our
passions that none of
them breake out upon
us either to dishonour
thy Majesty, disquiet
our owne consciences,
or disgrace our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
carriage. Let all our
words be seasoned with
grace, religion and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Let every action
into which we shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this day or ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
be just and lawfull,
and in them blesse us
with sincerity of heart,
with a godly end and
good meanes. O LORD,
we beseech thee give us
the spirit of judgement,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19893:52"/>
that wee may discerne
betweene the short span
of this wretched life,
and the length and
breadth of immortality,
that wee never esteeme
the pleasures of sinne
for a moment, before
eternall and everlasting
joyes, but even count
the best things of this
world as dung, as vanity
and nothing, nay as
worse then vanity and
lesse then nothing, for
the winning of CHRIST
JESVS, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
waight of glory
laid up in Heaven for
all thy servants. Worke
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19893:53"/>
in our hearts wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee a perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
even of our
sweetest and lest sinnes;
let us ever looke upon
them in their true nature,
and greatest ouglinesse,
as accompanied with
thy heavie displeasure
and fearefullest judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
that wee may
loath them as a Serpent,
and so cease for ever to
offend thee in them.
And whereas wee are
every day afresh to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
combat, not with
flesh and blood, but
with the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
the rulers of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19893:53"/>
ayer, the spirituall craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse
and pollicies of
hell; vouchsafe us wee
beseech thee the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate
armour of true
Christians. The brest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
of righteousnesse,
the helmet of salvation,
the sword of the Spirit;
but above all the shield
of faith, that wee may
manfully fight against
our corruptions, that
we may quench all the
fiery darts of Satan,
tread the malicious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
under our feete, and
at our last and greatest
fight in godly triumph
and through the might
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19893:54"/>
and merits of our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
JESVS CHRIST,
may say with gladnesse
and joy, O death where
is thy sting, O hell where
is thy victory. And in
the meane time, for as
much as every day wee
step neerer our grave,
and approach neerer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy presence, and
that great and fearefull
judgement before thy
throne, even for our
idle words and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
thoughts, give
unto us we beseech thee
every day a new grace,
a new strength in the
course of regeneration,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19893:54"/>
more full assurance of
the remission of our sins,
till with a wise heart, we
have such a feeling of
the glory of GOD, and
of eternall life, that wee
make up our account
with the world, and bee
at a point with all that is
under the Sun. And sith
at that day we must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
not onely for the
sinnes of our owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but for many sins
of those that depend
upon us, if we labour
not to bring them unto
GOD; for sinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by our ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
for sinnes that we
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19893:55"/>
have seene and heard in
others, and have not
grieved &amp; religiously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
them. LORD
we beseech thee give
us an exact and precise
care over all our waies;
over our generall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Christianity and
those particular callings
wherein thou hast pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
us. And let us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be hindered or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
in any good
thing by the profane and
malicious reproaches of
wicked and carnall men,
and the many oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Satan; and the
rather because to us it is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19893:55"/>
a blessed marke that we
are translated out of
darknesse into light, and
that we will not runne
with them unto the same
excesse of ryot: but
to them it is a token
of perdition. For why
should we, good LORD,
for the vaine and unjust
censures of mortall wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
turne from thee for
this little inch of time,
and hereafter receive
everlasting confusion.</p>

All the time before our

us so long a time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and for infinite
more blessings which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19893:65"/>
neither our hearts can
thinke, nor tongues ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse.</p>
            <p>Now one thing deare
LORD will we beg at
thy hands, and that will
we crave for evermore,
that thou wouldst give
us grace and power by

and dispose all these
excellent blessings both
eternall and temporall,
chiefly and principally
to the honour of thy
great Name, to the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of our soules, and
the good of thy Church.
And to this end roote
we beseech thee out of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19893:65"/>
our soules all pride, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
envy, covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

al thoughts of Atheisme,
Infidelity, uncleanenesse,
all the menstruous filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

we beseech thee and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft
deepely into our
soules the true feare of
thy glorious Name, true
humility, true zeale and
devotion, true sorrow
and repentance for all
our sinnes, true spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19893:66"/>
understanding, true
hope and charity; but
above all things a true,
strong and a lively faith
truly to apprehend the
death and Passion of
our deare Saviour, and
in particular and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to apply it to our
sinfull soules. LORD
make it ever powerfull
and invincible, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in all times of our
crosses and afflictions;
but LORD make it most
triumphant and glorious
even at the hower of
death, at our last visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when the divell shall
set before the eyes of our
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19893:66"/>
soules the blacke and
ougly catalogue of all
our sins, and when hee
shall prepare his firiest
darts to wound our

let the light of thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

upon us, O then let<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy

us with his sweetest
comforts, let the fresh
bleeding wounds of our
deare Saviour appeare
gracious and effectuall to
our distressed soules.</p>
            <p>Blesse good LORD,
protect and defend thy
Church wandring farre
and wide over the face
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19893:67"/>
of the whole earth. Let
thy mighty hand and
stretched out arme en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compasse
it, let thy Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency
bee a brazen
wall about it; leade it
we beseech thee into all
truth, concord and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
save it from all
schismes, errors and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies;
mightily fence it
from bloody Tyrants,
hellish Atheists and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse
Polititians.</p>
            <p>Comfort we beseech
thee all those that bee
comfortlesse, and distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with sorrow, need,
sicknesse, imprisonment,
banishment, slanderous
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19893:67"/>
tongues, or any other
crosse or calamity. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
good LORD,
speake comfortably unto
them in whose soules are
the arrowes of thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
thereof drinkes up
their spirit, those that
groane under the burthen
of a vexed conscience,
and those that suffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
for the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of thy truth. LORD
give them faith, patience
and constancy to abide
their triall, and a joyfull
issue to all their tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>And as at this time we
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19893:68"/>
are bound wee humbly
intreate thy tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and loving kindnesse
for all those in this Land
that thou hast heavily
visited with the Plague
of Pestilence. For
CHRIST JESUS
sake if it be thy blessed
pleasure command thy
Angell to cease from stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
put up the sword
of judgement, which in
great wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thou hast drawne
out against them. And
LORD in the meane
time give them joy and
comfort in thy holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that howsoever they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19893:68"/>
be strangely and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
tormented in their
body in this life, yet
they may be assured of
eternall happinesse in the
life to come. And teach
we beseech thee both
them and us by thy holy
Spirit to take a right view
of all our sins, the true
causes of thy wrathfull
displeasure, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to repent for the same.
And so much the rather
O LORD, because the
reprobate and such as
thou forsakest cannot
praise thee nor call upon
thy Name, but the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
heart, the sorrowfull
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19893:69"/>
mind and a conscience
hungring after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
shall ever set
forth thy praise and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Lastly most loving
Father we beseech thee
take us into thy defence
and protection this night,
let thy carefull provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
watch over us, let
thy blessed Angels pitch
about us, preserve us
from all perills and
dangers, from all the
assaults of Satan, from
vaine, idle, and wicked
dreames. Grant unto our
bodies comfortable rest
and quiet sleepe, but let
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19893:69"/>
our soules continually
watch for the comming
of our Saviour in the
clouds to end these last
and worst daies. Amen,
even so come LORD
JESVS, that we with
thee and the rest of thy
Elect may joyfully and
triumphantly ascend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

And therefore we

            <p>O LORD we are all

            <p>Rise up O LORD,

Plague of Pestilence
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19893:104"/>

            <p>O Most mighty, and

GOD, our ever loving

wretches, thy unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest

before thy Throne
of grace, acknowledging
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19893:106"/>
from our hearts, that we
are the vilest of all Thy
Creatures, by reason of
our manifold, and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
sins, we are defiled
and polluted in every
power and part both of
body and soule, to the
very heart roote, and
from the beginning of
our being, we laid at first
a bloudy foundation
with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise,
which utterly undid all
mankinde, and had our
hands in that horrible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
which brought
all mischiefs and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
all sinne and sorrow
upon all the sonnes and

everlastingly. O LORD
strike our hearts with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
for This sin, of
which we take so little
notice, that we may bee
humbled for it, all the
daies of our life; Wee
came into this world ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sinkes of all impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

blinde in all heavenly

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19893:107"/>
froward, rebellious to
every good word and
worke: Memory sinfull
and defiled: hard and
stony hearts, raging

earthly and sensuall
thoughts and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
dead and guilty
consciences; eyes full
of Adultery, wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

eare open to all rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19893:107"/>
into the cursed
communion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
and wicked spirits,
by reason of that origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
corruption, and
crookednesse which we
drew from the loines of
our sinfull Parents. And
this hereditary masse of
naturall filth, lurkt in our
natures like venome and
poison, which made us
odious and abominable
in thy sight before wee
were able to sin: when
wee had power to serve
the Divell, it broke out
upon us into as many
fearefull transgressions
and abominable lusts, as
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:19893:108"/>
could possibly proceed
from so empoysoned a

that time, good Lord
thou knowest we have
borne our selves like
Traytors and rebells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thy holy Majesty:
we have actually trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grest
all thy blessed
Lawes and Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
every manner of
way, in thought, word,
and deed: fearefully
wounding our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
greeving thy good

wrath against the day of
wrath.</p>
            <p>O Lord wee have
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19893:108"/>
grievously sinned against
Thee, by contempt of
thy Word, The crying
sinne of this place: by

distrust of thy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
carnall security,

Idolatry in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

the mighty LORD
of Heaven and Earth: By
the grosse neglect, or

preached or read, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
meditation, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
vowes, fasting, use
of good bookes, good
company and the like,
some of those have been
utterly neglected by us,
others quite mard by
formality and sloth.</p>
            <p>We have highly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonoured
thy Majesty,
by taking thy great name
in vaine: in want of due
esteeme, and an holy use
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19893:109"/>
of thy Titles, Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
Ordinances, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Workes of justice
and mercy abroad in the
world.</p>
            <p>We have fearefully
polluted thy Sabboths,
and profaned all thy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
upon those
blessed daies.</p>
            <p>And as we have thus
wickedly neglected thy
Worship and Service in
the first place, so wee
have beene justly given
over to beare our selves
wretchedly, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
towards our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
we have behaved
our selves unthankfully
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19893:110"/>
to our Superiours: proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to our Equals, unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
to our Inferiours.</p>
            <p>Though it may bee
we have kept our hand
from the grosse act of
murder: yet LORD
thou know'st our tongues
have beene swords, and
our hearts full of blood.</p>
            <p>We have beene defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with all manner of
abominable lusts in our
inward parts.</p>
            <p>Our noble spirits that
can never die, have been
basely chained downe to
the earth; and kept in
a wicked and dunghill
slavery, and bondage to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19893:110"/>
the world and worldly
things.</p>
            <p>In our tongues we have
beene guilty of a world
of wickednesse.</p>
            <p>But above all, our
hearts have beene rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
fountaines of all ill:
innumerable litters, and
swarmes of vaine, vile,
filthy Thoughts, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and desires have
continually bred in them;
very thorough-faires
have they beene for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
impure suggestions,
to walke up and downe
in: in regard of malicious
thoughts, very slaughter-houses;
in regard of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19893:111"/>
lusts, very stewes,
and brothel-houses; in
regard of the heate of
boyling concupiscence,
very hot-houses, and as
the Prophet <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 4.
speakes, like a bakers
Oven. And LORD our
GOD, these are but the
heads of our sins: The
branches, streames, and
particulars are infinite,
able to sinke us into the
bottome of ten thousand
hells: And that which
makes our sinnes a great
deale more sinfull, wee
have wretchedly and
stubbornely committed
them against many
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19893:111"/>
meanes of sanctification;
against the ministery of
thy Word; against ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sermons and gratious
invitations; against the
motions of thy Spirit,
the checks of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
the light of our
knowledge; against our
vowes, and promises,
Thy many fatherly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
great mercies,
and miraculous patience.</p>
            <p>Good LORD wee
beseech thee to open
our eyes, that wee may
see the length, and
breadth, the height and
depth of this our wofull
misery: The least of all
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19893:112"/>
our sins without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
may justly bring
upon us all manner of
plagues and judgements
in this world; dispaire
and horror upon our
beds of death, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
misery and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the world to
come. What height of
horror then, and depth
of hell doe all our feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
pollutions, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
all our life
long deserve at thine
hands?</p>
            <p>Now good LORD
our GOD helpe us,
and for the blood of
CHRIST give unto
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19893:112"/>
every one of us before
thee this day, true, and
saving repentance, unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
godly sorrow for
them all. Let them all
now come into our
mindes, and be represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the eye of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
as so many fiery
Scorpions, out of which,
except we take as it were
the stings, by turning
from them, while it is
called to day; they will
sting hereafter with
everlasting horrour. Let
us looke upon them, as
upon so many foule
feinds, (sin made the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:19893:113"/>
spirits) how foule then
doe they make us, who
are sons and daughters of
<hi>Adam:</hi> Let us behold
them as so many foule
and bloody instruments
of CHRIST his death,
and cruell cut-throats to
our owne soules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us cast our eye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
upon thy pure eye,
and infinite indignation
against sin: by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
how in thy fierce
wrath thou threwest
downe so many glorious
Creatures from Heaven.
How thou cast <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve</hi> for eating the
forbidden fruit out of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19893:113"/>
Paradise, drownedst the
whole world, Cursedst
<hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> as it
were with hellish flame
upon earth into ashes,
cast off thine owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who had beene so
deare unto thee: puts
sometimes a guilty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
conscience even
into an hell above
ground, and hast created
and provided the never
dying worme, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
fire, even all
the torments in hell, for
impenitent sinners.</p>
            <p>O LORD let these
considerations, of the
foulenesse of our sinnes,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:19893:114"/>
and the fearefullnesse of
the curse due thereunto;
but above all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of JESVS
CHRIST, dying and
bleeding upon the crosse;
make every one of our
hearts to breake and
burst and bleede within
us for them all: That
wee may heartily, and
abundantly mourne over
him whom wee have
pierced with them. And
then most mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we humbly beseech
thee be graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to open upon us the
blessed fountaine for sin
and for uncleanenesse,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:19893:114"/>
even the blood of that
Immaculate Lambe JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS

Breake thine own sweete
Name which is to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
iniquity, transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and sin, as a sweete
perfume upon our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

poore soules cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for ever, with a
lively and fruitfull faith
into the armes of JESVS
CHRIST for everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
safety, and for ever
cleave to all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in thy blessed Booke,
as to the surest Rocke,
and let the soundnesse of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:19893:115"/>
the Truth of this our
cleaving unto Christ, be
hereafter testified, and
manifested, by an hearty
abandoning of all sin; by
all the workes of piety,
justice, mercy, and truth,
by a sincere respect to all
thy Commandements,
by a fruitfull partaking
of all thy Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,

we being thus sincerely

by thy might, to cry
mightily unto thee for
pardon, and reformation
of the sins of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which are many

the heart of every one

            <p>

and horrible sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which devoures
now and eates up thy
people in our chiefe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
And is fearefully

the snare of the Fowler,
the noysome Pestilence,
the terrour by night, the
arrow that flieth by day,
the destruction that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth

them by worldlinesse,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:19893:122"/>
lusts, and earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</p>
            <p>4. We have vexed
thy blessed Angels, so
much as in us lies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
many other waies,
even in this house of
thine, with unreverence,
drowsinesse, sleepinesse,
and the like, where
they are beholding with
delight the misteries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the Gospell.</p>
            <p>5. We have wofully
abused all thy creatures,
they should have mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
to us continuall
matter of heavenly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
upon thy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and goodnesse,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:19893:122"/>
power, and providence,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but our earthly minds
have made no such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
use of them, but wee
have covetously and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
abused them to
our owne ends, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
contentments.</p>
            <p>6. Even this Kingdome,
gratious Father, wherein
we have beene borne,
and bread, and enjoyed
many good things, hath
beene much worse for
us; For we have had our
hands LORD thou
knowest in pulling downe
upon us, this horrible
sicknesse of the plague of
Pestilence, and other
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:19893:123"/>
judgements, both tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
and spirituall: and
without true, and timely
repentance, are likely
enough to hasten the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
sword, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of destruction to
make an end of us.</p>
            <p>7. We have abused
all thy fatherly correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and chastisements
laid upon us in love, and
for our good, they should
have brought forth in us
the peaceable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fruits of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but they have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
begot murmuring,
impatiency, and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:19893:123"/>
8. We have abused
thy mercies, which have
beene heaped abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon us above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
even to increase our
security, and presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and forgetfullnesse of
the evill day.</p>
            <p>9. We have abused
the most gracious, and
glorious day of visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
that ever any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
enjoyed upon earth:
passing over it very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably,
like sons, and
daughters of confusion,
not gathering any such
stock and store of grace,
against our ending houre
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:19893:124"/>
as we might plentifully
have done.</p>
            <p>10. We have abused
all thy blessed Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
those heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits
of all spirituall
blessings, grace, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
By our unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rednesse
before, irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the use of them,
fruitlesnesse, and want of
practise afterward.</p>
            <p>11. We have wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
abused our owne
bodies, and soules, by
abandoning them to the
service of Satan, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
all our members
instruments of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
to sin. Feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:19893:124"/>
were they infected
with Originall sin at first,
but we have made them
much more sinfull by our
actuall transgressions ever
since; we have added a
great deale of folly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the mystery of
CHRIST: every way
LORD thou knowest
we are become excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
sinfull.</p>
            <p>We humbly intreate
thee in the name of the
LORD JESVS to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
our mindes, and
open our eyes, to see the
length, and breadth, the
height, and depth, of this
our sinfull misery, for
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:19893:125"/>
which thou mightest
justly bring upon us all
the curses in thy booke,
and all the torments in
hell, and in the meane
time plague us with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us over to more
hardnesse of heart, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of minde, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of conscience, sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
under our lusts, a
reprobate sence, and to
be finally sealed up with
the spirit of slumber a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the day of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
which are farre
worse then all the
plagues of Egypt.</p>
            <p>1. Thou mightest
Holy Father even thine
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:19893:125"/>
owne selfe for our many
dishonours, and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
against thee draw
that sword against us,
that would eate flesh and
drinke blood: suffer that
wrath to be kindled in
thy bosome against us,
which would burne unto
the bottome of Hell:
come against us as a
Beare robbed of her
whelps, and rent the
caule of our hearts, and
teare us in peeces like a
Lyon when there is none
to helpe.</p>
            <p>2. Thine owne deare
Sonne might for ever
deny us his pretious
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:19893:126"/>
bloud, to wash away the
least staine from our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
soules.</p>
            <p>3. Thy Holy Spirit
might never more put
any motion into our
hearts.</p>
            <p>4. Thy blessed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
might take no more
charge over us, or be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring
spirits unto us for
our good, but leave us as
a prey to that roaring
Lyon, and his damned
Angels.</p>
            <p>5. All the Creatures
might come justly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
against us, with their
severall stings and rage
to make an end of us, for
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19893:126"/>
rebelling against thee
their Creator.</p>
            <p>6. This Kingdome
wherein we live, might
justly fall into the mouth
of some horrible confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and we inwrapt in
the miseries and desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof.</p>
            <p>7. All crosses, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and thine angry
visitations upon us,
might be unto us the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
beginnings of Hellish
paines.</p>
            <p>8. Thy many mercies
unto us which should
leade us unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
might onely serve
to far us against the day
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:19893:127"/>
of slaughter.</p>
            <p>9. The day of our
gratious visitation might
end, and the Sun set upon
the Prophets.</p>
            <p>10. All thy blessed
Ordinances might bee
unto us the savour of
death unto death.</p>
            <p>11. Our bodies and
soules might bee most
justly cast into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of Hell, there to be
tormented with the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>O LORD our GOD,
we humbly beseech thee
for the LORD JESUS
his sake, let a serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of this our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnesse
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19893:127"/>
and cursednesse
breake our stony hearts
into peeces, make them
burst and bleed within
us, and good LORD
our GOD, we being thus
sincerely humbled, let us
get faster hold upon the
LORD JESVS, with
a sound and fruitfull faith
then heretofore; by a
stedfast looking upon
him, and all his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
and satisfactions,
from his comming from
thy bosome untill his
returning unto thy right
hand againe: by survay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the promises of
of life sealed with his
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:19893:128"/>
blood: by cleaving to
his sweetest name: which
is to forgive iniquity,
transgression and sin: and
resting our selves with a
thankfull, and joyfull
acknowledgement upon
that blessed mystery of
his free grace, which
reacheth from everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
to everlasting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <head>A Thankesgiving.</head>
            <p>MOst mighty and
most glorious Lord
God of Heaven and
Earth, our light and life,
our Sun and shield: the
strength of our hearts,
and our portion forever.
Thou art the Author of
all our good, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of all our blisse, the
well-spring of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
and life, wherein
we live, and move, and
have our being, even
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:19893:129"/>
our naturall, spirituall,
and eternall being. And
therefore to thy great
and glorious Majesty, we
render from the bottome
of our hearts, all possible
praise, and thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
for all those glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
mercies, and richest
favours which thou
from time to time, hast
abundantly and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
vouchsafed unto us
most rebellious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull,
and undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
wretches.</p>
            <p>We thanke thee for
the well-head, and first
fountaine of them all, thy
love towards us, and of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19893:129"/>
all our good every way,
even the good pleasure
of thine own good will,
thy free grace, and that
mercy that reacheth
from everlasting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</p>
            <p>We thanke thee for
putting us into this
world in the best, and
blessed part and time
thereof. We might have
beene borne, and lived
in the time of the flood,
and so beene drown'd
and damn'd, or within
the compasse of that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
foure thousand
yeares betweene the
Creation and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19893:130"/>
of CHRIST,
out of the partition wall,
and so have had no
meanes or ordinary possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of salvation. But
have lived, and dyed in
cursed Paganisme, and
Heathenish Idolatry;
we might have lived in
that darke and damned
mid-night, and have
beene choakt with the
doctrine of divels: wee
might have lived at this
time of the world, but
amongst Turks, Pagans,
Infidels, where wee
should never have heard
savingly of JESVS
CHRIST: It's thy
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:19893:130"/>
infinite mercy wee have
beene borne, and bread,
and brought up in this
happy time of the world,
and blessed corner of the
Earth, this illightned
Goshan, where we have
enjoyed or might have
enjoyed, the glorious
Gospell of our blessed
GOD with such purity,
power, and peace.</p>
            <p>We thank thee blessed
GOD for making us
reasonable Creatures,
capable of grace and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.
Thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
have let us lie for
ever in that abhorred
state of being nothing,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:19893:131"/>
and wee should never
have dishonoured thee:
Thou mightest have
made us of those Angels
that are become wicked
spirits, and then we had
beene irrecoverably lost:
Thou mightest have
made us Toads, or Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
vermine, or any
vild thing: and we should
never have prooved such
Traytors, and rebells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee as we have
beene.</p>
            <p>O LORD, we praise
thee, that thou hast made
us of thy noblest Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and given us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:19893:131"/>
of GOD, so that if
we be not cursedly cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
to our owne soules,
they may be saved ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
by the meanes
that we enjoy.</p>
            <p>We blesse thee Holy
Father, for thy Fatherly
care of us, being yet in
our mothers wombe,
wonderfully, and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
made: For that
miraculous mercy in
bringing us into this
world, and giving us
leave to see this light.
For thy gratious watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over us while wee
hung upon our mothers
breasts, since that time
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:19893:132"/>
for thy mercifull conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
to us of our life,
health, liberty, outward
meanes, the use of our
wits, limbs, senses; for
all the good wee have
had by good yoake-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
good Parents,
good children, good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
good neighbours,
good governours, or any
of thy good creatures, for
every step we have made
upon this Earth, every
bit of bread we have put
into our mouthes, for
every draught of aire we
have drawne into these
fraile bodies, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
more then heart can
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:19893:132"/>
thinke, or tongue tell,
and which we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

or expresse.</p>
            <p>Above all, we of this
place are bound to praise
thy goodnesse most mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
GOD, for that
most incomparable Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
that ever this world

the Ministery of

of salvation, the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the mystery of

of all thy blessed

whereof so many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, as have truly
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:19893:133"/>
tasted how gratious and
glorious thou art in

magnifie, and admire, the
bottomelesse depth, and
infinite height of thy
free grace, for our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
conversion from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
to the living GOD,
for our change from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to grace, a greater
and more glorious work
then the Creation of the
world, wherein thou hast
improved thine owne
infinite mercie, the unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
merit of thy
Sonne, and the mighty
worke of the HOLY
GHOST, to make us of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:19893:133"/>
limbs of the divell mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of CHRIST, O
blessed be that happy
time, that ever we were
so new borne.</p>
            <p>Wee thanke thee for
pardoning all our sins,
the least of which would
have damned us everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly:
for renewing
upon our soules the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
image of the LORD
JESVS, the least glimpse
whereof is infinitely
more worth then the

            <p>We thank thee for the

every drop of his preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

for the prayers of

            <p>We thanke thee hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
for any power or

at any time over our sins;
for all our ability to doe
thee any service, in any

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:19893:134"/>
for all those afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

from the throne of grace
by the influence of thy
holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Blessed GOD, wee
thanke thee infinitely for
those glorious mansions
of rest, for our everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

purchased for us, with
the blood of CHRIST:
for every moment of

eternity in the highest
Heavens; where wee
shall fully and for ever
enjoy pleasures without

O blessed Joyes! O

            <p>Furthermore gratious

unto this Kingdome,
wherein we have had a
large and comfortable

            <p>We thanke thee good
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:19893:135"/>
Father for the happy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from the fiery and
bloudy times of Queene
<hi>Mary;</hi> for raising up
Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who
raised Religion as it
were by a miracle from
the dead: for all her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
deliverances
from the cruell conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
of the bloody Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
especially that in
88. For all her blessed
daies, wherein so many
Holy Saints were sent to
Heaven.</p>
            <p>We thanke thee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
GOD, for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
us from the rage
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:19893:136"/>
and bloud of that day so
long looked for by the
Papists, at Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi>
death; for the quiet
and happy succession of
King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed
memory, and all the
peace and prosperity,
and freedome from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sword, especially
the Powder-plot.</p>
            <p>We thanke thee, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
most heartily, for
the gratious setling of
King CHARLES in
the Royall Throne, for
his life and safety, and
the happy daies we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
under his blessed

raigne: and that thou
hast put into his royall
heart to give us this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
liberty, and glorious
opportunity, thus to
humble our selves, and
afflict our soules in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
before thy glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Majesty. We hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
intreate thee in the
name of CHRIST let
every one of us receive
at thy bountifull hands
grace and power to doe
it unfainedly, effectually,
and savingly. For that
purpose let thy blessings
fall abundantly from
Heaven upon every soule

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:19893:137"/>
of thy Word,
settle fast we pray thee
by the finger of thy Holy
Spirit in our memories,
judgement, affections,
hearts and consciences,
all those points of Holy
Truth with which wee
have beene acquainted
with this day, that by thy
mercifull blessing they
may prove thy arme and
power to every one of us
for our salvation, for the
conversion of those who
are yet uncalled, and the
setting forward of those
that are already thine, in
the waies of life, all holy
conversation, and neerer
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:19893:137"/>

            <p>At last we cannot but
reflect with compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionare

afflicted with the plague

stay the hand of thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying

now at the joynt suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of all thy deare

that we may

            <p>Lastly blessed LORD
we humbly beseech thee
to pardon in mercy all
those corruptions, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:19893:139"/>
faylings, defects

Prayer.</head>
            <p>O My good and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
LORD GOD,
most holy and deare Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in JESVS CHRIST,
I the vilest of all thy
creatures and the worst
that ever thou madest,
by reason of mine owne
horrible sins, doe here
come unto thee upon the
bended knees of my
bleeding soule to intreate
thee and beg at thy
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:19893:140"/>
hands with all the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and fervency my
poore, dull, cold heart
can possibly for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
grace and mercy,
for favour, compassion
and abundant forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
O LORD my
GOD, thou knowest me
full well, and thorowly,
even to the bottome of
my heart and beginning
of my being: for besides
that I came into this
world loaden with an
heavie burden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Babell of crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and corruption, in
every part both of soule
and body: thou knowest
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:19893:141"/>
what a cursed confluence
of all manner of polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
filthinesse, uncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
strange abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
abominable lusts,
and every villanous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
that is wont to
spring out of our impoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
nature, made my
poore soule a very sinke
and Sodom before I was
converted.</p>
            <p>Reckon up here unto
GOD particulars,
out of abundance of
feeling, with a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
and sincere
confession, and then
goe on.</p>
            <p>Thus O LORD thou
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:19893:141"/>
knowest, when thou very
mercifully at the first
didst call and knocke at
my heart by the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of thy Word, with
what stubbornenesse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy
and delaies I
withstood the worke of
thy blessed Spirit for the
salvation of my owne
poore soule. How loath
I was to open the eyes of
my understanding to let
in the heavenly light of
that holy truth, which
onely could make mee
gracious here and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in thy Kingdome
hereafter. And when
thou hadst something
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:19893:142"/>
conquered the hardnesse
of my heart, so that in
some measure I saw the
hatefullnesse of my sin,
and felt the horror of thy
wrath for them. O LORD
thou knowest I did not so
grieve, sorrow and take
on, as so great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
a sinner ought to
have done, I did not
mourne for them as the
mourning of <hi>Hadadrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
in the valley of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giddo,</hi>
I was not sorry for
them as one is sorry for
his first borne. I was not
throwne downe into the
dust, and into the place
of Dragons, and into that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:19893:142"/>
depth of humiliation
which the villany and
variety of my many most
horrible transgressions,
farre as much as the sins
of the vilest wretch that
ever lived upon earth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
at my hands.
Nay, and when after the
sence and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my vile and
damnable estate, I saw
the blood and merits of
my blessed Redeemer to
be the onely meanes to
save me from out of hell,
I did not feele in my selfe
that hunger and thirst,
that panting and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
those groanes, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:19893:143"/>
and strong
cries for that soveraigne
and saving Plaister to
heale my wounded soule,
as mine owne misery and
the excellency of my
CHRIST should have
moov'd me unto. And
when at length it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thee upon thy owne
free mercy to offer unto
my sorrowfull and sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
soule thy deare Son,
and all his pretious suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
my unbeleeving
and naughty heart did
not embrace, and lay
hold upon him with that
fastnesse and faithfullnes
as the certainty of thy
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:19893:143"/>
promises, the truth and
sweetnesse of thy mercy
most plentifully revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in thy Word doe
straitly enjoyne mee.
Thus LORD even eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
step of my passage
out of nature into Grace,
out of corruption into
Christianity, and the
snares of the divell into
the kingdome of Christ,
was, as thou knowest,
fearefully hindred with
the hardnesse of my own
corrupt heart, and fowly
polluted with the lusts
and rebellions of my sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
nature.</p>
            <p>Nay, and that which
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:19893:144"/>
grieves me the most, and
should justly make my
heart even to bleede
within me, since I gave
my name unto religion,
came into the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Saints, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the waies of new
obedience, I have beene
dragd back by the cruell
pollicie of Satan, and the
accustomed yeelding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of my sensuall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
into some vile
and hatefull abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the daies of my
vanity, and time of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation:
and also
overtaken with some
new knowne scandalous
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:19893:144"/>
sins, to the grieving of
thy good Spirit, the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
wounding of my
conscience, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing
of my profession.
I have beene very slack
and slow, and faint-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in promoting thy
glory, furthering good
causes and performing
holy duties. I have beene
very dull and cold, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
and formall in
all the waies of godlines,
and my Christian war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
in respect of many
Christians, who have
not neere beene so great
sinners before they were
converted, or receiv'd
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:19893:145"/>
the thousand part of
those favours from thee,
as I have done. I have
beene too heavie, heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and uncomfortable
in my profession, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
godly exercises
and practises of grace; I
have not so rejoyced, as I
ought, in all the good
things which thou hast
done for me, I have not
walked so cheerefully
towards a crowne of life,
as formerly towards the
damnation of hell. Nay,
LORD, and even in
those things, wherein I
should have the greatest
comfort, when I examine
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:19893:145"/>
my naughty and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
heart, I finde nothing
but confusion of face.
Even my prayers, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and reading the
Word, receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
meditations,
conferences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are so
mingled with temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
worldly thoughts,
by-respects, deadnesse
and drowsinesse of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
so mard with privie
pride, and secret hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
that I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them without
griefe of heart; neither
dare I thinke upon them
without prayer for the
pardon of their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:19893:146"/>
I finde great
matter of humiliation in
the best of them, and I
know thou mightest there
also finde much matter
of damnation, if thou
shouldest deale with me
as I have deserved. O
LORD my GOD, this
is my state, nay and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a thousand times
worse and more wofull
yet then I or the tongue
of an Angell can make it.
And I have nothing in
the world to say for my
selfe, I have none to goe
unto either in Heaven or
in Earth, but onely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
my blessed Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:19893:146"/>
to speake unto thee
in my behalfe, to make
intercession for me with
his glorious merits and
pretious blood-shed: and
to flee unto those melting
bowells of thy Fatherly
compassions and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartednesse,
with which
thou art wont to meete
and fall upon the neck of
every humbled, sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and broken-hearted
sinner. I do therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee, mercifull
LORD, upon the bowed
knees of my sin-grieved
heart to pardon and put
away all my many horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
hainous and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:19893:147"/>
sins in the pretious
blood of thine own deare
Son. It is onely the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
blood of that spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Lambe which hath
power and force to turne
the deepest staine of scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
and crimson sins into
the whitenesse of snow &amp;
wooll. And there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
poore, sinfull wretch
had more need of the
multitude of thy mercies,
and abundance of that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
blood to doe away
the multitude of my
sins, and to wash &amp; purge
and rinze my filthy and
polluted soule. I pray
thee therfore for Christ
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:19893:147"/>
Jesus his sake, for thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
names sake, for thine
infinite mercies sake, and
for thine own Covenants
sake, to make good unto
me the true sweetnesse, &amp;
utmost comfort of all
those gracious promises
of life, which ere flowed
from thy free mercy,
through the Passion of
thy Son upon any poore
soule, who sought thee
with truth of heart, &amp; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lov'd the glory of thy
name. I strangely deceive
mine owne heart if I doe
not hunger and thirst for
thy favour and pleased
countenance more then
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:19893:148"/>
for all the treasures of the
earth, &amp; the glory of the
whole world Make mine
heart I pray thee, as thou
wouldst have it, and then
be a Sun &amp; shield unto it,
and crowne it with al the
comforts of Heaven, as
thou hast promised: then
seale unto it for ever the
sure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> &amp;
the salvations of the life
to come. And I beseech
thee also, to be so loving
and mercifull to my lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
spirit, so tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
and kinde to my
trembling heart, that I
may feele in my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the sprinkling of the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:19893:148"/>
blood of thy Son, for the
appeasing of it, &amp; that my
poore soule may sensibly
know what great things
thou hast done for it, and
that thou art reconciled
unto it for ever in Christ
Jesus. Above all things
fill my heart with the
joyfull feeling of thy
mercies in the pardon of
my sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that so my quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
soule may sweetly
sleepe, and solace it selfe
everlastingly in that
peace which passeth all
understanding, and in the
bosome of thy compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And for the time to
come, I pray thee, to help
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:19893:149"/>
me more and more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
&amp; increase my repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
to better &amp; inlarge
my obedience: and put to
thine owne holy hand to
strengthen every grace
thou hast given me. O
Lord my God, I could
never yet get neere that
hand &amp; hatred over my
sins, as I have infinitely
desired. I beseech thee
now at length let mee
feele thy speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
power mightily
assisting me in this holy
businesse. The sins of my
youth have beene most
hatefull, execrable and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable,
both to God
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:19893:149"/>
and man, nay and I have
been guilty of many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
villanies, which
have beene only knowne
to thy All-seeing eye and
mine owne corrupt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
I pray thee bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Lord, for thy Christ
his sake, to worke in my
heart godly sorrow, true
loathing, sound repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and humiliation for
them all, in some good
measure answerable and
proportionable to their
heighnousnesse and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.
Oh grant mee that
happinesse, that I may
look back upon all those
fowle pollutions, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:19893:150"/>
vanities of my unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
time without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sensuall delight, or
slavish horror; even with
a sincere hatred and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
mourning. Let me see
them without any des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairefull
feare, being
assured they are done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with the blood of
thy Son, as though they
had never been: &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any secret delight,
lest I renew and multiply
their guilt &amp; grievousnes
upon my poore soule,
which they have too
fearefully wounded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
And Lord I pray
thee also, put quickning
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:19893:150"/>
life, power and feeling
into my heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the performance
of every holy duty,
which is the very heart
and soule of a pleasing
sacrifice and service unto
thee. Increase in me an
holy feare, reverence &amp;
respect to all thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.
Cause and
continue in me a sincere,
universall, and constant
obedience unto them all,
&amp; that not from any sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
feare, private end or
by-respect, but for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
sake, a soule-like
feare of thee and love of
thy glory. And if at any
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:19893:151"/>
time, as it is ordinary
with Gods children, it
shall please thee to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
me with any crosse,
disgrace, slander, discou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
losse of goods,
disease of body, terror of
soule, or the like, I pray
thee ever sweeten &amp; san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
them unto mee by
thy blessing: &amp; grant that
I may ever obediently
with all peace of heart, &amp;
patience of spirit submit
to thy will &amp; wisedome
therein; being fully assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that to me, which am
in Christ, the sting, curse
and poyson of them is
most certainely pulled
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:19893:151"/>
out by the Passion of thy
Son. And resting ever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thy sweet &amp; pretious
promises, that thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given me Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
will never deny me
any truly needfull and
and comfortable thing,
while the world stands.
And that all things, even
the rage of Satan, the
malice of men, the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of this life, nay even
the sins of my soule, in an
holy sence, by thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
shall turne unto my
everlasting good.</p>
            <p>Add I pray thee, daily
more and more strength
and life, and new degrees
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:19893:152"/>
unto all these graces,
which it hath pleased
thee in some measure to
plant in my soule of thy
owne free mercy, and for
the mediation of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy
Son. Increase my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of grace, my reliance
and trust in thee, as one
most powerfull, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and true; my hope
and patient expectation
of thy presence, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in all things that
are to come; my love of
thee, thy Word, thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and all things that
belong unto thee; my
zeale &amp; courage for thy
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:19893:152"/>
glory and truth &amp; good
causes and good men;
feare of thy great name;
humblenesse and lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of minde. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and power of Prayer;
Patience and contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in all troubles and
trials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or what other
holy virtue thou hast in
great mercy vouchsafed
unto me. Grant I pray
thee and give me grace
to imploy and improove
them all to the utmost &amp;
for the best advantage in
procuring thee glory,
good unto thy Church
and comfort unto mine
owne soule.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:19893:153"/>
Blesse I pray thee and

Infidels, Jewes, to the

            <p>Gratious Lord, I praise

which thy mercifull

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thou preservedst
me mightily and almost

Thou followedst mee

and didst infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thou
broughtst me at length
fairely, easily and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly

pastorall charge I now
injoy. Thou hast given
me out of thine own free,
immediate mercy a
deare and loving Wife,
incomparably the fittest

But above all, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts

In a word, I am verily
