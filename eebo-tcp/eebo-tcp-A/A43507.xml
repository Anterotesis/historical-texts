            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ntending a compleat History of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> in all the Principles, Practices, and most remarkable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of that dangerous Sect; I am to take a higher aim then the time of <hi>Calvin</hi> (though he be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly pretended for the Founder of it) and fetch their Pedigree from those whose stepts they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. For as our Saviour said to some of the Jews, that they <hi>were of their Father the Devil, and the works of their Father they would do:</hi> So by their works, that is to say, by the Opinions which they hold, the Doctrines which they preach, and the Disturbances by them made in these parts of Christendome, we may best find from what Original they derive themselves. I know that some, out of pure zeal unto the Cause, would fain intitle them to a descent from the Jewish <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> ordained by God himself in the time of <hi>Moses.</hi> And that it might comply the better with their ends and purposes, they have endeavoured to make that famous Consistory of the Seventy Elders, not onely a co-ordinate power with that
<pb facs="tcp:54836:4"/>
of <hi>Moses,</hi> and after his decease with the Kings and Princes of that State in this Publick Government; but a Power Paramount and Supreme, from which lay no appeal to any but to God himself: A power by which they were enabled not onely to control the actions of their Kings and Princes, but also to correct their persons. Which as I can by no means grant to be invested in the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> by God himself, or otherwise usurped and practised by them in the times of that Monarchy; though possibly they might predominate in those times and intervals in which there was no King in <hi>Israel</hi> (as such times there were:) so neither can I yield unto the Presbyterians any such Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, as to derive themselves and their pretensions, whether it be over Kings or Bishops, from the Jewish <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> And yet I shall not grutch them an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity as great as that which they desire, as great as that of <hi>Moses</hi> or the Jewish <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> from which they would so willingly derive themselves.</p>
            <p>For if we look upon them in their professed oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well to all Monarchical as Episcopal Government, we cannot but give them an Extraction from that famous Triumvirate, <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> combined in a Design against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> against the Chief-Priest and the Supreme Prince; though otherwise of different Families, and having different Counsels amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> were descended from the Line of <hi>Reuben,</hi> the eldest Son of Father <hi>Iacob</hi>; and therefore thought themselves more capable of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power then <hi>Moses,</hi> who descended from a younger house. And <hi>Korah</hi> thought himself as much neglected, in seeing <hi>Elizaphan</hi> the Son of <hi>Vzziel</hi> to have been made the Prince of the <hi>Kohathites</hi> (the principal Family of the <hi>Levites</hi> next to that of <hi>Gerson</hi>) when he himself descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the elder Brother. Nor was he able to discern, but that if there were any such necessity of having one Priest above the rest in place and power, the Mitre might sit
<pb facs="tcp:54836:4"/>
as well upon his head as on that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> whose readiness in complying with the peoples humor in setting up the Golden-Calf, had rendred him uncapable of so great a trust. Having conferred their notes, and compared their grievances, they were resolved to right themselves, and to have neither any Chief-Priest or Soveraign Prince to lord it over them; but to erect a parity both in Sacred and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil matters, as most agreeable to the temper of a free born Nation. They had got little, else, by being set at liberty from the House of Bondage, if they should now become the Vassals of their Fathers Children. But first they were to form their party; and they did it wisely, drawing no fewer then two hundred and fifty of the chief men of the Assembly to conspire with them in the Plot. And that they might allure the people to adhere unto them, they flatter them with an hope of an absolute Freedom, and such a power in Sacred matters, as should both autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize and justifie their approaches to the holy Altar, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the intervention of Priest or Prelate. Which being done, they boldly shew themselves against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>; and told them plainly to their faces, that they took more upon them then belonged to either; that all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was holy, every one of them, in regard that God appeared so visibly amongst them; and therefore that they had done that which they could not justifie, in lifting themselves above the Congregation of the Lord. In which it is to be observed, that though some of the chief Princes of the House of <hi>Dan,</hi> and perhaps many also of the other Tribes, did appear in the Action; yet it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called in Scripture, <hi>The Gain-saying of Korah</hi>; either because the practice was of his Contrivement, or chiefly carried on by the power and credit which he and his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> had gained amongst the common people, by reason of their Interests and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments in Sacred matters: so excellent are the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities which are afforded to unquiet and seditious men, when either by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:54836:5"/>
by some special place and interest in his Publick Service, they are become considerable in the eyes of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
            <p>These were the first seeds of those dangerous Doctrines, and most unwarrantable practices, which afterwards brought forth such sad effects toward the latter end of the Jewish State, when the Pharisees began to draw unto themselves the managing of all affairs, both Sacred and Civil. They were not ignorant of that high displeasure which God had manifestly shewn against the principal Authors of that first Sedition, who under the pretence of regulating the Authority of his two Chief Ministers, had put a baffle, as it were, upon God himself, whose Servants and Ministers they were. The Pharisees therefore were content, that both the Chief-Priest and the Supreme Prince should still preserve their rank and station, as in former times; but so, that neither of them should be able to act any thing of weight and moment, but as directed by their counsels, and influenced by their assistance. For the obtaining of which point, what arts they used, what practices they set on foot, and by what artifices they prevailed upon mens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; as also into what calamities they plunged that Nation by the abuse of their Authority, having once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, shall be laid down at large in the following Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. All the particulars whereof, the Reader is desired to observe distinctly, that he may see how punctually the Presbyterians of our times have played the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees; as well in the getting of their power by lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authority both of Prince and Prelate, as in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperating the people to a dangerous War for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of them both; the calling in of Foreign forces to abet their quarrel; the fractions and divisions amongst themselves; and the most woful Desolation which they have brought upon the happiest and most flourishing Church which the Sun of Righteousness ever shined on since the Primitive times. <hi>Nec ovum o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Iupiter</hi> could not make himself more like <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitrio,</hi> nor <hi>Mercury</hi> play the part of <hi>Sociae</hi> with more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance, then the ensuing Story may be parallel'd in our late Combustions; Actor for Actor, Part for Part, and Line for Line; there being nothing altered (in a manner) in that fearful Tragedie, but the Stage or Theatre.</p>
            <p>Change the Stage from <hi>Palestine,</hi> or the Realm of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and we shall see the same Play acted over again in many parts and Provinces of the Christian Church. In which we finde the Doctrines of the Pharisees revived by some; their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, or pretended Purity, taken up by others; their Artifices to encrease their party in the gaining of Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, embraced and followed by a third, till they grew formidable to those powers under which they lived; and finally, the same Confusions introduced in all parts of Christendom, in which their counsels have been followed. Which I shall generally reduce under these four heads; that is to say, The practices of the <hi>Novatians</hi> in the North; the <hi>Arrians</hi> in the East; the <hi>Donatists</hi> in <hi>Affrick,</hi> or the the Southern parts; and the <hi>Priscillianists</hi> in the Western. The arts and subtilties of the Pharisees were at first sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be too Heterogeneous to be all found in any one Sect of Hereticks amongst the Christians, till they were all united in the Presbyterians; the Sects or Hereticks above mentioned, participating more or less of their dangerous counsels, as they conceived it necessary to advance their particular ends: In the pursuance of which ends, as the <hi>Arrians</hi> ventured upon many points which were not known to the <hi>Novatians,</hi> and the <hi>Donatists</hi> upon many more, which were never practised by the <hi>Arrians</hi>; so the <hi>Priscillianists</hi> did as much exceed the <hi>Donatists</hi> in the arts of mischief, as they themselves have been exceeded by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in all the lamentable consequents and effects thereof: which I desire the Reader to consider distinctly, that he may be his own <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in fitting them, and every
<pb facs="tcp:54836:6"/>
one of them with a perfect parallel in reference to those men, whose History I shall draw down from the time of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> unto these our days, tracing it from <hi>Geneva</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> from <hi>France</hi> into the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> from the <hi>Netherlands</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from thence to <hi>England:</hi> And in this search I shall adventure upon nothing but what is warranted by the Testimony of unquestioned Authors, from whose sence I shall never vary, though I may finde it sometimes necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not to use their words.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54836:9"/>
afterwards occasioned far more obstinate ruptures between the followers of the parties in their several stations. The <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Reformation was begun in defacing Images, decrying the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Fasts and appointed Festivals, abolishing set forms of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, denying the old Catholick Doctrine of a real presence, and consequently all external reverence in the participation of the blessed Sacrament; which <hi>Luther</hi> seriously laboured to preserve in the same estate, in which he found them at the present: They differed also in the Doctrine of Predestination, which <hi>Luther</hi> taught according to the current of the ancient Fathers, who lived and flourished before the writings of St. <hi>Augustine</hi>; so that the <hi>Romanists</hi> had not any thing to except against in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, when it was canvassed by the School-men in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> But <hi>Zuinglius</hi> taught, as was collected from his writings,
<q>That God was the total cause of all our Works, both good and evil; that the Adultery of <hi>David,</hi> the cruelty of <hi>Manlius,</hi> and the treason of <hi>Iudas,</hi> were the works of God, as well as the vocation of <hi>Saul</hi>; that no man hath power to think well or ill, but that all cometh of absolute necessity; that man doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards his Predestination, or Reprobation, but all is in the Will of God; that the Predestinate cannot be condemned, nor the Reprobate saved; that the Elect and Predestinate are truely justified; that the justified are bound by Faith to believe they are in the number of the Predestinated; that the justified cannot fall from Grace, but is rather bound to believe, that if he chance to fall from Grace, he shall receive it again; and finally, that those who are not in the number of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinate, shall never receive Grace, though offered to them.</q>
Which difference being added unto that of the Sacrament, and eagerly pursued on both sides; occasioned such a mortal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable hatred between the parties, that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> have so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly vowed rather to fall off roundly to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then yeild to those <hi>Predestinarian</hi> and <hi>Sacramentary pestilences,</hi> as they commonly called them. But <hi>Zuinglius</hi> in the mean time carried it amongst the <hi>Switzers</hi>; five of those thirteen Cantons entertain his Doctrine, the like did also divers Towns and Seignories which lay nearest to them; of which <hi>Geneva</hi> in a short time became most considerable.</p>

Brought under the obedience of the <hi>Romans</hi> by the power of <hi>Caesar,</hi> it continued a member of that Empire; till the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> in the time of <hi>Honorius,</hi> possessed themselves of all those <hi>Gallick</hi> Provinces which lay toward the <hi>Alpes.</hi> In the Division of those Kingdoms by <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald,</hi> it was made a part of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> called <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurana,</hi> because it lay beyond the <hi>Iour</hi>; and was by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on <hi>Conrade</hi> a <hi>Saxon</hi> Prince, son of Duke <hi>Witibind</hi> the third, and younger brother of <hi>Robert</hi> the first Earl of <hi>Anjow.</hi> At the expiring of whose line, by which it had been held under several Titles of King, Earl and Duke; it was by <hi>Rodolph</hi> the last Prince, bestowed on the Emperour <hi>Henry,</hi> sirnamed the Black, as his nearest kinsman; and by that means united to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In time, the Bishops did obtain of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Frederick</hi> the first, that they and their Successors should be the sole Princes of <hi>Geneva,</hi> free from all taxes, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to any but the Emperours: which notwithstanding, the Earl continuing still to molest the Bishops, they were fain to call unto their aid the Earl of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who took upon him first as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector onely, but afterwards as Lord in Chief. For when the Rights of the Earls of <hi>Geneva,</hi> by the Marriage of <hi>Thomas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with <hi>Beatrix</hi> a Daughter of the Earls, fell into that house; then <hi>Ame</hi> or <hi>Amade,</hi> the first of that name, obtain'd of the Emperour, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, to be <hi>Vicar-General</hi> of the Empire in his own Country, and in that right Superiour to the Bishop in all Temporal matters: and <hi>Ame,</hi> or <hi>Amade</hi> the first Duke got from Pope <hi>Martin</hi> (to the great prejudice of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops) a grant of all the Temporal jurisdictions of it. After which time the Bishops were constrained to do homage to the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and acknowledge them for their Soveraign Lords: the Authority of the Dukes being grown so great (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that the people were immediately subject unto their Bishop onely) that the Money in <hi>Geneva</hi> was stamped with the Dukes Name and Figure; capital offenders were pardoned

by him; no sentence of Law executed, till his Officers first made acquainted; nor league contracted by the people of any vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, without his privity and allowance; and finally, the Keys of the Town presented him as often as he should please to lodge there; as once for instance to <hi>Charles</hi> the Third, coming thither with <hi>Beatrix</hi> his Wife, Daughter of <hi>Portugal.</hi> But still the City was immediately subject to the Bishops onely, who had as well the Civil as the Ecclesiastial jurisdiction over it, as is confest by <hi>Calvin</hi> in a Letter unto Cardinal <hi>Sadolet,</hi> though as he <note n="a" place="margin">

            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">1528.</note>4. In this condition it continued till the year 1528, when those of <hi>Berne,</hi> after a publike Disputation held, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d made an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Religion; defacing Images, and innovating all things in the Church on the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Principles. <hi>Viretus</hi> and <hi>Farellus,</hi> two men exceeding studious of the Reformation, had gained some footing in <hi>Geneva</hi> about that time, and laboured with the Bishop to admit of such Alterations, as had been newly made in <hi>Berne.</hi> But when they saw no hopes of prevailing with him, they practised on the lower part of the People, with whom they had gotten most esteem; and travelled so effectually with them in it, that the Bishop and his Clergie in a popular tumult are expelled the Town, never to be restored to their former Power. After which they proceeded to reform the Church, defacing Images, and following in all points the example of <hi>Berne,</hi> as by <hi>Viretus</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellus</hi> they had been instructed; whose doings in the same, were afterwards countenanced and <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Quae à</hi> Vire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>&amp;</hi> Farello <hi>facta sunt, suffragio meo comprobavi.</hi>
               </note> approved by <hi>Calvin,</hi> as himself confesseth. Nor did they onely in that Tumult alter every thing which had displeased them in the Church, but changed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Town; disclaiming all Allegiance either to their Bishop or their Duke; and standing on their own Liberty as a Free Estate, governed by a Common Council of 200 persons, out of which four are chosen annually by the name of <hi>Syndicks,</hi> who sit as Judges in the Court, the Mayors and Bayliffs (as it were) of the Corporation. And for this also they were most indebted to the active counsels of <hi>Farellus,</hi> whom <hi>Calvin</hi> therefore calls the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the publike Liberty <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Libertatis suae patrem, &amp;c</hi>
               </note>; and saith in an Epistle unto those of <hi>Zurick,</hi> dated 26 <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1553, that the <hi>Genevians</hi> did owe themselves <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Farellus,</hi> cui se totos debent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> wholly to his care and counsels. And it appears by <hi>Calvin</hi> also, that the people could have been content to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Bishop, if the Bishop could have been content to reform Religion; and more then so, that they had deserved the greatest Censures of the Church, if it had been otherwise. For thus he writes in his said Letter to Cardinal <hi>Sadolet; Talem nobis Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiam si exhibeant, &amp;c.</hi> If, saith he, they could offer to us such
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54836:10"/>
a Hierarchy, or Episcopal Government, wherein the Bishops shall so rule, as that they refuse not to submit themselves to Christ, that they also depend upon him as their onely head, and can be content to refer themselves to him; in which they will so keep brotherly society amongst themselves, as to be knit together by no other bond then that of Truth; then surely, if there shall be any that will not submit themselves to that Hierarchy, reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with the greatest obedience that may be, I must confess there is no kinde of <hi>Anathema,</hi> or casting to the devil, which they are not worthy of. But in regard the Bishop could not satisfie them in their expectations, they are resolved to satisfie themselves out of his Estate; and either for his sake, or their own, to cast off all relation to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as their Patron Paramount. And though both Lords did afterwards unite against them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged the Town; yet by the help of those of <hi>Berne,</hi> (with whom they joyned themselves in a strict Confederacie) they repulsed them both. Since which time, they have strongly fortified the Town on all sides, but most especially on that side which lies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Savoy</hi>; and would never since permit the Duke to arm any Boats or Galleys upon the Lake, for fear he might make use of them to their disadvantage.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The power and dominion of that Citie being thus put into the hands of the common people, it could not be expected that any Discipline or good Order should be kept in the Church. The Common-Council of the Town disposed of all things as they pleased; and if any Crime which anciently belonged to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Discipline, did happen to be committed in it; it was punished by order from the Council. No Censures Ecclesiastical, no Sentence of Excommunication, was either thought on at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> or at that time in any other of the Popular Churches, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled according to the Form devised by <hi>Zuinglius</hi>; as <note n="e" place="margin">

               <hi>Beza</hi> hath observed in the Life of <hi>Calvin.</hi> The like affirmed by <hi>Calvin</hi> also, in his Letter above-mentioned to those of <hi>Zurick</hi>; who grants it to have been a received opinion, with some very grave and learned men, <note n="f" place="margin">

To this device he brought the people to submit, without any reluctancie: for what cause had they to suspect any yoak or bondage to be intended

in that project, wherein they had a double Vote to each single Minister, and consequently a double number on their side upon all occasions. But when the first year was expired, and that the Elders of that year were to leave their places, they then perceived how much they had inthralled themselves by their own facility. And now they began to have some fear, that the filling up of the Seats in the Consistory with so geat a number of Lay-men, was but to please the mindes of the people, to the end they might think themselves of some power therein; that their Pastors being men of parts, and practised in affairs of that nature, would easily over-rule the rest, though the greater number; that the Lay-elders being onely annual, and changed from one year to another, might first or last come under the severe lash of their Pastors, who were in a perpetua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">7. But nothing gave them more offence then the confidence of that vast and unlimited power, which was to be put into the hands of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> in reference unto crimes and persons; and the unhandsome manner of proceeding in it: for power was given unto them by the Rules of the Discipline, not onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Excommunication, if the case required it, against Drunkards, Whore-masters, Blasphemers of Gods holy Name, disturbers of the peace by fighting, or contentious words; but also against such as pleased themselves with modest dancing, which was from henceforth looked on as a grievous crime; and what disturbances and disquiets did ensue upon it, we shall see anon. Nor were they onely Authorized to take notice of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious crimes, when they gave just scandal to the Church, or such as past in that account by the voice of <hi>Fame</hi>; but also to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the lives and conversations of all sorts of persons, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the private ordering of their several Families. In refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to which last, they are required to make a diligent and strict enquiry, whether men lived peaceably with their Wives, and kept their Families in good order; whether they use con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly some course of morning and evening Prayer in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral housholds, sit down at their Tables without saying Grace, or cause their Children or Servants diligently to frequent the Churches; with many others of that nature. And to the end they may come the better to the knowledge of all particulars, it is not onely permitted by the Rules of their Discipline to tamper with mens Neighbours, and corrupt their Servants; but to exact an Oath of the parties themselves, who are thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make answer unto all such Articles as may or shall

be tendred to them in behalf of the Consistory: which odious and unneighbourly office is for the most part executed by those of the Laity, or at the least imputed wholly unto their pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticalness; though the Lay-elders possibly have done nothing in it, but by direction from their Pastors. For so it was contrived of purpose by the wise Artificer, that the Ministers might be thereby freed from that common hatred, which such a dangerous and saucie inquisition might else draw upon them. And yet these were not all the mischiefs which their submitting to that yoak had drawn upon them; by which they had enthralled themselves to such hard conditions, that if a man stood Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, or in contempt against the censures of the Church, for the space of a twelve month, he was to suffer a whole years banishment by Decree of the Senate; not otherwise to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, but upon submission, and that submission to be made upon their knees in the open Church.</p>
            <p n="8">8. These melancholick thoughts had not long possessed them, when an occasion was presented to try their courage. <hi>Perinus</hi> Captain of the people, and of great power in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity amongst the multitude, pretends the common liberty to be much endangered by that new subjection, and openly makes head against him in defence thereof. Ten years together did it struggle with the opposition, and at last was almost ruined and oppressed by it. For whereas the Consistory had given sentence against one <hi>Bertilier,</hi> even in the highest censure of Excommunication; the Common councel not onely absolved him from that censure under their Town-seal, but foolishly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that Excommunication and Absolution did properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them. Upon this he is resolved again to quit the Town, and solemnly takes his leave of them, at the end of one of his Sermons, which he had fitted for that purpose: but at the last the Controversie is reduced to these three questions, <hi>viz.</hi> First, after what manner by Gods Ordinance, according to the Scripture, Excommunication was to be exercised. Secondly, whether it may not be exercised some other way then by such a Consistory. Thirdly, what the use of other Churches was in the like case. And being reduced to these three questions, it was submitted to the judgement and determination of four of the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches; to whose Decree both parties were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to stand. But <hi>Calvin</hi> knew beforehand what he was to trust to, having before prepared the Divines of <hi>Zurick</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce sentence on his side; of whom he earnestly desired that they would seriously respect that cause, on which the whole State of the Religion of the City did so much depend; that God and all good men were now inevitably in danger to be trampled on, if those four Churches did not declare for him and his Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, when the cause was to be brought before them; that in the giving of the sentence, they should pass an absolute appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation upon the Discipline of <hi>Geneva,</hi> as consonant unto the

Upon which pre-ingagement they returned this Answer, directed to the Common council of <hi>Geneva,</hi> by which their judgement was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; that is to say, That they had heard already of those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistorial Laws, and did acknowledge them to be godly Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, <hi>drawing towards</hi> the Prescript or Word of God: In which respect they did not think it good for the Church of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> to make any innovation in the same, but rather to keep them as they were. This caution being interposed, that Lay-elders should be chosen from amongst themselves; that is to say, ten of them to be yearly out of the Council of two hundred; and the other two (for there were to be but twelve in all) to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of the more powerful Council of the five and twenty.</p>

            <p n="10">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54836:13"/>10. Thus was the Discipline confirmed, and <hi>Calvin</hi> setled in the jurisdiction which he had aspired to: But long he could not be content with so narrow a Diocess as the Town and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of <hi>Geneva</hi>; and would have thought himself neglected, if all those Churches which embraced the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Doctrines had not withal received the <hi>Genevian</hi> Discipline; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming whereof at home, and the promoting it in all parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, there was no passage in the Scripture, which either spake of Elders or Excommunication, but he applyed the same for justifying the Authority of his new <hi>Presbytery,</hi> in which the Lay-elders were considered as distinct from those which laboured in the Word and Sacraments, but joyned with them in the exercise of a Jurisdiction (even that of Ordination also) which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Church. Assuredly, we are as much in love with the Children of our Brains, as of our Bodies; and do as earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the preferment of them. <hi>Calvin</hi> had no sooner conceived and brought forth this Discipline, but he caused it first to be nourished and brought up at the charge of <hi>Geneva</hi>; and when he found it strong enough to go abroad of it self, he afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it to the entertainment of all other Churches, in which he had attained to any credit; proceeding finally so far, as to impose it upon the world as a matter necessary, and not to be refused on pain of Gods high displeasure: by means whereof, what Jealousies, Heart-burnings, Jars and Discords have been occasioned in the Protestant Reformed Churches, will be made manifest by the course of this present History: Which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, might easily have been prevented, if the Orders which he devised for the use of this City, had not been first established in themselves, &amp; then tendered unto others, as things everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required by the Law of that Lord of lords, against whose Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes there was no exception to be taken. In which respect it could not chuse but come to pass, that his Followers might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all other Churches which received it not, of manifest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the Will of Christ: And being once engaged, could not finde a way how to retire again with Honour. Whenas the self-same Orders having been established in a Form more wary and suspence, and to remain in force no longer then God should give the oportunity of some general Conference; the <hi>Genevians</hi> either never had obtruded this Discipline on the rest of the Churches, to their great disquiet; or left themselves a fair liberty of giving off, when they perceived what trouble they had thereby raised to themselves and others.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Now for the means by which this Discipline was made acceptable to the many Churches which had no dependance on <hi>Geneva,</hi> nor on <hi>Calvin</hi> neither; they were chiefly these, that is to say, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irst, The great contentment which it gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, to see themselves intrusted with the weightiest matters in Religion; and thereby an equality with, if not (by reason of their number, being two for one) superiority above
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54836:13"/>
their Ministers. Secondly, the great Reputation which <hi>Calvin</hi> had attained unto for his diligence in Writing and Preaching, whereby his Dictates came to be as authentick amongst some Divines, as ever the Popes <hi>Ipse dixit</hi> was in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thirdly, his endeavours to promote that Platform in all other Churches, which was first calculated for the Meridian of <hi>Geneva</hi> onely: of which we shall speak more particularly in the course of this History. Fourthly, the like endeavours u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by <hi>Beza,</hi> who not content to recommend it as convenient for the use of the Church (higher then which <hi>Calvin</hi> did not go) imposed it as a matter necessary upon all the Churches; so necessary, that it was utterly as unlawful to recede from this, as from the most material Points of the Christian Faith: of which more hereafter. Fifthly, the self-ends and ambition of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Ministers, affecting the Supremacy in their several Parishes; that themselves might lord it over Gods Inheritance, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of setting Christ in his Throne. Upon which ground they did not onely <hi>prate</hi> against the Bishops <hi>with malicious words</hi> (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Dieotrephes</hi> did against the Apostles) but were resolved to <hi>cast them out of the Church, neither receiving them amongst themselves,</hi> nor suffering those that would have done it if they might. Sixthly, the covetousness of some great persons, and Lay-Patrons; of which the one intended to raise themselves great Fortunes, by the spoil of the Bishopricks; and the other to return those Titles to their own proper use, to which they onely were to nominate some deserving person. For compassing of which three last ends, their followers drove on so furiously, that rather then their Discipline should not be admitted, and the Episcopal Government destroyed in all the Churches, they are resolved to depose Kings, ruine Kingdoms, and subvert the Fundamental Constitutions of all Civil States.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <note place="margin">1537.</note>12. Thus have we seen the Discipline setled at the last, after many struglings; but setled onely by the forestalled judgement and determination of four neighbouring Churches, which neither then did entertain it, nor could be ever since induced to receive the same. And we have took a general view of those Arts and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices by which it hath been practised and imposed upon other Nations; as also of those grounds and motives, on which it was so eagerly pursued by some, and advanced by others. We must now therefore cast our eyes back on that Form of Worship which was by him devised at first for the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterwards to all other Churches, which were not of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Model; and finally received, if not imposed upon most Churches which imbraced the Discipline. Which Form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, what it was, may best be gathered from the summary or brief view thereof, which <hi>Beza</hi> tendreth to the use of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches, then established in the City of <hi>London</hi>; and is this that followeth.

And as for the habit of the Ministry, whether Sacred or Civil, as there was no course taken by the Rules of their Discipline, or by the Rubricks of the book of their publick Offices; so did they by themselves, and their Emissaries, endeavour to discountenance and discredit all other Churches, in which distinct Vestures were retained. Whence came those manifold quarrels against Coaps and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, as also against the Caps, Gowns and Tippets of the lower Clergie, the Rochets and Chimeres of the Bishops, wherewith for more then twenty years they exercised the patience of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But naked as it was, and utterly void of all outward Ornaments, this Form of Worship looked so lovely in the eyes of <hi>Calvin,</hi> that he endeavoured to obtrude it on all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54836:14"/>
Churches else. Having first setled his new Discipline in the Town of <hi>Geneva,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1547</note> 
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1541, and crusht <hi>Perinus</hi> and the rest in the dancing business, about five years after; he thought himself to be of such confidence, that no Church was to be reformed but by his advice. Upon which ground of self-opinion, he makes an offer of himself to Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Si quis mei usus foret,</hi> &amp;c.</note>, as soon as he had heard of the Reformation which was here intended; but <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> knew the man, and refused the offer. Which though it was enough to have kept him from venturing any further in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness and affairs of <hi>England</hi>; yet he resoved to be of counsel in all matters, whether called or not. And therefore having taken Order with <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> on his first coming into <hi>England,</hi> to give him some account of the English Liturgie; he had no sooner satisfied himself in the sight thereof, but he makes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently his exceptions and demurs upon it; which afterwards became the sole ground of those many troubles, those horrible disorders and confusions, wherewith his Faction have involved the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from that time to this.</p>
            <p n="15">15. For presently on the account which he received of the English Liturgy, he writes back to <hi>Bucer,</hi> whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to be instant with the Lord Protector, <note n="b" place="margin">

               </note> that all such Rites as savoured of superstition might be taken away: and how far that might reach, we may easily guess.

            <p n="16">16. But not content to tamper by his Letters with those Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Persons; he had his Agents in the Court, the City, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, the Country, and the Convocation; all of them pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising in their distinct and proper Circuits, to bring the people to dislike that Form of Worship, which at the first was looked on by them as an Heavenly Treasure, composed by the especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al aid of the Holy Ghost. Their Actings of this kinde for bringing down the Communion-Table, decrying the Reverent use of Kneeling at the Participation, inveighing against the sign of the Cross, abolishing all distinction of days and times into Fasts and Festivals, with many others of that nature, I purposely omit till I come to <hi>England.</hi> Let it suffice, that by the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their sollicitations, more then for any thing which could be faulted in the book it self, it was brought under a review, and thereby altered to a further distance then it had before from the Rituals of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But though it had much less of <hi>Rome</hi> then before it had, (though nothing was meerly Romane, and not Primitive also) yet was it still as far off from the Rules of <hi>Geneva,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1554.</note> as it was at that time; which gave a new Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum to <hi>Calvin,</hi> that he should take so much pains, and trouble so many of his Friends, to so little purpose: And long it shall not be before he lets us know his resentment of it. The English <hi>Protestants</hi> being scattered in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselves to divers places in <hi>Germany,</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and amongst the <hi>Switzers.</hi> In <hi>Germany</hi> some of them procure a Church in the City of <hi>Frankfort</hi>; but they were such as had more minde to conform themselves to <hi>Calvins</hi> Models, then to the Liturgie of <hi>England:</hi> and such a deviation thereupon was made from the Rules of this Church, as looked little better then an open Schism. The business bad enough before, but made much worse, when <hi>Knox,</hi> that great Incendiary of <hi>Scotland,</hi> took that charge upon him; when at his coming he found many not well pleased with those alterations which had been made by others from the Church of <hi>England</hi>; which he resolved not to admit of, how much soever the continuance of it had been recommended by such Divines as had retired to <hi>Strasburgh, Zurick,</hi> and elsewhere. To over-ballance whose Authority, which he found much valued, he flees for succour unto <hi>Calvin,</hi> sends him a Summary or Abstract of the English Book (in the Latine Tongue) and earnestly desires his opinion of it; not doubting but all opponents would submit to his final sentence. What <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement was in the present Point, and what sentence he was like to give in the case before him, <hi>Knox</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:54836:15"/>
could not but have good assurance, when he wrote that Letter, having lived with <hi>Calvin</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and published some Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Books from thence with his approbation, before his coming unto <hi>Frankfort:</hi> and it succeeded answerably to his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as may appear by <hi>Calvins</hi> answer to that Letter; which in regard it was the ground of all those troubles which afterwards were raised against the Liturgy by the Puritan Faction, I shall here subjoyn.</p>
            <p n="17">17. <hi>It is no small affliction to me, and in it self no less in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, that a contention should be raised between brethren professing the same Faith, and living as banished men or exiles for the same Religion; especially for such a Cause, which in this time of your dispersion, ought to have been the Bond of Peace to bind you the more finally to one another: for what ought rather to be aimed at by you in this woful condition, then that being torne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the bowels of your native Country, you should put your selves into a Church, which might receive you in her bosom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned together (like the Children of the same Parent) both in hearts and tongues? But at this time in my opinion it is very unseasonable, that troubles should be raised amongst you about Ceremonies and Forms of Prayer, (as happens commonly amongst those who live in wantonness and ease) by means whereof, you have been hindred hitherto from growing into one body. I do not blame the constancy of those men, who being unwillingly drawn into it, do earnestly contend in an honest Cause; but rather the stubbornness of those, which hitherto hath hindred the holy purpose of forming and establishing a Church amongst you. For as I use to shew my self both flexible and facile in things indifferent, as all Rites and Ceremonies are; yet I cannot always think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to comply with the foolish waywardness of some few men, who are resolved to remit nothing of their Ancient Customs.</hi>

It was therefore so far lawful to begin with such beggerly Rudiments, that the Learned, Grave and Godly Ministers of Christ might be thereby encouraged for proceeding farther in setting out somewhat which might prove more pure and perfect.</hi>

And when the matter was so handled by Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi> first Tutor, and then Almoner to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, brought thither by the noise of so great a Schism, that the Liturgie of <hi>England</hi> was again restored; <hi>Knox</hi> was so far from yeilding to the Gravity and Authority of that Learned man, that he inveighed against him in the Pulpit without fear or wit. But <hi>Cox</hi> not able to endure a baffle from so mean a fellow, informs against him to the Senate, touching some passages in one of his Seditious Pamphlets; in which it is affirmed, that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> (whom elsewhere he calls by the odious name of <hi>Iesabel,</hi> and a <hi>Traytoress</hi> to <hi>England</hi>) ought not to joyn her self in Marriage with the Emperours Son, because the Emperour himself <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>was a greater Enemy to Christ</hi> then ever was <hi>Nero.

He adds, that he could see no Reason why they should charge the Church with frivolous and impertinent Ceremonies, which he should no way wrong if he called them dangerous; when they were left at liberty to compose an Order for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, more pure and simple: that in his judgement it was done with little Piety, and less brotherly Love; on any clancular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations to call <hi>Knox</hi> in question; (for so I understood him by his letter <hi>N</hi>) and that they had done better to have stay'd at home, then to have kindled the coals by such a piece of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just cruelty in a Forreign Country, by which others also were inflamed: and finally, that he had written howsoever unto some of the adverse party, of whose intent to leave that place he had been advertised, that they should continue where they were, and not violate the League of their Friendship by their separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; with other things to that effect.

And what else could he aim at by these expressions (comparing them with the Contents of his two last Letters) but that the former Liturgie should be abolished, or brought unto a neerer conformity to the Rules of <hi>Geneva</hi>; or at the least, that liberty might be left to the godly party, to use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Form of Worship which they though more <hi>pure?</hi> But finding no such good return to either Letter, as he had promised to himself, he leaves the cause to be pursued by such English Zealots, as he had trained up at <hi>Geneva,</hi> or otherwise had setled their abode amongst the <hi>Switzers,</hi> where all set Forms of Worship were as much decryed, as they were with him. And that they might not slacken in the midst of their course, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends the general Superintendents of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the care of <hi>Beza,</hi> who after his decease succeeded both in his place and power; of whose pragmaticalness in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing this design against the Liturgie, condemning all establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Orders of this Church, his interposing in behalf of such of his Followers as had heen silenced, suspended, or deprived for their inconformity, we shall speak more large at when we come to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="20">20. There happened another quarrel in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and he must needs make himself a party in it. Mr. <hi>Iohn Hooper</hi> having well deserved by his pains in preaching and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing some Books, which very much conduced to the peace of the Church, is nominated by the King to the See of <hi>Glocester.</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54836:17"/>
Willing enough he was to accept the charge; but he had lived so long at <hi>Zurick,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry,</hi> where there was no distinction of Apparel, either Sacred or Civil, that he refused to wear such Robes at his Consecration, as by the Rules of the Church were required of him. And by the Rules of the Church it was required, that for his ordinary Habit he should wear the <hi>Rochet</hi> and <hi>Chimere,</hi> with a square Cap upon his head, and not officiate at the Altar without his Coap, or perform any Ordination without his Crosier. Incouraged by his refusal, many of the inferiour Clergie take the like excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against Caps and Surplices, as also against Gowns and Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, the distinct Habits of their Order. Upon this ground Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> makes a stop of his Consecration, and would not be perswaded to dispute with him in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, though he much desired it. He had fastned some depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon <hi>Dudley,</hi> then Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and afterwards created Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi>; who did not onely write his own Letters, but obtained the Kings, that without pressing him any further to conform himself to those Robes and Habits, the Bishop should proceed immediately to his Consecration. But <hi>Cranmer</hi> weighing the importance of that ill Example, held off his hand, till he had satisfied the King, and so cooled the Earl, that <hi>Hooper</hi> was left unto himself; and still continuing in his contumacy, was committed Prisoner. The news being brought to <hi>Calvin,</hi> he must needs play the Bishop in another mans Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, or rather the Archbishop in another mans Province. But having little hope of prevailing with <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who had before rejected his assistance in the Reformation, he totally applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Duke of <hi>Sommerset:</hi> And he writes to him to this purpose, That the Papists would grow every day more insolent then other, unless the differences about the Ceremonies were first composed. But then they were to be composed in such a manner, as rather might encourage the dissenters in their opposition, then end in the reduction of them to a due conformity. And to this end, he is unseasonably instant with him, to lend a helping hand to <hi>Hooper,</hi> as the head of that Faction. By which encouragement, if not also by his setting on, the like was done by <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and by <hi>Iohn Alasco</hi>; the first of which was made Divinity-Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and the other Preacher to the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>London</hi>; both ingaged in stickling for the unconformable party against the Vestments of the Church. But they both gained as little by it as <hi>Calvin</hi> did; who seeing how little he effected in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> more then the getting of the name of a <hi>Polypragmon,</hi> a medler in such matters as concerned him not, gave over the affairs thereof to the charge of <hi>Beza</hi>; who being younger then himself, and of less discretion, might live to see some good success of his Travails in it. And he accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirred himself in this very quarrel, as if the safety of the Church and the preservation of Religion had been brought in danger;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54836:18"/>
writing his Letters unto <hi>Grindal,</hi> when Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> not to insist so far on those matters of Ceremony, as to deprive any of his Ministery upon that account. He also signifies unto the Brethren his dislike of those Vestments, and thereby strengthned and confirmed them in their former obstinacy: And finally, left no stone unmoved, no kinde of practice unattempted, by which this Church might be at last necessitated to a Reformation upon <hi>Calvins</hi> Principles, whose counsels he pursued to the very last.</p>
            <p n="21">21. But as for <hi>Calvin,</hi> he had some other game to fly at, and of greater nature, then to dispute the lawfulness of Caps and Surplices, and other Vestments of the Clergie; or to content himself with altering the old Forms of Government and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship: The Doctrine was to be refined, and all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try removed, whether it were Civil or Spiritual. In point of Doctrine he came neerest unto that of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Sacrament, as Predestination; but pitched upon the last for the main concernment, which was to difference his own Followers from all other Christians. The straining of which string to so great a height, hath made more discord in the harmony of the Church of Christ, then any other whatsoever. For not content to go the way of the Ancient Fathers, or to rely upon the judgement of St. <hi>Augustine, Fulgentius, Prosper,</hi> or any others which have moderated his excesses in it, he must needs add so much unto those extravagancies which he found in <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> as brought him under a suspition with some sober men, for making God to be the Author of sin: For by his Doctrine God is made to lay on our Father <hi>Adam</hi> an absolute and an unavoidable necessity of falling into sin and misery; that so he might have opportunity to manifest his Mercy in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting some few of his Posterity, and his Justice in the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diless rejecting of all the rest. In which as he could finde no countenance from the Ancient Fathers, so he pretendeth not to any ground for it in the Holy Scripture. For whereas some objected in Gods behalf, <hi>De certis verbis non extare,</hi> that the Decree of <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, and consequently the involving of his whole Posterity in sin and misery, was no where extant in the Word; he makes no other answer to it, then a <hi>quasi vero,</hi> As if (saith he) God had made and created Man the most exact Piece of his Heavenly Workmanship, without determining of his End, either Heaven or Hell. And on this point he was so resolutely bent, that nothing but an absolute Decree for <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the like for the involving of all his Race in the same perdition, would either serve his turn, or preserve his credit. If any man shall dare to opine the contrary, as <hi>Castillo</hi> did, he must be sure to be disgraced and censured by him, as <hi>Castillo</hi> was; and as all others since have been, which presumed to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion that determination, for which himself can give us no better name than that of an <hi>Horrible Decree,</hi> as indeed it is; a cruel and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54836:18"/>
               <hi>Horrible Decree,</hi> to pre-ordain so many millions to destruction, and consequently unto sin, that he might destroy them.</p>
            <p n="22">22. I had not stood so long upon this particular, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of those confusions and distractions which by his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers have been occasioned in the Church, by their adhering to this Doctrine, and labouring to obtrude it upon all mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences. The <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Gospellers, as Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi> rightly calls them, began to scatter their predestinary Doctrines in the Reign of King <hi>Edward.</hi> But they effected little in it, till such of our Divines as had retired themselves to <hi>Basil, Zurick,</hi> and amongst the <hi>Switzers,</hi> or otherwise had been brought up at the Feet of <hi>Calvin,</hi> encouraged by his Authority, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by his name, commended them to all the people of this Realm, for sound Catholick verities. The like diligence was also used by his Disciples in all places else. By means whereof it came to be generally received, as a truth undoubted, and one of the most necessary Doctrines of mans Salvation, in all the Churches of his Platform: In which as his Doctrine in some other points had first prepared the way to bring in his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; so was it no hard matter for the Discipline to support these Doctrines, and crush all them that durst oppose them. Onely it was permitted unto <hi>Beza</hi> and his Disciples to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what milder then the rest, in placing the Decree of Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the Fall: which <hi>Calvin</hi> himself, though in some passages of his Writings he may seem to look the same way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, hath placed more judiciously in <hi>Massa corrupta,</hi> in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted mass of mankinde, and the more moderate <hi>Calvinians</hi> as rightly presuppose for a matter necessary, before there could be any place for <hi>Election</hi> or <hi>Reprobation</hi> of <hi>particular Persons.</hi> But being they concurred with the rest, as to the personal Election o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Reprobation of particular men; the restoring of the benefit of our Saviours sufferings to those few particulars, (whom onely they had honoured with the glorious Name of <hi>Gods Elect</hi>) the working on them by the irresistable power of Grace in the act of Conversion, and bringing them infallibly by the continual as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the said Grace unto life everlasting; there was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any notice taken of their Deviation; insomuch that they were scarce beheld in the condition of erring brethren, though they differed from them in the main Foundation which they built upon; but generally passed under the name of <hi>Calvinists,</hi> as the other did. Which Doctrines, though I charge not wholly on the score of Presbytery, in regard that many of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Divines, who abhorred that Government, appeared in favour of the same; yet I may truely father them on the two grand Patrons of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> by whom they have been since exposed as their dearest darling; and no less eagerly contended for, then the holy Discipline.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Another of <hi>Calvins</hi> great designs was to cry down that Civil Idolatry, which he conceived had been committed unto
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54836:19"/>
Kings and Princes, in making them Supreme and uncontrollable in their several Countries. For pulling down of whose Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, even in Civil Matters, he attributes such power to such po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Officers as are by them appointed for the ease of their Subjects, that by his Doctrine they may call the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate to a strict account, whensoever they shall chance to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed those bounds which they had prescribed unto themselves, onely by which they may be circumscribed by others: For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the last Chapter of his <hi>Institutions,</hi> first published in the year 1536, exceeding handsomely laid down the Doctrine of Obedience, and the unlawfulness of resistance in what case soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; he gives in the close such a qualification, as utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws his former Doctrine, and proved the sole ground of such Rebellions, Treasons and Assassinates as have disfigured the otherwise undefiled beauty of the Church of Christ. Which passages I shall here lay down in the Authors words, with a translation by their side, that the Reader may perceive there is no wrong done him; and afterwards proceed to the discovery of those sad effects which have ensued upon them in too many places, wherein his Discipline hath either been received or contended for. His Doctrine in which point is this that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:

It was then also moved by the Count of <hi>Tarnaco,</hi> that the Bishops should no longer hold their place or suffrage in the Assembly of Estates, but keep themselves only to such matters as concerned the Church: which though it did not take effect, yet the attempt appeared so dreadful in the eye of those Prelates then present, that they became more tractable and obsequious to the great State-Officers, then they had been formerly.

them to make Laws and Ordinances for the directing of their Churches after <hi>Calvins</hi> Model. For in the Synod held at <hi>Tzenger,</hi> in the year 1564, it was Decreed that they should use no other Musick in their Churches, then the singing of Psalms (after the manner of <hi>Geneva,</hi> understand it so) condemning that which was then used in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> partly because the Psalms and Hymns were sung in the Latine Tongue, and partly because the Priests did bellow in them (as they pleased to phrase it) like the Priests of <hi>Baal.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which we are to know, that the device of turning <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Psalms into Rhyme and Meter, was first taken up by <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Marrot,</hi> one of the Grooms of the Bed-chamber to King <hi>Francis</hi> the First; who being much addicted to Poetry, and having some acquaintance with those which were thought to wish well to the Reformation, was perswaded by the learned <hi>Vatablus</hi> (Professor of the Hebrew Tongue in the University of <hi>Paris</hi>) to exercise his Poetical Fancies in translating some of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms.

To which last Query, he returned such answer (for in the other he

During which time he had attained to such an height of Reputation, that even the Churches of the <hi>Switzers</hi> lost the name of <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> and thought it no small honour to them, as well as those of <hi>Germany, France, Pole,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be called <hi>Calvinian.</hi> Onely the English held it out, and neither had imbraced his Doctrines, nor received his Discipline. And though the <hi>Puritan</hi> party in it took the name of <hi>Calvinists</hi> (<hi>our Divines commonly called Calvinists,</hi> say the two <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi>) yet both <hi>Saravia</hi> stomached it to be so accounted, <hi>Mountague</hi> in answer to the two <hi>Informers</hi> doth protest against it, and all the true sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do as much disclaim it. <hi>Beza</hi> endeavoured what he could to introduce his Discipline and Forms of Worship into all the Churches which did pretend to any Reformation of their ancient Errours. In the pursuit whereof he drives on so furiously, like <hi>Iehu</hi> in the holy Scriptures, as if no Kings or Princes were to stand before him. Scarce was he setled in his Chair, when one of his professed Champions for Presbytery puts himself into <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> which had not long before admitted the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines, but not submitted to the Discipline, as extrinsecal to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion therefore challenges the Divines thereof to a disputation, publickly holds forth this proposition, which he then defended; that is to say, <hi>That to a Minister with his Elders, there is power given by express warrant from Gods Word, to Excommunicate all offenders, even the greatest Prince.</hi> From hence proceeded that dispute which afterwards <hi>Erastus</hi> (of whom more hereafter) maintained with <hi>Beza</hi>; the point being put upon this issue: <hi>Whether all Churches ought to have their Eldership invested with a power of Excommunication; and that Lay-elders were so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in every Eldership, that nothing could be done without them.</hi> In which dispute (as it is very well observed by judicious <hi>Hooker</hi>) they seemed to divide the whole truth between them; <hi>Beza</hi> most truely holding the necessity of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in a Church well constituted; <hi>Erastus</hi> no less truely shewing that there was no necessity of Lay-elders to be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of it.</p>
            <p n="40">40. But his main business was to settle the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Forms in the Realms of <hi>Britain</hi>; in which he aimed at the acquiring of as great a name, as <hi>Calvin</hi> had obtained in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Poland. Knox</hi> had already so prevailed amongst the <hi>Scots,</hi> that though they once subscribed to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet he had brought them to admit such a Form of Worship, as came more neer to the Example of <hi>Geneva.</hi> And he had brought the Discipline to so good a forwardness, that <hi>Beza</hi> was rather wanting to confirm then to introduce it, as shall
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54836:27"/>
appear at large when we come to <hi>Scotland.</hi> But <hi>Knox</hi> had many opportunities to effect his business, during the absence of their Queen, the Regencie of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Lorreign,</hi> and the unsettledness of affairs in the State of that Kingdom, which the Brethren could not finde in <hi>England,</hi> where the Fabrick of the State was joyned together with such Ligaments of Power and Wisdom, that they were able to act little, and effect much less. Some opposition they had made after their coming back from <hi>Frankfort</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> their two chief Retreats, against the Vestments of the Church, and the distinction of Apparel betwixt Priests and Lay-men: In which some of them did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with so vain an obstinacie, that some of them were for a time suspended, and others totally deprived of their Cures and Benefices; some of them also had begun to take exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst some parts and Offices of the publick Liturgie, refusing thereupon to conform unto it; and thereupon likely to incur the very same penalties which were inflicted on the other. In both these cases they consult the Oracle, resolving to adhere to his determination in them, whatsoever it was. First therefore he applyes himself to <hi>Grindal,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and very zealously affected to the name of <hi>Calvin:</hi> to whom he signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies by his Letter of the 26 of <hi>Iune</hi> 1566, how much he was afflicted with the sad reports out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> by which he was advertised that many Ministers in <hi>England,</hi>

And this he seems to charge upon them, as they will answer for the contrary at the Judgement-Seat of Almighty God, to whom an account is to be given of the poorest Sheep which should be forced to wander upon this occasion from the rest of the Flock.

As for the Town and Territory of <hi>Geneva</hi> it self, it had so far submitted unto their Authority, that <hi>Calvin</hi> wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Bishop in it, but the name and title. The City of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> had been anciently an Episcopal See, consisting of many Parishes and Country Villages; all subject by the Rules of the Discipline unto one Presbytery, of which <hi>Calvin</hi> for the term of his life had the constant Precedency (under the style of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator</hi>) without whom nothing could done which concerned the Church. And sitting as chief President in the Court or Consistory, he had so great an influence on the Common-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as if he had been made perpetual Dictator also, for ordering the affairs of the Common-wealth. The like Authority was exercised and enjoyed by <hi>Beza</hi> also, for the space of ten years, or thereabouts, after his decease. At what time <hi>Lambertus Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> one of the Ministers of that City, thinking himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to him in no part of Scholarship, procured the Presidency in that Church to go by turns, that he and others might be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their courses in it: By which means the <hi>Genevians</hi> being freed from those powerful Riders, would never suffer themselves to be bridled as they had been formerly. For thereupon it was concluded by a Decree of the Senate, that the Presbytery should have no power to convent any man before them, till the Warrant was first signed by one of the <hi>Syndicks.</hi> Besides which curb, as the <hi>Elders</hi> are named by the lesser Council, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the greater, the Ministers advice being first had in the nomination; so do they take an Oath at their admission, <hi>to keep the Ecclesiastical Ordinances of the Civil Magistrate.</hi> In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect their Consistory doth not challenge an exorbitant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited power, as the <hi>Commissioners of Christ</hi> (as they did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in <hi>Scotland</hi>) but as Commissioners of the State or Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory; by which they are restrained in the exercise of that Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which otherwise they might and would have challenged by their first institution, and seemed at first a yoke too insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable for the necks of the people.

            <p n="1">1. THe Realm of <hi>France,</hi> having long suffered under the corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was one of the first Western Kingdoms which openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared against those abuses. <hi>Beringarius</hi> in the Neighbouring <hi>Italy,</hi> had formerly opposed the Gross and Carnal Doctrines of the Papists in the point of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: Whose opinions passing into <hi>France</hi> from one hand to another, were at last publickly maintained by <hi>Peter Waldo,</hi> one of the Citizens of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who added thereunto many bitter invectives against the Supremacy of the Pope, the Adoration of Images, the Invocation of Saints, and the Doctrine of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory. His Followers, from the place of his Habitation, were at first called in contempt, <hi>The poor men of Lyons</hi>; as afterwards, from the name of their Leader, they were by the Latines called <hi>Waldenses,</hi> by the French <hi>Les Vandoise.</hi> But <hi>Lyons</hi> proving no safe place for them, they retired into the more desert parts of <hi>Languedock,</hi> and spreading on the banks of the River <hi>Alby,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:54836:32"/>
obtained the name of <hi>Albigenses</hi> in the Latine Writers, and of <hi>Les Albigeoise</hi> in the French: supported by <hi>Raymond</hi> the Fourth, Earl of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> they became so insolent, that they murthered <hi>Trincanel</hi> their Viscount in the City <hi>Beziers,</hi> and dasht out the teeth of their Bishop, having taken Sanctuary in St. <hi>Magdalens</hi> Church, one of the Churches of that City. For which high outrages, and many others of like nature which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued upon them, they were warred upon by <hi>Lewis</hi> the Ninth of <hi>France,</hi> Sirnamed the <hi>Saint,</hi> and many Noble adventurers, who sacrificed many of them in the self-same Church wherein they had spilt the blood of others. After a long and bloody War, which ended in the year 1250, they were almost rooted out of the Country also; the residue or remainders of them having betook themselves into the mountainous parts of <hi>Daulphine, Provence, Piemont,</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> for their greater safety. By means whereof becoming neer Neighbours to the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and possibly managing some traffick with the Town of <hi>Geneva,</hi> their Doctrines could neither be unknown to <hi>Zuinglius</hi> amongst the one, nor to many Inhabitants of the other of best note and quality.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The rest of <hi>France</hi> had all this while continued in the Popes obedience, and held an outward uniformity in all points with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; from which it was not much diverted by the Writings of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> or the more moderate proceedings of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctors, who after the year 1517, had filled many Provinces of <hi>Germany</hi> with their opinions. But in the year 1533, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> found an opportunity to attempt upon it. For <hi>Francis</hi> the First favouring Learned men and Learning (as commonly they do, whose Actions are worthy a learned Pen) resolved to erect a University at <hi>Paris,</hi> making great offers to the most Learned Scholars of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> for their entertainment. <hi>Luther</hi> takes hold of that advantange, and sends <hi>Bucer,</hi> and some others of his ablest Followers; who by disputing in such a confluence of Learned men, might give a strong essay to bring in his Doctrines. Nor wanted there some which were taken with the Novelty of them, especially because such as were questioned for Religion had recourse into <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> to <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> the Kings Sister, married to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Albert</hi> King of <hi>Navar,</hi> who perhaps out of hatred to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by whom her Husbands Father was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of that Kingdom, might be the more favourable to the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi>; or rather moved (as she confessed before her death) with commiseration to those condemned persons that fled to her protection, she became earnest with her brother in defence of their persons; so that for ten years together she was the chief means of maintaining the Doctrines of <hi>Luther</hi> in the Realm of <hi>France.</hi> Nor was the King so bent in their Extermination, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he would have been, in regard of those many <hi>Switz</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> that served him in his Wars against <hi>Charles</hi> the

Fifth; till at last, being grievously offended with the contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of the men, and their continual opposition to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he published many Edicts and Proclamations against them, not onely threatning, but executing his penal Laws, until he had at last almost extinguished the name of <hi>Luther</hi> in his Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But <hi>Calvins</hi> stratagem succeeded somewhat better,<note place="margin">1546.</note> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the Death of <hi>Francis</hi> the First (whilst King <hi>Henry</hi> was ingag'd in the Wars with <hi>Charles</hi>) attempted <hi>France</hi> by sending his Pamphlets from <hi>Geneva,</hi> writ for the most part in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, for the better captivating and informing of the common people. And as he found many possessed with <hi>Luthers</hi> opinions, so he himself inflamed them with a Zeal to his own; the Vulgar being very proud to be made Judges in Religion, and pass their Votes upon the abstrusest Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of the Christian Faith. So that in short time <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was no more remembred, nor the Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> so much followed as it had been formerly. The name of <hi>Calvin</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it amongst the <hi>French.</hi> The sudden propagating of whose Opinions, both by preaching and writing, gave great offence unto the Papists; but chiefly to <hi>Charles</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> then being in great power and favour with King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second. By whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual sollicitation, the King endeavoured by many terrible and severe executions to suppress them utterly; and did reduce his Followers at the last to such a condition, that they durst neither meet in publick, or by open day, but secretly in Woods or Private-houses; and for the most part in the night, to avoid discovery. And at this time it was, and on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, that the name of <hi>Hugonots</hi> was first given them; so called from St. <hi>Hugoes</hi> Gate in the City of <hi>Towrs,</hi> out of which they were observed to pass to their secret Meetings; or from a night-spirit, or Hobgobling, which they called St. <hi>Hugo</hi>; to which they were resembled, for their constant night-walks. But neither the disgrace which that name imported, nor the severity of the Kings Edicts so prevailed upon them, but that they multiplyed more and more in most parts of the Realm; especially in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces which either were nearest to <hi>Geneva,</hi> or lay more open towards the Sea, to the trade of the English. And though the fear of the danger, and the Kings displeasure, deterred such as lived within the air of the Court from adhering openly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; yet had they many secret favourers in the Royal Palace, and not a few of the Nobility, which gave them as much countenance as the times could suffer. The certainty whereof appeared immediately on the death of King <hi>Henry,</hi> who left this life at <hi>Paris</hi> on the tenth of <hi>Iuly, Anno</hi> 1559,<note place="margin">1559.</note> leaving the Crown to <hi>Francis</hi> his Eldest Son, then being but fifteen years of age, neither in strength of body, nor in vigour of Spirit, enabled for the managing of so great an Empire.</p>

This young King in his Fathers life-time had married <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> Daughter and Heir of <hi>Iames</hi> the Fifth, by <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> a Daughter of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> and Sister to the two great Favourites before remembred. This gave a great improvement to the power and favour which the two brothers had before, made greater by uniting themselves to <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine de Medices,</hi> the young Kings Mother; a Woman of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent Wit, and one that studied nothing more then to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her own greatness against all opposers. By this confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie, the Princes of the House of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Heirs in Reversion to the Crown, if the King and his three brothers should depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Islue-Male (as in fine they did) were quite excluded from all office and imployment in the Court or State. The principal of which, was <hi>Anthony</hi> Duke of <hi>Vendosme,</hi> and his brother <hi>Lewis</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>; men not so near in birth, as of different humours; the Duke being of an open nature, flexible in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and easily wrought upon by others: but on the other side, the Prince was observed to be of a more enterprising disposition, violent (but of a violence mixed with cunning in the carrying on of his designs) and one that would not patiently dissemble the smallest injuries. These two had drawn unto their side the two <hi>Chastilions</hi>; that is to say, <hi>Gasper de Collignie</hi> Admiral of the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>D' Andilot</hi> his brother Commander of the Infantry of that Kingdom; to which Offices they had been advanced by the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> into whose Family they had married, during the time of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the King deceased; for whose removal from the Court, by the confederacy of the Queen Mother with the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> they were as much disquieted, and as apt for action, as the Princes of the House of <hi>Bourbon</hi> for the former Reasons. Many designs were offered to consideration in their private Meetings; but none was more likely to effect their business, then to make themselves the Heads of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Faction, which the two <hi>Chastilions</hi> had long favoured as far as they durst. By whose assistance they might draw all affairs to their own disposing, get the Kings person into their power, shut the Queen-mother into a Cloyster, and force the <hi>Guises</hi> into <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> out of which they came.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This counsel was the rather followed, because it seemed most agreeable to the inclinations of the Queen of <hi>Navar</hi> Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Albret</hi> and the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, and Wife of <hi>Anthony</hi> Duke of <hi>Vendosm,</hi> who in her Right acquired the title to that Kingdom. Which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess being naturally averse from the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and no less powerfully transported by some flattering hopes for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of her Kingdoms, conceived no expedient so effectual to revenge her self upon the one, and Inthrone her self in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the prosecuting this design to the very utmost. Upon which ground she inculcated nothing more into the ears of her
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54836:33"/>
Husband, then that he must not suffer such an opportunity to slip out of his hands, for the recovery of the Crown which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto her; that he might make himself the Head of a mighty Faction, containing almost half the strength of <hi>France</hi>; that by so doing, he might expect assistance from the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Princes of the same Religion, from Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and many discontented Lords in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces, besides such of the Catholick party, even in <hi>France</hi> it self, as were displeased at the <hi>Omni</hi>-Regency of the House of <hi>Guise</hi>; that by a strong Conjunction of all these interesses, he might not onely get his ends upon the <hi>Guises,</hi> but carry his Army cross the Mountains, make himself Master of <hi>Navar,</hi> with all the Rights and Royalties appertaining to it. But all this could not so prevail on the Duke her Husband, (whom we will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth call the King of <hi>Navar</hi>) as either openly or under-hand to promote the enterprise, which he conceived more like to hinder his affairs, then to advance his hopes. For the Queen-Mother having some intelligence of these secret practices, sends for him to the Court, commends unto his care her Daughter the Princess <hi>Isabella,</hi> affianced to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and puts him chief into Commission for delivering her upon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to such <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers as were appointed to receive her. All which she did (as she assured him) for no other ends, but out of the great esteem which she had of his person, to put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fair way for ingratiating himself with the Catholick King, and to give him such a hopeful opportunity for solliciting his own affairs with the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> as might much tend to his advantage upon this imployment. Which device had so wrought upon him, and he had been so finely fitted by the Ministers of the Catholick King, that he thought himself in a better way to regain his Kingdom, then all the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> together with their Friends in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> could chalk out unto him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But notwithstanding this great coldness in the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> the business was so hotly followed by the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Admiral <hi>Colligny,</hi> and his brother <hi>D' Andelot,</hi> that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were drawn to unite together, under the Princes of that House. To which they were spurred on the faster, by the practices of <hi>Godfrey de la Bar,</hi> commonly called <hi>Renaudie,</hi> from the name of his Signiory; a man of a most mischievous Wit, and a dangerous Eloquence; who being forced to abandon his own Country for some misdemeanors, betook himself unto <hi>Geneva,</hi> where he grew great with <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and the rest of the Consistory; and coming back again in the change of times, was thought the fittest instrument to promote this service, and draw the party to a body. Which being industriously pursued, was in fine effected; many great men, who had before conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves in their affections, declaring openly in favour of the Reformation, when they perceived it countenanced by such
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54836:34"/>
Potent Princes. To each of these, according as they found them qualified for parts and power, they assigned their Provinces and Precincts, within the limits whereof they were directed to raise Men, Arms, Money, and all other necessaries, for carrying on of the design; but all things to be done in so close a manner, that no discovery should be made till the deed was done. By this it was agreed upon, that a certain number of them should repair to the King at <hi>Bloise,</hi> and tender a Petition to him in all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner for the Free exercise of the Religion which they then professed, and for professing which they had been persecuted in the days of his Father. But these Petitioners were to be backed with multitudes of armed men, gathered together from all parts on the day appointed; who on the Kings denyal of so just a suit, should violently break into the Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seize on the person of the King, surprise the Queen, and put the <hi>Guises</hi> to the Sword: And that being done, <hi>Liberty</hi> was to be Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Free exercise of Religion granted by publick Edict, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagery of affairs committed to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and all the rest of the Confederates gratified with rewards and honours. Impossible it was, that in a business which required so many hands, none should be found to give intelligence to the adverse party: which coming to the knowledge of the Queen-Mother, and the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> they removed the Court from <hi>Bloise</hi> a weak open Town, to the strong Castle of <hi>Amboise,</hi> pretending nothing but the giving of the King some recreation in the Woods adjoyning. But being once setled in the Castle, the King is made acquainted with the threatned danger, the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> appointed Lieutenant-General of the Realm of <hi>France.</hi> And by his care the matter was so wisely handled, that without making any noise to affright the Confederates, the Petitioners were admitted into the Town; whilst in the mean time, several Troopes of Horse were sent out by him to fall on such of their accomplices as were well armed, and ready to have done the mischief, if not thus prevented.</p>

The issue of the business was, that <hi>Renaudie</hi> the chief A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in it was killed in the fight, many of the rest slain, and some taken Prisoners, the whole body of them being routed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to flee: yet such was the clemencie of the King, and the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>creet temper of the <hi>Guises,</hi> in the course of this business, that a general pardon was proclaimed on the 18 of <hi>March,</hi> (being the third day after the Execution) to all that being moved one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Zeal to Religion, had entred themselves into the Conspiracie, if within twenty four hours they laid down their Arms, and retired to their own Houses. But this did little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie with those hot spirits which had the conduct of the Cause, and had befooled themselves and others with the flattering hopes of gaining the Free exercise of their Religion. It cannot be denyed but that they were resolved so to act their parts, that Religion might not seem to have any hand in it, or at the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54836:34"/>
least might not suffer by it, if the plot miscarried. To which end they procured the chief Lawyers of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and many of the reformed Divines of the greatest eminence, to publish some Writings to this purpose; that is to say, that without violating the Majesty of the King, and the dignity of the lawful Magistrate, they might oppose with Arms the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Domination of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> who were given out for Enemies to the true Religion, hinderers of the course of Justice, and in effect no better then the Kings Jaylors, as the case then stood. But this Mask was quickly taken off, and the design appeared bare faced without any vizard. For presently upon the routing of the Forces in the Woods of <hi>Amboise,</hi> they caused great tumults to be raised in <hi>Poictou, Languedock</hi> and <hi>Provence.</hi> To which the Preachers of <hi>Geneva</hi> were forthwith called, and they came as willingly; their Followers being much increased both in courage and numbers, as well by their vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency in the Pulpit, as their private practices.

               </gap>) came from no other Fountain then the Lake of <hi>Geneva</hi>; that by digging at the very Root, he might divert a great part of that nourishment by which those mischiefs were fomented; and that by prosecuting such a Forraign War, he might evacuate those bad humours which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54836:35"/>
distempered his Kingdom: and therefore if the King be pleased to engage herein, his Holiness would not onely send him some convenient Aids, but move the <hi>Scotch</hi> King, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to assist him also. But neither the Queen-Mother, nor the <hi>Guise</hi> (for the King acted little in his own affairs) could approve the motion, partly for fear of giving offence unto the <hi>Switzers,</hi> with whom <hi>Geneva</hi> had confederated thirty years before; and partly because none being like to engage in that War, but the Catholicks onely, the Kingdom would thereby lye open to the adverse party. But nothing more diverted the three Princes from concurring in it, then the impossibility of complying with their several interesses in the disposing of the Town when it should be taken. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would not enter into the War before he was assured by the other Princes that he should reap the profit of it, that belonging anciently to his jurisdiction. But it agreed neither with the interest of <hi>France</hi> nor <hi>Spain,</hi> to make the Duke greater then he was, by so fair an addition as would be made to his Estate, were it yeilded to him. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> knew that the French King would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring him into <hi>France,</hi> or put into his hands such a fortified pass, by which he might enter when he pleased. As on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not suffer it to fall into the power of the <hi>French,</hi> by reason of its neer Neighbour-hood unto the County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which both then was, and ever since hath been appendant on the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> By reason of which mutual distrusts and jealousies, the Pope received no other answer to his motion in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> but that it was impossible to apply themselves to matters abroad, when they were exercised at home with so many concernments.</p>
            <p n="9">9. This answer pinched upon the Pope, who found as much confusion in the State of <hi>Avignion,</hi> belonging for some hundreds of years to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> could reasonably complain in the Bowels of <hi>France.</hi> For lying as it did within the limits of <hi>Provence,</hi> and being visited with such of the French Preachers as had been studied at <hi>Geneva,</hi> the people generally became inclined unto <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrines, and made profession of the same both in private and publick; nay, they resolved upon the lawfulness of taking up of Arms against the Pope, though their natural Lord; partly upon pretence that the Country was unjustly taken from the Earls of <hi>Tholouse</hi> by the Predecessors of the Pope; partly because the present Pope could prove no true Lineal Succession from the first Usurper; but chiefly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that persons <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> were disabled by Christs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments from exercising any Temporal Jurisdiction over other men. Being thus resolved to rebel, they put themselves, by the perswasion of <hi>Alexander Guilatine,</hi> a professed Civilian, into the protection of <hi>Charles Count de Mont-brun,</hi> who had then taken Arms against the King, in the Country of <hi>Daulphine. Mont-brun</hi> accepts of the imployment, enters the Territory of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignion</hi>

with three thousand Foot, reduceth the whole Country under his command; the Popes Vice-Legate in the City being hardly able for the present to make good the Castle. But so it happened, that the Cardinal of <hi>Tournon,</hi> whose Niece the Count had married, being neer the place, prevailed with him after some discourse to withdraw his Forces, and to retire unto <hi>Geneva</hi>; assuring him not onely of his Majesties pardon, and the restitution of his Goods which had been confiscated, but that he should have liberty of Conscience also, which he prized far more then both the other. By which Action the people were necessitated to return to their old obedience; but with so many fears and jealousies on either side, that many years were spent before the Pope could be assured of the love of his Subjects, or they relye upon the Clemency and good will of their Prince. Such issue had the first attempts of the <hi>Calvinians</hi> in the Realm of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. In the mean time it was determined by the Cabinet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in the Court, to smother the indignity of these insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the hot spirits of the <hi>French</hi> might have time to cool, and afterwards to call them to a sober reckoning, when they least looked for it. In order whereunto, an Edict is published in the Kings name, and sent to all the Parliamentary Courts of <hi>France</hi> (being at that time eight in all) concerning the holding of an Assembly at <hi>Fountain-bleau</hi> on the 21 of <hi>August</hi> then next following, for composing the distractions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And in that Edict he declares, that without any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent occasion, a great number of persons had risen and taken Arms against him; that he could not but impute the cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the <hi>Hugonots</hi> onely, who having laid aside all belief to God, and all affection to their Country, endeavoured to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb the peace of the Kingdom; that he was willing, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, to pardon all such, as having made acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their errours, should return to their Houses, and live conformable to the Rites of the Catholick Church, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Laws; that therefore none of his Courts of Parliament should proceed in matters of Religion, upon any manner of information for offences past, but to provide by all severity for the future against their committing of the like; and finally, that for reforming all abuses in Government, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved upon the calling of an Assembly, in which the Princes and most Eminent Persons of the Kingdom should consult to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

According unto which appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Assembly holds, but neither the King of <hi>Navar</hi> nor the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> could be perswaded to be present; being both bent, as it appeared not long after, on some further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.

But it was ordered, that the Admiral <hi>Collignie,</hi> and his brother <hi>D' Andelot</hi> should attend the service, to the end that nothing should be there concluded without their privity, or to the prejudice of their Cause. And that they might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter strike a terrour into the Heart of the King; whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have been frighted to the calling of the present As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, the Admiral tenders a Petition in behalf of those of the reformed Religion in the Dukedom of <hi>Normandy,</hi> which they were ready to subscribe with one hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand hands, if it were required. To which the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> as bravely answered, that if 150000 seditious could be found in <hi>France</hi> to subscribe that paper, he doubted not but that there were a million of Loyal Subjects, who would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to encounter them, and oppose their insolencies.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In this Assembly it was ordered by the common consent, that for rectifying of abuses amongst the Clergy, a meeting should be held of Divines and Prelates, in which those discords might be remedied, without innovating or disputing in matters of Faith; and that for setling the affairs of the Kingdom, an Assembly of the three Estates should be held at <hi>Orleance,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>October</hi>; to which all persons interested were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to come. All which the <hi>Hugonots</hi> imputed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation which they had brought upon the Court by their former risings, and the great fear which was conceived of some new insurrections, if all things were not regulated and reformed according unto their desires. Which misconceit so wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the principal Leaders, that they resolved to make use of the present fears, by seizing on such Towns and places of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as might enable them to defend both themselves and their parties, against all opponents. And to that end it was concluded, that the King of <hi>Navar</hi> should seize upon all places in his way betwixt <hi>Bearn</hi> and <hi>Orleance</hi>; that the City of <hi>Paris</hi> should be seized on by the help of the Marshal of <hi>Montmorency</hi> the Dukes Eldest Son, who was Governour of it; that they should assure themselves of <hi>Picardy</hi> by the Lords of <hi>Tenepont</hi> and <hi>Bouchavanne,</hi> and of <hi>Britain</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Estampes,</hi> who was powerful in it; that being thus fortified, well armed, and better accompanied by the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> whom they might presume of, they should force the Assembly of the Estates to depose the Queen, remove the <hi>Guises</hi> from the Government, declare the King to be in his minority till he came to twenty two years of age, appoint the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> the Constable, and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> for his Tutors and Governours: which practice as it was confessed by <hi>Iaques de la Sague,</hi> one of the Servants of the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> who had been intercepted in his journey to him; so the confession was confirmed by some Letters from the Visdame of <hi>Chartres</hi> which he had about him. But this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very being kept secret, the <hi>Hugonots</hi> having taken courage from the first conspiracie at <hi>Amboise,</hi> and the open profession of the
<pb facs="tcp:54836:36"/>
Admiral, began to raise some new commotions in all parts of the Kingdom; and laying aside all obedience and respect of duty, not onely made open resistance against the Magistrates, but had directly taken arms in many places, and practised to get into their hands some principal Towns, to which they might retire in all times of danger: Amongst which none was more aimed at then the City of <hi>Lyons,</hi> a City of great Wealth and Trading, and where great numbers of the people were inclined to <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrine, by reason of their neer Neighbourhood to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the Protestant Cantons. Upon this Town the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had a plot, and was like to have carried it, though in the end it fell out contrary to his expectation; which forced him to withdraw himself to <hi>Bearn,</hi> there to provide for the security of himself and his Brother.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> not being so deeply interested in these late designs, in which his name had been made use of half against his will, could not so much distrust himself and his personal safety, as not to put himself into a readiness for his journey to <hi>Orleance.</hi> To which he could by no means perswade the Prince, and was by him much laboured not to go in person, till they were certified that the King was sending Forces to fetch them thence; which could not be without the wasting of the Country, and the betraying of themselves unto those suspicions which otherwise they might hope to clear. No sooner were they come to <hi>Orleance,</hi> but the Prince was arrested of high Treason, committed close Prisoner with a Guard upon him, the cognizance of his Cause appointed unto certain Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, his Process formed, and Sentence of death pronounced against him; which questionless had been executed both on him and the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> who was then also under a Guard, if the death of the young King had not intervened on the fifth of <hi>December,</hi> which put the Court into new Counsels, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served their lives. For the Queen wisely took into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if these two Princes were destroyed, there could be no fit counterpoise for the House of <hi>Guise</hi>; which possibly might thereby be temped to revive the old pretensions of the House of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> as the direct Heirs of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi> For which they could not have a better opportunity, then they had at the present; the Eldest of her three Sons not exceeding ten years of age, none of them of a vigorous constitution, and therefore the more likely to want Friends in their greatest need. Upon these apprehensions she sends secretly for the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var,</hi> and came at last to this agreement, <hi>viz.</hi> that during the Minority of her son King <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, the Queen-mother should be declared Regent, and the King of <hi>Navar</hi> Lord-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of <hi>France</hi>; all supplications from the Provinces to be made to the Lord-Lieutenant; but all Ambassadors and Letters of Negotiation from Forreign Princes to be presented to the Queen; that the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Visdame of <hi>Chartres,</hi> with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54836:37"/>
all other Prisoners of their party to be set at liberty, and the sentences of their condemnations to be so declared null and void; that the Queen-Regent should make use of her power and interest with the Catholick King, for restoring to the King of <hi>Navar</hi> the entire possession of that Kingdom, or at the least the Kingdom of <hi>Sardinia</hi> as a recompence for it. And at last it was also yeilded, though long first, and published by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of the 28 of <hi>Ianuary, That the Magistrates should be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to release all Prisoners committed for matters of Religion, and to stop any manner of Inquisition appointed for that purpose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any person whatsoever; that they should not suffer any disputation in matters of Faith, nor permit particular persons to revile one another with the names of</hi> Heretick <hi>and</hi> Papist; <hi>but that all should live together in peace, abstaining from unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Assemblies, or to raise scandals or Sedition.</hi>

            <p n="13">
               <note place="margin">1561.</note>13. By this Edict the Doctrines of <hi>Calvin</hi> were first counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced in the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> under the pretence of hindring the effusion of more Christian blood: which carryed an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of much Christianity, though in plain truth it was to be ascribed to the Queens ambition, who could devise no other way to preserve her greatness, and counterbalance the Authority of the House of <hi>Guise.</hi> But the <hi>Hugonots</hi> not being content with a bare connivance, resolved to drive it on to a Toleration; and to drive it on in such a manner, and by such means onely by which they had extorted (as they thought) these first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions. For thinking the Queen-Regent not to be in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to deny them any thing, much less to call them into question for their future Actings, they presently fell upon the open ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their own Religion, and every where exceedingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased both in power and numbers. In confidence whereof, by publick Assemblies, insolent Speeches, and other acts the like unpleasing, they incurred the hatred and disdain of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick party; which put all places into tumult, and filled all the Provinces of the Kingdom with seditious rumours: so that contrary to the intention of those that governed, and contrary to the common opinion, the remedy applyed to maintain the State, and preserve peace and concord in the Kings minority, fell out to be dangerous and destructive, and upon the matter oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned all those dissentions which they hoped by so much care to have prevented. For as the Cardinal informed the Council, the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were grown by this connivance to so great a height, that the Priests were not suffered to celebrate their daily Sacrifices, or to make use of their own Pulpits; that the Magistrates were no longer obeyed in their jurisdictions; and that all places raged with discords, burnings and slaughters, through the peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and presumption of those, who assumed to themselves a liberty of teaching and believing whatsoever they listed. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which points he so enlarged himself with his wonted elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that neither the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> nor any other of that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54836:37"/>
party could make any Reply. And the Queen-Mother also being silent in it, it was unanimously voted by the Lords of the Council, that all the Officers of the Crown should assemble at the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> on the thirteenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> there to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in the Kings presence of all these particulars, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve upon such remedies as were necessary for the future. At which time it was by general consent expresly ordered, upon complaint made of the insurrection of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in so many places, that all the Ministers should forthwith be expelled the Kingdom; that no manner of person should from thenceforth use any other Rites or Ceremonies in Religion, that were not held and taught by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and that all Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of men armed or unarmed should be interdicted, except it were of Catholicks in Catholick Churches, for Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances according to the usual Custom.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The Admiral and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unable to cross this Edict, resolved upon another course to advance their partie, and to that end encouraged the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Ministers to petition for a Disputation in the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, to be held between them and the Adversaries of their Religion. Which Disputation being propounded, was opposed by the Cardinal of <hi>Tournon,</hi> upon a just consideration of those inconveniencies which might follow on it; the rather, in regard of the General Council then convened at <hi>Trent,</hi> where they might safely both propose and dispute their opinions. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> being willing to imbrace the occasion for making a general Muster of his own Abilities, his subtilty in Divinity, and his art of speaking, prevailed so far upon the rest, that the suit was granted, and a Conference thereupon appointed to be held at <hi>Poyssie,</hi> on the tenth day of <hi>August,</hi> 1561. At which time there assembled for the Catholick party, the Cardinals of <hi>Tournon, Lorrain, Bourbon, Armagnac</hi> and <hi>Guise,</hi> with many Bishops and Prelates of greatest emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, some Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and many great Divines from the Universities. The Disputants authorized for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side were of like esteem, amongst those of their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perswasions; as namely, <hi>Theodore Beza, Peter Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yr, Francis de</hi> St. <hi>Paul, Iohn Raimond,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Vizelle,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Ministers from <hi>Geneva, Germany,</hi> and others of the Neighbouring Countries. But the result of all was this, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it happeneth on the like occasions, that both parties chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged to themselves the Victory in it, and both indeed were victors in some respects. For the King of <hi>Navar</hi> appeared much unsatisfied by noting the differences of the Ministers amongst themselves, some of them adhering to the <hi>Augustane,</hi> and others to the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Confession, in some points of Doctrine; which made him afterwards more cordial to the interest of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> notwithstanding all the arguments and insinuations used by his Wife, a most zealous <hi>Hugonot,</hi> to withdaaw him
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54836:38"/>
from it. But the <hi>Hugonots</hi> gave out on the other side, that they had made good their Doctrines, convinced the Catholick Doctors, confounded the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and gotten Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense from the King to Preach. Which gave such courage to the rest of that Faction, that they began of their own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to assemble themselves in such places as they thought most convenient, and their Ministers to preach in publick, and their Preachings followed and frequented by such infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, as well of the Nobility as the common People, that it was thought impossible to suppress, and dangerous to disturb their Meetings. For so it was, that if either the Magistrates mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested them in their Congregations, or the Catholicks attemped to drive them out of their Temples, without respect to any Authority they put themselves into Arms; and in the middle of a full Peace, was made a shew of a most terrible and destructive War.</p>
            <p n="15">15. This being observed by those which sate at the Helme, and finding that these tempests were occasioned by the Edict of <hi>Iuly,</hi> it was resolved to stere their course by another winde. For the Queen being setled in this Maxime of State, That she was not to suffer one Faction to destroy the other, for fear she should remain a prey to the Victor, not onely gave order for conventing all the Parliaments to a Common-Council, but earnestly sollicited for a Pacification; which gave beginning to the famous Edict of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> whereby it was granted, that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> should have the Free exercise of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; that they might assemble to hearing of Sermons in any open place without their Cities, but on condition that they went unarmed, and that the Officers of the place were there also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Which Edict so offended the chief Heads of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick party, that a strict combination and confederacy was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on between the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> the Constable, and the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> for maintenance of the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this reduced the Queen-Regent to the like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of making a strict union with the Admiral and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> whereby she was assured of the power of the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi> and they became as confident of her Protection. In which condition they were able to form their Churches, to cast them into Provinces, Classes, and other subdivisions of a less capacity; to settle in them their Presbyteries and Synodical Meetings, grounded according to their Rules of <hi>Calvins</hi> Platform, in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Discipline and Worship. The Forms whereof being discribed at large in the former Book, may there be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the trouble of a repetition. In so much, that it was certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the Fathers in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that the <hi>French Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi> were at that time distributed into two thousand one hundred and fifty Churches, each of them furnished with their proper and peculiar Preachers, according to a just computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was taken of them: which computation was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54836:38"/>
then made, to satisfie the Queen-Regent in the strength of that party, for which she could not otherwise declare her self, unless she were first made acquainted with their power and numbers. But being satisfied in those points, she began to shew her self much inclined to <hi>Calvinism,</hi> gave ear unto the Discourses of the Ministers in her private Chamber, conferred familiarly with the Prince, the Admiral, and many others in matters which concerned their Churches; and finally, so disguised her self, that the Pope was not able to discover at what port she aimed. For sometimes she would write unto him for such a Council as by the <hi>Calvinians</hi> was desired, at other times for a national one to be held in <hi>France</hi>; sometimes desiring that the Communion might be administred under both kindes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhile requiring a Dispensation for Priests to Marry; now solliciting that Divine Service might be said in the vulgar tongue, then proposing such other like things as were wished and preached for by the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> By which dissimulations she amused the World, but gave withal so many notable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to the Reformation, that next to God she was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal promoter and advancer of it; though this prosperity proved the cause of those many miseries which afterwards ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it.</p>
            <p n="16">16. For by this means the Preachers having free access into the Court,<note place="margin">1562.</note> became exceedingly respected in the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> where in short time their followers did increase to so great a multitude, as put the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> into such a confidence, that he assumed unto himself the managery of all great affairs: Which course so visibly tended to the diminution of the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> that he resolved by strong hand to remove him from <hi>Paris.</hi> And to that end, directed both his Messages and his Letters to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> to come in to help him. The Duke was then at <hi>Iainville</hi> in the Province of <hi>Champaigne,</hi> and happened in his way upon a Village called <hi>Vassey,</hi> where the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were assembled in great numbers to hear a Sermon. A scuffle unhappily is begun between some of the Dukes Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and not a few of the more unadvised and adventurous <hi>Hugonots:</hi> which the Duke coming to part, was hit with a blow of a stone upon one of his Cheeks, which forced him with the loss of some blood to retire again. Provoked with which indignity, his Followers, being two Companies of Lances, charge in upon them with their Fire-looks, kill sixty of them in the place, and force the rest for preservation of their lives into several houses. This accident is by the <hi>Hugonots</hi> given out to be a matter of design; the execution done upon those sixty persons, must be called a Massacre; and in revenge thereof, the Kingdom shall be filled with Blood and Rapine, Altars and Images defaced, Monasteries ruined and pulled down, and Churches bruitishly polluted. The Queen had so long juggled between both parties, that now it was not safe for her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54836:39"/>
for either. Upon which ground she removed the Court to <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi> and left them to play their own Games, as the Dice should run: The presence of the King was looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a matter of great importance, and either party laboured to get him into their power. The City of <hi>Orleance</hi> more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially was aimed at by the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> as lying in the heart of the Kingdom, rich, large and populous, sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to novelty and innovations; and therefore thought the fittest Stage for his future Actings. Being thus resolved, he first sends <hi>D' Andelot</hi> with some Forces to possess the Town, and posts himself towards <hi>Fountain-Bleau</hi> with three thousand Horse. But the Catholick Confederates had been there before him, and brought the King off safely to his City of <hi>Paris:</hi> which being signified to the Prince as he was on his way, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts toward <hi>Orleance,</hi> and came thither in a luckie hour to relieve his Friends: which having seized upon one of the Gates, and thereby got possession of that part of the City, was in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger to be utterly broken by the Catholick party, if the Prince had not come so opportunely to renew the fight: but by his coming they prevailed, made themselves Masters of the City, and handselled their new Government with the spoil of all the Churches and Religious Houses, which either they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, or laid waste and desolate. Amongst which, none was used more coursely then the Church of St. <hi>Crosse,</hi> being the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral of that City; not so much out of a dislike to all Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals (though that had been sufficient to expose it unto Spoil and Rapine) as out of hatred to the name. Upon which furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous piece of Zeal, they afterwards destroyed all the little Crosses which they found in the way between <hi>Mont-Martyr</hi> and St. <hi>Denis,</hi> first raised in memory of <hi>Denis</hi> the first Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and one that passeth in account for the chief Apostle of the <hi>Gallick</hi> Nations.</p>
            <p n="17">17. But to proceed: to put some fair colour upon this foul action, a <hi>Manifest</hi> is writ and published; in which the Prince and his adherents signifie to all whom it might concern, that they had taken arms for no other reason, but to restore the King and Queen to their personal liberty, kept Prisoners by the power and practice of the Catholick Lords; that obedience might be rendred in all places to his Majesties Edicts, which by the violence of some men had been infringed; and therefore that they were willing to lay down Arms, if the Constable, the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the Marshal of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> should retire from <hi>Paris,</hi> leaving the King and Queen to their own disposing; and that liberty of Religion might be equally tolerated and maintained unto all alike. These false Colours were wiped off by a like Remonstrance made by the Parliament of <hi>Paris:</hi> In which it was declared amongst other things, that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had first broke those Edicts by going armed to their Assemblies, and without an Officer; That they had no pretence to excuse
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54836:39"/>
themselves from the crime of Rebellion, considering they had openly seized on many Towns, raised Souldiers, assumed the Munition of the Kingdom, cast many pieces of Ordnance and Artillery, assumed unto themselves the Coyning of Money; and in a word, that they have wasted a great part of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Revenues, robbed all the rich Churches within their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and destroyed the rest, to the dishonour of God, the scandal of Religion, and the impoverishing of the Realm. The like answer was made also by the Constable and the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> in their own behalf, declaring in the same, that they were willing to retire, and put themselves into voluntary exile, upon condition that the Arms taken up against the King might be quite laid down, the places kept against him delivered up, the Churches which were ruined restored again, the Catholick Religion honourably preserved, and an intire obedience rendred to the lawful King, under the Government of the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var,</hi> and the Regencie of the Queen his Mother. Nor were the King and Queen wanting to make up the breach, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing that they were free from all restraint, and that the Catholick Lords had but done their duty in waiting on them into <hi>Paris</hi>; that since the Catholick Lords were willing to retire from Court, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had no reason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at that distance; that therefore he and his adherents ought to put themselves, together with the places which they had possessed, into the obedience of the King; which if they did, they should not onely have their several and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Pardons for all matters past, but be from thenceforth looked upon as his Loyal Subjects, without the least diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of State or honour.</p>
            <p n="18">18. These Paper-pellets being thus spent, both sides pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare more furiously to charge each other. But first the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> by the aid of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> makes himself Master of the great Towns and C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ties of chief importance; such as were <hi>Rouen,</hi> the Parliamentary City of the Dukedom of <hi>Normandy</hi>; the Ports of <hi>Diepe</hi> and <hi>New-haven</hi>; the Cities of <hi>Angiers, Towres, Bloise, Vendosme, Bourges</hi> and <hi>Poictiers</hi>; which last were reckoned for the greatest of all the Kingdom, except <hi>Rouen</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi>; after which followed the rich City of <hi>Lyons,</hi> with that of <hi>Valence</hi> in the Province of <hi>Daulphiny,</hi> together with almost all the strong places in <hi>Gascoigne</hi> and <hi>Languedock,</hi> Provinces in a manner wholly <hi>Hugonot,</hi> except <hi>Tholouse, Bourdeaux,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps some others. But because neither the Contributions which came in from the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> though they were very large, nor the spoil and pillage of those Cities which they took by force, were of themselves sufficient to maintain the War; the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> caused all the Gold and Silver in the Churches to be brought unto him, which he coyned into Money. They made provision of all manner of Artillery and Ammunition which they took from most of the Towns, and laid up in <hi>Orleance,</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:54836:40"/>
turning the Covent of the <hi>Franciscans</hi> into a Magazine, and there disposing all their stores with great art and industry. The Catholicks on the other side drew their Forces together, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of 4000 Horse and six thousand Foot, most of them old experienced Souldiers, and trained up in the War against <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth. The Prince had raised an Army of an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that is to say, three thousand Horse, and seven thousand Foot; but, for the most part, raw and young Souldiers, and such as scarcely knew how to stand to their Arms: And yet with these weak Forces he was grown so high, that nothing would content him but the banishment of the Constable, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>; free liberty for the <hi>Hugonots</hi> to meet together for the Exercise of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in walled Towns; Cities and Churches to be publickly appointed for them; the holding of the Towns which he was presently possessed of as their absolute Lord, till the King were out of his Minority, which was to last till he came to the age of two and twenty. He required also that the Popes Legate should be presently commanded to leave the Kingdom; that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> should be capable of all Honours and Offices; and finally, that security should be given by the Emperour, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King, the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Republick of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> by which they were to stand obliged, that neither the Constable nor the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> should return into <hi>France,</hi> till the King was come unto the age before remembred.</p>
            <p n="19">19. These violent demands so incensed all those which had the Government of the State, that the Prince and his Adherents were proclaimed Traytors, and as such to be prosecuted in a course of Law, if they laid not down their Arms by a day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Which did as little benefit them, as the proposals of the Prince had pleased the others. For thereupon the <hi>Hugonots</hi> united themselves more strictly into a Confederacie to deliver the King, the Queen, the Kingdom, from the violence of their opposites; to stand to one another in the defence of the Edicts, and altogether to submit to the Authority of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> as the head of their Union: publishing a tedious Declaration with their wonted confidence, touching the motives which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to this Combination. This more estranged the Queen from them then she was at first; and now she is resolved to break them by some means or other, but rather to attempt it by Wit then by Force of Arms: And to this end she deals so dexterously with the Constable and the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> that she prevailed with them to leave the Court, and to prefer the common safety of their Country before their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and personal greatness: which being signified by Letters to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> he frankly offered under his hand, that whensoever these great Adversaries of his were retired from the Court (which he conceived a matter of impossibility to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54836:40"/>
them to) he would not onely lay down Arms, but quit the Kingdom. But understanding that the Constable and the Duke had really withdrawn themselves to their Country-houses, devested of all power bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h in Court and Council, he stood confounded at the unadvisedness and precipitation of so rash a promise as he had made unto the Queen. For it appeared dishonourable to him not to keep his word, more dangerous to relinquish his command in the Army, but most destructive to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his party to dissolve their Forces, and put himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a voluntary exile, not knowing whither to retreat. At which dead lift he is refreshed by some of his <hi>Calvinian</hi> Preachers with a Cordial comfort. By which learned Casuists it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved for good Divinity, that the Prince having undertaken the maintenance of those who had imbraced the purity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and made himself by Oath Protector of the Word of God, no following obligation could be of force to make him violate the first. In which determining of the Case, they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been guided by that Note in the English Bibles, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated and printed at <hi>Geneva,</hi> where in the Margine to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter of St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel, it is thus advertised: <hi>viz. That promise ought not to be kept, when Gods honour and the preaching of the Truth is hindred; or else it ought not to be broken.</hi> They added, to make sure work of it (at the least they thought so) that the Queen had broken a former promise to the Prince, in not bringing the King over to his party, as she once assured him; and therefore that he was not bound to keep faith with her, who had broke her own.</p>
            <p n="20">20. But this Divinity did not seem sufficient to preserve his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; another temperament was found by some wiser heads, by which he might both keep his promise, and not leave his Army. By whose advice it was resolved, that he should put himself into the power of the Queen, who was come within six Miles of him with a small re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ive him; that having done his duty to her, he should express his readiness to forsake the Kingdom, as soon as some Accord was settled; and that the Admiral, <hi>D' Andelot,</hi> and some other of the principal Leaders, should on the sudden shew themselves, forcibly mount him on his Horse, and bring him back into the Army. Which Lay-device, whether it had more cunning or less honesty then that of the Cabal of Divines, it is hard to say: But sure it is, that it was put in execution accordingly; the Queen thereby deluded, and all the hopes of Peace and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation made void and frustrate. But then a greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty seized upon them. The King had re-inforced his Army by the accession of ten Cornets of <hi>German</hi> Horse, and six thousand <hi>Switz.</hi> The Princes Army rather diminished then increased, and, which was worse, he wanted Money to maintain those Forces which he had about him; so that being neither able to keep the Field for want of men, nor keep his men together for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54836:41"/>
want of Money, it was resolved that he must keep his men upon free-quarter in such Towns and Cities as followed the Fortune of his side, till he was seconded by some strength from <hi>England,</hi> or their Friends in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Queen of <hi>England</hi> had been dealt with; but she resolved not to engage on their behalf, except the Port of <hi>Havre-de-grace,</hi> together with the Town of <hi>Diepe</hi> were put into her hands, and that she might have leave to put a Garrison of English into <hi>Rouen</hi> it self. Which Proposition seemed no other to most knowing men, then in effect to put into her power the whole Dukedom of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> by giving her possession of the principal City, and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her Girdle the two Keys of the Province, by which she might enter when she pleased with all the rest of her Forces. But then the Ministers being advised with, who in all publick Consultations were of great Authority, especially when they related unto Cases of Conscience; it was by them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for sound Doctrine, That no consideration was to be had of worldly things, when the maintenance of Coelestial Truths, and the propagation of the Gospel was brought in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; and therefore that all other things were to be contemned, in reference to the establishment of true Religion, and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Conscience. According to which notable determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Seneschal of <hi>Rouen,</hi> and the young Visdame of <hi>Chartres</hi> are dispatched to <hi>England</hi>; with whom it was accorded by the Queens Commissioners, that the Queen should presently supply the Prince and his Confederates with Monies, Arms and Ammunition; that she should aid him with an Army of eight thousand Foot, to be maintained at her own pay, for defence of <hi>Normandy</hi>; and that for her security, in the way of caution, the Town of <hi>New haven,</hi> (which the French call <hi>Havre-de-grace,</hi> as is before said) should be forthwith put into her hands, under a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour or Commander of the <hi>English</hi> Nation; that she should place a Garrison of two thousand <hi>English</hi> in the City of <hi>Rouen,</hi> and a proportionable number in the Town of <hi>Diepe</hi>; but the Chief Governours of each to be natural French. Which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants were accordingly performed on both sides, to the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>French,</hi> and the great damage and reproach of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> as it after proved. For so it was, that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being forced to disperse his Souldiers, and to dispose of them in such manner as before was noted, the King being Master of the Field, carryed the War from Town to Town, and from place to place; and in that course he speeds so well, as to take in the Cities of <hi>Angiers, Tours, Bloise, Poictiers,</hi> and <hi>Bourges,</hi> with divers others of less note; some of which were surrended upon composition, some taken by assault, and exposed to spoil. And now all passages being cleared, and all rubs removed, they were upon the point of laying Siege to the City of <hi>Orleance,</hi> when at the Queens earnest sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they changed that purpose for the more profitable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54836:41"/>
to the King and Kingdom. <hi>Normandy</hi> was in no small danger of being wilfully betrayed into the hands of the <hi>English,</hi> who therefore were to be removed, or at the least to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed out of <hi>Rouen</hi> before the Kings Army was consumed in Actions of inferiour consequence. The issue of which War was this, That though the <hi>English</hi> did brave service for defence of the City, and made many gallant attempts for relief thereof by their men and shipping from <hi>New-haven</hi>; yet in the end the Town was taken by assault, and for two days together made a prey to the Souldiers. The joy of the Royalists for the reduction of this great City to the Kings obedience, was much abated by the death of the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately received his deaths wound in the heat of the Seige, and dyed in the forty fourth year of his age, leaving behind him a young Son called <hi>Henry,</hi> who afterward succeeded in the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> And on the contrary, the sorrow for this double loss was much diminished in the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and the rest of his party, by the seasonable coming of four thousand Horse and five thousand Foot, which <hi>Monsieur d' Andelot</hi> with great industry had raised in <hi>Germany,</hi> and with as great courage and good fortune had conducted safely to the Prince.</p>
            <p n="22">22. By the accession of these Forces, the <hi>Hugonots</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to attempt the surprizing of <hi>Paris</hi>; from which they were disswaded by the Admiral, but eagerly inflamed to that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking by the continual importunity of such Preachers as they had about them. Repulsed from which with loss both of time and honour, they were encountred in a set battel near the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ty of <hi>Dreux,</hi> in the neighbouring Province of <hi>Le Beausse.</hi> In which battel their whole Army was overthrown, and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> taken prisoner; but his captivity sweetned by the like misfortune which befel the Constable, took prisoner in the same battel by the hands of the Admiral; who having drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the remainder of his broken Army, retires towards <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance,</hi> and leaving there his Brother <hi>D' Andelot</hi> with the Foot to make good that City, takes with him all the <hi>German</hi> Horse, and so goes for <hi>Normandy,</hi> there to receive such Monies as were sent from <hi>England.</hi> But the Monies not coming at the time, by reason of cross windes and tempestuous weather, the <hi>Germans</hi> are permitted to spoil and plunder in all the parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, not sparing places either Profane or Sacred, and reckoning no distinction either betwixt Friends or Enemies. But in short time the Seas grew passable, and the Monies came (an hundred and fifty thousand Crowns according to the French account) together with fourteen pieces of Cannon, and a proportionable stock of Ammunition; by which supply the <hi>Germans</hi> were not onely well paid for spoiling the Country, but the Admiral was thereby inabled to do some good service, from which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54836:42"/>
in a manner to terms of yeilding, where he was villanously mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by one <hi>Poltrot,</hi> a Gentleman of a good Family and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Wit; who having lived many years in <hi>Spain,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward imbracing the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines, grew into great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem with <hi>Beza</hi> and the rest of the Consistorians, by whom it was thought fit to execute any great Attempt. By whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Admiral, and by the Admiral excited to a work of so much merit, he puts himself without much scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the undertaking; entreth on the Kings service, and by degrees became well known unto the Duke. Into whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he so far insinuated, that he could have access to him whensoever he pleased; and having gained a fit opportunity to effect his purpose, dispatched him by the shot of a Musket laden with no fewer then three bullets, in the way to his lodging.</p>
            <p n="23">23. This murder was committed on <hi>Feb.</hi> 24. <hi>an.</hi> 1562. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to the Rack, he on the Rack confessed upon what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives he had done the fact. But more particularly he aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that by the Admirall he was promised great rewards, and that he was assured by <hi>Beza,</hi> that by taking out of the world such a great persecutor of the Gospel, he could not but exceedingly merit at the hands of Almighty God. And though both <hi>Beza</hi> and the Admiral endeavoured by their Manifests and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to wipe off this stain; yet the confession of the murtherer, who could have no other ends in it then to speak his conscience, left most men better satisfied in it, then by both their writings. But as it is an ill wind which blows no body good, so the Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinate of this great person, though very grievous to his friends, served for an Introduction to the peace ensuing. For he being taken out of the way, the Admirall engaged in <hi>Normandy,</hi> the Constable Prisoner in the City, and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in the Camp; it was no hard matter for the Queen to conclude a peace upon such terms, as might be equall to all parties. By which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord it was concluded, that all that were free Barons in the Lands and Castles which they were possessed of, or held them of no other Lord then the King himself, might freely exercise the Reformed Religion in their own jurisdictions; and that the other which had not such Dominions might doe the same in their own Houses and Families only, provided that they did not the same in Towns and Cities: that in every Province certain Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties should be assigned, in the Suburbs whereof the <hi>Hugonots</hi> might have the free exercise of their Religion: that in the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and in all other Towns and places whatsoever, where the Court resided, no other Religion should be exercised but the Roman Catholick; though in those Cities every man might privately enjoy his conscience without molestation: that those of the Reformed Religion should observe the Holy Days ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Roman Kalendar, and in their Marriages the Rites and Constitutions of the Civil Law; and finally, that a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54836:42"/>
pardon should be granted to all manner of persons, with a full restitution to their Lands and Liberties, their Honors, Offices and Estates. Which moderation or restriction of the Edict of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> did much displease some zealous <hi>Hugonots,</hi> but their Preachers most; who as they loved to exercise their gifts in the greatest Auditories, so they abominated nothing more then those observances.</p>
            <p n="24">24. After this followed the reduction of <hi>New-haven</hi> to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1563.</note> and the expulsion of the <hi>English</hi> out of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>; the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and some other leading men of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> faction, contributing both their presence and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to it; which had not been so easily done, had not God fought more against the <hi>English,</hi> then the whole <hi>French</hi> Armies: for by cross winds it did not only hinder all supplyes from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, till the surrendry of the Town; but hastened the surrender by a grievous Pestilence, which had extreamly wasted them in respect of number, and miserably dejected them in point of courage. And yet the anger of God did not stay here nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Plague being carried into <hi>England</hi> at the return of the Soldiers, which raged extreamly both in <hi>London</hi> and most parts of the Realme, beyond the precedent and example of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages. It was on the 17 of <hi>Iuly, an.</hi> 1563, that <hi>New-haven</hi> was yielded to the <hi>French,</hi> that being the last day of the first war which was raised by the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and raised by them on no other ground, but for extorting the free exercise of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by force of Arms, according to the doctrine and example of the Mother-City. In the pursuit whereof, they did not only with their own hands ruinate and deface the beauty of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, but gave it over for a prey to the lust of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. The calling in of the <hi>English</hi> to support their faction, whom they knew well to be the antient enemies of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and putting into their hands the chief strength of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> of whose pretensions to that Dukedome they could not be ignorant; were two such actions of a disloyal impolitick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as no pretence of zeal to that which they called the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, could either qualifie or excuse. Nor was the bringing in of so many thousand <hi>German</hi> Souldiers of much better condition, who though they could pretend no title to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> nor to any particular Province in it, were otherwise more destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the peace of that Country, and created far more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the people of it, then all the forces of the <hi>English</hi>; for being to be maintained on the pay of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi> not being able to satisfie their exorbitant Arrears, they were suffered to waste the Country in all parts where they came, and to expose the whole Kingdom, from the very borders of it toward <hi>Germany,</hi> to the <hi>English</hi> Chanell, unto spoyle and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine; so that between the <hi>Hugonots</hi> themselves on the one side, and these <hi>German</hi> Souldiers on the other, there was nothing to be seen in most parts of the Kingdom, but the destruction of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54836:43"/>
Churches, the profanation of Altars, the defacing of Images, the demolishing of Monasteries, the burning of Religious Houses, and even the digging up of the bones of the dead, despitefully thrown about the fields and unhallowed places.</p>
            <p n="25">
               <note place="margin">1566.</note>25. But this first was only raked up in the Embers, not so extinguished by the Articles of the late agreement, but that it broke out shortly into open flames; for the <hi>Hugonots</hi> pressing hard for the performance of the Edict of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> as earnestly insisting on some clauses of the pacification; the whole Realm was filled in a manner with such fears and jealousies, as carryed some resemblance of a War in the midst of Peace. The <hi>Hugonots</hi> had some thoughts of surprising <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but the Plot miscarryed: they practised also upon <hi>Narbonne,</hi> a chief City of <hi>Languedock,</hi> and openly attempted the Popes Town of <hi>Avignion</hi>; but were prevented in the one, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the other. A greater diffidence was raised against them by the unseasonable Zeal of the Queen of <hi>Navar,</hi> who not content with setling the reformed Religion in the Country of <hi>Berne,</hi> when she was absolute and supreme, suffered the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks to be infested in her own Provinces which she held im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately of the Crown; insomuch that at <hi>Pamiers</hi> the chief City of the Earldom of <hi>Foix,</hi> the <hi>Hugonots</hi> taking offence at a solemn Procession held upon <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> day, betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves presently to Arms; and falling upon those whom they found unarmed, not onely made a great slaughter amongst the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but in the heat of the same fury burnt down their Houses. Which outrage being suffered to pass unpunished, gave both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and example to some furious Zealots to commit the like in other places, as namely at <hi>Montaban, Gaelion, Rodez, Preieux, Valence, &amp;c.</hi> being all scituate in those Provinces in which the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were predominant for power and number. But that which most alarmed the Court, was a seditious Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, published by a Native of <hi>Orleance</hi>; in which it was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained (according to the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines) that the people of <hi>France</hi> were absolved from their Allegiance to the King then Reigning, because he was turned an Idolater. In which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it is lawful also to kill him, as opportunity should be offered. Which Doctrine being very agreeable unto some designs which were then every where in agitation amongst the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> was afterward made use of for the justifying of the following Wars, when the opinion grew more general, and more openly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained both from Press and Pulpit.</p>
            <p n="26">
               <note place="margin">1567.</note>26. The Catholicks on the other side began to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a posture of Arms, without so much as taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of those misdemeanors; which they seemed willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at, not so much out of any inclinations which they had in themselves, but because they found it not agreeable to the will of the Court, where such dissimulations were esteemed the best arts of Government. The Catholick King had sent the Duke
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54836:43"/>
of <hi>Alva</hi> with a puissant Army, to reduce the Low Countries to obedience, where the <hi>Calvinians</hi> had committed as great spoils and Rapines as any where in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Scotland.</hi> This Army being to pass in a long march near the Borders of <hi>France,</hi> gave a just colour to the King to arm himself; for fear lest otherwise the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might forget their errand, and fall with all their Forces into his Dominions. To this end he gives order for a Levy of six thousand <hi>Switz,</hi> which he caused to be conducted through the heart off the Kingdom, and quartered them in the Isle of <hi>France,</hi> as if they were to serve to a Guard for <hi>Paris,</hi> far enough off from any of those parts and Provinces by which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were to pass. But this gave such a jealousie to the heads of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> that they resorted to <hi>Chastillion</hi> to consult with the Admiral. By whose advice it was resolved, that they must get the King and Queen into their power, and make such use of both their names, as the Catholicks had made of them in the former War. This to be done upon the sudden, before the opening of a War, by the raising of Forces, should render the surprize impossible, and defeat their purposes. The King and Queen lay then at <hi>Monceux,</hi> an House of pleasure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Territory of <hi>Byre</hi> in <hi>Champaigne,</hi> not fearing any the least danger in a time of peace, and having the <hi>Switz</hi> near e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to secure their persons against any secret Machinations. And thereupon it was contrived, that as many Horse as they could raise in several places, should draw together at <hi>Rosay,</hi> not far from <hi>Monceux,</hi> on the 27 of <hi>September</hi>; that they should first surprize the King, the Queen, and her younger Sons, and then fall in upon the <hi>Switz,</hi> who being quartered in several places, and suspecting nothing less then the present danger, might very easily be routed; and that being done, they should possess themselves of <hi>Paris,</hi> and from thence issue out of all Mandates which concerned the Government both of Church and State. Some <hi>Hugonots</hi> which afterwards were took in <hi>Gascoyne,</hi> and by the Marshal of <hi>Monluck</hi> were exposed to torture, are said to have confessed upon the Rack, that it was really intended to kill the King, together with the Queen and the two young Princes; and having so cut off the whole Royal Line, to set the Crown upon the head of the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> But Charity and Christianity bids me think the contrary, and to esteem of this report as a Popish Calumny, devised of purpose to create the greater hatred against the Authors of those Wars.</p>
            <p n="27">27. But whether it were true or not, certain it is, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was carryed with such care and closeness, that the Queen had hardly time enough to retire to <hi>Meux,</hi> a little Town twelve Leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> before the whole Body of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in sight; from whence they were with no less difficulty conducted by the <hi>Switz</hi> (whom they had suddenly drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to the Walls of <hi>Paris</hi>; the <hi>Switz</hi> being charged upon the way by no fewer then eleven hundred Horse, and D' <hi>Andelot</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:54836:44"/>
in the head of one of the parties; but gallantly making good their March, and serving to the King and the Royal Family for a Tower or Fortress; no sooner were they come to <hi>Paris,</hi> but the <hi>Hugonots</hi> take a resolution to besiege the City before the Kings Forces could assemble to relieve the same. To which end they possessed themselves of all the passes upon the River by which provisions came into it, and burned down all the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mills about the Town, which otherwise might serve for the grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such Corn as was then within it. No better way could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised to break this blow, then to entertain them with a Parley for an accommodation, not without giving them some hope of yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto any conditions which could be reasonably required. But the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were so exorbitant in their demands, that nothing would content them, but the removing of the Queen from publick Government; the present disbanding of the Kings Forces; the sending of all strangers out of the Kingdom; a punctual execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings Edict of <hi>Ianuary</hi>; liberty for their Ministers to Preach in all places, even in <hi>Paris</hi> it self; and finally, that <hi>Calice, Metz</hi> and <hi>Havre-de-grace</hi> might be consig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed unto them for Towns of caution; but in plain truth, to serve them for the bringing in of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> when their occasion so required. The Treaty notwithstanding was continued by the Queen with great dexterity, till the King had drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sixteen thousand men, with whom the Constable gives bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel to the Enemy on the 10 of <hi>November,</hi> compels them to dislodge, makes himself master of the Field, but dyed the next day after, in the eightieth year of his age, having received his deaths wound from the hands of a <hi>Switz,</hi> who most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manfully shot him when he was not in condition to make any resistance.</p>
            <p n="28">
               <note place="margin">1568.</note>28. In the mean time the City of <hi>Orleance</hi> was surprised by the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> with many places of great importance in most parts of the Realm; which serving rather to distract then increase their Forces, they were necessitated to seek out for some For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign aid. Not having confidence enough to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> whom in the business of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven</hi> they had so betrayed, they send their Agents to sollicite the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> and prevailed with him for an Army of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thousand Horse, and four thousand Foot, to which the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Country is again exposed. Encouraged with which great supplies, they laid Siege to <hi>Chartres,</hi> the principal City of <hi>La Beaue,</hi> the loss whereof must of necessity have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the <hi>Parisians</hi> to the last extremities. The chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in the Kings Army were exceeding earnest to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them battel, thereby to force them from the Siege. But the Queen not willing to venture the whole State of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom upon one cast of the Dice, especially against such despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Gamesters who had nothing to lose but that which they carryed in their hands, so plyed them with new Offers for

The standing out of which Town in such obstinate manner, not only encouraged many others to doe the like, but by the fame thereof drew thither both the Admiral and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> with many other Gentlemen of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Faction, there to consult about renewing of the war which they were resolved on. To whom repaired the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> with the Prince her Son, then being but fifteen years of age, whom she desired to train up in that holy war, upon an hope that he might one day come to be the head of that party, as he after was. And here being met, they publish from hence two several <hi>Manifests</hi>; one in the name of all the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in general, the other in the name of that Queen alone; both tending to the same effect, that is to say, the putting of some specious colour upon their defection, and to excuse the breaking of the peace established, by the necessity of a warre.</p>
            <p n="29">29. This rapture so incensed the King and his Council, that they resolved no longer to make use of such gentle medicines as had been formerly applyed in the like distempers; which resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the parent of that terrible Edict by which the King doth first revoke all the former Edicts which had been made during his minority in favour of the Reformed Religion; nullifying more particularly the last capitulations, made only in the way of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision</hi> to redress those mischiefs for which no other course could be then resolved on. And that being done, it was ordained and commanded,
<q>That the exercise of any other Religion then the Roman Catholick (ever observed by him and the King his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors) should be prohibited, and expresly forbidden, and interdicted in all places of the Kingdom; banished all the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinist</hi> Ministers and Preachers out of all the Towns and places under his Dominion, and within fifteen days upon pain of death to avoid the Realm; pardoned through special grace all things past in matters of Religion, but requiring for the future under pain of death a general Conformity to the Rites of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; and finally ordained that no person should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any office, charge, dignity, or magistracy whatever, if he did not profess and live conformable in all points to the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54836:45"/>
Roman Religion.</q>
And for a Preamble hereunto, the King was pleased to make a long and distinct Narration of the indulgence he had used to reduce the <hi>Hugonots</hi> to a right understanding, and of the ill requital they had made unto him, by the seditions and conspiracies which they raised against him; their bringing in of forraign forces, and amongst others the most mortal enemies of the French Nation, putting into their hands the strongest places and most flourishing parts of the Kingdom, to the contempt of his authority, the despising of his grace and goodness, and the continual disquieting of his Dominions, and the destruction of his subjects. To counter-poise which terrible Edict, the Princes and other Leaders of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> which were then at <hi>Rochel,</hi> entred into a solemn Covenant or Association, by which they bound themselves by Oath to persevere till death in defence of their Religion, never to lay down arms, or condescend to any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement without the general consent of all the Commanders; and not then neither, but upon sufficient security for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their lives, and the enjoying of that Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for which they first began the war.</p>
            <p n="30">30. But the Admiral well knowing that the business was not to be carried by Oaths and Manifests, and that they wanted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to proceed by arms, advised the <hi>Rochellers</hi> to send their Navy to the sea, which in a time when no such danger was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, might spoyle and pillage all they met with, and by that means provide themselves of mony, and all other necessaries to maintain the war. Which Counsel took such good effect, that by this kind of Piracy they were enabled to give a fair beginning to this new Rebellion; for the continuance whereof, it was thought necessary to sollicite their Friends in <hi>Germany,</hi> to furnish them with fresh recruits of able men, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for such sums of money as might maintain them in the service. And in the first of these designs there appears no difficulty; the inclination of the Prince Elector, together with the rest of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Princes, and Imperial Cities, were easily intreated to assist their Brethren of the same Religion. And the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit governed many of the people also, but on different grounds; they undertaking the imployment upon hope of spoil, as Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, serving for their Pay, but more for Plunder. In <hi>England</hi> their desires were entertained with less alacrity, though eagerly sollicited by <hi>Odet</hi> Bishop of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> a younger Brother of the <hi>Admiral</hi>; who having formerly been raised to the degree of a Cardinal, therefore called most commonly the Cardinal of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon,</hi> had some years since renounced his Habit and Religion, but still kept his Titles. By the continual sollicitation of so great an Advocate, and the effectual interposing of the Queen of <hi>Navar, Elizabeth</hi> was perswaded to forget their former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and to remember how conducible it was to her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal interest to keep the French King exercised in perpetual troubles; upon which Reason of State she is not onely drawn
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54836:45"/>
to accommodate the <hi>Hugonots</hi> with Ships, Corn, Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, but to supply them with a hundred thousand Crowns of ready money for the maintaining of their Army, consisting of fourteen thousand <hi>Germans,</hi> and almost as many more of the natural <hi>French.</hi> And yet it was to be believed, that in all this she had done nothing contrary to the League with <hi>France,</hi> which she had sworn not long before; because, forsooth, the Forces of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were raised to no other end but the Kings mere service, and the assistance of the Crown against the Enemies of both, and the professed Adversaries of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

Such were the Actings of the <hi>French Calvinians,</hi> as well by secret practices as open Arms, during the troublesome Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the Second and <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, and such their variable Fortunes according to the interchanges and successes of those broken times, in which, for fifteen years together, there was nothing to be heard but Wars and rumours of Wars; short intervals of Peace, but such as generally were so full of fears and jealousies, that they were altogether as unsafe as the Wars themselves. So that the greatest calm of Peace, seemed but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to a War ensuing; to which each party was so bent, that of a poyson it became their most constant Food. In which distraction of affairs dyed King <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He had been used for some months to the spitting of bloud, which brought him first into a Feaver, and at last to his grave, not without some retaliation of the Heavenly Justice, in punishing that Prince by vomiting up the bloud of his Body natural, which had with such prodigious cruelty exhausted so much of the best bloud of the body Politick. After whose death, the Crown descended upon <hi>Henry</hi> the new King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who presently upon the news thereof forsook that Kingdom, and posted with all speed to <hi>Venice,</hi> and from thence to <hi>France,</hi> where he was joyfully received by all loyal Subjects. At his first coming to the Crown, he resolved to put an end to those combustions which had so often inflamed his Kingdom, and extinguish all those heats which had exasperated one party against another; that he might sit as Umpire or Supreme Moderator of the present
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54836:46"/>
differences, and draw unto himself an absolute Soveraignty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver both alike: which to effect, he resolves to prosecute the War so coldly, that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> might conceive good hopes of his moderation; but still to keep the War on foot, till he could finde out such a way to bring on the peace, as might create no suspition of him in the hearts of the Catholicks. By which means hoping to indulge both parties, he was perfectly believed by none, each party shewing it self distrustful of his inclinations, and each resolving to depend on some other Heads.</p>

About this time, when all men stood amazed at these proceedings of the Court, the State began to swarm with Libels and Seditious Pamphlets, published by those of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, full of reproach, and fraught with horrible invectives, not onely against the present Government, but more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly against the persons of the Queen and all her Children. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Authors whereof, when some of the Council purposed to proceed with all severity, the Queen-mother interposed her power, and moderated by her prudence the intended rigors; affirming, as most true it was, that such severity would onely gain the greater credit to those scurrilous Pamphlets, which would otherwise vanish of themselves, or be soon forgotten. Amongst which Pamphlets, there was none more pestilent then that which was composed in the way of a Dialogue, pretending one <hi>

Two other Tracts were published about this time also, both of them being alike mischievous, and tending to the overthrow of all publick Government; but wanting something of the Libel in them, as the other had: Of these, the one was called <hi>Vindiciae contra Tyrannos,</hi> or the rescuing of the people from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Tyrants; published under the name of <hi>Stephanus Brutus,</hi> but generally believed to be writ by <hi>Beza,</hi> the chief surviving Patron of the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> In which he prostitutes the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Supreme Magistrate to the lusts of the people, and brings them under the command of such <hi>popular</hi> Magistrates, as <hi>Calvin</hi> makes to be the Conservators of the publick Liberty. The other was intituled <hi>De jure Magistratos in subditos,</hi> built on the same grounds, and published with the same intention as the others were.

            <p n="36">36. As for his Doctrines in reference to the common duties between Kings and Subjects, we may reduce them to these heads, that is to say, 1. That the Authority of Kings and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magistrates is circumscribed and limited by certain bounds, which if they pass, their Subjects are no longer tyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their obedience; that Magistrates do exceed those bounds, when either they command such things as God forbiddeth, or prohibit that which he commands; that therefore they are no longer to be obeyed, if their Commands are contrary to the Rules of Piety or Christian Charity; of which the Subjects must be thought the most competent Judges. 2. That there were companies and societies of men before any Magistrates were set over them; which Magistrates were no otherwise set over them
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54836:48"/>
then by common consent; that every Magistrate so appointed was bound by certain Articles and Conditions agreed between them, which he was tyed by Oath to preserve inviolable; that the chief end for which the people chose a Superiour Magistrate, was, that they might remain in safety under his protection; and therefore if such Magistrates either did neglect that end, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise infringe the Articles of their first Agreement, the Subjects were then discharged from the bond of obedience; and that being so discharged from the bond of obedience, it was as lawful for them to take up Arms against their King in maintainance of their Religion, Laws and Liberties, if indangered by him, as for a Traveller to defend himself by force of Arms against Thieves and Robbers. 3. That no Government can be rightly constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in which the Grandeur of the Prince is more consulted then the weal of the People; that to prevent all such incroachments on the Common Liberty, the people did reserve a power of putting a curb upon their Prince or Supreme Magistrates, to hold them in, such as the <hi>Tribunes</hi> were in <hi>Rome</hi> to the Senate and Consuls, and the <hi>Ephori</hi> to the Kings of <hi>Sparta:</hi> that such a power as that of the <hi>Spartan Ephori</hi> is vested in the seven E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors of the <hi>German</hi> Empire, which gives them an Authority to depose the Emperour, if they see cause for it; and that the like may be affirmed of the English Parliaments, who oftentimes have condemned their Kings, but he knows not whom. 4. That by the first constitutions of the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> the Supreme power was not entrusted to the King, but the three Estates; so that it was not lawful for the King to proclaim a War, or to lay Taxes on the people, but by their consent; that these Estates assembled in a Common Council, did serve instead of eyes and ears to a prudent Prince, but to a wicked and ungoverned, for Bit or Bridle; and that according to this power they dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many of their Kings for their Lusts, Luxuries, Cruelty, Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, Avarice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that if they proceeded not in like manner with the King then Reigning, it was because they had an high esteem (with scorn and insolence enough) of his eminent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, his Piety, Justice and Fidelity, and the great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which was given of his Mothers Chastity: and therefore fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally (which was the matter to be proved by those Factious Principles) that it was altogether as lawful for the French to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves, their Laws and Liberties, against the violent as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault of a furious Tyrant (so he calls their King) as a Traveller by Thieves and Robbers.

But notwithstanding these indignities and provocations, the King resolved to proceed in his former indifferency, hoping thereby to break the <hi>Hugonots</hi> without blows and bloud-shed, and thereby to regain the good opinion of his Popish Subjects. To which end he was pleased to grant such priviledges to the

               <hi>Hugonot</hi> Faction as they durst not ask, and never had aspired unto in their greatest heats; which he conceived he had more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to do in the present pinch, then any of his Predecessors had in far less extremities: For the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had not onely brought in a formidable Army of <hi>Switz</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> under the conduct of Prince <hi>Casimir</hi> one of the younger sons of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Third then Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> but had also made a fraction in the Court it self, by drawing <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Alanzon</hi> his youngest Brother to be Head of their Party, who brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him a great number of Romish Catholicks, who then past under the name of the <hi>Male-contents.</hi> To break which blow, and free his Kingdom from the danger of so great an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he first capitulates to pay the <hi>Germans</hi> their Arrears, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to a million and two hundred thousand Ducats; to gratifie Prince <hi>Casimir</hi> with the Signory of <hi>Chasteau-Thierry</hi> in the Province of <hi>Champaigne,</hi> with a Pension of fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns, and a Command of a hundred Lances: To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Government of <hi>Picardie</hi> with the strong Town of <hi>Perrone</hi> on the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and settle on his Brother the Duke of <hi>Alanzon</hi> the Provinces of <hi>Berry, Touraine</hi> and <hi>Anjou,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with one hundred thousand Crowns of yearly <hi>Pension,</hi> and made him also Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then to pacifie and oblige the <hi>Hugonots</hi> (if such men could be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or pacified by acts of favour) he grants unto them by his Edict of the 14 of <hi>May</hi> 1576, that they should peaceably enjoy the exercise of their Religion, together with full power for erecting Colledges and Schools, for holding Synods, of Celebrating Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and Administring the Sacraments, with the same free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as was used by his Catholick Subjects: that those of the Reformed Religion should be permitted to execute any Places or Offices, and enjoy any Dignities of what sort soever, without such distinction betwixt them and the rest of that Nation, as had been of late times observed: that in each Parliament of <hi>France</hi> a new Court should be presently erected, consisting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually of Judges and Officers of both Religions, and they to have the Cognizance of all Causes which concerned the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots:</hi> that all sentences past against the Admiral, the Count of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and the rest of that party, should be revoked and made null; and the eight cautionary Towns, being all places of great strength and consequence, should remain with the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi> till all these Articles were confirmed, and the Peace concluded.</p>
            <p n="38">38. The passing of this Edict gave great scandal to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick party, which thereupon was easily united by the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> into a common Bond or League for maintainance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Religion, apparently indangered by those large Indulgences; by the first Article whereof they bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the Establishment of the Law of God in its first Estate; to restore and settle his holy Service according to the Form

But in the midst of these devices, the Leaders of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> are again in Arms, under colour that the former Edict had not been observed; but in plain truth, upon a clear and manifest experience, that Peace was the ruine of their Party, and that they could not otherwise preserve their power then by open War. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> seizeth on <hi>La Fere</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> and the King of <hi>Navar</hi> makes himself Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster by strong hand on the City of <hi>Cahors</hi>; which draws the King again from his Meditations, under which must be covered his retirement from all publick business. But <hi>La Fere</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained from the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the sacking of <hi>Cahors</hi> was connived at, and the breach made up, that so the <hi>Hugonots</hi> might be tempted to consume their Forces in the Wars of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> to which they were invited by their Brethren of the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> Provinces, who had called in the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> against their King. And so long <hi>France</hi> remained in quiet, as that War continued. But when the Duke returned after two or three years, and that there was no hopes of his reverting to so great a charge;<note place="margin">1581.</note> the <hi>Hugonots</hi> wanting work abroad, were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with this occasion to break out at home. The Catholick League had now layn dormant for some years, none seeming more Zealous then the King in the Cause of <hi>Rome.</hi> But when it was considered by the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1584.</note> and the rest of the League, that the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> being dead, and the King without any hope of Issue, the Crown must fall at last to the King of <hi>Navar</hi>; it was resolved to try all means by which he might be totally excluded from the right of Succession. For what hope could they give themselves to preserve Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when the Crown should fall upon the head of an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, an Heretick relapsed, and therefore made uncapable of the Royal Dignity by the Canon-Laws? Of these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses and Designes of the <hi>Guisian</hi> Faction, the King of <hi>Navar</hi> takes speedy notice, and prepares accordingly, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it best to be before-hand, and not to be taken unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided when they should come.<note place="margin">1585.</note> And to that end, having first cleared himself by a Declaration from the crime of Heresie, and now particularly from being a relapsed Heretick, with many foul recriminations on the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> he

sends his Agents to sollicite the <hi>German</hi> Princes to come in to aid him against the oppressions of the League, which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aim at nothing but the ruine of the Realm of <hi>France:</hi> which so exasperated those of the <hi>Guisian</hi> Faction, that they prevailed by their Emissaries with Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, to Excommunicate the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and to declare them both uncapable of the Royal Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as relapsed Hereticks: Which he performed in open Consistory on the ninth of <hi>September</hi> 1585, and published the sentence by a special Bull within three dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

Which was in time the issue of the disputation, which afterwards was so hotly followed, between <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> on the one side, and Dr. <hi>Thomas Erastus,</hi> (whom <hi>Calvin</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth in his Epistle to <hi>Olerianus</hi>) Doctor of Physick, on the other; <hi>Beza</hi> evincing the necessity of Excommunication in the Church of Christ, and <hi>Erastus</hi> proving nothing to the contrary, but that Lay-elders were not necessary to the exercise of it. Which disputation lasted long, and effected little, managed on both sides in Printed Tractates; the last of which was that of <hi>Beza,</hi> first published at <hi>Geneva,</hi> reprinted afterwards at <hi>London, An.</hi> 1590. But in the mean time the <hi>Genevian</hi> Discipline was admitted in both <hi>Palatinates,</hi> the Country divided into Classes and Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal meetings; those Classes subdivided into their <hi>Presbyteries,</hi>

and each <hi>Presbytery</hi> furnished with a power of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and exercising such Church-censures as the Fact required. But then we are to know withal, that those wise Princes being loath to leave too much Authority in the hands of the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, with whose encroachments on the power of the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate they were well acquainted, appointed some Superiour Officers of their own nomination to sit as Chief amongst them, without whom nothing could be done; and they were sure that by them nothing would be done, which either might intrench upon their Authority, or their people's Liberty. A temperament for which they were beholden to the said <hi>Erastus,</hi> who being a Doctor of Physick (as before was noted) devised this <hi>Pill</hi> to <hi>purge Presbytery</hi> of some <hi>Popish humours,</hi> which secretly lay hid in the <hi>body</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The like alloy was mixed with the <hi>Genevian</hi> Discipline in the Churches of <hi>Hassia, Nassaw,</hi> and those other petite Estates and Signories, which make up the Confederacie of the <hi>Wetter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54836:53"/>
but also for departing from the Confession of <hi>Ausberge,</hi> which onely ought to be received within the bounds of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p n="5">5. First then, beginning with <hi>Vrsine,</hi> publick Professor for Divinity in the Chair of <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> he thus instructs us in his Commentary on the <hi>Palatine Catechism. Albeit</hi> (saith he) <hi>that wicked men sometimes bear Rule, and therefore are unworthy of honours; yet the Office is to be distinguished from their persons, and that the man whose vices are to be detested, ought to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured for his Office, as Gods Spiritual Ordinance:</hi> which is a truth so consonant to the Holy Scriptures, that nothing could be said more piously in so short a position. But then he gives us such a Gloss as corrupts the Text, telling us in the words next following, That <hi>since Superiours are to be honoured in respect of their Office, it is therefore manifest, that so far onely we must yeild obedience unto their commands, as they exceed not in the same the bounds of their Offices.</hi> Which plainly intimates, that if Princes be at any time transported beyond the bounds of their Offices, of which the people and their popular Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates are the onely Judges, the Subjects are not bound to yeild obedience unto their commands, under pretence that they are past beyond their bounds, and have no influence on the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but onely when they shine within the compass of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Spheres.</p>
            <p n="6">6. More plainly speaks <hi>Parcus,</hi> who succeeded him both in place and Doctrines; out of whose Commentary on the 13 Chapter of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions were extracted by some Delegates and Divines of <hi>Oxon,</hi> when the unsoundness of his Judgement in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar was questioned and condemned by that University. First then it was declared for a truth undoubted, <hi>That Bishops and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ministers or Pastors in the Church of Christ, both might and ought, with the consent of their several Churches, to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, or give over to the power of Satan, their Superiour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, for their impiety towards God, and their injustice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Subjects, if they continued in those errours after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, till they gave some manifest signs of their repentance.</hi> 2. <hi>That subjects being in the condition of meer private men, ought not without some lawful calling either to take arms to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault a Tyrant, before their own persons be indangered; or to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>end themselves though they be indangered, if by the ordinary Magistrates they may be defended from such force and violence.</hi> 2. <hi>That Subjects being in the condition of meer private men, may lawfully take Arms to defend themselves against a Tyrant, who violently shall break in upon them as a Thief or Ravisher, and expedite themselves from the present danger, as against a common Thief and Robber, when from the ordinary Magistrates there appeareth no defence or succour.</hi> 4. <hi>That such Subjects as are not meerly private men, but are placed in some inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54836:53"/>
may lawfully by force of Arms defend themselves, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, the Church and the true Religion, against the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and command of the Supreme Magistrate: These following conditions being observed, that is to say, if either the Supreme Magistrate become a Tyrant, practiseth to commit Idolatry, or blaspheme Gods Name; or that any great and notable injustice be offered to them, as that they cannot otherwise preserve their consciences and lives in safety: conditioned finally, that under colour of Religion, and a Zeal to Iustice, they do not rather seek their private ends then the publick good.</hi> And this last Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition being so agreeable to <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrines, he flourisheth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and inforceth with those words of <hi>Trajan,</hi> which before we cited out of <hi>Buchan,</hi> when he required the principal Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his Guard to use the Sword in his defence, if he governed well; but to turn the point thereof against him, if he did the contrary.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Building their practice on these Doctrines,<note place="margin">1567.</note> we finde the <hi>Palatine</hi> Princes very forward in aiding the French <hi>Hugonots</hi> against their King upon all occasions. In the first risings of that people, <hi>Monsieur d' Andelot</hi> was furnished with five thousand Horse, and four thousand Foot, most of them being of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Prince Elector, <hi>Anno</hi> 1562, when he had out newly entertained the thoughts of <hi>Zuinglianism,</hi> and had not fully settled the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines. But in the year 1566, when the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were upon the point of a second War, he joyns with others of the <hi>German</hi> Princes in a common Ambathe, by which the French King was to be desired, that the Preachers of the Reformed Religion might Preach both in <hi>Paris</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the Kingdom without control, and that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple freely might repair to hear them in what numbers they pleased. To which unseasonable demand, the King, though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally very Cholerick, made no other answer, then that he would preserve a friendship and affection for those Princes so long as they did not meddle in the Affairs of his Kingdom, as he did not meddle at all in their Estates After which, having somewhat recollected his Spirits, he subjoyned these words, with manifest shew of his displeasure, that it concerned him to sollicite their Princes to suffer the Catholicks to say Mass in all their Cities. With which nipping answer the Ambassadors being sent away, they were followed immediately at the heels by some of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots,</hi> who being Agents for the rest, prevailed with Prince <hi>Iohn Casimir</hi> the second Son of the Elector, to raise an Army in defence of the common Cause. To which purpose they had already furnished him with a small sum of money, assuring him that when he was come unto their Borders, they would pay down one hundred thousand Crowns more towards the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of his Army. Which promises perswading more then the greatest Rhetorick, excited him, with many Captains and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, who for the most part lived upon spoil and plunder,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54836:54"/>
to raise an Army of seven thousand Horse and four thousand Foot, with which they made foul work in <hi>France,</hi> wasting and spoiling all Countries wheresoever they came: for being joyned unto the rest of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> Army, they found them brought to such a poor and low condition, that they were not able to advance the least part of that sum which they had promised to provide against their coming.<note place="margin">1563.</note> Somewhat was raised by way of Contribution, to keep them in some present compliance; and for the rest, they were permitted to pay themselves in the spoil of the Country, especially Churches, Monasteries, and Religious Houses. But the Queen offering termes of Peace, none were more forward then these <hi>Germans</hi> to imbrace the offer, and <hi>Casimir</hi> more forward in it then all the rest.

To counterpoise which Potent Faction, the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and his Associates in that Cause implored the assistance of their Friends in <hi>Germany,</hi> but more particularly the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberge,</hi> the Count of <hi>Mombelliard,</hi> and the Protestant Cantons; who being much moved by the danger threatned unto their Religion, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully stirred up by <hi>Beza,</hi> who was active in it, began to raise the greatest Army that ever had been sent from thence to the aid of the <hi>Hugonots:</hi> And that the action might appear with some Face of Justice, it was thought fit to try what they could do towards an atonement, by sending their Ambassadors to the Court of <hi>France</hi> before they entred with their Forces. But the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador of Prince <hi>Casimir</hi> carried himself in that imployment with so little reverence, and did so plainly charge the King with the infringing of the Edicts of Pacification, that the King dismist them all with no small disdain; telling them roundly, that he would give any man the lye which should presume to tax him of the breach of his promise. This short dispatch hastned the coming in of the Army, compounded of twelve thousand <hi>German</hi> Horse, four thousand <hi>German</hi> Foot, sixteen thousand <hi>Switz,</hi> and about eight thousand <hi>French</hi> Auxiliaries which staid their coming on the Borders.

Nor did some other of the petty Princes speed much better in the success of this Affair; the Country of <hi>Montbelguard</hi> paying dearly for the Zeal of their Count, and almost wholly ruined by the Forces of the Duke of <hi>Guise. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> the last Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> of the House of <hi>Marke,</hi> had spent a great part of his time in the acquaintance of <hi>Beza,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became a constant follower of the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> by whom he was imployed in raising this great Army of <hi>Switz</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> and destined to a place of great Command and Conduct in it: Escaping with much difficulty in the day of the slaughter, he came by many unfrequented ways to the Town of <hi>Geneva</hi>; where, either spent with grief of minde, or toyl of body, he dyed soon after, leaving the Signory of <hi>Sedan</hi> to his Sister <hi>Charlot,</hi> and her to the disposing of the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var,</hi> who gave her in Marriage, not long after, to the Viscount <hi>Turenne</hi>; but he had first established <hi>Calvinism</hi> both for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Discipline in all the Towns of his Estate; in which they were afterwards confirmed by the Marriage of <hi>Henry De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latoure</hi> Viscount of <hi>Turenne,</hi> Soveraign of <hi>Sedan,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> by his former Wife, with one of the Daughters of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> a professed <hi>Calvinian</hi>; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of which House, by reason of the great Command which they had in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> prevailed so far on many of the Neighbouring Princes, that not onely the Counties of <hi>Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw</hi> and <hi>Hanaw,</hi> with the rest of the Confederacy of <hi>Vettera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> but a great part of <hi>Hassia</hi> also gave entertainment to those Doctrines, and received that Discipline, which hath given so much trouble to the rest of Christendom.

The <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces, subject in former times to the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and by descent from them to the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> are on all sides invironed with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> except toward the <hi>West,</hi> where they are parted by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current-Ocean from the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> with which they have maintained an ancient and wealthy Traffick. Being ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in the hands of several Princes, they fell at last by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny distinct Titles to the House of <hi>Burgundy</hi>; all of them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept five, united in the person of Duke <hi>Philip the good,</hi> and those five added to the rest by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth. From hence arose that difference which appears between them in their Laws and Customs, as well as in distinct and peculiar Priviledges; which rendred it a matter difficult, if not impossible, to mould them into one Estate, or to erect them into an absolute and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54836:56"/>
though it was divers times endeavoured by the Princes of it. The whole divided commonly into seventeen Provinces, most of them since they came into the power of the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> having their own proper and subordinate Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours accountable to their King, as their Lord in Chief, who had the sole disposal of them, and by them managed all Affairs both of War and Peace, according to their several and distinct capacities: All of them priviledged so far, as to secure them all (without a manifest violation of their Rights and Liberties) from the fear of Bondage. But none so amply priviledged as the Province of <hi>Brabant,</hi> to which it had been granted by some well-meaning, but weak Prince amongst them, that if their Prince or Duke (by which name they called him) should by strong hand attempt the violation of their ancient priviledges, the Peers and People might proceed to a new Election, and put themselves under the Clyentele or Patronage of some juster Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The whole Estate thus laid together, is reckoned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no more in compass then twelve hundred miles; but is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all so well planted, and extremely populous, that there are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered in that compass no fewer then three hundred and fifty Cities, and great Towns equal unto Cities; besides six thousand and three hundred Villages of name and note, (some of them equal to great Towns) not taking in the smaller Dorps, and inferiour Hamlets. But amongst all the Cities and great Towns, there were but four which anciently were honoured with Episcopal Sees, that is to say, the Cities of <hi>Vtrecht, Cambray, Tournay,</hi> and <hi>Arras</hi>; and of these four, they onely of <hi>Arras</hi> and <hi>Tournay</hi> were naturally sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Princes of the House of <hi>Burgundy</hi>; the Bishop of <hi>Cambray</hi> being anciently a Prince of the Empire, and <hi>Vtrecht</hi> not made subject to them till the Government of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth. Which paucity of the Episcopal Sees in so large a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, subjected some of the Provinces to the Bishops of <hi>Leige,</hi> some to the jurisdiction of the Archbishops of <hi>Rheims</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and others under the Authority of the Bishops of <hi>Munster.</hi> Of which the first were in some sort under the Protection of the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the three last absolute and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, not owing any suite or Service at all unto them. By means whereof, concernments of Religion were not looked into with so strict an eye, as where the Bishops are accomptable to the Prince for their Administration, or more united with and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves in the publick Government. The inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience whereof being well observed by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, he practised with the Pope then being, for increasing the number of the Bishopricks, reducing them under Archbishops of their own, and Modeling the Ecclesiastical Politie under such a Form, as might enable them to exercise all manner of spiritual juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction within themselves, without recourse to any Forreign Power or Prelate but the Pope himself. Which being first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed

by him, was afterwards effected by King <hi>Philip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, though the event proved contrary to his expectation. For this enlargement of the number of the Sees Episcopal, being projected onely for the better keeping of the Peace and Unity of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, became unhappily the occasion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tumults and Disorders in the Civil State, which drew on the defection of a great part of the Country from that Kings obedience.</p>
            <p n="14">14. For so it was, that the Reformed Religion being enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> did quickly finde an entrance also into such of the Provinces as lay nearest to them; where it found people of all sorts sufficiently ready to receive it. To the increase whereof the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> himself gave no small advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, by bringing in so many of the <hi>Switz</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Souldiers to maintain his Power, either in awing his own Subjects, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>French,</hi> by which last he was frequently invaded in the bordering Provinces. Nor was Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (though she meant it not) to the increasing of their numbers. For whereas many of the Natives of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> who were affected zealously to the Reformation, had put themselves for Sanctuary into <hi>England</hi> in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi>; they were all banished by Proclamation in the first year of her Reign. Many of which not daring to return to their several Countries, dispersed themselves in most of the good Towns of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces (especially in such as lay most neer unto the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>a) where they could best provide themselves of a poor subsistance. By means whereof, the Doctrine of the Protestant and Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches began to get much ground upon them; to which the continual intercourses which they had with <hi>England,</hi> gave every day such great and manifest advantage, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was fain to bethink himself of some proper means for the suppressing of the inconveniences which might follow on it. And means more proper he found none in the whole course of Government, then to increase the number of the former Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, to re-inforce some former Edicts which he made against them, and to bring in the <hi>Spanish Inquisition,</hi> which he establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and confirmed by another Edict bearing date <hi>April</hi> 20. 1548. Which notwithstanding, the Professors of that Doctrine, though restrained a while, could not be totally suppressed; some Preachers out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and others out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> promoting underhand those Tenents, and introducing those opinions, which openly they durst not own in those dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous times. But when the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> had resigned the Government, and that King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, upon some urgent Reasons of State had retired to <hi>Spain,</hi> and left the Chief Command of his <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces to the Dutchess of <hi>Parma,</hi> they then began to shew themselves with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confidence, and gained some great ones to their side, whom discontent by reason of the disappointment of their

Amongst the great ones of which time, there was none more considerable for Power and Patrimony, then <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> invested by a long descent of Noble Ancestors in the County of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> a fair and goodly Territory in the Higher <hi>Germany</hi>; possest of many good Towns and ample Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nories in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> derived upon him from <hi>Mary</hi> Daughter and Heir of <hi>Philip</hi> Lord of <hi>Breda,</hi> &amp;c. his great Grand-fathers Grand-mother; and finally, enriched with the Principality of <hi>Orange</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> accruing to him by the death of his Cozen <hi>Rene</hi>; which gave him a precedencie before all other <hi>Belgick</hi> Lords in the Court of <hi>Brussels.</hi> By which advantages, but more by his abilities both for Camp and Counsel, he became great in favour with the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi>; by whom he was made Governour of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> Knight of the Order of the Fleece; imployed in many Ambassies of weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and trusted with his dearest and most secret purposes. For Rivals in the Glory of Arms, he had the Counts of <hi>Horne</hi> and <hi>Egmond,</hi> men of great Prowess in the Field, and alike able at all times to Command and Execute. But they were men of open hearts, not practised in the Arts of Subtilty and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, and wanted much of that dexterity and cunning which the other had for working into the affections of all sorts of people. Being advanced unto this eminencie in the Court, and knowing his own strength as well amongst the Souldiers as the common people, he promised to himself the Supreme Government of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces on the Kings returning into <hi>Spain.</hi> The disappointment of which hope, obliterated the remembrance of all former favours, and spurred him on to make himself the Head of the Protestant party, by whose as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance he conceived no small possibility of raising the <hi>Nasso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> Family to as great an height as his ambition could aspire to.</p>

King <hi>Philip</hi> at his going for <hi>Spain,</hi> had left three thousand Spanish Souldiers (the onely remainder of those great Armies which had served his Father and himself against the <hi>French</hi>) in Garrison upon the Borders, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of shutting up the back-door against the <hi>French,</hi> but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought to be left of purpose for a curb to the Natives, in case of refractoriness or opposition unto his Commands. They must be first removed, and the Country cleared of all such rubs as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would have made the way less passable unto private ends. For though the King had put those Souldiers under the Command of two Lords of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> that is to say, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> himself, and the Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> that they might rather seem to be the natural <hi>Militia</hi> of the Country, then a power of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; yet that device did little edifie amongst them: for the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54836:58"/>
two Lords, especially the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> expressed such contentment in the trust and honour which was therein conferred upon them, that they excited the whole Country both to move the King before his going, and the Governess after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to dismiss those Souldiers which could not be imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them without breach of their Priviledges. To this request the King had given a gratious answer, and promised to remove them within four months after his going into <hi>Spain</hi>; but secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave order to the Lady Regent to retain them longer, till the new Bishops and the <hi>Inquisition</hi> were confirmed amongst them.

But being wearied in the end by the importunity of all sorts of people, counselled by her Husband the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to give way unto it, and authorized at last by the King himself to hearken unto their desires; she gives order to have them drawn out of their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Garrisons, and Shipt at <hi>Flushing</hi>; from thence to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported into <hi>Spain</hi> with the first fair winde.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The easie removing of this rub, incouraged those who managed the designe for innovating in the Church and State, to make the like attempt against the Cardinal <hi>Granvel</hi>; whose extraordinary parts and power they were more affraid of, then of all the Spaniards in the Country.

And unto these he added such a moderation in his pleasures, such abstinence both from food and sleep when the case required it, such extraordinary pains in accommodating all the difficulties which came before him, and such a diligent observance of his Princes motions, that his greatest Adversaries could not chuse but say, that he was a Jewel, fit to be owned by none but the greatest Kings. By means

The like Authority he held with the Dutchess of <hi>Parma,</hi> not onely out of that report which the King made of him, but her own election, who found his counsel so applyable to all occasions, that seldom any private or publick business came in agitation, in which his judgement had not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viously required, before it was openly delivered. And though his previous resolutions in matters of counsel, were carried with all imaginable care and closeness from the eyes of the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; yet no man doubted but that all Affairs were t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But when they found that his Authority increased, that all things bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that point at which he aimed, and that some of the Nobility began to apply themselves unto him, and became his Creatures; they then conceived it necessary to make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, for fear of being brought to the like submissions. First therefore they began to clash with him at the Councel-Table, and to dissent from many things which he appeared in, though otherwise of great advantage in themselves to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service.

From hence it was, that such as did pretend to any licentiousness in Life or Doctrine, exclaimed against him as the Author of those severities wherewith the King had formerly proceeded against divers of them; as on the other side, they cryed up all the Lords which appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54836:59"/>
him, as the chief Patriots of the Country, the Principal Patrons and Assertors of the publick Liberty.</p>
            <p n="20">20. The people being thus corrupted, it was no hard matter for the Lords to advance the Project, in rendring <hi>Granvel</hi> as unpleasing in the eyes of the King, as they had made him odious in the sight of the people. In order whereunto, some of them shewed themselves less careful of the Cause of Religion, by smothering the publication of his Majesties Edicts which concerned the Church in the Provinces under their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Others dealt under-hand with the common people, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading them not to yeild submission to those new Tribunals, which onely served for the exercise of superstition, and the Popes Authority. And some again connived at the growth of Heresie (by which name they called it) by suffering the maintainers of those new opinions to get ground amongst them; encouraged secretly some seditious practices; and finally omitted nothing, by which the King might understand by a sad experiment how much he had misplaced his favours, and to what imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he exposed the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> by putting such Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them in the hands of a Forreigner. Of all which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices the Cardinal was too intelligent, and had too many Friends abroad to be kept in ignorance; which made him carry a more vigilant eye upon their designes, to cross their Counsels, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude their Artifices, when any thing was offered to the prejudice of the publick Peace: but in the end, the importunity of his Adversaries became so violent, and the breach had such a face of danger in the fight of the Governess, that she moved the King for his dismission; to prevent which, he first retired into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Rome</hi>; preferred not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be Vice-Roy of the Realm of <hi>Naples</hi>; and finally, made President of the Council for <hi>Italy</hi> in the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">21. In the mean time the <hi>Calvinists</hi> began to try their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in those Provinces which lay next to <hi>France,</hi> by setting up two of their Preachers on the same day in two great Cities, <hi>Valenciennes</hi> the chief City of <hi>Haynalt,</hi> and <hi>Tournay</hi> the chief City of <hi>Flanders Gallicant:</hi> In the first of which, the Preacher having finished in the Market-place where he made his Sermon, was followed in the Streets by no fewer then one hundred peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but in the other, by a train of six hundred, or thereabouts, all of them singing <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms of <hi>Marots</hi> Translation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the custom of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> amongst the <hi>French.</hi> Some tumults hereupon ensued in either City; for the repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing whereof, <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Momorancy</hi> Lord of <hi>Montigny,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Governour of that Province, rides in post to <hi>Tournay,</hi> hangs up the Preacher, seizeth on all such Books as were thought Heretical, and thereby put an end to the present Sedition. But when the Marquess of <hi>Bergen</hi> was required to do the like at <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> he told the Governess in plain terms, that it was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54836:59"/>
neither agreeable to his place or nature to put an Heretick to death. All that he did was the committing of two of their Preachers to the common Prison; and that being done, he made a journey unto <hi>Leige</hi> to decline and business: Which so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the <hi>Calvinian</hi> party to proceed in their purposes, that they threatned mischief to the Judges, if any harm happened to the Prisoners. But sentence at the seven months end being past upon them to be burnt, and all things being made ready for the execution, the Prisoners brought unto the Stake, and the sire ready to be kindled, there presently arose a tumult so fierce and violent, that the Officers were compelled to take back their Prisoners, and to provide for their own safety, for fear of being stoned to death by the furious multitude. But the people ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once begun, would not so give over; for being inflamed by one of their company, whom they had set up in the midst of the Market-place to preach an extemporary Sermon, two thousand of them ran tumultuously to the common Goal, force open the doors, knock off the Shackles of the Prisoners, restore them to their former Liberty, and so disperse themselves to their several dwellings. The news of which Sedition being brought to <hi>Brussels,</hi> the Governess dispatcheth certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Foot, and some Troopes of Horse, with order to the Marquess of <hi>Bergen</hi> to appease the disorders in the Town. But they found all things there so quiet, that there was little need of any other Sword then the Sword of Justice; by which some of the chief Ring-leaders of the Tumult, and one of their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers (who had unhappily fallen into their hands) were sentenced to that punishment which they had deserved.</p>
            <p n="22">22. The <hi>Calvinists</hi> conceiving by this woful experiment, that it was not safe jesting with Edged-tools, and that they were not of sufficient power for so great a business, betook themselves to other courses. And finding that some of the principal Lords were much offended at the exorbitant power of <hi>Granvel,</hi> that others shewed no good affection to his Majesties Government, and that the rest had no desire to see the new Bishops setled in their several Sees, for fear of being over-powered by them in all publick Councils; they seriously applyed themselves to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment those discords, and make the rupture greater then at first it was. The new Bishops being fourteen in number, were in themselves so eminent in point of Learning, and of a conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so unblameable in the eyes of all men, that malice it self could make no just exception against the persons: A quarrel therefore must be picked against the Form and Manner of their indowment, which was by founding them in such wealthy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries as were best able to maintain them; the Patrimony which anciently was allotted to the use of the Abbot, being to be inverted (after the death of the incumbent) to the use of the Bishop. This was presented to the Monks as a great disfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisement, a plain devesting of them of their Native Priviledges;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54836:60"/>
not onely by depriving them of the choice of their Governour, but by placing over them an imperious Lord instead of an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Father. The Magistrates and people of such of the Cities as were designed for the Sees of the several Bishops, were pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised on to protest against their admission; by whose establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the common people must be subject to more Masters then before they were, and the Magistrates must grow less in power and reputation then they had been formerly. They represented to the Merchants, that without liberty of Conscience it was not possible there could be liberty of Trade; the want whereof must needs bring with it their impoverishing, a sensible decay of all sorts of Manufactures; and consequently, an exposing of the common people to extremest beggery. Which consideration, as appeared soon after, was alone sufficient, not onely to ingage the Merchants, but to draw after them that huge rabble of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical people (which commonly make up the greatest part of all populous Cities) that depended on them. But nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleased the discontented Nobility, then their Invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Granvel,</hi> against whom, and such of the Court-Lords as adhered unto him, they fastened their most scandalous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Libels upon every post; not sparing through his sides to wound the honour of the King, and reproach the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which by this means they made distasteful to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon subjects.</p>

By these devices, and some others of like dangerous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they gained not onely many of the common people, but divers of the greatest Lords; some also of the principal Cities, and not a few of the <hi>Regulars,</hi> or Monastick Clergy. By means whereof, their Friends and Factors grew so powerful, as to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such motions both in Court and Council, as tended to the prejudice of the Reformation; insomuch, that when King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> had given order to the Dutchess of <hi>Parma</hi> to send two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the fire being sooner quenched then he had imagined, both he and his Accomplices, which were nine in number, were brought unto the place of Execution, and there justly suffered; the Priest himself declaiming bitterly against <hi>Calvin</hi> at his Execution, and charging all his sufferings upon
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54836:60"/>
upon that account. At <hi>Antwerp</hi> one <hi>Fabricius,</hi> once a <hi>Carmelite</hi> Fryar, but now a great promoter of <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrines, had gained much people to that side; for which being apprehended, he had judgement of death. But being brought unto the Stake, such a shower of Stones was seen to fall upon the head of the Hang-man, that not daring to abide the storm till the fire had done, he drew his Sword and sheathed it in the Prisoners body, and after saved himself by seeming to make one in the Tumult. And the next day they caused some Verses writ in bloud to be posted up, in which was signified, that there were some in <hi>Antwerp</hi> who had vowed revenge for the death of <hi>Fabricius</hi>; though afterwards they surceased, upon the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of one of the Mutineers, and entertained more sober and religious counsels. But the distemper seemed much greater in the Town of <hi>Bruges,</hi> where the Inquisitors Deputy had sent a man to prison, on a suspition of Heresie, with a Guard of three Officers to attend him; at which the Senate was so moved, that they commanded the Officers to be seized upon, to be committed close prisoners, and to be fed with nothing but bread and water; the party in the mean time being set at liberty.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Startled with Tumult after Tumult,<note place="margin">1565.</note> but more with the unhandsome carriage of the Senate of <hi>Bruges</hi>; the King gives order to his Sister the Lady Governess, to see his Fathers E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts severely executed, and more particularly to take special care that the Decrees and Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> be presently received and obeyed in all the Provinces: Against which Orders of the King, though many of the great Lords opposed at the Council-Table, yet the Governess carried it at the last. And thereupon the opposite party incensed the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banters</hi> against admitting the Edicts or the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Council, as tending manifestly to the violation of their ancient privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: At which though most of them took fire, yet it burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but slowly, proceeding onely at the first in the way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance, which for the most part carried more smoke then flame. But after the Ministers and Agents of <hi>Lodowick</hi> Count of <hi>Nassaw</hi> (one of the younger brothers of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>) were returned from <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> there appeared a kinde of new spirit amongst the people. He had before with certain other Noble-men of his age and quality betook himself unto <hi>Geneva,</hi> either for curiosity or study, or for some worse purpose, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrought upon by the <hi>Calvinians</hi> which conversed with them, and finding their own people to be very inquisitive after new opinions, they were not sparing in the commendation of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they found exercised in that City, and seemed to wish for nothing more then that they might have liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to profess the same. But knowing that so great a business could not be carried on successfully but by force of Arms, he had his Agents in the Court of the Prince El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ctor for getting some
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54836:61"/>
assistance, if it came to blows, or under colour of his name to awe the Governess. And it fell out according unto his desire: for hereupon the party animated with new hopes, renewed their former course of libelling against the present Government with greater acrimony then before, dispersing no fewer then five thousand of those scandalous Pamphlets within the compass of a year, by which the people were exasperated and fitted for engaging in any action, which by the cunning of their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the insinuations of their Preachers, should be offered to them.</p>
            <p n="25">25. But these were onely the preparatives to the following Tumults; for in the middle of these heats, nine of the Lords not being Officers of State, convened together at <hi>Breda,</hi> the principal Seat and most assured hold of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> where they drew up a Form of an <hi>Association,</hi> which they called the <hi>Covenant,</hi> contrived by <hi>Philip Marnixius</hi> Lord of <hi>Aldegand,</hi> a great admirer of the person and parts of <hi>Calvin.</hi> In the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whereof they inveighed bitterly against the Inquisition, as that which being contrary to all Laws both Divine and Humane, did far exceed the cruelty of all former Tyrants: they then declared in the name of themselves and the rest of the Lords, that the care of Religion appertained to them as Councellors born, and that they entred into this Association for no other reason, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the wicked practices of such men, as under colour of the sentences of death and banishment, aimed at the Fortunes and destructions of the greatest persons: that therefore they had taken an holy Oath not to suffer the said Inquisition to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon their Country: praying therein, that as well God as man would utterly forsake them, if ever they forsook their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or failed to assist their Brethren which suffered any thing in that Cause; and finally, calling God to witness, that by this Covenant and Agreement amongst themselves, they intended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Glory of God, Honour of their King, and their Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries peace. And to this Covenant as they subscribed before their parting, so by their Emissaries they obtained subscription to it over all their Provinces; and for the credit of the business, they caused the same to be translated into several Languages, and published a Report that not onely the Chief Leaders of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> but many of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> had subscribed it also: which whether it were true or not, certain it is, that the Confederacie was subscribed by a considerable number of the Nobility, some of the Lords of the Privy-Council, and not a few of the Companions of the Golden Fleece.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Of the nine which first appeared in the designe, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal were <hi>Henry</hi> Lord of <hi>Brederode,</hi> descended lineally from <hi>Sigefride,</hi> the second Son of <hi>Arnold,</hi> the fourth Earl of <hi>Holland</hi>; Count <hi>Lodowick</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi> before mentioned; and <hi>Florence</hi> Count of <hi>Culemberg,</hi> a Town of <hi>Gueldres,</hi> but anciently priviledged
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54836:61"/>
from all subjection to the Duke thereof. Accompanied with two hundred of the principal Covenanters, each of them having a case of Pistols at his Saddle-bow, <hi>Brederode</hi> enters <hi>Brussels</hi> in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> to which he is welcomed by Count <hi>Horne</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> which last had openly appeared for them at the Council-Table, when the unlawfulness of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy was in agitation. And having taken up their Lodging in <hi>Culemberg</hi>-house, they did not onely once again subscribe the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but bound themselves to stand to one another by a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oath. The tenour of which Oath was to this effect, That if any of them should be imprisoned, either for Religion or for the Covenant, immediately the rest all other business laid aside, should take up arms for his assistance and defence. Marching the next day by two and two till they came to the Court, they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their petition to the Lady Regent, by the hands of <hi>Brederode,</hi> who desired her in a short Speech at the tendry of it, to believe that they were honest men, and propounded nothing to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but obedience to the Laws, Honour to the King, and safety to their Country. The sum of the Petition was, That the Spanish Inquisition might be abolished, the Emperours Edicts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, and new ones made by the advice of the Estates of the Countries. Concerning which we are to know, that the Emperour had past several Edicts against the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the first of which was published in the year 1521, and the second about five years after, <hi>Anno</hi> 1526, by means whereof many well-meaning people had been burnt for Hereticks: but that which most extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gaulled them, was the Edict for the bringing in of the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> published upon the 29 of <hi>April</hi> as before was said. Against these Edicts they complained in the said Petition. To which upon the morrow she returned such an answer by the consent of the Council, as might give them good hopes that the Inquisition should be taken away, and the Edicts moderated; but that the King must first be made acquainted with all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars before they passed into an Act. With which answer they returned well satisfied unto <hi>Culemberg-house,</hi> which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the entertainment of the chief Confederates.</p>
            <p n="27">27. To this House <hi>Brederode</hi> invites the rest of his Company, bestows a prodigal Feast upon them; and in the middle of their Cups it was put to the question, by what name their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie should be called. Those of their party in <hi>France</hi> were differenced from the rest by the name of <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (much about that time) by the name of <hi>Puritans</hi>; nor was it to be thought but that their followers might be as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of some proper and peculiar appellation, as in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England.</hi> It happened that at such time as they came to tender their Petition, the Governess seemed troubled at so great a number, and that Count <hi>Barlamont</hi> (a man of most approved fidelity to his Majesties service) advised her not to be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at it; telling her in the <hi>French</hi> tongue betwixt jest and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54836:62"/>
earnest, that they were but <hi>Gueux</hi> (or <hi>Gheuses,</hi> as the Dutch pronounced it) that is to say, men of dissolute lives and broken fortunes, or in plain English <hi>Rogues</hi> and <hi>Beggars.</hi> Upon which ground they animated one another by the name of <hi>Gheuses,</hi> and calling for great bowls of Wine, drank an health to the name; their Servants and Attendants crying out with loud acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Vive les Gueus,</hi> long live the <hi>Gheuses.</hi> For the confirming of which name, <hi>Brederode</hi> takes a Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>let which he spyed in the place, and laid it on one of his Shoulders as their Beggars do, and out of a Wooden dish brim-full drinks to all the Company; thanks them for following him that day with such unanimity, and binds himself upon his honour to spend his life, if need should be, for the generality of the Confederates, and for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member of them in particular: Which done, he gave his Dish and Wallet to the next unto him, who in like manner past it round, till they had bound themselves by this ridiculous Form of initiation to stand to one another in defence of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; the former acclamation of <hi>Long live the Gheuses,</hi> being doubled and redoubled at every Health. The jollity and loud acclamations which they made in the House, brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> and Count <hi>Horne,</hi> men of most Power and Reputation with the common people; who seemed so far from reprehending the debauchery which they found amongst them, that they rather countenanced the same; the former Healths and Acclamations being renewed and followed with more heat and drunken bravery then they were a first: on which incouragement they take upon themselves in earnest the name of <hi>Gheuses,</hi> and by that name were solemnly proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that Raskal Rabble at their coming out; which name being taken thus upon them, as the mark of their Faction, was afterwards communicated to all those of the same Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Returning to their several dwellings, they caused a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous report to be spread abroad, not onely that they had obtained a suspension of the Emperours Edicts, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the power of the Inquisition; but that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of the Order of the Golden Fleece, being men of most Authority both in Court and Council, had declared for them in the Cause. To gain belief to which report, a false and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit paper is dispersed amongst them, in which it was notified to all that should read the same, that the Lords and Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Fleece had sworn by their Order to the Gentlemen chosen by the Estates of the Country, to present the desires of the people to the Lady Regent, <hi>That from thenceforth the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Inquisitors and other Magistrates should punish no man for his Religion, neither by imprisonment, exile, or death, unless it were joyned with a popular tumult, and the publick ruine of their Country; of which the Covenanters themselves were to be the Iudges.</hi> And though the Governess took the wisest
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54836:62"/>
and most speedy course both to discover and proclaim the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of so lewd a practice, and used all honest ways for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiving of the people in that Particular; yet either she ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained no credit to her <hi>Anti-Remonstrances,</hi> or found the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome too far spread for so weak an Antidote. For present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the scattering and dispersing of the said Declaration, as many of the Reformed parties as had fled the Country, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again unto their Houses; and such as had concealed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or otherwise dissembled their Religion, began more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently to a vow the profession of it. For whose incouragement and increase, there was no want of diligence in such of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters as resorted to them out of <hi>France</hi>; first preaching to them in the Fields, and afterwards in some of their open Towns; but every where bitterly inveighing against the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Pope, the pride of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the corruptions of the Clergy; but most especially of the Bishops, whom they chiefly aimed at. By these invectives, and their continual preaching up of a popular liberty, their followers so exceedingly increased in a very short time, that in the Fields near the Citie of <hi>To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> there were seen no fewer then eight thousand persons at a Sermon; a greater multitude then that in the Fields near <hi>Lisles,</hi> and sometimes more then double that number in the fields near <hi>Antwerp.</hi> But in such Parts and Provinces as lay nearest <hi>France,</hi> they took greater liberty, and fell from Preaching to the Ministration of the Sacraments and Sacramentals; Marrying some, and Baptizing others, according to the Form devised by <hi>Calvin</hi>; but <hi>Sanctifying</hi> all by a continual intermixture of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms, translated into French Meter as before was said.</p>
            <p>Together with these <hi>French</hi> Preachers and <hi>Calvinian</hi> Ministers, there entred several Emissaries sent from the Admiral <hi>Colligni,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and others of the Heads of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whose interest it was to imbroyl the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> that they themselves might fear no such danger on that side, as formerly they had received. And these men play'd their parts so well, that a confused Rabble of the common people, furnished with Staves, Hatchets, Hammers and Ropes, and armed with some few Swords and Muskets, upon the Eve of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, fell violently into the Towns and Villages about St. <hi>Omers,</hi> one of the chief Cities of <hi>Artois,</hi> forced open all the Doors of Churches and Religious Houses, if they found them shut; demolished all the Altars, and defaced the Shrines, and broke the Images in pieces, not sparing any thing which in the Piety of their Ancestors was accounted sacred. Encouraged by which good success, they drive on to <hi>Ipres,</hi> a Town of <hi>Flanders,</hi> where they were sure to finde a party prepared for them, by which the Gates of the City were set open to give them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance: no sooner were they entred, but they went directly to the Cathedral, (their multitudes being much increased all the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54836:63"/>
way they came) where presently they fell to work; some beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Images with Staves and Hammers, some pulling down the <hi>Statues</hi> of our Saviour with Ropes and Ladders; other defacing Pulpits, Altars, and the Sacred Ornaments, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Books, and stealing the Consecrated Plate. With the same fury they proceeded to the burning of the Bishops Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the destroying of all Churches and Religious Houses within that City; in which they found as little opposition from the hands of that Magistrate, as if they had been hired and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that service by the Common Council. About the same time, that is to say, on the morrow after the Assumption, another party being of the same affections, and taking both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and encouragement from this impunity, fall into <hi>Menim, Commines, Vervich,</hi> and other Towns upon the <hi>Lys:</hi> In all which they committed the like impious out-rages, carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with them Plate and Vestments, and all other consecrated things which were easily portable; but burning or destroying what they could not carry. The like they would have done also at the Town of <hi>Seclin,</hi> but that the people rose in Arms, assaulted them, and drove them back, not without great slaughter of that mutinous and seditious Rabble, and some loss of themselves.</p>
            <p n="30">30. In <hi>Antwerp</hi> the chief City of <hi>Brabant</hi> they found better Fortune. They had before attained to so great a confidence, that having assembled in the Fields to hear a Sermon accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their usual custom, and finding their number to amount unto fifteen thousand; they mounted their Preacher on a Horse, and brought him triumphantly into the City, attended by a strong Guard both of Horse and Foot, to the great terrour and affrightment of the principal Magistrates. For remedy of which disorders, the Governess sent thither the Count of <hi>Megen,</hi> and afterwards the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with some slender Forces; on the approaching of which last (for the first was presently recalled, as a man less popular) infinite multitudes of the people went out to meet him; entertained him with the accustomed acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Vive les Gueux,</hi> and cryed him up for the great Patron and Protector of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Liberty. At which though he seemed outwardly to be somewhat offended, yet it was easie to be seen that he received a secret contentment in it; and therefore acted nothing whilst he stayed amongst them, by which he might become less gracious in the eye of that Faction then he was before. Encouraged by which remisness, and being privately excited by some of his Followers, they abate little or nothing of their former insolencies, which they discovered not long after his departure to the Court of <hi>Brussels,</hi> by their violent disturbance of a solemn Procession made by the Clergy of that City, in honour of their supposed Patroness the Blessed Virgin; and that too on the very Festival of her Assumption, when the like outrages were committed in other places: For not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54836:63"/>
content to jeer and taunt them in the Streets as they passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, they follow them into the principal Church of that City; where first they fall to words, and from words to blows, and from blows to wounds; to the great scandal of Religion, and the unpardonable prophanation of that holy Place.</p>
            <p n="31">31. But this was onely an Essay of the following mischief. For on the same day Sennight, being not onely more numerous, but better armed, they flocked to the same Church at the Evening-Service; which being ended, they compel the people to forsake the place, and possess themselves of it. Having made fast the Doors for fear that some disturbance might break in upon them, one of them begins to sing a Psalm in <hi>Marots</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein he is followed by the rest; that such a holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise as they were resolved on, might not be undertook without some preparation: which fit of Devotion being over, they first pulled down a massie Image of the Virgin, afterwards the Image of Christ, and such other Saints as they found advanced there, on their several <hi>Pedestals</hi>; some of them treading them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, some thrusting Swords into their sides, and others hagling of their Heads with Bills and Axes: In which work as many were imployed in most parts of the Church, so others got upon the Altars, cast down the sacred Plate, defaced the Pictures, and disfigured the paintings on the Walls, whilst some with Ladders climbed the Organs, which they broke in pieces; and others with like horrible violence, destroyed the Images in the Windows, or rather brake the Windows in despight of the Images. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated Host they took out of the Pixes, and trampled under their feet; carouse such Wine as they brought with them in the sacred Chalices, and greased their shooes with that Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, or anoynting Oyl, which was prepared for some Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to be used at Baptism, and in the visiting of the sick. And this they did with such dispatch, that one of the fairest Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> richly adorned with Statues and massie Images of Brass and Marble, and having in it no fewer then seventy Altars, was in the space of four hours defaced so miserably, that there was nothing to be seen in it of the former beauties. Proud of which fortunate success, they brake into all other Churches of that City, where they acted over the same spoils and outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous insolencies; and afterwards forcing open the doors of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries and Religious Houses, they carryed away all their Consecrated Furniture, entred their Store-houses, seized on their Meat, and drank off their Wine; and took from them all their Money, Plate, and Wardrobes, both Sacred and Civil, not sparing any publick Library wheresoever they came: a ruine not to be repaired but with infinite sums: the havock which they made in the great Church onely, being valued at four hundred thousand Ducates by indifferent rates. The like out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages they committed at the same time in <hi>Gaunt</hi> and <hi>Oudenard,</hi> and all the Villages about them; the severalties whereof would
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54836:64"/>
make up a Volume: let it suffice, that in the Province of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> onely, no fewer then four hundred Consecrated places were in the space of ten days thus defaced, and some of them burnt down to the very ground.</p>
            <p n="32">32. The news of these intolerable outrages being posted one after another to the Court at <hi>Brussels,</hi> occasioned the Governess (when it was too late) to see her errour in sending back her Spanish Souldiers, and yeilding to the improvident dismission of the prudent Cardinal, by whose Authority and Counsel she had so happily preserved those Provinces in peace and quiet; and then she found that she had good reason to believe all the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> gave her, touching a plot of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> party in <hi>France</hi> (from whence came most of these new Preachers) to imbroyl the <hi>Netherlands</hi>; which till that time she looked on as a groundless jealousie. But as it is in some Diseases, that when they are easie to be cured, they are hard to be known; and when they are easie to be known, they are hard to be cured: so fared it at that time with these distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces; which now were grown unto that height, that it was very difficult, if not almost impossible, to finde out a remedy. For having called together the great Council of State, and acquainted them with the particulars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remembred, she found the Counts of <hi>Mansfield, Aremberg,</hi> and <hi>Barlamont,</hi> cheerfully offering their assistance to reduce the people to obedience by force of Arms; but <hi>Egmont, Horne</hi> and <hi>Orange,</hi> (whose Brother Count <hi>Lodowick</hi> was suspected for a chief contriver of the present mischief) of a contrary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so that she could proceed no further; and indeed she durst not; for presently a secret Rumour was dispersed, that if she did not so far gratifie the Covenanters and their adherents, that every man might have liberty to go to Sermons, and no man be punished for Religion, she should immediately see all the Churches in <hi>Brussels</hi> fired, the Priests murthered, and her self imprisoned. For fear whereof, though she took all safe courses for her own security, yet she found none so safe as the granting of some of their demands to the Chief Conspirators, by which the Provinces for the present did enjoy some quiet. But this was onely like an Intermission in the fit of an Ague: For presently hereupon she received advertisement that those of the Reformed party were not onely suffered to take unto themselves some Churches in <hi>Machlin, Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Tournay,</hi> which till then had never been permitted; but that at <hi>Vtrecht</hi> they had driven the Catholicks out of their Churches, and at the <hi>Bosch</hi> had forced the Bishop to forsake the City, as their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers in <hi>Geneva</hi> had done before them. And in a word, to make up the measure of her sorrows, and compleat their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies, she had intelligence of the like Tumult raised at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> where some of the Reforming Rabble had broken into a Monastery of the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> defaced all Consecrated
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54836:64"/>
things, beat and stoned out the Religious persons, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wounding some of the principal Senators who opposed their doings.</p>
            <p n="33">33. Provoked with these indignities, she resolves upon the last remedy, which was, to bring them to obedience by force of Arms: and therein she had no small encouragement from the King himself, and good assurance of assistances from such Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> as still adhered unto the Pope. The news where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of so start<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es the chief of the Covenanters, that they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to consultation of Electing a new Prince, or putting themselves under the power of some potent Monarch, by whom they might be countenanced against their King, and priviledged in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their Religion. It was advised also, that three thousand Books of <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrine should be sent into <hi>Spain,</hi> and dispersed in the chief Cities of it; to the end, that whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st the King was busied in looking to his own peace at home, he might the less regard the Tumults which were raised in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands:</hi> and yet for fear that Project might not take effect, it was agreed upon that a combination should be made between the heads of the Covenanters, and the principal Merchants; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom it was finally concluded, and the conclusion ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by a solemn taking of the Sacrament on either side, that the Covenanters should protect the Merchants against all men whatsoever, who laboured to restrain them in the freedom of Conscience; and that the Merchants should supply the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters with such sums of money as might enable them to go through with the Work begun. It also was agreed upon, that the <hi>Calvinian</hi> party for a time should suppress their own, and make profession of conformity to the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Confession of <hi>Ausberg,</hi> in hope thereby of having succour and relief from the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Princes, if the King should seek to force them in the way of Arms: which was accordingly performed. And that being done, they cast themselves into a separate and distinct Republick from that of the State, erect a Supreme Consistory in the City of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and some inferiour Judicatories in the other Cities, (but all subordinate unto that of <hi>Antwerp</hi>) in which they take upon them the choice of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, for managing and directing all Affairs which concerned the Faction.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Of all these Plots and Consultations, the King is punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally informed by the vigilant Governess; and thereupon caused a report to be dispersed, that he intended to bestow a Royal vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit on his <hi>Belgick Provinces</hi>; but first to smooth the way before him by a puissant Army. On this advertisement the Governess resumes her courage, complains how much the Covenanters had abused her favours; and publickly declares, that she had onely given them leave to meet together for hearing Sermons of their own; but that their Ministers had took upon them to Baptize and Marry, and perform all other Sacred Offices in a different
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54836:65"/>
manner from that allowed of by the Church; That they had set up divers Consistories and new Forms of Government, not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Laws of the several Provinces; That they had opened divers Schools for training up their Children in Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Principles; That they had raised great sums of Money un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of purchasing a toleration of the King (whose Piety was too well known to be so corrupted) but in plain truth, to levy Souldiers for a War against him; That therefore she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all Governours and Deputy-Governours in their several Provinces, not onely to dissolve Heretical Meetings (otherwise then for Sermons onely) in the time to come, but to put Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons into such of the Towns and Cities as were held suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or were most likely to be seized on to the Kings disservice. By this Remonstrance, seconded with the news of the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, the leading Covenanters were so startled, that they resolved on the beginning of the War, and were accordingly in Arms, before the Governess had either raised Horse or Foot, more then the ordinary Train bands, which were to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in continual readiness, by the Rules of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But first, they thought it most agreeable to the State of Affairs, to possess themselves of such strong Towns as either stood convenient for the letting in of Forreign Succours, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise for commanding the adjoyning Territories. In which designe they speed so well, that many great Towns declare for them of their own accord; some were surprised by such of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Leaders as had friends amongst them; and some were willing to stand neutral till they saw more of it. But none fared better at the first then <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Bomberg,</hi> one of the <hi>Calvinists</hi> of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> who having formerly served the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonot</hi> Princes in the Wars of <hi>France,</hi> had put himself into the <hi>Bosch,</hi> from whence the Faction had not long before expelled their Bishop: And there he played his game with such fraud and cunning, that he put the people into Arms, made himself Master of the Town, and turned the Cannon upon Count <hi>Meghen,</hi> who was Commissionated by the Governess, amongst other things, to plant a Garrison in the same.</p>
            <p n="35">35. This good success encouraged many of the rest to the like attempts, but few of them with so good Fortune. The Count of <hi>Brederode</hi> having Fortified his own Town of <hi>Viana,</hi> a small Town of <hi>Holland,</hi> stretcheth his Arms from thence to imbrace the rest, and takes in <hi>Amsterdam</hi> it self without opposition; but having the like aim on <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> he found his hopes defeated by the Count of <hi>Meghen,</hi> who got in before him.

               </gap>t with <hi>Philip de Marnix,</hi> Lord of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> another of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twerpian Calvinists,</hi> of greater power then <hi>Bomberg,</hi> but of less dexterity: holding intelligence with the Provost of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> he entertained a design of surprising <hi>Vlushing,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the whole Isle of <hi>Walcheren,</hi> and the rest of <hi>Zealand.</hi> To which end he embarks his men, and sails down the <hi>Scheldt,</hi> not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54836:65"/>
without some good hope of effecting his enterprize before any discovery was made of it. But the Governess knew of what importance the said Island was, and was there before him in her Forces, though not in her person. Repulsed from thence, he marcheth back again towards <hi>Antwerp,</hi> takes up his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Borough of <hi>Ostervill,</hi> the <hi>Southwark</hi> as it were of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and from thence so named; where he is set upon by <hi>Lanoy,</hi> another of the Regents Captains; the Borough fired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his ears, himself burned in a Barn, fifteen thousand of his Souldiers killed in the flight, three hundred of them taken and then put to the Sword: Which execution was thought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as the case then stood, for fear the <hi>Calvinists</hi> in the City might renew the fight, and put him worse to it then before: Nor were they wanting to their Friends in that desperate exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, whose slaughter they beheld from the Walls of the City. But when they thought to pass the Bridge, they found no Bridge at all to give them passage: the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> being then at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> had caused it to be broken down the day before, not out of any designe to prevent the <hi>Calvinists</hi> from assisting their Brethren, but rather to hinder the Victorious Catholicks (if it should so happen) from making any use of it to possess the City. But the <hi>Calvinists</hi> not knowing of his secret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, tumultuously assembled to the number of fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, fell foul upon him in the Streets, reviled him by the name of Traytor, and clapped a Pistol to his Breast, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless had proceeded to some greater outrage, if the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> (hating the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and as hateful to them) had not joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Papists,</hi> and thereby over-powered them both in strength and numbers.</p>
            <p n="36">36. But none fared worse then the <hi>Calvinians</hi> of <hi>Tournay</hi> and <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> though they were both stronger and more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous then in other places. Those of <hi>Valencienn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> had refused to admit a Garrison, encouraged by their <hi>French</hi> Preachers to that disobedience. But being besieged by <hi>Norcarmius,</hi> Deputy-Governour of <hi>Haynalt</hi> for the Marquess of <hi>Bergen,</hi> they were compelled in the end to submit to mercie; which was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed with justice, that thirty six of the principal Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries were beheaded, some of their Preachers hanged, and some Souldiers executed; the Liberties of the City being seized, and declared to be forfeit till the King should be pleased to restore them. Those of <hi>Valenciennes</hi> had been animated by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistories of some other Cities to make good the Town against <hi>Norcarmius,</hi> as long as they could; assuring them that he must shortly raise the Siege, to quench the fire that would be kindled in another Province. Accordingly it was contrived that some Foot-Companies which lay in <hi>Armentieres</hi> should waste the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about <hi>Lisle</hi> in <hi>Flanders Gallicant</hi>; and that whilst <hi>Rassinghen</hi> the Governour of <hi>Lisle</hi> drew out of the City to suppress them, the <hi>Calvinists</hi> of <hi>Tournay</hi> by the aid of their Brethren within
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54836:66"/>
that City should possess themselves of it. And so far it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded as they had projected, that the <hi>Armenterians,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by one <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who of a Smith became a Preacher, and would needs make himself a Commander also, acted their part in the designe, but easily were subdued by <hi>Rassinghen</hi> at the first assault. The news whereof not onely terrified the Consistorians within <hi>Lisle</hi> it self, but so disheartned those of <hi>Tournay,</hi> who hoped to have made themselves Masters of it, that they thought it best for them to retire; but being set upon by <hi>Norcarmius,</hi> who had drawn some Forces from his Camp before <hi>Valenciennes</hi> to perform this service, they were utterly routed, most of their men (amounting to four thousand) either killed or taken; two Barrels of Powder, twenty Field-peeces, and nine Colours, falling into the hands of the Conquering Army: with which <hi>Norcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> marching on directly to the Gates of <hi>Tournay,</hi> commands them in the name of the Governess to receive a Garrison, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Town, disarms the people, imprisoned the Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, restored the Bishop and Clergy to their former pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and finally, imposed such a Governour over them, as was like to give a good account of them for the times en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing.</p>

The taking of these Towns to mercy, the like success in other places, and a report that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was coming forwards with an Army to make way for the King, did so deject the Heads of the <hi>Gheuses,</hi> and the rest of the Covenanters, that most of them began to droop; whereof the Governess did not need to be advertised, and was resolved to make some present use of the Consternation. She therefore causes a new Oath or Protestation to be forthwith made, and to be taken by all Magistrates and Officers both of Peace and War; by which they were to bind themselves without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to obey any who should be appointed in the Kings name for their Supreme Governour. And this she was resolved upon against all disswasions; not that she meant to use it for a discrimination, by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which she might discover how they stood affected to his Majesties Service; but that she might with less envy displace all such as wilfully refused the Oath, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them with death and confiscation if they brake their Faith. Being propounded to the Council, it was cheerfully approved and subscribed by some, and resolutely opposed by others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence that they had formerly took the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the King himself, and that Oaths were not to be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed without just necessity. But none more pertinaciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused it then the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who devised many plausible reasons in his justification, but such as were of little weight when they came to the ballance. Count <hi>Egmont</hi> for a while demurred, but at last submitted, and took the Oath as others of the Council had done before: the falling off of which great man so amazed the rest, that every one thought it now high

The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily retireth unto his County of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> but leaves his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters behinde him to maintain his Interest: Count <hi>Brederode</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts for <hi>Germany,</hi> where he dyed soon after: Count <hi>William de la March,</hi> commonly called the Baron of <hi>Lume,</hi> takes Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary in the Realm of <hi>England: Bomberg</hi> not finding any safety to be had in the <hi>Bosch,</hi> abandoneth it to the Regents Empire, by whom it was not onely forced to receive a Garrison, but also to redeem their priviledges for a sum of money.

Besides, he was not without hope, that if he should miscarry in the present enterprise, his Eldest Son, being brought up in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> might be restored to those Estates which himself had lost; but if he prospered in his work, and that the King should still think fit to detain him Prisoner, he had another Son by the Daughter of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> who might succeed him, as he did, in his power and greatness.</p>
            <p n="39">39. But first, he thought it most agreeable to his present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to employ other hands and heads besides his own; to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54836:67"/>
which end he had so contrived it, that whilst his brother <hi>Lodowick</hi> invaded <hi>Friesland,</hi> and Count <hi>Hostrat</hi> out of <hi>Iuliers</hi> and the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Palatinate</hi> crossed over the <hi>Mose,</hi> an Army of the <hi>French Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi> should fall into <hi>Artois,</hi> to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the more work by this treble invasion. But the <hi>French</hi> Forces being followed at the heels by some Troops of Horse whom the King sent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, were totally defeated neer the Town of St. <hi>Vallery</hi>; their Chief Commanders brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> and there beheaded. Count <hi>Hostrat</hi> with his Forces had the like misfortune, first bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and afterwards totally vanquished by <hi>Sancho d' Avila</hi> one of <hi>Alva</hi>'s Generals: Onely Count <hi>Lodowick</hi> had the honour of a signal Victory, but bought it with the death of his brother <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph</hi> whom he lost in the Battail; though afterwards encountring with the Duke himself, he lost six thousand of his men, besides all his Baggage, Ordnance and Ammunition, hardly escaping with his life. And now it is high time for the Prince to enter; who having raised an Army of eight and twenty thousand Horse and Foot (increased not long after by the addition of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot and five hundred Horse, which the <hi>French Hugonots</hi> out of pure Zeal unto the Cause had provided for him) takes his way toward <hi>Brabant,</hi> which he had marked out for his Quarters; but there he found the Dukes whole Army to be laid in his way, whom he could neither pass by, nor ingage in fight; the Duke well knowing, that such great Armies wanting pay, would disband themselves, and were more safely broken by delay then battail; onely he watched their motions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by parties, in which he always had the better: And by these Arts so tired the Prince, that in the end he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to dissolve his Forces, and retire once more into <hi>Nassaw.</hi> But whilst the Duke was thus imployed in securing the passages of the Country which lay next to <hi>Germany,</hi> he left the Ports and Sea-Towns open to the next Invadour: Which being observed by <hi>William de March</hi> Baron of <hi>Luma,</hi> who with few Ships kept himself upon the Seas out of <hi>Alva</hi>'s reach, he suddenly seized upon the <hi>Brill,</hi> a Port of <hi>Holland,</hi> where he defaced such I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages as he found in their Churches, omitting no irreverence unto any thing which was accounted Sacred; but otherwise so fortified and intrenched the Town, that it proved impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This hapned on <hi>Palm</hi>-Sunday, <hi>Anno</hi> 1570; and on the Sunday following, being <hi>Easter</hi>-day, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Garrison is turned out of <hi>Vlushing,</hi> the chief Port of <hi>Zealand</hi>: by gaining of which two places, it might not be unfitly said, that they carried the Keys of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> at their Girdles, and were inabled by that means to receive succours from all Parts and Nations which lay towards the Sea, as they after did.</p>
            <p n="40">40. The loss of these two Ports drew along with it a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of most of the strong Towns in <hi>Holland,</hi> which at the instigation of the Baron of <hi>Luma,</hi> put themselves under the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54836:67"/>
command of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and at his motion took the Oath of fidelity to him; from him they received their Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Shipping and Arms, and to him they permitted the disposing of all places of Government, making of Laws, and the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting of the Revenues which belonged to the Clergy: To him such multitudes repaired out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> (besides Auxiliary <hi>Scots</hi>) that within less then four months, a Navy of one hundred and fifty Sail lay rigged in <hi>Vlushing,</hi> and from thence spoiled and robbed all Merchants of the <hi>Spanish</hi> party. Nor were the Dukes Affairs in much better order in the parts next <hi>France,</hi> in which Count <hi>Lodowick</hi> with the help of some <hi>French Hugonots</hi> had made himself Master of <hi>Mons,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Haynalt</hi>; which seemed the more considerable in the eyes of <hi>Alva,</hi> because the <hi>French</hi> King openly, but for different ends, had avowed the Action. By whose permission, <hi>Gasper Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny,</hi> the great Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> and one of the chief Leaders of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> party, had raised an Army in the Borders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of six or seven thousand men, which he put under the command of the Lord of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="41">41. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in the mean time, animated by the General revolt of almost all the strong Towns in <hi>Holland,</hi> raised a new Army of no fewer then eleven thousand Foot and six thousand Horse; with which he entred into <hi>Brabant,</hi> possest himself of some of the principal Towns, and suffered others to redeem themselves with great sums of money, with which he satisfied his Souldiers for their pains and hazard in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the rest. <hi>Dendermond</hi> and <hi>Oudenard,</hi> two strong Towns of <hi>Flanders</hi> which had made some resistance, he both stormed and plundered; the Souldiers in all places making spoil of Churches, and in some tyrannizing over the dead, whose Monuments they robbed and pillaged. But none fared worse then the poor Priests, whom out of hate to their Religion, they did not onely put to death, but put to death with tortures; and in some places which fell under the power of the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Luma,</hi> hanged up their mangled Limbs or Quarters, as Butchers do their small Meats in a common Shambles: which spoils and cruelties so alienated the affections of all the people, that his power in those parts was not like to continue long; and having failed of his attempt in relieving <hi>Mons,</hi> crossed the Country in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Holland,</hi> as his surest receptacle; on whose retreat the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers all the Towns which he had taken in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> follows him into <hi>Holland,</hi> and besiegeth <hi>Harlem</hi>; in which the Souldiers, to demonstrate of what Sect they were, made a meer

Pageant of Religion: for setting up Altars on the Bulwarks, they dressed them with Images and representations of the Saints; and being attired in Copes and Vestments, they sung Hymns before them, as if they were offering Devotions. After which mockery they brought out the resemblances of Priests and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious persons made of straw, whipt them, and stabbed them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body; and finally, cutting off their heads, flung them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Leaguer: Sometimes they also placed the Images of Christ, and many of the Saints, against the mouth of the Cannon, with many other Arts of the like impiety; for which they were brought to a dear reckoning when the Town was taken; at which time most of them were either put to the Sword, or hanged, or drowned.</p>
            <p n="42">42. <hi>Frederick</hi> the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> had hitherto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged no further in the <hi>Belgick</hi> troubles then the rest of his Neighbours. But now he doth more cordially espouse the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, upon some hope of propagating the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines, which he had lately introduced into his Dominions. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well affected to the House of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> and knowing what encouragements the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Faction in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> had received from them, cheerfully hearkened to such propositions as were made to him at the first by Count <hi>Lodowick</hi> his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and alter by the Agent of the Prince himself. He had sent some aid not long before to support the <hi>Hugonots:</hi> But now his Souldiers being returned from <hi>France,</hi> and grown burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to him, are drawn together into a body; and with the help of some others out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> compound an Army of seven thousand Foot and four thousand Horse, with which he sends Prince <hi>Christopher</hi> a younger son, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Count <hi>Lodowick</hi> and his Brother <hi>Henry.</hi> But they had scarce entred within the Borders of <hi>Gelderland,</hi> where they expected an addition of fresh Forces from the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> when they were set upon by <hi>Sanchio d' Avila</hi> before mentioned, and routed with so great a slaughter, that almost all the whole Army were either taken prisoners, remedilesly wounded, or slain outright: and as for their three Generals, <hi>Lodowick</hi> of <hi>Nassaw, Grave Henry,</hi> and the young Prince <hi>Christopher,</hi> they were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther slain fighting in the battail, or trampled under the Horses Feet, or finally, stisled in the flight, as they crossed the Fens; the last more probable, because their bodies were not to be found on the strictest search.</p>
            <p n="43">43. But not withstanding this misfortune, neither the Prince E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector nor the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> could be moved to desert the Cause, which by the temptation of revenge was grown dearer to them. For after this we finde Prince <hi>Casimir,</hi> another of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Princes, in the Head of an Army raised for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting the Confederates in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces, (by which name they began to be commonly called) after the death of <hi>Reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senes,</hi> who had succeeded <hi>Alva</hi> in the publick Government;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54836:68"/>
but wanting time before his death to settle the command in some trusty hands, till some Supreme Officer might be sent unto them from the Court of <hi>Spain</hi>; the Government devolved for the present on the Council of State, and was invaded afterwards by the States themselves, whose Deputies assembling in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-house or Court of <hi>Brussels,</hi> made up the body of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil which governed all Affairs both of Peace and War. But great contentions growing betwixt them and the Souldiers, and those contentions followed on either side with great animosities, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had a most excellent opportunity for the establishing of his new Dictatorship over <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> and some of the adjoyning Provinces of less name and note. But being weary at the last of their own confusions, and more impatient of the insupportable insolencies of the Spanish Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, an Association is first made in the Provinces of <hi>Brabant, Flanders, Artois</hi> and <hi>Haynalt.</hi> By which it was agreed in Writing, and confirmed by Oath, that they should mutually assist each other against the <hi>Spaniards</hi> till they had cleared the Country of them. And with these Provinces, consisting for the most part of such as were counted Catholicks, <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> with the rest, though esteemed heretical, did associate also: which Union is called commonly the <hi>Pacification of Gaunt,</hi> because agreed on in that City, and was so much insisted on by the Heads of the Leaguers, that it was counselled by the Prince, not to admit of <hi>Don Iohn</hi> for their Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, till he had ratified and confirmed that Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="44">44. But because there was no mention of maintaining the Kings Authority, or preserving the Catholick Religion in the Originals of the League; it was found necessary to provide for both by some explication, to take away the envy and suspition of that great disloyalty which otherwise must have fallen upon them. And by that explication it was thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>viz.</hi> that they would faithfully from thenceforth main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the League, for the conservation of their most Sacred Faith, and the Roman Catholick Religion; for preserving the Pacification made at <hi>Gaunt</hi>; for the expulsion of the Spaniards and their adherents; their due obedience to the Kings most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majesty being always tendered. According to which explication, it was confirmed by <hi>Don Iohn</hi> under the name of the <hi>perpetual Edict,</hi> with the Kings consent; who thought his own Authority and the Roman Religion to be thereby suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently provided for, but he found the contrary. For when the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was required to subscribe to the Pacification, with the addition of two Clauses for constancie in this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Kings obedience, he refused it absolutely, assuring such as moved it to him, that the Provinces under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or consederacie with him were barred in Conscience from subscribing to the preservation of the <hi>Romish</hi> Faith. And at
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54836:69"/>
this time it was, that he merrily told the Duke of <hi>Arescot,</hi> who was one of the Delegates, that there was not more <hi>Calvism</hi> on his head, then there was <hi>Calvinism</hi> in his heart. He well fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw that the agreement betwixt <hi>Don Iohn</hi> and the Estates of the Country would not long continue; and he resolved to make some advantage of the breach, whensoever it hapned. Nor was he any thing mistaken in the one or the other; for discontents and jealousies encreasing mutually between the parties, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> leaves <hi>Brussels,</hi> and betakes himself to the Castle of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure</hi> for fear of an Assassinate (as it was given out) which was intended on his person: which so incensed the Estates, that by a general consent, a <hi>Dictatorian</hi> or Soveraign power was put into the hands of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> by the name <hi>Ruart,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the priviledge and practice of the <hi>Brabanters</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme necessities. Invested with which power, he instituteth a new face of Government both in <hi>Brussels</hi> it self, and many of the Towns adjoyning, modelled after the Example of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand.</hi> He demolished also the great Fort at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which had been raised with so great Pride and Ostentation by the Duke of <hi>Alva:</hi> The like done also in demolishing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of <hi>Gant, Vtrecht, Lisle, Valenciennes,</hi> and some other places; performed by such alacrity by them that did it, as if they had shaken off the Yoke of some Forreign servitude. An Oath was also framed for renouncing all obedience to <hi>Don Iohn</hi> their Governour, and people of all sorts compelled to take it; for the refusal whereof by the <hi>Iesuits</hi> of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> a Rabble of <hi>Calvinian</hi> Zealots, on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> forced open the doors of that <hi>Society,</hi> plundred their houses of all things Sacred and Prophane, and set the Father on board a Ship of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> with great scorn and insolencie, to be landed in some other Country.</p>
            <p n="45">45. The like done also to the Fathers of <hi>Tournay, Bruges,</hi> and <hi>Maestricht,</hi> banished on the same account from their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cities; with whom were also exiled in some places <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscan</hi> Fryars, in others many secular Priests, who would not easily be perswaded to abjure their Loyalty. By whose departure divers Churches were left destitute, and unprovided of incumbents to instruct the people: which so increased the confidence and hopes of the <hi>Calvinians,</hi> that they not onely petitioned the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states for liberty of Conscience, but for the publick use of Churches in their several Territories: but being refused in their desires, (though the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> openly appeared for them) they were resolved no longer to expect the lazie temper of Authority, but actually took possession of some of the Churches in <hi>Brabant, Gelderland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and openly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised that Religion, which till then they had professed in secret; nor durst the Estates do any thing in vindication of their own Authority, considering what necessary use they might have of them, in the present War against <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54836:69"/>
from how great a person they received incouragement. But in the midst of this career, they received a stop; for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates being vanquished by <hi>Don Iohn</hi> at the battail of <hi>Gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>black, Brussels</hi> and all the Towns of <hi>Brabant</hi> submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves one after another to the power of the conquerour. <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pivil,</hi> a strong Town of <hi>Haynalt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Limburg</hi> and <hi>Dalem,</hi> with some others, not so easily yeilding, were either forced by long siege, or some violent storming, or otherwise surrended upon capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. During which Sieges and Surrendries, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who had escaped with safety from the battail of <hi>Gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>black,</hi> was busied in establishing his Dominion on the Coast of <hi>Holland</hi>: In which designe he found no opposition but at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi> constant at that time, even to miracle, both to their old Religion and their old Obedience. But being besieged on all sides both by Sea and Land, they yeilded on condition of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the free exercise of their former Faith, and of the like Freedom from all Garrisons, but of Native Citizens: But when they had yeilded up the Town, they were not onely forced to admit a Garrison, but to behold their Churches spoil'd, their Priests ejected, and such new Teachers thrust upon them as they most abominated. But liberty of Religion being first admitted, a confused liberty of opinions followed shortly after; till in the end that Town became the common Sink of all Sects and Sectaries which hitherto have disturbed the Church, and proved the greatest scandal and dishonor of the Reformation.</p>
            <p n="46">46. <hi>Holland</hi> had lately been too fruitful of this viperous brood, but never more unfortunate, then in producing <hi>David George</hi> of <hi>Delfe,</hi> and <hi>Henry Nicholas</hi> of <hi>Leiden,</hi> the two great Monsters of that age: but the impieties of the first were too gross and horrid to finde any followers; the latter was so smoothed over as to gain on many, whom the Impostor had seduced. The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> out of <hi>Westphalia</hi> had found shelter here in the beginning of the Tumults; and possibly might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute both their hearts and hands to the committing of those spoils and outrages before remembred. In imitation of whose counterfeit piety, and pretended singleness of heart, there started up another Sect as dangerous and destructive to humane Society as the former were; for by insinuating themselves into the heart of the ignorant multitude, under a shew of singular Sanctity and Integrity, did afterwards infect their mindes with damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, openly repugnant to the Christian Faith. In ordinary Speech they used new and monstrous kindes of expressions, to which the ears of men brought up in the Christian Church had not been accustomed, and all men rather wondered at then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. To difference themselves from the rest of mankinde, they called their Sect by the name of the <hi>Family of Love,</hi> and laboured to perswade their hearers, that those onely were elected unto life Eternal, which were by them adopted Children of that Holy Family; and that all others were but Reprobates and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54836:70"/>
Damned persons. One of their Paradoxes was (and a safe one too) that it was lawful for them to deny upon oath whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pleased, before any Magistrate, or any other whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, that was not of the same <hi>Family</hi> or Society with them. Some Books they had, in which their dotages were contained and propagated; first writ in <hi>Dutch,</hi> and afterwards translated into other Languages as tended most to their advantage; that is to say, <hi>The Gospel of the Kingdom; The Lords Sentences; The Prophesie of the Spirit of the Lord; The publication of peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth:</hi> by the Author <hi>H. N.</hi> But who this <hi>H. N.</hi> was, those of the <hi>Family</hi> could by no fair means be induced or inforced by threatnings to reveal. But after, it was found to be this <hi>Henry Nicholas</hi> of <hi>Leiden,</hi> whom before we spake of: Who being emulous of the Glories of King <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leiden,</hi> that most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Botcher, had most blasphemously preached unto all his followers, that <hi>he was partaker of the Divinity of God, as God was of his humane nature.</hi> How afterwards they past over into <hi>England,</hi> and what reception they found there, may be told hereafter.</p>
            <p n="50">50. By giving freedom of Conscience to all Sects and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and amongst others, to these also, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had provided himself of so strong a party in this Province, that he was able to maintain a defensive War against all his opposites, especially after he had gained the Ports of <hi>Brill</hi> and <hi>Vlushing,</hi> which opened a fair entrance unto all adventurers out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> For on the Rumour of this War, the <hi>Scots</hi> in hope of prey and plunder, the <hi>English</hi> in pursuit of Honour and the use of Arms, resorted to the aid of their <hi>Belgick</hi> Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, whose absolute subjugation to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was looked on as a thing of dangerous consequence unto either Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And at the first they went no otherwise then as Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers of their own accord, rather connived at then permitted by their several Princes: But when the Government was taken into the hands of the States, and that the War was ready to break out betwixt them and <hi>Don Iohn</hi>; the Queen of <hi>England</hi> did not onely furnish them with large sums of money, but entred into a League or Confederation; by which it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, That the Queen should send unto their aid one thousand Horse and five thousand Foot; that they should conclude no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing respecting either Peace or War, without her consent and approbation; that they should not enter into League with any person or persons, but with her allowance, and she, if she thought good, to be comprehended in the same; that the States should send the like aid unto the Queen, if any Prince attempted any act of Hostility against her or her Kingdoms; and that they should furnish her with forty Ships of sufficient burthen, to serve at her pay under the Lord Admiral of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whensoever she had any necessary occasion to set forth a Navy; and finally (not to insist upon the rest) that if any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54836:70"/>
should arise amongst themselves, it was to be referred and offered unto her Arbitrament. And to this League she was the rather induced to grant her Royal assent, because she had been certainly advertised by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> was then negotiating a marriage with the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> that under colour of her Title he might advance himself to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> And yet she ventured neither men nor money, but on very good terms; receiving in the way of pawn the greatest part of the rich Jewels and massie Ornaments of Plate which anciently belonged unto the Princes of the House of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="51">51. This League exceedingly increased the reputation of the new <hi>Confederacy,</hi> and made the <hi>States</hi> appear considerable in the eye of the world. And more it might have been, if either <hi>Don Iohn</hi>'s improsperous Government had continued longer, or if the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had not entertained some designs apart for himself. But <hi>Don Iohn</hi> dyes in the year 1578, and leaves his Forces in the power of <hi>Alexander Farneze</hi> Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> Son to that Dutchess whom we have so often mentioned in this part of our History. A Prince he was of no less parts and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Prowess, then any of his Predecessors; but of a better and more equal temper then the best amongst them; whereof he gave sufficient testimony in his following Government, in which he was confirmed (after the Kings occasioned lingrings) with great state and honour: For having regained from the States some of the best Towns of which they had possessed themselves before the arrival of <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> he forced them to a necessity of some better counsels then those by which they steered their course since they came to the Helm. And of all counsels none seemed better to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> then that the Country should be so cantoned amongst several Princes, that every one being ingaged to defend his own, the whole might be preserved from the power of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> To this end it had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised that <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois</hi> should return to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> of which they were holden, and to the Kings whereof the Earls of both did homage in the times foregoing. The Queen of <hi>England</hi> was to have been gratified with the Isles of <hi>Zealand</hi>; the Dukedom of <hi>Gueldres</hi> to divert to the next Heirs of it; <hi>Groning</hi> and <hi>Deventer</hi> to be incorporated with the <hi>Hans; Holland</hi> and <hi>Friesland,</hi> together with the districht of <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> to be appropriated wholly to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his deservings: the <hi>Brabanters</hi> to a new Election, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their native rights: the rest of the Provinces to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to the <hi>German</hi> Empire, of which they had anciently <hi>Eleired.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="52">52. This distribution I confess had some cunning in it, and must have quickly brought the <hi>Spanish</hi> pride to a very low ebb, if he that laid the plot could have given the possession. It is reported that when the Pope offered the Realms of <hi>Naples</hi> and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54836:71"/>
               <hi>Sicily</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, for <hi>Edmond</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaster</hi> his youngest Son, he offered them on such hard conditions, (and so impossible in a manner to be performed) that the Kings Embassadors merrily told him, he might as well create a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Moon, and bid his Master climb up to it, for it should be his. And such a Lunary conceit was that of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision and subdivision of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces, in what <hi>Calvini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> head soever it was forged and hammered. For being that each of the <hi>Donces</hi> was to conquer his part before he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any benefit from it, the device was not like to procure much profit, but onely to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in possession, and could not better fortifie and assure himself in his new Dominion, then by cutting out so much work for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as probably might keep him exercised to the end of the world. But this device not being likely to succeed, it seemed better to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to unite the Provinces under his command into a Solemn League and Association, to be from thenceforth called the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Vnion.</hi> Which League, Association, or perpetual Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, bears date at <hi>Vtrecht</hi> on the 23 of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1578, and was then made between the Provinces of <hi>Holland, Zealand, Guelders, Zutphen, Vtrecht, Friesland</hi> and <hi>Overyssel,</hi> with their Associates, called ever since that time the <hi>Vnited Provinces.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1579.</note> In the first making of which League or perpetual Union, it was provided in the first place, that they should inseparably joyn together for defence of themselves, their Liberty and Religion, against the power of the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> But it was cautioned in the second, that this Association should be made without any diminution or alteration of the particular Priviledges, Rights, Freedoms, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions, Statutes, Customs, Uses, Preheminencies, which any of the said Towns, Provinces, Members, or Inhabitants at that time enjoyed. Liberty of Religion to be left to those of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> in which they might govern themselves as to them seemed good: and such a Freedom left to those of other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, as was agreed on at the Pacification made at <hi>Gaunt</hi>; by which it was not lawful to molest those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in any manner whatsoever.</p>
            <p n="53">53. But more particularly it was provided and agreed on, that such Controversies as should grow between the said Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, Towns, or Members of this Union, touching their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Customs, Freedoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should be decided by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary course of Justice, or by some amicable and friendly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position amongst themselves; and that no other Countries, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, Members or Towns, whom those Countries did no way concern, shall in any part meddle by way of friendly intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion tending to an accord. Which caution I the rather note in this place and time, because we may perhaps look back upon it in the case of <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> when they had freed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the power of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and were at leisure to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54836:71"/>
infringe the publick Liberties, in the pursuit of their particular Animosities against one another. But to proceed: this Union, as it was more advantagious unto Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> then the general League; so was it afterwards more cordially affected by her, when their necessities inforced them to cast themselves and their Estates upon her protection. But these proceedings so exasperated the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he proscribed the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> by his publick Edict, bearing date <hi>Iune</hi> 18. 1581.<note place="margin">1581.</note> And on the other side, the Prince prevailed so far upon those of the Union, as to declare by publick Instrument, that the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> by reason of his many violations of their Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, had forfeited his Estate and Interest in the several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and therefore that they did renounce all manner of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and obedience to him. Which Instrument bears date on the twenty sixth of <hi>Iuly</hi> then next following. Upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing whereof, they brake in pieces all the Seals, Signets, and Counter-signets of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; appointed others to be made by the States General; for dispatch of such business as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the <hi>Vnion</hi> or Confederation; requiring all subjects to renounce their Oaths to the said King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to take a new Oath of Fidelity to the general Estates, against the said King and his adherents: the like done also by all Governours, Superintendents, Chancellors, Councellors, and other Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They had before drawn the Sword against him, and now they throw away the Scabberd. For to what end could this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aim at, but to make the breach irreparable between them and the King, to swell the injury so high, as not to be within the compass of future pardon? And when men once are brought unto such a condition, they must resolve to fight it out to the very last, and either carry away the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arland as a signe of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, or otherwise live like Slaves, or dye like Traytors. But this was done according to <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrine in the Book of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes,</hi> in which he gives to the Estates of each several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try such a Coercive Power over Kings and Princes, as the <hi>Ephori</hi> had exercised over the Kings of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi> sometimes put in practice against the <hi>Consuls.</hi> And more then so, he doth condemn them of a betraying of the Peoples Liberty, whereof they are made <hi>Guardians</hi> by Gods own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment (so he saith at least) if they restrain not Kings when they play the Tyrants, and want only insult upon, or oppress the Subjects. So great a Master could not but meet with some apt Scholars in the Schools of Politie, who would reduce his Rules to practice, and justifie their practice by such great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p n="54">54. But notwithstanding the unseasonable publication of such an unprecedented sentence, few of the Provinces fell off from the Kings obedience; and such strong Towns as still remained in the hands of the States, were either forced unto their duty, or otherwise hard put to it by the Prince of <hi>Parma.</hi> To keep
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54836:72"/>
whom busied in such sort, that he should not be in a capacity of troubling his Affairs in <hi>Holland,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> puts the <hi>Brabanders</hi> (whose priviledges would best bear it) to a new Election: And who more fit to be the man then <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> Brother to <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>France,</hi> and then in no small possibility of attaining to the Marriage of the Queen of <hi>England?</hi> Assisted by the Naval power of the one, and the Land-Forces of the other, What Prince was able to oppose him? and what power to withstand him? The young Duke passing over into <hi>England,</hi> found there an entertainment so agreeable to all expectations, that the Queen was seen to put a Ring upon one of his Fingers; which being looked on as the pledge of a future Marriage, the news thereof posted presently to the <hi>Low Countries</hi> by the Lord <hi>Aldegund</hi> who was then present at the Court, where it was welcomed both in <hi>Antwerp</hi> and other places with all signes of joy, and celebrated by discharging of all the Ordnance both on the Walls, and in such Ships as then lay on the River. After which triumph comes the Duke, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by some great Lords of the Court of <hi>England,</hi> and is invested solemnly by the Estates of those Countries, in the Dukedoms of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Limburg,</hi> the Marquisate of the holy Empire, and the Lordship of <hi>Machlin:</hi> which action seems to have been carryed by the power of the Consistorian <hi>Calvinists</hi>; for besides that it agreeth so well with their common Principles, they were grown very strong in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where <hi>Philip</hi> Lord of <hi>Aldegund,</hi> a profest <hi>Calvinian,</hi> was Deputy for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as they were also in most Towns of consequence in the Dukedom of <hi>Brabant.</hi> But on the other side, the Romish party was reduced to such a low estate, that they could not freely exercise their own Religion, but onely as it was indulged unto them by Duke <hi>Francis,</hi> their new-made Soveraign, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of taking the Oath of Allegiance to him, and abdicating the Authority of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; the grant of which permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion had been vain and of no significancie, if at that time they could have freely exercised the same without it. But whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were that concurred most powerfully in conferring this new honour on him, he quickly found that they had given him nothing but an airy Title, keeping all power unto themselves: So that upon the matter he was nothing but an honourable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and bound to execute the commands of his mighty Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. In time perhaps he might have wrought himself to a greater power; but being young, and ill advised, he rashly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprised the taking of the City of <hi>Antwerp</hi>; of which being frustrated by the miscarriage of his plot, he returned ingloriously into <hi>France,</hi> and soon after dyes.</p>
            <p n="55">55. And now the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is come to play his last part on the publick Theatre: his winding Wit had hitherto preserved his Provinces in some terms of peace, by keeping <hi>Don Iohn</hi> exercised by the General States, and the Prince of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54836:72"/>
               <hi>Parma</hi> no less busied by the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>; nor was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope of recovering <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> to the Kings obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but either by open force, or some secret practice; the first whereof appeared not possible, and the last ignoble. But the necessity of removing him by what means soever, prevailed at last above all sence and terms of Honour. And thereupon a desperate young Fellow is ingaged to murther him; which he attempted by discharging a Pistol in his face, when he was at <hi>Antwerp</hi> attending on the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>; so that he hardly escaped with life. But being recovered of that blow, he was not long after shot with three poyson Bullets by one <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar Gerard</hi> a <hi>Burgundian</hi> born, whom he had lately taken into his service: which murder was committed at <hi>Delph</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> on the 10 of <hi>Iune</hi> 1584, when he had lived but fifty years, and some months over. He left behind him three Sons, by as many Wives. On <hi>Anne</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Egmont</hi> Earl of <hi>Bucen,</hi> he begat <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Bucen</hi> his eldest Son, who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> after his decease. By <hi>Anne</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Maurice</hi> Duke Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> he was Father of <hi>Grave Maurice,</hi> who at the age of eighteen years was made Commander General of the Forces of the States United, and after the death of <hi>Philip</hi> his Elder Brother, succeeded him in all his Titles and Estates. And finally, by his fourth Wife <hi>Lovise</hi> Daughter of <hi>Gasper Colligny</hi> great Admiral of <hi>France</hi> (for of his third, being a Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Montpensier,</hi> he had never a Son) he was the Father of Prince <hi>Henry Frederick,</hi> who in the year 1625 became Successor unto his Brother in all his Lands, Titles, and Commands. Which <hi>Henry</hi> by a Daughter of the Count of <hi>Solmes,</hi> was Father of <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who married the Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> Eldest Daughter of King <hi>Charles</hi> the second Monarch of great <hi>Britain:</hi> And departing this life in the flower of his youth and expectations, <hi>Anno</hi> 1650, he left his Wife with Childe of a <hi>Post-humous</hi> Son, who after was baptized by the name of <hi>William,</hi> and is now the onely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving hope of that famous and illustrious Family.</p>
            <p n="56">56. But to return again to the former <hi>William,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1584.</note> whom we left weltring in his bloud at <hi>Delph</hi> in <hi>Holland:</hi> He was a man of great possessions and Estates, but of a soul too large for so great a Fortune: For besides the Principality of <hi>Orange</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the County of <hi>Nassaw</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> he was possessed in right of his first Wife of the Earldom of <hi>Bucen</hi> in <hi>Gelderland,</hi> as also of the Town and Territories of <hi>Lerdame</hi> and <hi>Iselstine</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi>; and in his own Patrimonial Right, was Lord of the strong Towns and goodly <hi>Signories</hi> of <hi>Breda, Grave</hi> and <hi>Diest,</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Brabant.</hi> In the right of which last Lordship, he was <hi>Burgrave</hi> of <hi>Antwerp.</hi> He was also Marquess of <hi>Vere</hi> and <hi>Vlushing,</hi> with some jurisdiction over both, in the Isle of <hi>Walcheren</hi>; by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth made Knight of the Golden Fleece, and by King <hi>Philip</hi> Governour of <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54836:73"/>
the County of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> All which he might have peaceably enjoyed with content and honour, as did the Duke of <hi>Areschot,</hi> and many others of the like Nobility, if he had aimed onely at a personal or private greatness. But it is possible that his thoughts carryed him to a higher pitch, and that perceiving what a general hatred was born by the Low Country-men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he thought it no impossible thing to dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess them at the last of all those Provinces, and to get some of them for himself. And he had put fair for it, had not death prevented him, by which his life and projects were cut off toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For compassing which projects, he made use of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which best served his turn: being bred a <hi>Lutheran</hi> by his Father, he profest himself a <hi>Romanist</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth; and after finding the <hi>Calvinians</hi> the more likely men to advance his purposes, he declared himself chiefly in their favour, though he permitted other Sects and Sectaries to grow up with them; in which respect he openly opposed all Treaties, Overtures, and Propositions, looking towards a peace, which might not come ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with such a liberty of Conscience, both in Doctrine and Worship, as he knew well could never be admitted by the Ministers of the Catholick King. But the <hi>Calvinians</hi> of all others were most dear unto him. By his encouragement, the <hi>Belgick</hi> Confession was drawn up and agreed upon 1567. By his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, being then <hi>Burgrave</hi> and Governour of <hi>Antwerp</hi> (as before is said) they set up their Consistory in that City, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in many others of the Dukedome of <hi>Brabant</hi>; and by his favour they attained unto such Authority, and took such deep root in <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and the rest of the Provinces under his command, that they prevailed in fine over all Religious Sects and Sectaries which are therein tolerated.</p>
            <p n="57">57. And that they might the better be enabled to retain that power which under him they had acquired, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved not to return again to their first obedience, which they conceived so inconsistent with it, and destructive of it: To this end they commit the Government to some few amongst them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the Estates, who were to govern all affairs which concerned the publick in the nature of a Common-wealth, like to that of the <hi>Switzers</hi>; so much the more agreeable to them, because it came more neer to that form or Polity which they had erected in the Church. And in this posture they will stand as long as they can; which if they found themselves unable to continue with any comfort, and that they needs must have a Prince, they will submit themselves to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> or perhaps the <hi>Dane</hi>; to any rather then their own. And to this point it came at last; for the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> so prevailed, that by the taking of <hi>Gaunt</hi> and <hi>Bruges,</hi> he had reduced all <hi>Flanders</hi> to the Kings obedience, brought <hi>Antwerp</hi> unto terms of yeilding, and carried on the War to the Walls of <hi>Vtrecht.</hi> In which extremity they offered themselves to the French King;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54836:73"/>
but his affairs were so perplexed by the <hi>Hugonots</hi> on the one side, and the <hi>Guisian</hi> Faction on the other, that he was not in a fit capacity to accept the offer. In the next place they have recourse to the Queen of <hi>England</hi>; not as before, to take them into her protection, but to accept them for her Subjects; and that the acceptance might appear with some shew of justice, they insist on her descent from <hi>Philip</hi> Wife to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, Sister, and some say Heir of <hi>William</hi> the Third, Earl of <hi>Holland, Haynalt, &amp;c.</hi> Which <hi>Philip,</hi> if she were the Eldest Daughter of the said Earl <hi>William</hi> (as by their Agents was pretended) then was the Queens Title better then that of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was derived from <hi>Margaret</hi> the other Sister: Or granting that <hi>Philip</hi> was the younger; yet on the failer, or other legal interruption of the Line of <hi>Margaret,</hi> (which seemed to be the case before them) the Queen of <hi>England</hi> might put in for the next Succession: and though the Queen upon very good reasons and considerations refused the Soveraignty of those Countries, which could not without very great injury to publick justice be accepted by her; yet so far she gave way to her own fears, the ambition of some great persons who were near unto her, and the pretended Zeal of the rest, that she admitted them at the last into her protection.</p>
            <p n="58">58. The Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> was at that time of greatest power in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> who being a great favourer of the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> Faction, and eagerly affecting to see himself in the head of an Army, sollicited the affair with all care and cunning; and it succeeded answerably to his hopes and wishes. The Queen consents to take them into her protection, to raise an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of five thousand Foot and one thousand Horse, to put it under the Command of a sufficient and experienced General, and to maintain it in her pay till the War were ended. And it was condescended to on the other side, that the Towns of <hi>Brill</hi> and <hi>Vlushing,</hi> with the Fort of <hi>Ramekins,</hi> should be put into the hands of the <hi>English</hi>; that the Governour whom the Queen should appoint over the Garrisons, together with two other persons of her nomination, should have place and suffrage in the Council of the States United; that all their own Forces should be ranged under the Command of the English General; and that the States should make no peace without her consent. By which transaction, they did not onely totally withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> but suffered the <hi>English</hi> to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the Gates of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> whereby they might imbar all Trade, shut out all Supplies, and hold them unto such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as they pleased to give them. But any Yoke appeared more tolerable then that of the <hi>Spaniard</hi>; and any Prince more welcome to them, then he to whom both God and Nature had made them subject. According unto which agreement, <hi>Vlushing</hi> is put into the hands of Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Army under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi>; and (which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54836:74"/>
is more then was agreed on) an absolute Authority over all Provinces is committed to him, together with the glorious Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Governour and Captain-General of <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and the rest of the States United: which how it did displease the Queen; what course was took to mitigate and appease her anger; what happened in the war, betwixt him and the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>; and what cross Capers betwixt him and the States themselves, is not my purpose to relate. It is sufficient that we have presented to the eye of the Reader, upon what principles the <hi>Netherlands</hi> were first embroyled, whose hands they were by which the Altars were prophaned, the Images de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, Religious Houses rifled, and the Churches ruinated: And finally, by what party, and by whose strange practices, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was totally devested of all those Provinces, which since have cast themselves into the form of a Common-wealth.</p>

It was then pleaded, that they onely were to expound the Article, who had contributed their assistance to the making of it; and that it did appear by the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of their Doctrine from the first Reformation, that no other method of Predestination had been taught amongst them, then as it was maintained by <hi>Calvin</hi> and his Followers in their publick Writings; under which name, as those of <hi>Beza</hi>'s judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which embraced the <hi>Supralapsarian</hi> way desired to be comprehended; so did they severally pretend, that the words of the Confession did either countenance their Doctrines, or not contradict them. But on the other side, it was made as plainly to appear, that such of their first Reformers as were of the old <hi>Lutheran</hi> stamp, and had precedencie of time before those that followed <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement, imbraced the <hi>Melancthonian</hi> way of Predestination, and looked upon all such as Innovators in the publick Doctrines, who taught otherwise of it. By them it was declared, that in the year 1530, the Reformed Religion was admitted into the Neighbouring Country of <hi>East-Friesland</hi> under <hi>Enno</hi> the First, upon the Preaching of <hi>Harding Bergius</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divine of great Fame and Learning, and one of the principal Reformers of the Church of <hi>Embden,</hi> a Town of most note in all that Earldom; that from him <hi>Clemens Martini</hi> took those Principles, which he afterwards propagated in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces; that the same Doctrine had been publickly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54836:75"/>
in a Book called <hi>Odegus Laicorum,</hi> or the <hi>Lay mans Guide,</hi> published by <hi>Anastatius Velluanus, Anno</hi> 1554, which was ten years before the French Preachers had obtruded on them this Confession; that the said Book was much commended by <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus Antonides,</hi> Divinity-Reader in the University of <hi>Franeka</hi>; that notwithstanding this Confession, the Ministers successively in the whole Province of <hi>Vtrecht</hi> adhered unto their former Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, not looked on for so doing as the less reformed; that <hi>Gallicus Snecanus,</hi> a man of great fame for his Parts and Piety in the County of <hi>West-Friesland,</hi> esteemed no otherwise of those which were of <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement in the points disputed, then as of Innovators in the Doctrine which had been first received amongst them; that <hi>Iohannes Isbrandi,</hi> one of the old Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> did openly declare himself to be an <hi>Anti-Calvinian</hi>; and that the like was done by <hi>Holmannus</hi> Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of <hi>Leiden,</hi> by <hi>Cornelius Meinardi,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Wiggeri,</hi> men of principal esteem in their times and places. Which I have noted in this place, because it must be in and about these times, namely before the year 1585, in which most of these men lived and writ who are here remembred. What else was done in the pursuance of this controversie between the parties, will fall more properly under consideration in the last part of this History, and there we shall hear further of it.</p>
            <p n="62">62. Next, look upon them in their <hi>Tacticks,</hi> and we shall finde them as professed Enemies to all publick Liturgies and Forms of Prayer, as the rest of their <hi>Calvinian</hi> Brethren. They thought there was no speedier way to destroy the <hi>Mass,</hi> then by abolishing the <hi>Missals</hi>; nor any fitter means to exercise their own gifts in the acts of Prayer, then by suppressing all such Forms as seemed to put a restraint upon the Spirit. Onely they fell upon the humour of translating <hi>Davids Psalms</hi> into <hi>Dutch</hi> Meter, and caused them to be sung in their Congregations, as the <hi>French Psalms</hi> of <hi>Marrots</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi>'s Meter were in most Churches of that people. By which it seems, that they might sing by the Book, though they prayed by the Spirit; as if their singing by the Book in set Tunes and Numbers, imposed not as great a restraint upon the Spirit in the acts of Praising, as reading out of Book in the acts of Praying. But they knew well the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence which Musick hath on the souls of Men: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though they had suppressed the old manner of singing, and all the ancient Hymns which had been formerly received in the Catholick Church; yet singing they would have, and Hymns in Meter, as well to please their Ears, as to cheer their Spirits, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest their alacrity in the Service of God. And though they would not sing with Organs, for fear there might be somewhat in it of the old superstition; yet they retained them still in many of their Churches; but whether for civil entertainment when they met together, or to compose and settle their affections for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Offices, or to take up the time till the Church were filled,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54836:76"/>
I am not able to determine. The like they also did with all the ancient weekly and set-times of Fasting, which (following the Example of <hi>Aerius</hi>) they devoured at once, as contrary to that Christian Liberty, or licentiousness rather, to which they inured the people, when they first trained them up in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> No Fast observed, but when some pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick great occasion doth require it of them; and then but half-Fast neither, as in other places, making amends at night for the days forbearance. And if at any time they feed most on fish, as sometimes they do, it rather is for a variety to please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the use of Gods Creatures, or out of State-craft to encourage or maintain a Trade which is so beneficial to them; and rather as a civil then Religious Fast.</p>
            <p n="63">63. But there is no one thing wherein they more defaced the outward state of the Church, then in suppressing all those days of publick Worship which anciently were observed by the name of Festivals, together with their Eves or Vigils. In which they were so fearful of ascribing any honour to the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, whose names were honoured by those days, that they also took away those Anniversary Commemorations of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mercies in the Nativity, Passion, Resurrection and Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Savour Christ: which though retained amongst the <hi>Switzers,</hi> would not down with <hi>Calvin,</hi> and being disallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, were reprobated without more ado in all the Churches of his Platform, and in these with others. And though they kept the Lords day, or rather some part of it, for Religious meetings; yet either for fear of laying a restraint on their Christian Liberty, in Attributing any peculiar holiness to it which might entitle them to some superstition, they kept that neither but by halfs; it was sufficient to bestow an hour or two of the morning in Gods publick Service, the rest of the day should be their own, to be imployed as profit should advise, or their pleasures tempt them. And whereas in some places they still retained those afternoon-Meetings to which they had been bound of Duty by the Rules of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; it was decreed in one of their first Synods (that namely which was held at <hi>Dort,</hi> 1574) <note n="a" place="margin">

And if they had no Evening-Prayers, there is no question to be made but they had their Evening Pastimes, and that the afternoon was spent in such imployment as was most suitable to the condition of each several man. Nor was the morning so devoted to Religious uses, but that in some of their good Towns they kept upon that day the ordinary Fairs and Markets, (<hi>Kirk-Masses,</hi> as they commonly called them) which must needs draw away a great part of the people to attend those businesses, to which their several Trades and Occupations did most especially oblige them.

And whereas once <hi>Tertullian</hi> did upbraid the Gentiles for their irreverence in sitting before some of those Gods whom they pretended to adore; so might this people be reproached for using the same posture in all acts of Worship, but that they do it purposely to avoid all outward signes of Adoration: even in the Sacrament of the Supper, in which it cannot be denyed but that our Saviour is more eminently present then in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Divine Ordinance of what name soever, they are so fearful of relapsing to their old Idolatries (if by that name they may be called) that they chuse rather to receive it in any posture, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or standing, yea, or walking, then reverently upon their knees.

More of the like stuff might be produced from the Acts of their Synods, but that this little is too much to inform the Reader how different they are, both in their Discipline and Doctrine, in point of speculation, and matter of practice, from that which was most countenanced by the piety of the Primitive times, and recommended to them by the constant and uniform tradition of the ages following.</p>

As is their work, such is the wages they received; and as the reverence is which they give to Christ in his holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, such is the honour which is paid them by the common people. They had abolished the <hi>daily Sacrifice</hi> of Praise and Prayer, which might have been continued, though the <hi>Mass</hi> was abrogated; disclaimed the hearing of Confessions, the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Sick, and Sacerdotal Absolution, as inconsistent with the purity of their Profession; took away all the annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Festivals, with their Eves and Vigils; and in a word, reduced the whole Service of their Ministry to the Sunday-Morning: Which hardly taking up the tenth part of time expended for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by the Priests on Religious Offices, they were so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious as to rest contented with little more then the tenth part of those yearly profits which by the Priest had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.

a <hi>Iewish</hi> maintainance improper and unfit for Ministers of the holy Gospel, when they were paid unto the Clergy of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that at the last the people took them at their word, believe them to be so indeed; and are spurred on the faster to a change of Religion, in which they saw some glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of a present profit. Of these mistakes the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was too wise not to make advantage; giving assurance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Tythes in the mean time to be brought into the common Treasury toward the charges of the War, the Ministers to be maintained by contributions at an easie rate. But when the War was come to so fair an issue, that they thought to be exempted from the payment of Tythes, answer was made, that they should pay none to the Ministers, as they had done formerly, whereby their Ministers in effect were become their <hi>Masters</hi>; but that the Tythes were so considerable a Revenue to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, that the State could not possibly subsist without them; that therefore they must be content to pay them to the States Commissioners, as they had done hitherto; and that the State would take due care to maintain a Ministry. By means whereof they do not only pay their Tythes as in former times; but seeing how much the publick allowance of the State doth come short of a competencie (thoughby that name they please to call it) they are constrained, as it were, out of common charity, if not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled thereto by order, to contribute over and above with the rest of the people, for the improvement and increase of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters maintainance.

               <note place="margin">1527.</note>2. It was about the year 1527, that the Reformation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion begun by <hi>Luther,</hi> was first preached in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Ministry of one <hi>Patrick Hamilton,</hi> a man of eminent Nobility in regard of his birth, as being Brothers Son to <hi>Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran</hi>; but far more eminent in those times for his parts and piety, then the Nobility of his House: spending some time at <hi>Witteberg</hi> in the pursuit of his Studies, he grew into acquaintance with <hi>Martin Luther, Philip Melancthon,</hi> and other men of name and note in that University; and being seasoned with their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he openly declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against Pilgrimages, Purgatory, Prayer to the Saints, and for the dead, without going further. And further as he did not go, so indeed he could not. For on the noise of these his preachings, he was prevailed with by <hi>Iames Beton</hi> Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> to repair to that City; but was so handled at his coming, that after some examinations he was condemned to the fire: which sentence was inflicted on him on the last of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi> But the Church is never made more fruitful, then when the soyl thereof is watered with the blood of Martyrs. For presently upon the commi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n to look into the Reasons of such great severities, and were the more inquisitive after all particulars, because they had not been affrighted with the like Example in the memory of the oldest man which then lived amongst them. By this means the opinions of this man being known abroad, found many which approved, but very few which had just reason to condemn them; and passing thus from hand to hand, gave further cause to those of the Popish Party to be watchful over them. And for long time they were on the suffering hand, patiently yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their lives to the Executioners, wheresoever any sentence of death was past upon them. And it stood till the decease of King <hi>Iames</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1542, when the unsetledness of Affairs, the tender infancie of the young Queen, not above nine days old at the death of her Father, and the conferring of the Regencie after some disputes on <hi>Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> who was thought to favour their opinions, imboldned them to appear more openly in defence of themselves, and to attempt upon the Chiefs of the contrary party; whereof they gave a terrible Example in the death of Cardinal <hi>David Beton,</hi> immediately or not long after the cruel burning of <hi>George Wischart</hi> (whose name is mollified by <hi>Buchanan</hi> into <hi>Sofocardius</hi>) a man of great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem amongst them, who having spent some time in <hi>France,</hi> and being conversant with some <hi>Calvinists</hi> of that Nation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54836:78"/>
into his Native Country with such <hi>French</hi> Commissioners as were sent unto the Earl of <hi>Arran, Anno</hi> 1544. In little time he had gained unto himself so many followers, that he became formidable to the greatest Prelates; but unto none more then unto Cardinal <hi>David Beton,</hi> Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> also, and Nephew unto <hi>Iames</hi> his Predecessor. By whose Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and procurement he was condemned to the like death as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> before had suffered, in the year next following.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Amongst the followers of this man (the most remarkable in reference to my present purpose) were <hi>Norman Lesly</hi> eldest Son to the Earl of <hi>Rothes, Iohn Lesly</hi> Uncle unto <hi>Norman, Iames Melvin,</hi> and the <hi>Kirkaldies</hi> Lairds of <hi>Grange.</hi> By whom and others of that party, a plot was laid to surprise the Castle, and take revenge upon the Cardinal for the death of <hi>Wishart.</hi> Having possest themselves of the Gates of the Castle, they forced their way into his Chamber, and were upon the point of striking the fatal blow, when <hi>Iames Melvin</hi> told them with great shews of gravity, that the business was not to be acted with such heat and passion. And thereupon holding a Ponyard at his brest, put him in minde of shedding the innocent bloud of that famous Martyr Mass <hi>George Wishart,</hi> which now called loud to God for vengeance, in whose name they were come to do justice on him: which said, he made this protestation, That neither hatred to his person, nor love to his Riches, nor the fear of any thing concerning his own particular, had moved him to the undertaking of that execution; but onely because he had been, and still remained an obstinate enemy against Christ Jesus and his holy Gospel. Upon which words, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any answer, or giving the poor man any time of appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Father of Mercies, he stabbed him twice or thrice into the body with so strong a malice, that he left him dead upon the place.<note place="margin">1546.</note> In the relating of which Murder in <hi>Knox</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But to proceed unto my story: it was upon the 29 of <hi>May,</hi> that the Murderers possest themselves of that strong peece, into which many flocked from all parts of the Realm, both to congratulate the act, and assist the Actors: So that at last they cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a Congregation, and chose <hi>Iohn Rough,</hi> (who after suffered death in <hi>England</hi>) to be one of their Preachers;<note place="margin">1547.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> that great incendiary of the Realm of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them. And thus they stood upon their guard till the coming of one and twenty Gallies, and some Land-Forces out of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54836:79"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> by whom the Castle was besieged, and so fiercely bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that they were forced to yeild on the last of <hi>Iuly,</hi> without obtaining any better conditions then the hope of life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Castle being yeilded, and the Country quieted, the <hi>French</hi> returned with their booty, of which their Prisoners which they brought along with them made the principal part; not made the tamer by their sufferings in the enemies Gallies; insomuch that when the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was offered to them to be kissed on some solemn occasion, one of them snatched it into his hands, flung it into the Sea, and said unto them that brought it, in a jeering manner, <hi>That her Ladyship was light enough, and might learn to swim.</hi> Which desperate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advised action (as it was no other) is said by <hi>Knox</hi> to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this good effect, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were never after tempted to the like Idolatries.<note place="margin">1550.</note> 
               <hi>Knox</hi> at this time was Prisoner in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies amongst the rest, and with the rest released upon the Peace made between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> at the delivering up of <hi>Bulloigne</hi>; from whence he past over into <hi>England,</hi> where he was first made Preacher at <hi>Barwick,</hi> next at <hi>New-castle,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to some Church of <hi>London</hi>; and finally, in some other places of the <hi>South:</hi> so that removing like our late <hi>Itinerants</hi> from one Church to another, as he could meet with entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he kept himself within that Sanctuary till the death of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and then betook himself to <hi>Geneva</hi> for his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Studies: From hence he published his desperate Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Predestination, which he makes not onely to be an impulsive to, but the compulsive cause of mens sins and mens wickednesses: From hence he published his trayterous and seditious Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>The first blast of the Trumpet,</hi> in which he writes most bitterly, amongst other things, against the Regiment of Women, aiming therein particularly at the two <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. By this means he grew great with <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the most leading men of the <hi>Consistorians,</hi> who looked upon him as a proper Engine to advance their purposes: But long he had not stayed amongst them, when he received an invitation from some Friends of his of the same temper and affections, as it after

proved, to take charge of the Church of <hi>Frankfort</hi>; to which some learned men and others of the <hi>English</hi> Nation had retired themselves in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> which call he first communicated unto <hi>Calvin,</hi> by whose encouragement and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion he accepted of it, and by his coming rather multiplyed then appeased the quarrels which he found amongst them: But siding with the inconformable party, and knowing so much of <hi>Calvins</hi> minde touching the Liturgie and Rites of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he would by no means be perswaded to officiate by it; and for that cause was forced by Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi> and others of the Learned men who remained there, to forsake the place, as hath been shewn at large in another place.<note place="margin">1555.</note> Outed at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> he returns again to his Friends at <hi>Geneva</hi>; and being furnished with instructions for his future carriage in the cause of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, he prepares for his journey into <hi>Scotland,</hi> passeth to <hi>Dieppe,</hi> form thence to <hi>England,</hi> and at last came a welcome man to his Native Country, which he found miserably divided into sides and factions. <hi>Mary</hi> their Infant Queen had been transported into <hi>France</hi> at six years of age; the Regency taken from <hi>Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> given to <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>

From Villages and private Houses, he ventured into some of the great Towns and more eminent Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and at the last appeared in <hi>Edenborough</hi> it self, preaching in all, and ministring the Communion in many places, as he saw occasion. This was sufficient to have raised a greater storm against him then he could have been able to indure; but he must make it worse by a new provocation. For at the perswasion of the Earl of <hi>Glencarne,</hi> and some others of his principal fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, he writes a long Letter to the Queen Regent, in which he earnestly perswades her to give ear to the Word of God, according as it was then preached by himself and others: which Letter being communicated by the Queen to the Archbishop of <hi>Glasco,</hi> and dispersed in several Copies by <hi>Knox</hi> himself, gave such a hot Alarm to the Bishops and Clergy, that he was cited to appear in <hi>Blackfryars</hi> Church in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> on the 15 of <hi>May:</hi> and though upon advertisement that he came accompanied with so great a train, that it could not be safe for them to proceed against him, he was not troubled at that time; yet he perceived that having made the Queen his enemy, he could not
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54836:80"/>
hope to remain longer in that Kingdom, but first or last he must needs fall in their hands.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But so it happened, that when he was in the midst of these perplexities, he received a Letter from the Schismatical <hi>English</hi> which repaired to <hi>Geneva,</hi> when they had lost all hope of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the <hi>English</hi> Liturgie in the Church of <hi>Frankfort,</hi> by which he was invited to return to his former charge: this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he communicated to his principal Friends, resolves to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the offer, and prepares all things for his journey. And to say truth, it was but time that he should set forwards; for the danger followed him so close, that within few days after his departure, he was condemned for not appearing, and burnt in his <hi>Effigies</hi> at the Cross in <hi>Edenborough.</hi> But first he walks his round, visits all his Churches, takes a more solemn farewel of his especial Friends; and having left sufficient instructions with them for carrying on the Reformation in despite of Authority, in the latter end of <hi>Iuly</hi> he sets sail for <hi>France.</hi> His party was by this time grown strong and numerous, resolved to follow such directions as he left behind him. To which encouraged by the preaching of one <hi>Willock,</hi> whom <hi>Knox</hi> had more especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to them in the time of his absence, they stole away the Images out of most of their Churches; and were so ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous, as to take down the great Image of St. <hi>Gyles</hi> in the chief Church of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> which they drowned first in the <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lake,</hi> and burnt it afterwards. But this was but a Prologue to the following Comedy. The Festival of St. <hi>Gyles</hi> draws near, in which the Image of that Saint was to be carryed through the chief Streets of <hi>Edenborough</hi> in a solemn Procession, attended by all the Priests, Fryars, and other Religious persons about that City: another Image is borrowed from the <hi>Gray-Fryars</hi> to supply the place; and for the honour of the day, the Queen Regent her self was pleased to make one in the Pageant. But no sooner was she retired to her private repose, when a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Rabble of the <hi>Knoxian</hi> Brethren brake in upon them, dismounted the Image, brake off his head against the stones, scattered all the Company, pulled the Priests Surplices over their Ears, beat down their Crosses; and, in a word, so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed the Order of that mock-Solemnity, that happy was the man who could first save himself in some House or other; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Bag-pipes, nor their Banners, their Tabrets, nor their Trumpets, which made a Principal part in that days triumph, though free enough from superstition in themselves, could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape their fury, but ran the same Fortune with the rest. And though no diligence was wanting for finding out the principal actors in that Commotion; yet as the story hath informed us, the Brethren kept themselves together in such Companies, singing of <hi>Psalms,</hi> and openly encouraging one another, that no body durst lay hands upon them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Finding by this experiment that they were strong enough
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54836:80"/>
to begin the work, it was thought fit to call back <hi>Knox</hi> to their assistance; to which end they dispatched their Letters to him in the <hi>March</hi> next following, to be conveyed by one <hi>Iames Sym,</hi> whom they had throughly instructed in all particulars touching their affairs. In <hi>May</hi> the Letters are delivered, the contents whereof he first communicateth to his own Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and afterwards to <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the rest of the Brethren of that Consistory, by whom it was unanimously declared unto him, <hi>that he could not refuse that Vocation, unless he would shew himself rebellious unto his God, and unmerciful to his native Country.</hi> He returned answer thereupon, That he would visit them in <hi>Scotland</hi> with all convenient expedition, and comes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to <hi>Dieppe</hi> in <hi>October</hi> following;<note place="margin">1557.</note> where contrary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation he is advertised by Letters from some secret Friends, that all affairs there seemed to be at a stand, so that his coming to them at that time might be thought unnecessary. Highly displeased with such a cooling Card as he did not look for, he sends his Letters thence to the Nobility and principal Gentry; in which he lets them know how much he was confounded for travailing so far in their Affairs, by moving them to the most Godly and most Learned men (by which he means <hi>Calvin</hi> and the <hi>Consistorians</hi>) who at that time did live in <hi>Europe,</hi> whose judgements and grave counsels he conceived expedient, as well for the assurance of their own Consciences as of his own; that it must needs redound both to his shame and theirs, if nothing should succeed in such long consultations; that he left his Flock and Family at <hi>Geneva</hi> to attend their service, to whom he should be able to make but a weak account of his leaving them in that condi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Finally, having laid before them many
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54836:81"/>
strong inducements to quicken them unto the work, he ends with this most memorable Aphorism, (which is indeed the sum and substance of the whole <hi>Consistorian</hi> Doctrine in the present case) that the Reformation of Religion, and of publick enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, doth appertain to more then the Clergy, or chief Rulers called Kings.</p>

On the receiving of these Letters, they are resolved to proceed in their former purpose, and would rather commit themselves and all theirs to the greatest dangers, then suffer that Religion which they called Idolatry any longer to remain amongst them, or the people to be so defrauded as they had been formerly, of that which they esteemed to be the onely true preaching of Christ's Gospel. And to this end they entred into a common Bond or Covenant, in the name of themselves, their Vassals, Tenants and dependants, dated upon the third of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemb.</hi> and subscribed by the Earls of <hi>Arguile, Glencarne</hi> and <hi>Morton,</hi> the Lords <hi>Lorne, Ereskin</hi> of <hi>Dun, &amp;c.</hi> the Tenour of which was as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p n="10">10. Having subscribed unto this Bond, their next care was to issue out these directions following, for the promoting of the work which they were in hand with: 1. That in all Parishes of that Realm, the Common-prayer-book (that is to say, the Common-prayer book of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) should be read upon the Sundays and Holydays in the Parish-Church, together with the Lessons of the Old and New Testament by the same ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54836:81"/>
2. That preaching and interpretation of Scripture be had and used in private Houses, without any great convention of the people at them, till it should please God to put it into the heart of the Prince to allow thereof in publick Churches. And had they stood to that, they had been unblameable; but finding by the Subscriptions which they had received from all parts of the Kingdom, that they were nothing inferiour to their Adversaries in power and number, they were not able to hold long in so good an humour. Howsoever it was thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, for the avoiding of Scandal,<note place="margin">1558.</note> that they should first proceed in the way of supplication to the Queen and Council; in which it was desired, that it might be lawful for them to meet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly or privately for having the Common-prayers in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue; that the Sacrament of Baptism might be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in the same Tongue also; the Sacrament of the Lords Supper in both kindes, according to Christs Institution; and that a Reformation might be made of the wicked lives of Prelates, Priests, and other Ecclesiastical persons. The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was in the mean time Married to the <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> upon whose head it was desired by the <hi>French</hi> that at the least the Matrimonial Crown should be solemnly placed; and that all the <hi>French</hi> Nation should forthwith be naturalized in the Realm of <hi>Scotland.</hi> For the better effecting whereof, in the following Parliament, the Queen Regent thought it no ill peece of State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft so far to gratifie the Petitioners in their desires, as to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense them to meet in publick or private for the exercise of their own Religion, so that it were not in the City of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> or the Port of <hi>Leith,</hi> for fear some Tumult or Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might ensue upon it. But not content with this Indulgence, they were resolved to move the Parliament for an Abrogation of all former Laws made against Sects and Heresies, by which they might incur the loss of Life, Land or Liberty; and that none of their profession should be condemned for Heresie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they were first convinced by the Word of God to have erred from the Faith which the holy Spirit witnesseth to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to mans Salvation.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But hereunto they could not get the Queens consent. And thereupon they caused a Protestation to be drawn, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly pronounced in the face of the Parliament, in which it was declared, amongst other things, that neither they, nor any other of the Godly who pleased to joyn with them in the true Faith grounded upon the Word of God, should incur any danger of Life or Lands, or other particular pains, for not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving such acts as have passed heretofore in favour of their Adversaries, or for violating such Rites as have been invented by man without the Commandment of God; that if any Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult or Uproar should happen to arise in the Realm, or that any violence should be used in reforming of such things as were amiss in the state of the Church, the blame should not be laid
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54836:82"/>
on them, who had desired that all things might be rectified by publick Order: And finally, that they pretended to no other end, but onely for the reforming of such abuses as were found in Religion; and therefore that they might no otherwise be thought of, then as faithful and obedient Subjects to Supreme Authority. And now the Scheme begins to open: the Town of <hi>Perth,</hi> by some called St. <hi>Iohnstone,</hi> declared in favour of the Lords of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> which name they had took unto themselves; the news whereof was so unpleasing to the Queen, that she commanded the Lord <hi>Ruthuen,</hi> a man of principal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the parts adjoyning, to take some order for suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing those Innovations in Religion which some busie people of that Town had introduced: To which he answered, That he was able, if she pleased, to force their bodies, and to seize their goods; but that he had no power to compel their Consciences: which answer did not more displease the Queen,<note place="margin">1559.</note> then it encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged those of the Congregation; who now from all parts flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Perth,</hi> as a Town strong by scituation, well fortified, and standing in a fruitful Country, from whence they might receive all necessaries, if any open force or violence should be used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>Knox</hi> in the mean time had retreated to his charge at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> not thinking fit to tempt that danger by an unseasonable return, which he had so narrowly escaped at his being there. He onely waited opportunity to go back with safety, and would not stir, though frequently sollicited by his Friends in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> In so much, that means was made to <hi>Calvin</hi> by especial Letters, to re-ingage him in the Cause: Which Letters were brought to him in the Month of <hi>November, Anno</hi> 1558. And that it may appear what influence <hi>Calvin</hi> had upon all the counsels and designes of the Congregation, he is advertised from time to time of their successes, of the estate of their Affairs, whether good or bad; in so much, that when the Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent had fed them with some flattering hopes, <hi>Calvin</hi> is forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with made acquainted with their happiness in it. And who but he must be desired to write unto her? that by his <hi>Grave counsel and exhortation,</hi> she might be <hi>animated</hi> to go forward constantly in promoting the Gospel. But though these Letters came to <hi>Calvin</hi> in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> yet we finde not <hi>Knox</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> till the <hi>May</hi> next following, when those of his party had possessed themselves of the Town of <hi>Perth:</hi> though he loved <hi>Calvin</hi> well, and the Gospel better, yet all that a man hath he will give for his life; and <hi>Knox</hi> was dearer to himself then either of them. But unto <hi>Perth</hi> he comes at last, on the fifth of <hi>May.</hi> In the chief Church whereof he preached such a thundring Sermon against the <hi>Adoration of Images,</hi> and the advancing of them in places of Gods publick Worship, as suddenly beat down all the Images and Religious Houses within the Precincts of that Town. For presently after the end of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54836:82"/>
the Sermon, when almost all the rest of the people were gone home to dinner, some few which remained in the Church pull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which being dispatched, they did the like execution on all the rest in that Church; and were so nimble at their work, that they had made a clear riddance of them, before the tenth man in the Town was advertised of it. The news hereof causeth the <hi>Rascal Multitude</hi> (so my Author calls them) to resort in great numbers to the Church. But because they found that all was done before they came, they fell with great fury on the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of <hi>Carthusian</hi> Monks, and the Houses of the Preaching and <hi>Franciscan</hi> Fryars, beginning wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in the ruinating of these Houses, they continued with much force and eagerness, so that within the compass of two days, they had left nothing standing of those goodly Edifices but the outward Walls.</p>
            <p n="13">13. It was reported that the Queen was so inraged when she heard the news, that she vowed utterly to destroy the Town, Man, Woman and Childe, to consume the same with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which exhortation so prevailed upon most of the hearers, that immediately they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themselves to the pulling down of Altars and Images; and finally, destroyed all Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry which they found in the Town.

By the accession of which strength, they first secured themselves by a Capitulation from any danger by the <hi>French,</hi> and then proceeded to the removing of the Queens Garrison out of <hi>Perth,</hi> which they also effected.

And though the Noblemen, and even <hi>Knox</hi> himself, endeavoured to appease the people, and to stop their fury, that so the place might be preserved; yet all endeavours proved in vain, or were coldly followed. So that in fine, a ter some spoyl made in defacing of Images, and digging up great quantity of hidden goods which were buried there, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in expectation of a better day; they committed the whole House to the Mercie of Fire; the flame whereof gave grief to some, and joy to others of St. <hi>Iohn stones,</hi> scituate not above a Mile from that famous Abby.</p>
            <p n="14">14. They had no sooner plaid this prize, but some of the Chiefs of them were advertised that Queen Regent had a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of putting some <hi>French</hi> Forces into <hi>Sterling,</hi> the better to cut off all intercourse and mutual succours which those of the Congregation on each side of the <hi>Fryth</hi> might otherwise have of one another. For the preventing of which mischief, the Earl of <hi>Arguile</hi> and the Lord <hi>Iames Steward</hi> were dispatched away: Whose coming so inflamed the zeal of the furious multitude, that they pulled down all the Monasteries which were in the Town; demolished all the Altars, and defaced all the Images in the Churches of it. The Abbey of <hi>Cambuskenneth,</hi> near ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to it, was then ruined also: Which good success en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them to go on to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> that the like Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation might be made in the capital City. Taking <hi>Linlithgow</hi> in their way, they committed the like spoyl there, as before at <hi>Sterling</hi>; but were prevented of the glory which they chiefly aimed at in the Saccage of <hi>Edenborough.</hi> Upon the news of their approach, though their whole Train exceeded not three hundred persons, the Queen Regent with great fear retires to <hi>Dunbar</hi>; and the Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> being then Provest of the Town, staid not long behind. But he was scarce gone out of the City, when the <hi>Rascal Rabble</hi> fell on the Religious Houses, destroyed the Covents of the <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>Gray-fryars,</hi> with all the other Monasteries about the Town, and shared amongst them all the goods which they found in those Houses: In which they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54836:83"/>
made such quick dispatch, that they had finished that part of the Reformation, before the two Lords and their attendants could come in to help them.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The Queen Regent neither able to endure these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, nor of sufficient power to prevent or punish them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it most expedient to allay these humours for the present by some gentle Lenitive, that she might hope the better to extinguish them in the time to come: which when she had endeavoured, but with no effect, she caused a Proclamation to be published in the name of the King and Queen; in which it was declared, <hi>That she perceived a seditious Tumult to be raised by a part of the Lieges, who named themselves the</hi> Congregation, <hi>and under pretence of Religion had taken Arms; Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t by the advice of the Lords of the Council, for satisfying every mans Conscience, and pacifying the present troubles, she had made offer to call a Parliament in</hi> January <hi>then following (but would call it sooner if they pleased) for establishing an Vniversal Order in Affairs of Religion; That in the mean time every man should be suffered to live at liberty, using their own Consciences without trouble until further order; That those who called themselves of the</hi> Congregation, <hi>rejecting all reasonable offers, had made it manifest by their actions, that they did not so much seek for satisfaction in point of Religion, as the subversion of the Crown. For proof whereof, she instanced in some secret intelligence which they had in</hi> England, <hi>seizing the Irons of the Mans, and Coyning Money, that being one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Iewels of the Royal Diadem. In which regard she straightly willeth and commandeth all manner of persons (not being Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the City) to depart from</hi> Edenborough <hi>within six hours after publication thereof, and live obedient to her Authority, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they would be holden and reputed Traytors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. This Proclamation they encountred with another, which they published in their own names for satisfaction of the people, some of which had begun to shrink from them at the noise of the former. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>herein they made known to all whom it may concern, <hi>That such crimes as they were charged with, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entred into their hearts; That they had no other inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then to banish Idolatry, to advance true Religion, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Preachers of it; That they were ready to continue in all duty toward their Soveraign, and her Mother there Regent, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they might have the free exercise of their own Religion. In reference to their medling with the Irons of the Mint, and the Coyning of Money, they justified themselves, as being most of them Councellors born, and doing nothing in it but for the good of the people.</hi> To which effect they writ their Letters also to the Regent her self, whom they assured in the close, that if she would make use of her authority for the abolishing of Idolatry and Superstitious abuses which agreed not with the Word of God, she should finde them as obedient as any Subjects within the Realm. Which in plain truth was neither more nor less then
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54836:84"/>
this, that if they might not have their wills in the point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, she was to look for no obedience from them in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: whereof they gave sufficient proof by their staying in <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> her command to the contrary notwithstanding; by pressing more then ever for a toleration, and adding this over and above to their former demands, that such <hi>French</hi> Forces as remained in <hi>Scotland</hi> might be disbanded and sent back to their native Country. In the first of which demands they were so unreasonable, that when the Queen offered them the exercise of their own Religion, upon condition that when she had occasion to make use of any of their Churches for her own Devotions, such exercise might be suspended, and the Mass onely used in that conjuncture; they would by no means yeild unto it: And they refused to yeild unto it for this Reason onely, because it would be in her power, by removing from one place unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to leave them without any certain Exercise of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which in effect was utterly to overthrow it. And hereto they were pleased to add, that, as they could not hinder her from exercising any Religion which she had a minde to (but this was more then they would stand to in their better Fortunes) so could they not agree that the Ministers of Christ should be silenced upon any occasion, and much less, that the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God should give place to Idolatry. A point to which they stood so stifly, that when the Queen Regent had resetled her Court at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> she could neither prevail so far up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Magistrates of that City, as either to let her have the Church of St. <hi>Gyles</hi> to be appropriated onely to the use of the Mass, or that the Mass might be said in it at such vacant times in which they made no use of it for themselves or their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</p>
            <p n="17">17. But in their other demands for sending the <hi>French</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they were not like to finde any such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance as had been offered in the former. <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>France</hi> dyed about that time, and left the Crown to <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, Married not long before to the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>; the preservation of whose power and prerogative Royal must be his concernment. And he declared himself so sensible of those indignities which had been lately put upon her, as to protest, that he would rather spend the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> then not be revenged of the seditious Tumults raised in <hi>Scotland:</hi> in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of which resolution, he sends over a <hi>French</hi> Captain, called <hi>Octavian,</hi> who brought with him a whole Regiment of Souldiers, great sums of money, and all provisions necessary to maintain a War. Followed not long after with four Companies more, which made up twenty Ensigns compleat, together with four Ships of War, both to defend the Town of <hi>Leith,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Haven. Incouraged with whose coming, the Queen Regent did not onely fortifie that Town, but put a strong Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the <hi>French</hi> into it; which gave a new grievance unto
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54836:84"/>
those of the <hi>Congregation</hi>; the Trade and Town of <hi>Edenborough</hi> being like by this means to be brought under her command, and to rest wholly in a manner at her devotion. The breach made wider on the one side by the taking of the Fort of <hi>Bough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Crag</hi> into the hands of those of the <hi>Congregation</hi>; which was pretended to be done, for fear lest otherwise it might have been seized on by the <hi>French</hi>; and on the other side, by the coming of two thousand <hi>French</hi> Souldiers out of <hi>France,</hi> under pretence of being a Convoy to the Bishop of <hi>Amiens,</hi> and some other persons, sent thither to dispute (as it was given out) with the <hi>Scotish</hi> Ministers. Which great accession of <hi>French</hi> Forces so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed the Lords of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> that they excited the whole Kingdom by a publick Writing to arm against them; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring all those which were, or desired to be accounted for n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Scotch-men, to judge betwixt the Queen and them, and not abstract the just and dutiful support from their Native Country in so needful a time; assuring them, that whosoever did otherwise, should be esteemed betrayers of their Country to the power of strangers.</p>
            <p n="18">18. And that the people might not cool in the midst of this heat, they draw their Forces together, and march toward <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> on the 18 of <hi>October</hi>; upon the news whereof, the Queen Regent put her self into <hi>Leith</hi> as the safer place, and leaves them Masters of the City: From whence they send a Letter to her, requiring in a peremptory and imperious manner, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications about <hi>Leith</hi> be forthwith slighted, the Forts about the same to be demolished, and all strange Souldiers to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately removed: Which if she not pleased to do, they must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think themselves of some such other remedies as they thought most necessary. But when their Messenger returned unsatisfied, and that <hi>Lyon</hi> King at Arms was sent presently after him, commanding them amongst other things to remove from <hi>Edenborough,</hi> they then resolve for putting that in execution which had been long before in deliberation; that is to say, the deposing of the Queen Regent from the publick Government. But first, they must consult with their Ghostly Fathers, that by their countenance and authority, they might more certainly prevail upon all such persons as seemed unsatisfied in the point. <hi>Willock</hi> and <hi>Knox</hi> are chosen above all the rest to resolve this doubt, if at the least any of them doubted of it, which may well be questioned. They were both Factors for <hi>Geneva,</hi> and therefore both obliged to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance her interest. <hi>Willock</hi> declares, that albeit God had appointed Magistrates onely to be his Lieutenants on Earth, honouring them with his own title, and calling them Gods; yet did he never so establish any, but that for just causes they might be deprived. Which having proved by some Examples out of holy Scripture, he thereupon inferred, that since the Queen Regent had denyed her chief Duty to the Subjects of this Realm, which was to preserve them from invasion of Strangers, and to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54836:85"/>
suffer the Word of God to be freely preached: seeing also she was a maintainer of superstition, and despised the counsel of the Nobility; he did think they might justly deprive her from all Regiment and Authority over rhem. <hi>Knox</hi> goes to work more cautiously, but comes home at last: For having first approved whatsoever had been said by <hi>Willock,</hi> he adds this to it, That the iniquity of the Queen Regent ought not to withdraw their hearts from the obedience due to their Soveraign; nor did he wish that any such sentence against her should be pronounced, but that when she should change her course, and submit her self to good counsels, there should be place left unto her of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress to the same honours from which for just cause she ought to be deprived.</p>
            <p n="19">19. So said the Oracle: and as the Oracle decreed, so the sentence passed; for presently upon this judgement in the case, a publick Instrument is drawn up, in which the most part of the passages in the course of her Government were censured as grievances and oppressions on the Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the violating of the Laws of the Land, the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the enslaving of them to the power and domination of strangers. In which respect, they declare her to be fallen from the publick Government; discharge all Officers and others from yeilding any obedience to her; subscribing this Instrument with their hands, requiring it to be published in all the Head-Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs of the Kingdom, and causing it to be proclaimed with sound of Trumpet. Thus they began with the Queen Regent; but we shall see them end with the Queen her self, their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted Soveraign. This Instrument bears date on the 23 of <hi>October,</hi> a memorable day for many notable occurrences which have hapned on it in our Brittish Stories. Of all these doings, they advertised her by express Letters, sent back by the same Herald who had brought her last message to them; and having so done, they resolve immediately to try their fortune upon <hi>Leith</hi> in the way of <hi>Scalada.</hi> But the worst was, the Souldiers would not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ight without present money, and money they had none to pay them on so short a warning. Somewhat was raised by way of Contribution, but would not satisfie. And thereupon it was advised, that the Lords and other great men should bring in their Plate, and cause it to be presently melted, to content the Souldiers. But they who had so long made a gain of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, did not love Godliness so well, as not to value and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their gain before it. And therefore some had so contrived it, that the Irons of the <hi>Mint</hi> were missing; and by that hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some fraud they preserved their Plate.</p>
            <p n="20">20. It was not to be thought that the <hi>Scots</hi> durst have been so bold in the present business, if they had not been encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged underhand from some Friends in <hi>England</hi>; which the Queen Regent well observed, and prest it on them in her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, as before was noted. To which particular, though
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54836:85"/>
the Confederates made no reply in their Anti-remonstrance at that time, yet afterwards they both acknowledged and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their intelligence with the English Nation. For in a subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Declaration, <hi>They acknowledge plainly, that many Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages had past betwixt them, and that they had craved some sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from thence; but that it was onely to maintain Religion, and suppress Idolatry. And they conceived that in so doing, they had done nothing which might make them subject unto any just cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; it being lawful for them, where their own power failed, to seek assistance from their Neighbours.</hi> And now or never was the time to make use of such helps, their Contribution falling short, and the Plate not coming to the Mint, as had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. In which extremity it was advised to try some secret Friends at <hi>Barwick,</hi> especially Sir <hi>Ralph Sudlieur</hi> and Sir <hi>Iames Crofts</hi>; by whose encouragement it may be thought they had gone so far, that now there was no going back without manifest ruine. By the assistance of these men, they are furnished with four thousand Crowns in ready Money. But the Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent had advertisement of the negotiation, and intercepts it by the way. The news of this ill Fortune makes the Souldiers desperate; some of them secretly steal away, others refuse to venture upon any service; so that the Lords and others of the chief Confederates are put upon a necessity of forsaking <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> immediately take possession of it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Ministers, and most of those who profest the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion, to desert their dwellings; restore the Mass, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile with many Ceremonies the chief Church of the City (I mean that dedicated unto St. <hi>Gyles</hi>) as having been prophaned by Heretical Preachings. But the abandoning of <hi>Edenborough</hi> proved the ruine of <hi>Glasgow.</hi> To which Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing, he caused all the Images and Altars to be pulled down, and made himself Master of the Castle; out of which, upon the noise of the Bishops coming with some Bands of <hi>French,</hi> he withdraws again, and quits the Town unto the Victor. No way now left to save their persons from the Law, their Estates from forfeiture, their Country from the <hi>French,</hi> and their Religion from the Pope, but to cast themselves upon the favour of the Qeeen of <hi>England.</hi> And to that course as the Lord <hi>Iames</hi> did most incline, and <hi>Knox</hi> most preached for, so there might be some probable Reasons which might assure them of not failing of their expectations.</p>
            <p n="21">21. No sooner was Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England</hi> dead, but <hi>Mary</hi> the young Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> not long before Married to the <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> takes on her self the name and title of Queen of <hi>England</hi>; the Arms whereof she quarters upon all her Plate, some of her Coyn, and upon no small part of her Houshold-Furniture. Which though she did not (as she did afterwards alledge) of her own accord, but as she was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled in it by the perswasion of her Husband, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54836:86"/>
(which was not in her to dispute) of the King his Father; yet Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> looked upon it as a publick opposition to her own Pretensions, an open disallowing of her Title to the Crown of this Realm. She had good reason to presume that they by whose Authority and Counsel she was devested of her Title, would leave no means untryed, nor no stone unmoved, by the rouling whereof she might be tumbled out of her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and deprived also of her Kingdom. Which jealousie so justly setled, received no small increase, from the putting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of so many <hi>French,</hi> distributing them into so many Garrisons, but more especially, by their fortifying of the Town of <hi>Leith</hi>; at which Gate all the strengths of <hi>France</hi> might enter when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion served: And then how easie a passage might they have into <hi>England?</hi> divided only by small Rivers in some places, and in some other places not divided at all. But that which most assured her of their ill intentions, was the great preparations lately made by the Marquiss of <hi>Elboeuf</hi> one of the Brothers of the Queen Regent, and consequently Uncle to the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi> For though he was so distressed by tempests, that eighteen Ensignes were cast away on the Coast of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the rest forced for the present to return into <hi>France,</hi> yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, with one thousand Foot, and some remainders of his Horse, he recovered <hi>Leith,</hi> and joyned himself unto the rest of that Nation, who were there disposed of. Of all which passages and provocations, the Chief Confederates of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation were so well informed, as might assure them that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would be easily moved for her own securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to aid them in expelling the <hi>French,</hi> and then the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Religion, and the securing of themselves, their Estates and Families, would come in of course.</p>
            <p n="22">
               <note place="margin">1560.</note>22. It was upon this Reason of State, and not for any quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel about Religion, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> put her self into Arms, and lent the <hi>Scots</hi> a helping hand to remove the <hi>French.</hi> And by the same she might have justified her self before all the World, if she had followed those advantages which were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her by it, and seized into her hands such Castles, Towns, and other places of importance within that Kingdom, as might give any opportunity to the <hi>French-Scots</hi> to infest her Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. For when one Prince pretends a Title to the Crown of another, or otherwise makes preparations more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary both by Land and Sea, and draws them together to some place, from whence he may invade the other whensoever he please; the other party is not bound to sit still till the War be brought to his own doors, but may lawfully keep it at a distance, as far off as he can, by carrying it into the Enemies Country, and getting into his power all their strong Passes, Holds, and other Fortresses, by which he may be hindred from approaching nearer. But this can no way justifie or excuse the <hi>Scots,</hi> which are not to be reckoned for the less Rebels against
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54836:86"/>
their own undoubted Soveraign, for being subservient in so just a War to the Queen of <hi>England</hi>; as neither the <hi>Caldeans</hi> or the wilde <hi>Arabians</hi> could be defended in their thieving, or <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> justified in his pride and Tyranny, because it pleased Almighty God for tryal of <hi>Iobs</hi> faith and patience to make use of the one; and of the other, for chastising his people <hi>Israel.</hi> The point being agitated with mature deliberation by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>England,</hi> it was resolved that the <hi>French</hi> were not to be suffered to grow strong so near the Border; that the Queen could not otherwise provide for her own security, then by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling them out of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and that it was not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed at a less expence of bloud and Treasure, then by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king use of the <hi>Scots</hi> themselves, who had so earnestly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated for her aid and succours. Commissioners are thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appointed to treat at <hi>Barwick:</hi> Betwixt whom, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents for the Lords of the Congregation, all things in reference to the War are agreed upon: The sum and result whereof was this, That the English with a puissant Army entred into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> reduced the whole War to the Siege of <hi>Leith,</hi> and brought the <hi>French</hi> in short time into such extremities, that they were forced in conclusion to abandon <hi>Scotland,</hi> and leave that Country wholly in a manner to the Congregation.</p>
            <p n="23">23. These were the grounds, and this the issue of those counsels, which proved so glorious and successful unto Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in all the time of her long Reign: For by giving this seasonable Aid to those of the Congregation in their greatest need, and by feeding some of the Chiefs amongst them with small an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Pensions, she made her self so absolute, and of such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over all the Nation, that neither the Queen Regent, nor the Queen her self, nor King <hi>Iames</hi> her son, nor any of their Predecessors, were of equal power, nor had the like Command upon them. The Church was also for a while a great gainer by it; the <hi>Scots</hi> had hitherto made use of the English Liturgie in Gods publick Worship; the fancie of extemporary Prayers not being then taken up amongst them, as is affirmed by <hi>Knox</hi> himself in his Scottish History. But now upon the sence of so great a benefit, and out of a desire to unite the Nations in the most constant bonds of friendship, they binde themselves by their subscription to adhere unto it: For which I have no worse a Witness then their own <hi>Buchanan.</hi> And that they might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach as near unto it in the Form of Government as the present condition of the times would bear, as they placed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ministers for their several Churches, (as <hi>Knox</hi> in <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, Goodman</hi> at St. <hi>Andrews, Aeriot</hi> at <hi>Aberdeen, &amp;c.</hi>) so they ordained certain Superintendants for their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; all the Episcopal Sees being at that time filled with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Prelates. And happy it had been for both, had they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued still in so good a posture; and that the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> humour had not so far obliterated all remembrance of their
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54836:87"/>
old affections, as in the end to prosecute both the Liturgie and Episcopacie to an extermination. And there accrued a further benefit by it to the <hi>Scots</hi> themselves; that is to say, the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Faith which they so contended for by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: for by difficulties of Agreement between the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners authorized on all sides to attone the differences, it was consented to by those for the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> that the Estates of the Realm should convene and hold a Parliament in the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> following, and that the said Convention should be as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all respects, as if it should be summoned by the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and express command of the Kings themselves. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which Article they hold a Parliament, and therein pass an Act for the ratification of the Faith and Doctrine, as it was then drawn up into the Form of a Confession by some of their Ministers. But because this Confession did receive a more ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Confirmation in the first Parliament of King <hi>Iames,</hi> we shall refer all further speech of it till we come to that. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so passed therein other Acts to their great advantage; first for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolishing the Popes Authority; the second for repealing all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Statutes which were made and maintained of that which they called Idolatry; and the third against the saying or hearing of Mass.</p>
            <p n="24">24. It was conditioned in the Articles of the late agreement, that the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> should send Commissioners to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Parliament, that the results thereof might have the force and effect of Laws; but she intended not for her part to give their Acts the countenance of Supreme Authority; and the Chief-leading-men of the Congregation did not much regard it, as thinking themselves in a capacity to manage their own business without any such countenance: For though they had addressed themselves to the King and Queen for confirmation of such Acts as had passed in this Parliament; yet they declared that what they did was rather to express their obedience to them, then to beg of them any strength to their Religion. They had already cast the Rider, and were resolved that neither King nor Queen should back them for the time to come. The Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>een Regent wearied and worn out with such horrid inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, departed this life at <hi>Edenborough</hi> on the 10 of <hi>Iune</hi>; and none was nominated to succeed with like Authority: The <hi>French</hi> Forces were imbarked on the 16 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> except some few which were permitted to remain in the Castle of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and the Isle of <hi>Inchkeeth</hi>; so few, that they seemed rather to be left for keeping possession of the Kingdom in the name of the Queen, then either to awe the Country, or command obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And that they might be free from the like fears for the times ensuing, <hi>Francis</hi> the Second dyeth on the 5 of <hi>December,</hi> leaving the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> a desolate and friendless Widdow, assisted onely by her Uncles of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> who though they were able to do much in <hi>France,</hi> could do little out of it.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54836:87"/>
This put the <hi>Scots</hi> (I mean the leading <hi>Scots</hi> of the <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) into such a stomack, that they resolved to steer their course by another compass, and not to Sail onely by such Winds as should blow from <hi>England.</hi> They knew full well that the breach between the two Queens was not reconcileable, and that their own Queen would be always kept so low by the power of <hi>England,</hi> that they might trample on her as they pleased, now they had her under. And though at first they had imbraced the Common-prayer-Book of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and afterwards confirmed the use of it by a solemn Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet when they found themselves delivered from all fear of the <hi>French</hi> by the death of their King, and the breach growing in that Kingdom upon that occasion; they then began to tack a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and to discover their affections to the Church of <hi>Geneva, Knox</hi> had before devised a new book of Discipline, contrived for the most part after <hi>Calvins</hi> platform, and a new Form of Common-prayer was digested also, more consonant to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible judgement then the English Liturgie. But hitherto they had both lain dormant, because they stood in need of such help from <hi>England,</hi> as could not be presumed on with so great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, if they had openly declared any dissent or disaffection to the publick Forms which were established in that Church. Now their estate is so much bettered by the death of the King, the sad condition of their Queen, and the assurances which they had from the Court of <hi>England</hi> (from whence the Earls of <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Glencarne</hi> were returned with comfort) that they resolve to perfect what they had begun; to prosecute the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of Religious Houses, and the spoyl of Churches; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce their new Forms, and suspend the old. For compassing of which end, they summoned a Convention of the Estates to be held in <hi>Ianuary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="25">25. Now in this Book of Discipline they take upon them to innovate in most things formerly observed and practised in the Church of Christ, and in some things which themselves had setled, as the ground-work of the Reformation. They take upon them to discharge the accustomed Fasts, and abrogate all the ancient Festivals, not sparing those which did relate parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly unto Christ our Saviour, as his Nativity, Passion, Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They condemned the use of the Cross in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, give way to the introduction of the New Order of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> for ministring the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and commend sitting for the most proper and convenient gesture to be used at it. They require that all Churches not being Parochial should be forthwith demolished, declare all Forms of Gods publick Worship, which are not prescribed in his Word, to be meer Idolatry, and that none ought to administer the holy Sacraments, but such as are qualified for preaching. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Catechism of <hi>Geneva</hi> to be taught in their Schools, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained three Universities to be made and continued in that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54836:88"/>
Kingdom, with Salaries proportioned to the Professors in all Arts and Sciences, and time assigned for being graduated in the same. They decree also in the same, that Tythes should be no longer paid to the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy, but that they shall be taken up by Deacons and Treasurers, by them to be imployed for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of the poor, the Ministers, and the said Universities. They complained very sensibly of the Tyranny of Lay-Patrons and Impropriators in exacting their Tythes, in which they are said to be more cruel and unmerciful then the Popish Priests; and therefore take upon them to determine, as in point of Law, what Commodities shall be Tythable, what not; and declare also that all Leases and Alienations which formerly had been made of Tythes, should be utterly void.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Touching the Ministration of the Word and Sacraments, and the performance of other Divine Offices, it is therein ordered, That Common-prayers (by which they mean the new Form of their own devising) be said every day in the greater Towns, except it be upon the days of publick Preaching; but then to be forborn, that the Preachers own Prayer before and after Sermon may not be despised or disrespected: That Baptism be Administred onely upon the Sundays, and other days of publick Preaching, for the better beating down of that gross Opinion of the Papists (so they pleas'd to call it) concerning the necessity of it: That the first Sundays of <hi>March, Iune, September</hi> and <hi>December</hi> should be from thenceforth set apart for the holy Communion, the better to avoid the superstitious receiving of it at the Feast of <hi>Easter:</hi> That all persons exercise themselves in singing <hi>Psalms,</hi> to the end they may the better perform that service in the Congregation: That no singing of <hi>Psalms,</hi> no reading of Scriptures should be used at burials: That no Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral-Sermon shall be preached, by which any difference may be made between the rich and the poor; and that no dead body for the same cause shall be buried in Churches: That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesyings and Interpreting of the holy Scriptures shall be used at certain times and places, according to the custom of the Church of <hi>Corinth:</hi> That in every Church there shall be one Bell to call the people together, one Pulpit for the Word, and a Bason for Baptism: And that the Minister may the better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend these Duties, it is ordered that he shall not haunt the Court, nor be of the Council, nor bear charge in any Civil Affairs, except it be to assist the Parliament when the same is called.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Concerning Ecclesiastical persons, their Function, Calling, Maintainance and Authority, it was ordered in the said Book of Discipline, That Ministers shall from thenceforth be elected by the Congregation where they are to preach: that having made tryal of their Gifts, and being approved of by the Church where they are to Preach, they shall be admitted to their charge, but without any imposition of hands as in other

This Book being tendered to the consideration of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Estates, was by them rejected; whether it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not make such a manifest separation from the Polity of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or that it concerned them more particularly in their own proper interest, in regard of the Church-lands &amp; Tythes which they had amongst them, or perhaps

for both. Certain it is, that some of them past it over by no better Title then that of some <hi>devout Imaginations,</hi> which could not be reduced to practice. This so offended <hi>Knox</hi> and others, who had drawn it up (if any other but <hi>Knox</hi> onely had a hand therein) that they spared not bitterly to revile them for their coldness in it, taxing them for their carnal liberty, their love unt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Of all of them it was admired, that for such a long continuance they could hear the threatnings of God against Thieves and Robbers, and that knowing themselves to be guilty of those things which were most rebuked, they should never have any remorse of Conscience, nor intend the restoring of those things which they had so stolen. For so it was (if they may be believed that said it) that none in all the Realm were more unmerciful to the poor Ministers, then they that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded and possessed themselves of the greatest Rents of right belonging unto the Church, and therein verified as well the old Proverb, <hi>That the belly hath no ears at all,</hi> as a new observation of their own devising, <hi>That nothing would suffice a wretch.</hi> Such were the discontents and evaporations of these zealous men, when they were crossed in any thing which concerned them in their power or profit.</p>

They had sollicited the Convention of Estates for demolishing of all Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry, in which number they accounted all Cathedral Churches, as well as Monasteries and other Religious Houses; which they insisted on the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because it was perceived, and perhaps given out, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this, some hopes were given them that they should be satisfied, but nothing done in execution of the same, till the <hi>May</hi> next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: And possibly enough it might have been delayed to a longer time, if the noise and expectation of the Queens return had not spurred it on: For either fearing, or not knowing what might happen to them, if she should interpose her power to preserve those places, whose demolishing they so much desired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they introduce that Discipline by little and little, which they
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54836:89"/>
could not settle all at once. They begin first planting Churches, and nominating Superintendents for their several Circuits; they superinduce their own Ministers over the heads of the old in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents; establish their Presbyteries, divide them into several Classes, and hold their general Assemblies without any leave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired of the Queen or Council. They proceed next to execute all sorts of Ecclesiastical Censures, and arrogate Authority to their selves and their Elders to Excommunicate all such as they found unconformable to their new devices. For the first tryal of their power, they convent one <hi>Sanderson,</hi> who had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused to them for Adultery, whom they condemned to be carted, and publickly exposed unto the scorn of Boys and Children. An uproar had been made in <hi>Edenborough</hi> about the chusing of a <hi>Robbinhood</hi> (or a <hi>Whitson-Lord</hi>) in which some few of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciser sort opposed all the rest; and for this crime they excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the whole multitude; wherein they shewed themselves to be very unskilful in the Canon-law, in which they might have found, that neither the Supreme Magistrate, nor any great multitudes of people are to be subject to that Censure. They proceed afterwards to the appointing of solemn Fasts, and make choice of Sunday for the day; which since that time hath been made use of for those Fasts, more then any other: and in this point they shewed themselves directly contrary to the practice of the Primitive Church, in which it was accounted a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety to keep any Fast upon that day, either private or publick. They Interdict the Bishops from exercising any Ecclesiastical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having attained unto this height, they maintain an open correspondence with some Forreign Churches, give audience to the Agents of <hi>Berne, Basil</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>; from whom they received the sum of their Confessions, and signified their consent with them in all particulars, except Festivals onely, which they had universally abolished through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom; and finally, they take upon them to write unto the Bishops of <hi>England,</hi> whom they admonished not to vex or suspend their Brethren for not conforming to the Rules of the Church, especially in refusing the Cap and Surplice, which they call frequently by the name of <hi>trifles, vain trifles,</hi> and the old <hi>badges of idolatry.</hi> All which they did, and more, in pursuit of their Discipline, though never authorized by Law, or confirmed by the Queen, nor justified by the Conven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A Petition is directed to the Lords of secret Council, from the <hi>Assemblies of the Church,</hi> in which their Lordships are sollicited to dispatch the business. But not content with that which they had formerly moved, it was demanded also that some severe course might be taken against the Sayers and Hearers of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54836:90"/>
Mass; that fit provision should be made for their Superintendents, Preachers, and other Ministers; and that they should not be compellable to pay their Tythes as formerly to the Popish Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, with other particulars of that nature. And that they might not trifle in it as they had done hitherto, the Petition carried in it more threats and menaces, then words of humble suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as became Petitioners. For therein it said expresly, That before those Tyrants and dumb Dogs should have Empire over them, and over such as God had subjected unto them, they were fully determined to hazard both life, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had received of God in Temporal things; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they besought their Lordships to take such order, that the Petitioners (if they may be called so) might have no occasion to take the Sword of just defence into their hands, which they had so willingly resigned, after the Victory obtained, into those of their Lordships; that so doing, their Lordships should perceive they would not onely be obedient unto them in all things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but ready at all times to bring all such under their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as should at any time rebel against their Authority; and finally, that those enemies of God might assure themselves, that they would no no longer suffer Pride and Idolatry; and that if their Lordships would not take some order in the premises, they would then proceed against them of their own Authority after such a manner, that they should neither do what they list, nor live upon the sweat of the brows of such as were in no sort debtors to them.</p>
            <p n="31">31. On the receipt of this Petition, an Order presently is made by the Lords of the Council, for granting all which was desired; and had more been desired, they had granted more: so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable were the Brethren grown to the opposite party. Nor was it granted in words onely which took no effect, but exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution caused to be done upon it, and warrants to that purpose issued to the Earls of <hi>Arrane, Arguile</hi> and <hi>Glencarne,</hi> the Lord <hi>Iames Steward, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon followed a pitiful devastati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Churches and Church-buildings in all parts of the Realm; no difference made, but all Religious Edifices of what sort soever, were either terribly defaced, or utterly ruinated; the holy Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and whatsoever else could be turned into money, as Lead, Bells, Timber, Glass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was publickly exposed to sale; the very Sepulchres of the dead not spared; the Registers of the Church, and the Libraries thereunto belonging, defaced, and thrown into the fire. Whatsoever had escaped the former tumults, is now made subject to destruction; so much the worse, because the violence and sacrilegious actings of these Church-robbers had now the countenance of Law. And to this work of spoyl and rapine, men of all Ranks and Orders were observed to put their helping hands; m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

by their Lords and Patrons. Both sorts encouraged to it by the Zealous madness of some of their sedirious Preachers, who frequently cryed out, that the places where Idols had been wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, ought by the Law of God to be destroyed; that the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them was the reserving of things execrable; and that the Commandment given to <hi>Israel</hi> for destroying the places where the <hi>Canaanites</hi> did worship their false Gods, was a just warrant to the people for doing the like. By which encouragements, the madness of the people was transported beyond the bounds which they had first prescribed unto it. In the beginning of the heats, they designed onely the destruction of Religious Houses, for fear the Monks and Fryars might otherwise be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored in time to their former dwellings: But they proceeded to the demolition of Cathedral Churches, and ended in the ruine of Parochial also; the Chancels whereof were sure to be level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in all places, though the Isles and bodies of them might be spared in some.</p>

Who taking no delight in <hi>France,</hi> where every thing renewed the memory of her great loss, was easily intreated to return to her native Kingdom. Her coming much desired by those of the Popish party, in hope that by her power and presence they might be suffered at the least to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the private Exercise of their Religion, if not a publick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and allowance of it. Sollicited as earnestly by those of the <hi>Knoxian</hi> interest, upon a confidence that they should be better able to deal with her when she was in their power, assisted onely by the Counsels of a broken Clergy, then if she should remain in <hi>France,</hi> from whence by her Alliances and powerful Kindred she might create more mischief to them then she could at home. On the 19 day of <hi>August</hi> she arrives in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> accompanied by her Uncles the Duke of <hi>Aumales,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>Elboeuf,</hi> and the Lord grand Pryor, with other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men of <hi>France.</hi> The time of her arrival was obscured with such Fogs and Mists, that the Sun was not seen to shine in two days before, nor in two days after. Which though it made her passage safe from the Ships of <hi>England,</hi> which were design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to intercept her, yet was it looked upon by most men as a sad presage of those uncomfortable times which she found amongst them. Against Sunday, being the 24, there were great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made for celebrating Mass in the Chappel-Royal of <hi>Holy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At which the Brethren of the Congregation were so highly offended, that some of them cryed out aloud, so as all might hear them, That <hi>the Idolatrous Priests should dye the death according to Gods Law</hi>; others affirming with less noise, but with no less confidence, <hi>That they could not abide, that the Land which God by his power had purged of Idolatry, should in their sight be polluted with the same again.</hi> And que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless some great mischief must have followed on it, if the

            <p n="33">33. For remedy whereof for the time to come, an Order was issued the next day by the Lords of the Council, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by the Queen, in which it was declared, that no manner of person should privately or openly take in hand to alter or innovate any thing in the State of Religion which the Queen found publickly and universally received at her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties arrival in that Realm, or attempt any thing against the same upon pain of death. But then it was required withal, that none of the Leiges take in hand to trouble or molest any of her Majesties Domestick Servants, or any other persons which had accompanied her out of <hi>France</hi> at the time then present, for any cause whatsoever, in word, deed, or countenance; and that upon the pain of death, as the other was. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the equality of so just an Order, the Earl of <hi>Arrane</hi> in the name of the rest of the Congregation professed openly on the same day at the Cross in <hi>Edenborough, That no protection should be given to the Queens Domesticks, or to any other person that came out of</hi> France, <hi>either to violate the Laws of the Realm, or offend Gods Majesty, more then was given to any other subjects.</hi> And this he did, as he there affirmed, because Gods Law had pronounced death to the Idolater, and the Laws of the Realm had appointed punishment for the sayers and hearers of Mass; from which he would have none exempted, till some Law were publickly made in Parliament, and such as was agreeable to the Word of God, to annul the former. The like distemper had possest all the rest of the Lords at their first coming to the Town to attend her Majesty to congratulate her safe arrival; but they cooled all of them by degrees, when they considered the unreasonableness of the Protestation, in denying that Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conscience to their Soveraign Queen, which every one of them so much desired to enjoy for himself: Onely the Earl <hi>Arrane</hi> held it out to the last. He had before given himself some hopes of marrying the Queen, and sent her a rich Ring immediately on the death of the King her Husband; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no return agreeable to his expectation, he suffered himself to be as much transported to the other extreme, according to the natural Genius of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who never yet knew any mean in their loves or hatred.</p>
            <p n="34">34. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> makes good the Pulpit in the chief Church at <hi>Edenborough</hi> on the Sunday following, in which he bitterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed against Idolatry, shewing what Plagues and Punishments God had inflicted for the same upon several Nations. And then
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54836:91"/>
he adds, that one Mass was more fearful to him, then if ten thousand armed Enemies were landed in any part of the Realm on purpose to suppress their whole Religion; that in God there was strength to resist and confound whole multitudes, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A Conference hereupon ensued betwixt him and the Queen, at the hearing whereof there was none present but the Lord <hi>Iames Steward,</hi> besides two Gentlemen which stood at the end of the Room. In the beginning whereof, she charged him with raising Sedition in that Kingdom, putting her own Subjects into Arms against her, writing a Book against the Regiment of Women; and in the end, descend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To all which <hi>Knox</hi> returned such answers, or else so favourably reports them to his own advantage (for we must take the whole story as it comes from his pen) that he is made to go away with as easie a victory, as when the Knight of the Boot encounters with some Dwarf or Pigmy in the old <hi>Romances.</hi> All that the Queen got by it from the mouth of this Adversary, was, that he found in her <hi>a proud minde, a craf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from whose hands they did expect the defence thereof.</p>
            <p n="35">35. A general Assembly being indicted by them about that time, or not long after, a question is made by some of the Court-Lords, whether such Assemblies might be holden by them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Queens notice and consent. To which it was answered, that the Assembly neither was, nor could be held without her notice, because she understood that there was a Reformed Church within the Realm, by the Orders whereof they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed times for their publick Conventions. But as to her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of it, it was then objected, that if the Liberty of the Church should stand upon the Queens allowance or disallowance, they were assured that they should not onely want Assemblies, but the preaching of the Word it self; for if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>reedom of Assemblies was taken away, the Gospel in effect must be also suppressed, which could not long subsist without them. The putting in of the demurrer concerning the Authority in calling and holding their Assemblies, prompted them to present the Book of Discipline to her Majesties view, and to sollicite her by all the Friends and means they could for her Royal-Assent: But finding no hope of compassing their desires for that Book in general, it was thought best to try their Fortune in the pursuit of some particulars contained in it. And to that end it was propounded to the Lords of the Council, that Idolatry might be suppressed, the Churches planted with true Ministers, and that certain provision should be made for them according to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and good Conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Ministers till that time had liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d for the most part upon such Benevolences as were raised for them on the people; the Patrimony of the Church being seized into the hands of private persons, and alienated in long Leases by the Popish Clergy. The Revenue of the Crown was small when it was at the best, exceedingly impaired since the death of King <hi>Iames</hi> the Fifth, and not sufficient to defray the necessary charge and expence of the Court. To satisfie all parties, it was ordered by the Lords of the Council, that the third part of all the Rents of Ecclesiastical Benefices should be taken up for the use of the Queen; that the other two parts should remain to the Clergy, or to such as held them in their Right; and that the Queen, out of the part assigned to her, should maintain the Ministers. This Order bears date at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, December</hi> 20, but gave no satisfaction to the Ministers or their Sollicitors, who challenged the whole Patrimony, by the Rules of the Discipline, to belong onely to themselves. <hi>Knox</hi> amongst others so disliked it, that he affirmed openly in the Pulpit of <hi>Edenborough, That the Spirit of God was not the Author of that Order, by which two parts</hi> of the Church-Rents <hi>were given to the Devil, and the third part was to be divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Devil</hi>; adding withal, <hi>that in short time the Devil would have three parts of the third,</hi> and that a fourth part onely should be left to God.</p>

They were all such as did profess the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion, and therefore could not but be thought to be well-affected to the Ministers maintainance; to some of which they allowed one hundred Marks by the year, unto some three hundred; insomuch, that it was said by <hi>Ledington</hi> principal Secretary of Estate, that when the Ministers were paid the Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends assigned unto them, the rest would hardly finde the Queen a new pair of Shooes. But on the other side, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters vehemently exclaimed against these assignments; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly profest it to be very unreasonable, that such dumb Dogs and Idle-bellies as the Popish Clergy should have a thousand Marks <hi>per annum</hi>; and that themselves (good men) who spent their whole time in preaching the Gospel, should be put off with two or three hundred. They railed with no less bitterness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Laird of <hi>Pittarow,</hi> who was appointed by the Queen for their pay-Master General; and used to say in common Speech, that the good Laird of <hi>Pittarow,</hi> Comptroller of her Majesties Houshold, was a Zealous Professor of Jesus Christ; but that the pay Master or Comptroller would fall to the Devil. And for the Queen, so far they were from acknowledging the receipt of any favour from her, in the true payment of their Stipends, that they disputed openly against that Title which she pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the thirds, out of which she paid them. By some it was affirmed, that no such part had appertained to any of her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors in a thousand years; by others, that she had no better Title thereunto (whether she kept them to her self, or divided them amongst her Servants) then had the Souldiers by whom Christ was crucified to divide his Garments.</p>
            <p n="37">37. It hapned not long after these debates,<note place="margin">1562.</note> that upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of some good news from her Friends in <hi>France,</hi> the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>een appeared to be very merry, betook her self to dancing, and continued in that recreation till after midnight. The news whereof being brought to <hi>Knox,</hi> who had his Spies upon her at all times to observe her actions; the Pulpit must needs ring of it, or else all was marred: He chuseth for his Text these words of the second <hi>Psalm, viz. And now understand O ye Kings, and be learned ye that judge the earth.</hi> Discoursing on which Text, he began to tax the ignorance, the vanity, and the despight of Princes against all Vertue, and against all those in whom hatred of Vice and love of Vertue appeared. Report is made unto the Queen, and this report begets a second Conference betwixt her and <hi>Knox,</hi> in which she must come off with as little credit as she did in the first. <hi>Knox</hi> tells her in plain terms, that it is oftentimes the just recompence that God gives the stubborn of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54836:93"/>
the World, that because they will not hear God speaking to the comfort of the Penitent, and for the amendment of the wicked, they are oft compelled to hear the false reports of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to their great displeasure. To which immediately he subjoyned, that it could not chuse but come to the Ears of <hi>Herod,</hi> that our Saviour Jesus Christ had called him <hi>Fox</hi>; but that the men who told him of it, did not also tell him what an odious act he had committed before God, in causing <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist to be beheaded, to recompence the dancing of an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots Daughter. The Queen desired (after much other talk between them) that if he heard any thing of her which distasted him, he would repair to her in private, and she would willingly hear what he had to say. To which he answered with as little reverence and modesty as to all the rest, that he was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God to rebuke the vices and sins of all, but not to go to every one in particular to make known their offences; that if she pleased to frequent the publick Sermons, she might then know what he liked or disliked, as well in her self as any others; but that to wait at her Chamber-door, or elsewhere, and then to have no further liberty then to whisper in her ear what he had to say, or to tell her what others did speak of her, was neither agreeable to his vocation, nor could stand with his Conscience.</p>
            <p n="38">38. At <hi>Midsummer</hi> they held a general Assembly, and there agreed upon the Form of a Petition to be presented to the Queen in the name of the Kirk; the substance of it was for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolishing the Mass, and other superstitious Rites of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion; for inflicting some punishment against Blasphemie, Adultery, contempt of the Word, the Profanation of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and other like vices condemned by the Word of God, whereof the Laws of the Realm did not take any hold; for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring all actions of Divorce to the Churches judgement, or at the least to men of good knowledge and conversation; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all Popish Church-men from holding any place in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil or Session; and finally, for the increase and more assured payment of the Ministers Stipends, but more particularly for appropriating the Glebes and Houses unto them alone. This was the sum of their desires, but couched in such irreverent, coarse, and bitter expressions, and those expressions justified with such animosities, that <hi>Lethington</hi> had much ado to prevail upon them for putting it into a more dutiful and civil Language. All which the Queen knew well enough, and therefore would afford them no better answer, but that she would do nothing to the prejudice of that Religion which she then professed; and that she hoped to have Mass restored, before the end of the year, in all parts of the Kingdom. Which being so said, or so reported, gave <hi>Knox</hi> occasion in his preachings to the Gentry of <hi>Kyle</hi> and <hi>Galloway</hi> (to which he was commissioned by the said Assembly) to forewarn some of them of the dangers which would shortly
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54836:93"/>
follow; and thereupon earnestly to exhort them to take such order, that they might be obedient unto Authority, and yet not suffer the Enemies of Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And they, who understood his meaning at half a word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> assembled themselves together on the 4 of <hi>September,</hi> at the Town of <hi>Air,</hi> where they entred into a common Bond, subscribed by the Earl of <hi>Glencarne,</hi> the Lords <hi>Boyd</hi> and <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="40">40. And in pursuance of this Bond, they seize upon some Priests, and give notice to others, that they would not trouble themselves of complaining to the Queen of Council, but would execute the punishment appointed to Idolaters in the Law of God, as they saw occasion, whensoever they should be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. At which the Queen was much offended; but there was no remedy. All she could do, was once again to send for <hi>Knox,</hi> and to desire him so to deal with the Barons, and other Gentlemen of the <hi>West,</hi> that they would not punish any man for the cause of Religion, as they had resolved. To which he answered with as little reverence as at other times, That if her Majesty would punish Malefactors according to the Laws, he durst assure her, that she should finde peace and quietness at the hand of those who professed the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> in that Kingdom: That if she thought or had a purpose to illude the Laws, there were some who would not fail to let the Papists understand, that they should not be suffered without punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to offend their God. Which said, he went about to prove in a long discourse, that others were by God intrusted
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54836:94"/>
with the Sword of Justice, besides Kings and Princes; which Kings and Princes, if they failed in the right use of it, and drew it not against Offenders, they must not look to finde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience from the rest of the Subjects.</p>
            <p n="41">41. It is not to be doubted, but that every understanding Reader will be able to collect out of all the premises, both of what Judgement <hi>Knox</hi> and his Brethren were, touching the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of Kings, or rather the Supreme Power invested na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in the people of a State or Nation; as also from what Fountain they derived their Doctrine, and to whose sentence onely they resolved to submit the same. But we must make a clearer demonstration of it, before we can proceed to the rest of our History; that so it may appear upon what ground, and under the pretence of what Authority so many Tumults and Discords were acted on the Stage of <hi>Scotland</hi> by the <hi>Knoxian</hi> Brethren. It pleased the Queen to hold a Conference with this man, in the pursuit whereof they fell upon the point of resisting Princes by the Sword, the lawfulness whereof was denyed by her, but maintained by him. The Queen demands whether Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects having power may resist their Princes: <hi>Yea, (Madam)</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Knox; if Princes do exceed their bounds, and do against that wherefore they should be obeyed, there is no doubt but that they may be resisted even by power. For</hi> (said he) <hi>there is neither greater honour, nor greater obedience to be given to Kings and Princes, then God hath commanded to be given unto our Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and yet it may so happen, that the Father may be stricken with a Phrensie, and in some fit attempt the slaying of his Children. In which case, if the Children joyn themselves together, apprehend their Father, take the Sword out of his hand, and keep him in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son till his Phrensie be over-past; it is not to be thought that God will be offended with them for their actings in it.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he doth infer, that so it is with such Princes also, as out of a blind Zeal would murther the Children of God which are subject to them. And therefore to take the Sword from them, to binde their hands, and to cast them into Prison, till that they may be brought to a more sober minde, is not disobedience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, but rather is to be accounted for a just obedience, because it agrees with the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="42">42. The same man preaching afterwards at one of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assemblies, made a distinction between the Ordinance of God, and the persons placed by him in Authority; and then affirmed that men might lawfully and justly resist the persons, and not offend against the Ordinance of God. He added as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary unto his discourse, That Subjects were not bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their Princes, if they Command unlawful things; but that they might resist their Princes, and that they were not bound to suffer. For which being questioned by Secretary <hi>Ledington</hi> in the one, and desired to declare himself further in the other point; he justified himself in both, affirming that he had long
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54836:94"/>
been of that opinion, and did so remain. A Question hereupon arising about the punishment of Kings, if they were Idolaters; it was honestly affirmed by <hi>Ledington,</hi> That there was no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment given in that case to punish Kings, and that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had no power to be judges over them, but must leave them unto God alone, who would either punish them by death, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, war, or some other Plagues. Against which <hi>Knox</hi> replyed with his wooted confidence, that to affirm that the people, or a part of the people may not execute Gods Judgments against their King being an offender, the Lord <hi>Ledington</hi> could have no other Warrant, except his own imaginations, and the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such, as rather feared to displease their Princes, then offend their God. Against which when <hi>Ledington</hi> objected the Authority of some eminent Protestants; <hi>Knox</hi> answered, that they spake of Christians subject to Tyrants and Infidels, so dispersed, that they had no other force but onely to cry unto God for their deliverance: That such indeed should hazard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further then those godly men willed them, he would not hastily be of counsel. But that his Argument had another ground, and that he spake of a people assembled in one Body of a Commonwealth, unto whom God had given sufficient force, not onely to resist, but also to suppress all kinde of open Idolatry; and such a people again he affirmed were bound to keep their Land clean and unpolluted: that God required one thing of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, when he and they were strangers in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that another thing was required of them when they were delivered from that bondage, and put into the actual Possession of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="43">43. Finally, that the Application might come home to the point in hand, it was resolved by this learned and judicious Casuist, that when they could hardly finde ten in any one part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who rightly understood Gods Truth, it had been foolishness to have craved the suppression of Idolatry either from the Nobility or the common subject, because it had been nothing else but the betraying of the silly Sheep for a prey to the Wolves. <hi>But now</hi> (saith he) <hi>that God hath multiplyed know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and hath given the victory unto Truth in the hands of his Servants, if you should suffer the Land again to be defiled, you and your Prince should drink the cup of Gods indignation; the Queen, for her continuing obstinate in open Idolatry, in this great light of the Gospel; and you, for permission of it, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing her in the same. For my assertion is</hi> (saith he) <hi>that Kings have no priviledge more then hath the people to offend Gods Majesty; and if so be they do, they are no more exempted from the punishment of the Law, then is any other subject; yea, and that subjects may not onely lawfully oppose themselves unto their Kings, whensoever they do any thing that expresly oppugnes Gods Commandments, but also that they may execute Iudgement upon them according to Gods Laws; so that if the King be a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54836:95"/>
Murtherer, Adulterer, or an Idolater, he should suffer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to Gods Law, not as a King, but as an Offender.</hi> Now that <hi>Knox</hi> did not speak all this as his private judgement, but as it was the judgement of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Genevian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, whom he chiefly followed, appears by this passage in the story. It was required that <hi>Knox</hi> should write to <hi>Calvin,</hi> and to the Learned men in other Churches, to know their judgements in the Question; to which he answered, that he was not onely fully resolved in conscience, but had already heard their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as well in that, as in all other things which he had affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Kingdom; that he came not to that Realm without their resolution, and had for his assurance the hand-writing of many; and therefore if he should now move the same questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons again, he must either shew his own ignorance, or inconstancie, or at least forgetfulness.</p>
            <p n="44">44. Of the same Nature, and proceeding from the same Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, are those dangerous passages so frequently dispersed in most parts of his History. By which the Reader is informed, <hi>That Reformation of Religion doth belong to more then the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and the King: That Noblemen ought to reform Religion, if the King will not: That Reformation of Religion belongeth to the Commonalty, who concurring with the Nobility, may compel the Bishops to cease from their Tyranny, and bridle the cruel Beasts (the Priests:) That they may lawfully require of their King to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nothing more ordinary with him in his factious Sermons, then to call her a <hi>Slave to Sathan,</hi> and to tell the people that <hi>Gods vengeance hanged over the Realm, by reason of her impiety:</hi> which what else was it, but to inflame the hearts of the people, as well against the Queen, as all them that served her? For in his publick Prayers he commonly observed this Form, <hi>viz. O Lord, if it be thy good pleasure, purge the Queens heart from the venom of Idolatry, and deliver her from the bondage and thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Sathan, in the which she yet remains for lack of true Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that in so doing, she may avoid the eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is ordained for all obstinate and impenitent to thee, and that this Realm may also escape that plague and vengeance which inevitably follows Idolatry, maintained in this Kingdom against thy manifest Word, and the Light thereof set forth unto them.</hi> Such in a word was the intemperancie of his spirit, his hatred of her person, or contempt of her Government, that he opposed and crossed her openly in all her courses, and for her sake, fell foul upon all men of more moderate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</p>

During the interval between the death of her Father, and her own coming back from <hi>France,</hi> there had been little shewn of a Court in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as not much before. But presently on her return, a greater bravery in Apparel was taken up by the Lords and Ladies, and such as waited near her person, then in former times; never more visibly, then when they waited on her in a pompous manner, as she went to the Parliament of this year. This gives great scandal to the Preachers, to none more then <hi>Knox.</hi> The Preachers boldly in their Pulpits (that I say not malapertly) declared against the superfluity of their Clothes, and against the rest of their Vanities; which they affirm'd should provoke Gods vengeance, not onely against those foolish Women, but the whole Realm; and especially against those that maintained them in that odious abusing all things which might have better been bestowed. A course is taken principally by their sollicitations, that certain Articles were agreed on, and proposed in Parliament, for regulating all excess in Apparel as a great enormity, the <hi>stinking pride of Women,</hi> as <hi>Knox</hi> plainly calls it.

The Queen had gained the thirds of all Church-Rents by an Act of State, for the more honourable support of her self and her Family, upon condition of making some allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of it to defray the Ministers: How <hi>Knox</hi> approved of this, hath been shewn before. We must now see how he had trained up <hi>Goodman</hi> (if they were not both rather trained up by the same great Master) to pursue the quarrel; and how far he was seconded by the rest of the Brethren. In a general Assembly held this year, the business of the thirds was again resumed by some Commissioners of the <hi>Kirk.</hi> To which no sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At which when he was put in minde by <hi>Ledington</hi> that he was a stranger, and therefore was to be no medler; he boldly answered, that though he was a stranger in the Civil Policie of that Realm, yet stranger he was none in the Church of God; the care whereof did appertain to him no less in <hi>Scotland,</hi> then if he were in the midst of <hi>England,</hi> his own nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But to proceed to greater matters: the Queen began her Summers Progress, and left a Priest behinde in <hi>Halyrood</hi>-house, to execute Divine-Offices in the Chappel to the rest of her Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Some of the Citizens of <hi>Edenborough</hi> were observed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair thither at the time of Mass; whereof the Preachers make complaint, and stir the people in their Sermons to such a fury, that they flock in great multitudes to the Palace, violently force open the Chappel-doors, seize upon such as they found there, and commit them to Prison, the Priest escaping with much difficulty by a privy Postern. The news of this disorder is carried post to the Queen, who thereupon gives order to the Provost of <hi>Edenborough</hi> to seize upon the persons of <hi>Andrew Armstrong,</hi> or <hi>Patrick Cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was about the beginning of <hi>August</hi> that the tumult hapned, and the beginning of <hi>October</hi> that the Letter was written. A Copy of it comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Lords of the Council; by whom the writing of it was declared to be treason, to the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of the Queen, who hoped on this occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge her self upon him for his former insolencies. But it fell out quite contrary to her expectation. <hi>Knox</hi> is commanded to appear before the Lords of the Council, and he comes accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; but comes accompanied with such a train of godly Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that they did not onely fill the open part of the Court, but thronged up stairs, and prest unto the doors of the Council. This makes the man so confident, as to stand out stoutly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Queen and her Council, affirming that the convocating of the people in so just a Cause, was no offence against the Law; and boldly telling them, that they who had inflamed the Queen against those poor men, were the Sons of the Devil; and therefore that it was no marvail if they obeyed the desires of their

Moved with which confidence, or rather terrified with the clamours of the Rascal Rabble, even ready to break in upon them, the whole Nobility then present, absolved him of all the crimes objected to him, not without some praise to God for his modesty, and for his plain and sensible answers, as himself reports it.</p>

At the ministring of the Communion in <hi>Edenborough</hi> on the first of <hi>April,</hi> the Brethren are advertised that the Papists were busie at their Mass; some of which taking one of the Bayliffs with them, laid hands upon the Priest, the Master of the House, and two or three of the Assistants; all whom they carryed to the <hi>Tole-booth</hi> or <hi>Common-hall:</hi> The Priest they re-invest with his Massing-Garments; set him upon the Market-cross, unto which they tye him, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Chalice in his hand, which is tyed to it also, and there exposed him for the space of an hour to be pelted by the boys with rotten Eggs. The next day he is accused and convicted in a course of Law, by which he might have suffered death, but that the Law had never been confirmed by the King or Queen. So that instead of all other punishments which they had no just power to inflict upon him, he was placed in the same manner on the Market-cross, the Common-hang-man standing by, and there exposed to the same insolencies for the space of three or four hours, as the day before. Some Tumult might have followed on it, but that the Provost with some <hi>Halberdiers</hi> dispersed the multitude, and brought the poor Priest off with safety. Of this the Queen complains, but without any Remedy: Instead of other satisfaction, an Article is drawn up by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of the next Assembly, to be presented to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then sitting at <hi>Edenborough</hi>; in which it was desired, <hi>That the Papis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was not long since nothing was more preached amongst them, then the great tyranny of the Prelates, and the unmerciful dealing of such others as were in Authority, in not permitting them to have the liberty of Conscience in their own Religion, which now they denyed unto their Queen.</p>

But the affront which grieved her most, was the perverse, but most ridiculous opposition which they made to her Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: she had been desired for a Wife by <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> King of <hi>Navar, Lewis</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> Arch-duke <hi>Charles,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and one of the younger Sons of the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> But Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who endeavoured to keep her low, disswaded her from all Alliances of that high strain, perswaded her to Marry with some Noble Person of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:54836:97"/>
for the better establishment of her Succession in the Crown of this Realm; and not obscurely pointed to her the Earl of <hi>Leicester:</hi> Which being made known to the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> Countess of <hi>Lenox,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Margaret</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and Grand-childe to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, from whom both Queens derived their Titles to this Crown; she wrought upon the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> by some Court-Instruments, to accept her Eldest Son the Lord <hi>Henry Steward</hi> for her Husband. A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman he was above all exception, of comely personage, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plausible behaviour, of English Birth and Education and much about the same age with the Queen her self. And to this Match she was the more easily inclined, because she had been told of the King her Father, that he resolved (if he had dyed without any Issue of his own) to declare the Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> for his Heir Apparent, that so the Crown might be preserved in the name of the <hi>Stewarts.</hi> But that which most prevailed upon her, was a fear she had lest the young Lord, being the next Heir unto her self to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> might Marry into some Family of power and puissance in that Kingdom; by means whereof he might prevent her of her hopes in the succession; to which his being born in <hi>England,</hi> and her being an Alien and an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, might give some advantage. Nor did it want some place in her consideration, that the young Lord, and his Parents also, were of the same Religion with her, which they had constantly maintained, notwithstanding all temptations to the contrary in the Court of <hi>England.</hi> To smooth the way to this great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, the Earl desires leave of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to repair into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he is graciously received, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The young Lord follows not long after, and findes such entertainment at the hands of that Queen, that report voiced him for her Husband before he could assure himself of his own affections. This proved no very pleasing news to those of the Congregation, who thought it more expedient to their Affairs, that the Queen should not Marry at all; or at least, not Marry any other Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band but such as should be recommended to her by the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> on whom their safety did depend. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they are resolved to oppose this Match, though otherwise they were assured that it would make the Queen grow less in reputation both at home and abroad, to Marry with one of her own subjects, of what blood soever.</p>
            <p n="51">51. And now comes <hi>Knox</hi> to play his prize, who more desired that the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> (as one of his own Faction) should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spouse the Queen, then the Earl desired it for himself. If she will Marry at all, let her make choice of one of the true Religion, for other Husband she should never have, if he could help it. And to this end he lays about him in a Sermon preached before the Parliament, at which the Nobility and Estates were then
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54836:98"/>
assembled. And having roved sufficiently, as his custom was, at last he tells them in plain terms (desiring them to note the day, and take witness of it) <hi>That whensover the Nobility of</hi> Scotland <hi>who profess the Lord Iesus, should consent that an Infidel</hi> (<hi>and all Papists are Infidels,</hi> saith he) <hi>should be head to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; they did, so far as in them lyes, banish Christ Iesus from this Realm, yea, and bring Gods judgements upon the Country, a plague upon themselves, and do small comfort to her self.</hi> For which being questioned by the Queen in a private conference, he did not onely stand unto it, without the least qualifying or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting of those harsh expressions; but must intitle them to God, as if they had been the immediate Inspirations of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost: for in his Dialogue with the Queen, he affirmed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, that out of the preaching place few had occasion to be any way o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fended with him; but there (that is to say, in the Church or Pulpit) he was not Master of himself, but must obey him that commands him to speak plain, and flatter no flesh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the Earth. This insolent carriage of the man put the Queen into passion; insomuch, that one of her Pages (as <hi>Knox</hi> himself reports the story) could hardly finde Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs enough to dry her eyes; with which the proud fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low shewed himself no further touched, then if he had seen the like fears from any one of his own Boys on a just cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p n="52">52. Most men of moderate spirits seemed much offended at the former passage, when they heard it from him in the Pulpit, more when they heard of the affliction it had given the Queen. But it prevailed so far on the generality of the Congregation, that presently it became a matter of Dispute amongst them, <hi>Whether the Queen might chuse to her self an Husband, or whether it were more fitting that the Estates of the Land should appoint one for her.</hi> Some sober men affirmed in earnest, that the Queen was not to be barred that liberty which was granted to the meanest Subject. But the Chief leading-men of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation had their own ends in it, for which they must pretend the safety of the Common-wealth. By whom it was affirmed as plainly, that in the Heir unto a Crown, the case was different, because, said they, such Heirs in assuming an Husband to themselves, did withal appoint a King to be over the Nation: And therefore that it was more fit, that the whole people should chuse a Husband to one Woman, then one Woman to elect a King to Rule over the whole people. Others that had the same designe, and were possibly of the same opinion, concerning the imposing of a Husband on her by the States of the Realm, disguised their purpose, by pretending another Reason to break off this Marriage: The Queen and the young Noble-man were too near of Kindred to be conjoyned in Marriage by the Laws of the Church; her Father and his Mother being born of the same <hi>Venter,</hi> as our Lawyers phrase it. But for this blow the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54836:98"/>
Queen did easily provide a Buckler, and dispatched one of her Ministers to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> for a Dispensation. The other was not so well warded, but that it fell heavy at the last, and plunged her into all those miseries which ensued upon it.</p>
            <p n="53">53. But notwithstanding these obstructions,<note place="margin">1565<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> the Match went forwards in the Court, chiefly sollicited by one <hi>David Risio,</hi> born in <hi>Piedmont</hi>; who coming into <hi>Scotland</hi> in the company of an Ambassador from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> was there detained by the Queen, first in the place of a Musician, afterwards im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in writing Letters to her Friends in <hi>France.</hi> By which he came to be acquainted with most of her secrets, and as her Secretary for the <hi>French</hi> Tongue to have a great hand in the managing of all Forreign transactions. This brought him into great envy with the <hi>Scots,</hi> proud in themselves, and not easie to be kept in fair terms, when they had no cause unto the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But the preferring of this stranger was considered by them as a wrong to their Nation, as if not able to afford a sufficient man to perform that Office, to which the Educating of so many of them in the Court of <hi>France</hi> had made them no less fit and able then this Mungrel <hi>Italian.</hi> To all this <hi>Risio</hi> was no stranger, and therefore was to cast about how to save himself, and to preserve that Power and Reputation which he had acquired. Which to effect, he laboured by all means to promote the Match, that the young Lord being obliged unto him for so great a benefit, might stand the faster to him against all Court-factions, whensoever they should rise against him. And that it might appear to be his work onely, <hi>Ledington</hi> the chief Secretary is dispatched for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> partly to gain the Queens consent unto the Marriage, and partly to excuse the Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> and his Son, for not return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Court as she had commanded. In the mean time he carries on the business with all care and diligence, to the end that the Match might be made up before his return. Which haste he made for these two Reason: first, lest the dissenting of that Queen, (whose influence he knew to be very great on the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland</hi>) might either beat it off, or at least retard it; the second, that the young Lord <hi>Darnley,</hi> for so they called him, might have the greater obligation to him for effecting the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, then if it had been done by that Queens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            <p n="54">54. To make all sure (as sure at least as humane Wisdom could project it) a Convention of the Estates is called in <hi>May,</hi> and the business of the Marriage is propounded to them. To which some yeilded absolutely without any condition, others upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Religion might be kept indempnified; onely the Lord <hi>Vehiltry,</hi> one who adher'd to <hi>Knox</hi> in his greatest difficulties, maintained the Negative, affirming openly, that he would never admit a King of the Popish Religion. Encouraged by which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and free consent of the chief Nobility then present, the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54836:99"/>
Lord <hi>Darnly</hi> not long after is made Baron of <hi>Ardmonack,</hi> created Earl of <hi>Ross</hi> and Duke of <hi>Rothesay,</hi> titles belonging to the eldest and the second Sons of the Kings of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, such of the great Lords of the Congregation as were resolved to work their own ends out of these present differences, did purposely absent themselves from that Convention, that is to say, the Earls of <hi>Murray, Glencarne, Rothes, Arguile, &amp;c.</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and his dependants, whom they had drawn into the Faction: and they convened at <hi>Stirling</hi> also, though not until the Queen and her retinue were departed from thence; and there it was resolved by all means to oppose the Marriage, for the better avoiding of such dangers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which otherwise might ensue upon it. For whose encouragement, the Queen of <hi>England</hi> furnished them with ten thousand pounds, that it might serve them for advance-money for the listing of Souldiers, when an occasion should be offered to embroyl that Kingdom. Nor was <hi>Knox</hi> wanting for his part to advance the troubles, who by his popular declamations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Match, had so incensed the people of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> that they resolved to put themselves into a posture of War, to elect Captains to command them, and to disarm all those who were suspected to wish well unto it. But the Queen came upon them in so just a time, that the chief Leaders of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were compelled to desert the Town, and leave unto her mercy both their Goods and Families; to which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored not long after by her grace and clemency.</p>
            <p n="55">55. A general Assembly at the same time was held in <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> who falsely thinking that the Queen in that conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture could deny them nothing, presented their desires unto her: In the first whereof it was demanded, <hi>That the Papistical and blasphemous Mass, with all Popish Idolatry, and the Popes juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, should be universally supprest and abolished throughout the whole Realm, not onely amongst the Subjects, but in the Queens Majesties own Person and Family.</hi> In the next place it was desired, <hi>That the true Religion formerly received should be professed by the Queen, as well as by the Subjects; and people of all sorts bound to resort upon the Sundays, at least to the Prayers and Preachings, as in the former times to Mass: That sure provision should be made for sustentation of the Ministry, as well for the time present, as for the time to come; and their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings assigned them in the places where they served, or at least in the parts next adjacent; and that they should not be put to crave the same at the hands of any others: That all Benefices then vacant, and such as had fallen void since</hi> March 1558, <hi>or should happen thereafter to be void, should be disposed to persons qualified for the Ministry, upon tryal and admission by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent</hi>; with many other demands of like weight and quality. To which the Queen returned this answer: first, <hi>That
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54836:99"/>
she could not be perswaded that there was any impiety in the Mass: That she had been always bred in the Religion of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>which she esteemed to be agreeable to the Word of God, and therefore trusted that her subjects would not force her to do any thing against her conscience: That hitherto she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had, nor did intend hereafter to force any mans conscience, but to leave every one to the free exercise of that Religion which to him seemed best; which might sufficiently induce them to oblige her by the like indulgence.</hi> She answered to the next: <hi>That she did not think it reasonable to defraud her self of such a considerable part of the Royal Patrimony, as to put the Patronages of Benefices out of her own power; the publick necessities of the Crown being such, that they required a great part of the Church-Rents to defray the same:</hi> Which notwithstanding, she declared, <hi>that the necessities of the Crown being first supplyed, care should be taken for the sustentation of the Ministers in some reasonable and fit proportion, to be assigned out of the nearest and most commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious places to their several dwellings.</hi> For all the rest, she was contented to refer her self to the following Parliament, to whose determinations in the particulars desired, she would be conformable.</p>
            <p n="56">56. Not doubting but this answer might sufficiently comply with all expectations, she proceeds to the Marriage, publickly solemnized in the midst of <hi>Iuly,</hi> by the Dean of <hi>Restalrig,</hi> whom I conceive to be the Dean of her Majesties Chappel, in which that service was performed; and the next day the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom was solemnly proclaimed King by the sound of Trumpet; declared to be associated with her in the publick Government, and order given to have his name used in all Coyns and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But neither the impossibility of untying this knot, nor the gracious answer she had made to the Commissioners of the late Assembly, could hinder the Confederate Lords from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out into action. But first they published a Remonstrance (as the custom was) to abuse the people; in which it was made known to all whom it might concern, <hi>That the Kingdom was openly wronged, the liberties thereof oppressed, and a King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon the people without the consent of the Estates</hi>; which they pretend to be a thing not practised in the former time, contrary to the Laws and received Customs of the Country: <hi>And thereupon desired all good Subjects to take the matter into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and to joyn with them in resisting those beginnings of Tyranny.</hi> But few there were that would be taken with these Baits, or thought themselves in any danger by the present Marriage; which gave the Queen no power at home, and much less abroad. And that they might continue always in so good a posture, the young King was perswaded to shew himself at <hi>Knoxes</hi> Sermon; but received such an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from that fiery and seditious spirit, as he little looked
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54836:100"/>
for. For <hi>Knox,</hi> according to his custom, neither regarding the Kings presence, nor fearing what might follow on his alienating from the cause of the Kirk, fell amongst other things to speak of the Government of wicked Princes, who for the sins of the people were sent as Tyrants and Scourges to plague them; but more particularly, that people were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more scourged by God, then by advancing boys and Women to the Regal Throne. Which if it did displease the King, and give offence to many Conscientious and Religious men, can seem strange to none.</p>
            <p n="57">57. In the mean time the discontented Lords depart from <hi>Stirling</hi> more discontented then they came, because the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came not in to aid them, as they had expected. From <hi>Stirling</hi> they remove to <hi>Paisely,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> the Castle whereof they resolved to Fortifie for their present defence. But they were followed so close by the King and Queen, and so divided in opinion amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that it seemed best to them to be gone, and try what Friends and Followers they could finde in <hi>Edenborough:</hi> but they found that place too hot for them also; the Captain of the Castle did so ply them with continual shot, that it was held unsafe for them to abide there longer. From thence therefore they betook themselves to the Town of <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> not far from the City of <hi>Carlisle</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> into which they might easily escape, whatsoever happened, as in time they did. For the King leaving his old Father, the Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> to attend them there, march'd with his Forces into <hi>Fife,</hi> where the party of the Lords seemed most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; which Province they reduced to their obedience: some of the great Lords of it had forsook their dwellings, many were taken prisoners and put to Ransome, and some of the chief Towns fined for their late disloyalty: Which done, they march to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and from thence followed to <hi>Dumfreis.</hi> On whose approach, the Lords, unable to defend themselves against their Forces, put themselves into <hi>Carlisle,</hi> where they are courteously received by the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> who was then Lord-Warden of the Marches; from thence Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Glencarne</hi> and <hi>Rothes,</hi> the Lord <hi>Vchiltry,</hi> the Commendator of <hi>Kilvinning,</hi> and divers others of good note, removed not long after to <hi>New-castle,</hi> that they might have the easier passage into <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> if their occasions so required. The Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> is dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Court of <hi>England</hi>; but there he found so little comfort, at the least in shew, as brought the Queen under a suspition amongst the <hi>Scots,</hi> either of deep dissimulation, or of great inconstancy. The news whereof did so distract and divide the rest, that Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> under-hand made his own peace with his injured Queen, and put himself into her power
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54836:100"/>
in the <hi>December</hi> following. The falling off of which great person so amazed the rest, that now they are resolved to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all those desperate counsels, by which they might preserve themselves and destroy their enemies, though to the ruine of the King, the Queen, and their natural Country.

The frustrating of these hopes so exceedingly vexed him (as certainly some are as much disquieted with the loss of what they never had, as others with the ruine of a present possession) that the next year he joyned himself to those of the Congregation, took <hi>Knox</hi> into his most immediate and particular care, and went along with him hand in hand in defacing the Churches of St. <hi>Andrews, Stirling, Lithgow, Edenborough,</hi> and indeed what not? And for so doing, he received two sharp and chiding Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the King and Queen, upbraiding him with former Benefits received from each, and threatning severe punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if he returned not immediately to his due obedience. Which notwithstanding, he continues in his former courses, applies himself unto the Queen and Council of <hi>England,</hi> and lays the plot for driving the French Forces out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Which done; he caused the Parliament of 1560 to be held at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> procures some Acts to pass for banishing the Popes Supremacie, repealed all former Statutes which were made in maintainance of that Religion, and ratifies the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> in such form and manner as it was afterwards confirmed in the first Parliament of King <hi>Iames</hi> the Sixth. Upon the death of <hi>Francis</hi> the young <hi>French</hi> King, he goes over again. And after some condolements betwixt him and the Queen, intimates both to her and the Princes of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> how ill the rugged and untractable nature of the <hi>Scots</hi> would sort with one, who had been used to the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and affabilities of the Court of <hi>France</hi>; adviseth that some principal person of the Realm of <hi>Scotland</hi> might be
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54836:102"/>
named for Regent; and in a manner recommends himself to them as the fittest man. But the worst was, that his Mother had been heard to brag amongst some of her Gossips, that her Son was the lawful Issue of King <hi>Iames</hi> the Fifth; to whose desires she had never yeilded, but on promise of Marriage. This was enough to cross him in his present aims, and not to trust him with a power by which he might be able to effect his purposes, if he had any such aspirings. And so he was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist again, without further honour then the carrying back of a Commission to some Lords in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by which they were impowered to manage the affairs of that Kingdom till the Queens return.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This second disappointment adds more Fewel to the former flame; and he resolves to give the Queen as little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of that Crown, as if it were a Crown of Thorns, as indeed it proved. For taking <hi>England</hi> in his way, he applies himself to some of the Lords of the Council, to whom he represents the dangers which must needs ensue to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> if <hi>Mary</hi> his own Queen were suffered to return into her Country, and thereby lay all passages open to the powers of <hi>France,</hi> where she had still a very strong and prevailing party. But when he found that she had fortunately escaped the Ships of <hi>England,</hi> that the Subjects from all parts had went away extremely sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with her gratious carriage, he resolved to make one in the <hi>Hosanna,</hi> as afterwards he was the Chief in the <hi>Crucifige</hi>; he applies himself unto the Queens humour with all art and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, and really performed to her many signal services, in gratifying her with the free exercise of her own Religion; in which, by reason of his great Authority with the Congregation, he was best able to oblige both her self and her servants. By this means he became so great in the eyes of the Court, that the Queen seemed to be governed wholly by him: and that he might continue always in so good a posture, she first conferred upon him the Earldom of <hi>Murray,</hi> and after married him to a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Keith,</hi> Earl-Marshal of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Being thus honoured and allyed, his next care was to remove all impediments which he found in the way to his aspiring. The Ancient and Potent Family of the <hi>Gourdons</hi> he suppressed and ruined, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it reflourished in its ancient glory: But his main business was to oppress the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> as the next Heirs unto the Crown in the common opinion; the Chief whereof (whom the <hi>French</hi> King had created Duke of <hi>Chasteau-Herald,</hi> a Town in <hi>Poictou</hi>) he had so discountenanced, that he was forced to leave the Court, and suffer his eldest Son the Earl of <hi>Arrane</hi> to be kept in prison, under pretence of some distemper in his brain. When any great Prince sought the Queen in Marriage, he used to tell her, that the <hi>Scots</hi> would never brook the power of a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and that whensoever that Crown had fallen into the hands of a Daughter, as it did to her, a Husband was chosen for
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54836:102"/>
her by the Estates of the Kingdom, of their own Language, Laws and Parentage. But when this would not serve his turn to break off the Marriage with the young Lord <hi>Darnley,</hi> none seemed more forward then himself to promote that Match which he perceived he could not hinder: Besides, he knew that the Gentleman was very young, of no great insight in business, mainly addicted to his pleasures, and utterly unexperienced in the affairs of that Kingdom; so that he need not fear the weakning of his power by such a King, who desired not to take the Government upon him. And in this point he agreed well enough with <hi>David Risio,</hi> though on different ends. But when he found the Queen so passionately affected to this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Husband; that all Graces and Court-favours were to pass by him; that he had not the Queens ear so advantagiously as before he had; and that she had revoked some Grants which were made to him and others, during her minority, as against the Law; he thought it most expedient to the furthering of his own concernments, to peece himself more nearly with the Earls of <hi>Morton, Glencarne, Arguile</hi> and <hi>Rothes,</hi> the Lords <hi>Ruthen, Vchiltry, &amp;c.</hi> whom he knew to be zealously affected to the Reformation, and no way pleased with the Queens Marriage to a person of the other Religion. By whom it was resolved, that <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Ruthen</hi> should remain in the Court, as well to give as to receive intelligence of all proceedings:<note place="margin">1565.</note> The others were to take up Arms, and to raise the people, under pretence of the Queens Marriage to a man of the Popish Religion, not taking with her the consent of the Queen of <hi>England.</hi> But being too weak to keep the Field, they first put themselves into <hi>Carlisle,</hi> and afterwards into <hi>New-castle,</hi> as before was said; and being in this manner fled the Kingdom, they are all proclaimed Traytors to the Queen; a peremptory day appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a publick Tryal; on which if they appeared not at the Bar of Justice, they were to undergo the sentence of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And now their Agents in the Court begin to bustle: the King was soon perceived to be a meer outside-man, of no deep reach into Affairs, and easily wrought on; which first induced the Queen to set the less value on him; nor was it long before some of their Court-Females whispered into her ears, that she was much neglected by him, that he spent more of his time in Hawking and Hunting, and perhaps in more unfit divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (if <hi>Knox</hi> speak him rightly) then he did in her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and therefore that it would be requisite to lure him in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was too much on the Wing, and beyond her call. On these suggestions, she gave order to her Secretaries, and other Officers, to place his name last in all publick Acts, and in such Coyns as were new stamped to leave it out. This happened as they would have wished: For hereupon Earl <hi>Morton</hi> closeth with the King, insinuates unto him how unfit it was that he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54836:103"/>
should be subject to his Wife; that it was the duty of women to obey, and of men to govern; and therefore that he might do well to set the Crown on his own head, and take that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into his hands which belonged unto him. When they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that his ears lay open to the like temptations, they then began to buz into them, the <hi>Risio</hi> was grown too powerful for him in the Court, that he out-vied him in the bravery both of Clothes and Horses, and that this could proceed from no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground then the Queens affection, which was suspected by wise men to be somewhat greater then might stand with honour. And now the day draws on apace, on which Earl <hi>Murray</hi> and the rest were to make their appearance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore somewhat must be done to put the Court into such confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and the City of <hi>Edenborough</hi> into such disorder, that they might all appear without fear or danger of any legal prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution to be made against him. The day designed for their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, was the twelfth day of <hi>March</hi>; and on the day before, say some, (or third day before, as others) the Conspirators go unto the King, seemed to accuse him of delay, tell him that now or never was the time to revenge his injuries, for that he should now finde the fellow in the Queens private Chamber, without any force to make resistance. So in they rush, find<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>David</hi> sitting at the Queens Table, the Countess of <hi>Arguile</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly between them. <hi>Ruthen</hi> commands him to arise, and to go with him, telling him that the place in which he sate did no way beseem him. The poor fellow runs unto the Queen for protection, and clasps his arms about her middle; which the King forcibly unfastneth, and puts him to the power of his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enemies, by whom he was dragged down the Stairs, and stabbed in so many places (fifty three, saith <hi>Knox</hi>) that his whole body seemed to be like a piece of Cut-work. Which barbarous Murther <hi>Knox</hi> proclaims for an act of justice, calls it a <hi>just pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> on that <hi>Pultron and vile Knave</hi> David, for <hi>abusing the Common wealth, and his other villanies</hi>; and heavily complains, that the <hi>Chief Actors</hi> in the same (which he extols for a <hi>just act, and most worthy of all praise,</hi> p. 96.) <hi>were so unworthily left by the rest of their Brethren, and forced to suffer the bitterness of exile and banishment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Queen was then grown great with Childe, and being affrighted at the suddenness of this execution, and the fear of some treasonable attempt against her person, was in no small danger of miscarrying. The Court was full of Tumult, and the noise thereof so alarmed the Town, that the people flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither in great multitudes to know the matter; to whom the King signified out of a Window, that the Queen was safe; which somewhat appeased them for the present: But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, both the Court and City were in such distraction, that when the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> and the rest of the Confederates tendred their appearance, and offered themselves unto the tryal
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54836:103"/>
of the Law, there was no information made against them, nor any one sufficiently instructed for the prosecution. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing observed, they address themselves to the Parliament House, and there take instruments to testifie upon Record, that they were ready to answer whatsoever could be charged upon them; but none there to prosecute. And here the Scene begins to change: <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Ruthen,</hi> and the rest of their accomplices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselves to <hi>New-castle,</hi> as the safest Sanctuary; and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> staid behinde to negotiate for them.

She on the other side, to shew how much she valued the affection of so dear a Brother, was easily intreated that <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Lindesay,</hi> and the rest who remained at <hi>New-castle,</hi> should be permitted to return; but so, that it should rather seem to be done upon the earnest sollicitations of the Earls of <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Arguile,</hi> then at his request. The King in the mean time findes his errour, and earnestly supplicates unto her for a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement; assuring her, that he had never fallen on that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate action, but as he was forcibly thrust upon it by <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Murray.</hi> And that he might regain his reputation in the sight of the people, he openly protested his innocency at the Cross in <hi>Edenborough</hi> by sound of Trumpet, and publickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred, that his consent had gone no further with the Murtherers, then for the recalling of the banished Lords which were sled into <hi>England.</hi> The young Prince was not so well studied in the School of mischief, as to have learned that there is no safety in committing one act of wickedness, but by proceeding to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or at the least, by standing stoutly unto that which was first committed, that so his confidence might in time be took for innocencie. A lesson which the rest of the Confederates had took out long since, and were now upon the point to practice it upon himself.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For by this piece of ostentation and impertinencie,<note place="margin">1566.</note> the King gained nothing on the people, and lost himself exceedingly amongst the Peers; for as none of the common sort did believe him to be the more innocent of the wicked murther, because he washed his hands of it in the sight of the multitude; so the great men which had the guiding of the Faction, disdained him as a weak and impotent person, not to be trusted in affairs of his own concernment: nor did he edifie better with the Queen, then he did with the Subjects; who was so far from suffering any hearty reconciliation to be made between them, that she exprest more favour unto <hi>Murray</hi> then in former times. Which so exasperated the neglected and forsaken Prince, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved on sending <hi>Murray</hi> after <hi>Risio</hi>; with which he makes the Queen acquainted, in hopes she would approve of it as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent service; but she disswades him from the fact, and tells
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54836:104"/>
               <hi>Murray</hi> of it; knowing full well, that which soever of the two miscarried in it, she should either loose an hated Friend, or a dangerous Enemy. <hi>Murray</hi> communicates the Affair with <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and the rest of his Friends. By whom it is agreed, that they should take into their Friendship the Earle of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> a man of an audacious spirit, apt for any mischief; but otherwise of approved valour, and of a known fidelity to the Queen in her greatest dangers. He had before some quarrels with the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> of whose designs he was not distrustful without cause; and therefore laboured both by force and practice, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make him less or nothing. But <hi>Murray</hi> was too hard for him at the weapon of Wit, and was so much too powerful for him, both in Court and Consistory, that he was forced to quit the Kingdom, and retire to <hi>France.</hi> Returning at such time as <hi>Murray</hi> and the rest of the Confederates were compelled to take sanctuary at <hi>New-castle,</hi> he grew into great favour with the Queen, whose discontents against the King he knew how to nourish; which made his friendship the more acceptable, and his assistance the more useful in the following Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Thus <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> are made friends, and the poor King must fall a <hi>peace offering</hi> for their Redintegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But first they would expect the issue of the Queens deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, by the success whereof, the principal conspirators were resolved to steer their course. On the 19 day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> she is delivered of a Son in the Castle of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> to the general joy of all the Kingdom, and the particular comfort of the chief Governours of Affairs for the Congregation. There was no more use now of a King or Queen, when God had given them a young Prince to sit upon the Throne of his Fathers; in whose minority they might put themselves into such a posture, that he should never be able to act much against them when he came to age. And now they deal with <hi>Bothwel</hi> more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally then before they did, incourage him to remove the King by some means or other, to separate himself from his own Wife, (a Daughter of the House of <hi>Huntley</hi>) and Espouse the Queen. Let him but act the first part, as most proper for him, and they would easily finde a way to bring on the rest. For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof, and to stand to him in it against all the world, they bound themselves severally and joyntly under Hand and Seal. In which most wicked practice they had all these ends: first, the dispatching of the King; next, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> whom they feared and hated; thirdly, the weakning of the Queen both in power and credit, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the drawing of all Affairs to their own disposing. <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> in order to the plot makes use of <hi>Ledington</hi> to prompt the Queen to a Divorce, which he conceived might easily be effected in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; and is himself as diligent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions to work upon the Queens displeasures, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54836:104"/>
make the breach wider betwixt her and her Husband. The greatness of which breach was before so visible, that nothing was more commonly known, nor generally complained of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the people: But never was it made so eminently noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the eye of Strangers, as at the Christening of the young Prince in <hi>December</hi> following. At which time she would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffer the Ambassadors of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England</hi> to give him a visit, nor permit him to shew himself amongst them at the Christening Banquet. From <hi>Stirling,</hi> where the Prince was Christened, he departs for <hi>Glasco,</hi> to finde some comfort from his Father. To which place he was brought not without much difficulty: for falling sick upon the way, it appeared plainly by some symptoms that he had been poysoned, the terrible effects whereof he felt in all the parts of his body with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable torments: But strength of Nature, Youth and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick did so work together, that he began to be in a good way of recovery, to the great grief of those who had laid the plot. Some other way must now be taken to effect the business, and none more expedient then to perswade the Queen to see him, to fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tter him with some hopes of her former favour, and bring him back with her to <hi>Edenborough</hi>; which was done according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. At <hi>Edenborough</hi> he was lodged at a private house, on the outside of the Town, (an house unseemly for a King, as <hi>Knox</hi> confesseth) and therefore the fitter for their purpose: where, on the 9 of <hi>February</hi> at night, the poor Prince was strangled, his dead body laid in an Orchard near adjoyning, with one of his Servants lying by it, whom they also murthered; and the house most ridiculously blown up with powder, as if that blow could have been given without mangling and breaking the two bodies in a thousand pieces.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The infamy of this horrid murther is generally cast upon the Queen, by the arts of those whom it concerned to make her odious with all honest men; nor did there want some strong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions which might induce them to believe that she was of the counsel in the fact; and with the good Brethren of the Congregation, every presumption was a proof, and every weak proof was thought sufficient to convict her of it. But that which most confirmed them in their suspitions, was her affection unto <hi>Bothwel,</hi> whom she first makes Duke of <hi>Orknay,</hi> and on the 15 of <hi>May</hi> is married to him in the Chappel of <hi>Halyrood</hi>-house, according to the form observed by those of the Congregation. But against these presumptions there were stronger evidences: <hi>Bothwel</hi> being compelled not long after to flee into <hi>Denmark,</hi> did there most constantly profess, both living and dying, that the Queen was innocent. <hi>Morton</hi> affirmed the same at his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above twelve years after, relating that when <hi>Bothwel</hi> dealt with him about the murther, and that he shewed himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to consent unto it without the Queens Warrant and Allowance; <hi>Bothwel</hi> made answer, that they must not give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54836:105"/>
any hope of that, but that the business must be done without her privity. But that which seems to make most for her justification, was the confession of <hi>Hepbourne, Daglish,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>Bothwels</hi> servants, who were condemned for murdering the young King; and being brought unto the Gallows, they protested before God and his holy Angels, that <hi>Bothwel</hi> had never told them of any other Authors of so lewd a counsel, but onely the two Earls of <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Murray.</hi> In the mean time the common infamy prevailed, and none is made more guilty of it then this wretched Queen, who had been drawn to give consent to her marriage with <hi>Bothwel,</hi> by the sollicitation and advice of those very men, who afterwards condemned her for it. In order to whose ends, <hi>Buchanan</hi> publishes a most pestilent and malicious Libel,<note place="margin">1567.</note> which he called, <hi>The defection,</hi> wherein he publickly traduced her for living an adulterous life with <hi>David Risio,</hi> and afterward with <hi>Bothwel</hi> himself; that to precipitate her unlawful marriage with him, she had contrived the death of the King her husband, projected a Divorce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Bothwel</hi> and his former Wife, contrary to the Laws both of God and Man. Which Libel being printed and dispersed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, obtained so much credit with most sorts of people, that few made question of the truth of the accusations. Most true it is, that <hi>Buchanan</hi> is reported by King <hi>Iames</hi> himself to have confessed with great grief at the time of his death, how falsly and injuriously he had dealt with her in that scandalous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet: but this confession came too late, and was known to few, and therefore proved too weak a remedy for the former mischief.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He published at the same time also that seditious Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, which he entituled, <hi>De jure Regni apud Scotos.</hi> In which he laboured to make proof, that the Supreme power of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation was in the body of the people, no otherwise in the King but by delegation; and therefore that it was in the peoples power, not onely to control and censure, but also to depose and condemn their Kings, if they found them faulty. The man was learned for his time, but a better Poet then Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and yet a better Historian then he was a States-man. For being of the <hi>Genevian</hi> Leven, he fitted all his State-maximes unto <hi>Calvins</hi> Principles, and may be thought in many points to out-go his Master.

And that he might make sure work of it, he takes upon him to reply upon all Objections, which sober and more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men had found out to the contrary. For whereas it had been objected, <hi>That custom was against such dealing with Princes: That</hi> Jeremiah <hi>commanded obedience to</hi> Nebuchadnezzar: <hi>That God placed Tyrants sometimes for punishment of his people: That the Iews dealt not so with any of their Princes; and that there was no example to be found in Scripture, to shew that subjects may so use their Governours, as is there pretended:</hi> To all these he returns his particular answers; and in this sort he answereth to them, that is to say, <hi>That there is nothing more dangerous to be followed then a common custom: That the example is but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and concludeth nothing: That as God placed Tyrants to punish the people, so he appoints private men to kill them: That the Kings of the Iews were not elected by the people, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might not deal with them, as they might in</hi> Scotland, <hi>where Kings depend wholly on the peoples Election: And finally, that there were sundry good and wholesome Laws in divers Countries, of which there is no example in holy Scripture.</hi> And whereas others had objected, <hi>That by St.</hi> Pauls <hi>Doctrine we are bound to pray for Kings and Princes:</hi> The Argument is evaded by this handsome shift, <hi>That we are bound to pray for those whom we ought to punish.</hi> But these are onely velitations, certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory skirmishes to the grand encounter; the main battail followeth. For finally, the principal objection is, <hi>That St.</hi> Paul <hi>hath commanded every soul to be subject to the higher Powers; and that St.</hi> Peter <hi>hath required us to submit our selves to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Ordinance of man, whether it be unto the King as to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, or unto such as be in Authority by and under him.</hi> And hereunto they frame their Answer in such a manner, as if they knew Gods minde better then the Apostles did, or that of the Apostles better then they did themselves.</p>

Man; as bestowed the Churches Revenues upon Iesters and Rascals, and such as gibed at those who did profess the more sincere Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; what would they write of such to the Church? Surely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they would dissent from themselves, they would say, That they accounted no such for Magistrates; they would forbid all men from speaking unto them, and from keeping their company; they would leave them to their subjects to be punished; nor would they blame them if they accounted not such men for their Kings, with whom they could have no society by the Laws of God.</hi> So excellent a proficient did this man shew himself in the Schools of <hi>Calvin,</hi> that he might worthily have challenged the place of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity-Reader in <hi>Geneva</hi> it self.</p>
            <p n="12">12. To put these Principles into practice, a Bond is made at <hi>Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> by some of the chief Lords of the Congregation, pretended for the preservation of the Infant-Prince; but aiming also at the punishment of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> and the rest of the Murtherers. The first that entred into this Combination, were the Earls of <hi>Athol, Arguile, Morton, Marre</hi> and <hi>Glencarne,</hi> with the Lords <hi>Lindsay</hi> and <hi>Boyd</hi>; to which were added not long after, the Lords <hi>Hume</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> (this <hi>Ruthen</hi> being the Son of him who had acted in the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>David Risio</hi>) together with the Lairds of <hi>Drumlanrig, Tulibardin, Seffourd</hi> and <hi>Grange,</hi> men of great power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on their several Countries; besides many others of good note. The Earl <hi>Murray</hi> having laid the plot, obtained the Queens leave to retire into <hi>France</hi> till the times were quieter, committing to the Queen the Government of his whole Estate; that so if his designe miscarried, as it possibly might, he might come off without the least hazard of estate or honour. Of this conspiracie the Queen receives advertisement, and presently prepares for Arms, under pretence of rectifying some abuses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Borders. The Confederates were not much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; and having got together a considerable power, made an attempt on <hi>Borthwick</hi> Castle, where the Queen and <hi>Bothwel</hi> then remained. But not being strong enough to carry the place at the first attempt, <hi>Bothwel</hi> escaped unto <hi>Dunbar,</hi> whom the Queen followed shortly after in mans apparel. Missing their prey, the Confederates march toward <hi>Edenborough</hi> with their little army, and make themselves Masters of the Town. But understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Queens Forces were upon their march, they betook themselves unto the field, gained the advantage of the ground, and thereby gave her such a diffidence of her good success, that having entertained them with a long parley, till <hi>Bothwel</hi> was gone off in safety, she put her self into their hands without striking a blow.</p>
            <p n="13">13. With this great prey the Confederates returned to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> in the middle of <hi>Iune</hi>; and the next day order her to be sent as Prisoner to <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>chlevin</hi>-house, under the conduct of the Lords <hi>Ruthen</hi> and <hi>Lindsay,</hi> by whom she was delivered in a very plain and sorry attire to the custody of <hi>Murray</hi>'s Mother, who
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54836:106"/>
domineered over the unfortunate Lady with contempt enough. The next day after her commitment, the Earl of <hi>Glencarne</hi> passeth to the Chappel in <hi>Halyrood</hi> house, where he defaceth all the Vestments, breaks down the Altar, and destroys the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages. For which though he was highly magnified by <hi>Knox,</hi> and the rest of the Preachers; yet many of the chief Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates were offended at it, as being done without their consent, when a great storm was gathering towards them, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of some other of the principal Lords on the Queens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. To reconcile this party to them, and prevent the Rupture, <hi>Knox</hi> with some other of their Preachers are dispatched away with Letters of Credence, and instructions for attoning the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. But they effected nothing to the benefit of them that sent them, and not much neither to their own, though they had some concernments of self-interest besides the publick, which they made tender of to their considerations. A general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly at the same time was held in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> with which upon the coming back of these Commissioners, it was thought necessary to ingratiate themselves by all means imaginable. And thereupon it was agreed, that the Acts of Parliament made in the year 1560, for the suppressing of Popery, should be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the next Parliament then following; that the assignation of the Shires for the Ministers maintainance, should be duly put in execution, till the whole Patrimony of the Church might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested in them in due form of Law; which was conditioned to be done (if it could not be done sooner) in that Parliament also. Some other points of huge concernment to the Church were then also moved; but they were onely promised, without any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. It was also then agreed between them, that all Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Barons, and other Professors should imploy their whole Forces, Strength and Power, for the punishment of all and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever persons that should be tryed and found guilty of that horrible Murther of late committed on the King: And further, that all the Kings and Princes which should succeed in following times to the Crown of that Realm, should be bound by Oath before their Inauguration, to maintain the true Religion of Christ, professed then presently in that Kingdom. Thus the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates and the Kirk are united together; and hard it is to say, whether of the two were least execusable before God and man. But they followed the light of their own principles, and thought that an excuse sufficient, without fear of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The news of these proceedings alarms all Christendom, and presently Ambassadors are dispatched from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> to mediate with the Confederates (they must not be called Rebels) for the Queens Delivery. <hi>Throgmorton</hi> for the Queen of <hi>England</hi> presseth hard upon it, and shewed himself exceeding earnest and industrious in pursuance of it. But <hi>Knox</hi> and self-interest prevailed more amongst them, then all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54836:107"/>
whatsoever, there being nothing more insisted upon by that fiery spirit, then that she was to be deprived of her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Life together. And this he thundred from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit with as great a confidence, as if he had received his Doctrine at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> from the hands of God, at the giving of the Law to <hi>Moses.</hi> Nor was <hi>Throgmorton</hi> thought to be so Zealous on the other side, as he outwardly seemed. For he well knew how much it might concern his Queen in her personal safety, and the whole Realm of <hi>England</hi> in its peace and happiness, that the poor Queen should be continued in the same (or a worse) condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to which these wretched men had brought her. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was much suspected by most knowing men, that secretly he did more thrust on her deprivation with one hand, then he seemed to hinder it with both. Wherewith incouraged, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise being too far gone to retire with safety, <hi>Lindsay</hi> and <hi>Ruthen</hi> are dispatched to <hi>Lochlevin</hi>-house, to move her for a resignation of the Crown to her Infant-Son. Which when she would by no means yeild to, a Letter is sent to her from <hi>Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton</hi> to perswade her to it; assuring her, that whatsoever was done by her under that constraint, would be void in Law. This first began to work her to that resolution. But nothing more prevailed upon her, then the rough carriage of the two Lords which first made the motion. By whom she was threatned in plain terms, that if she did not forthwith yeild unto the desires of her people, they would question her for incontinent living, the murther of the King, her tyranny, and the manifest violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Laws of the Land, in some secret transactions with the <hi>French.</hi> Terrified wherewith, without so much as reading what they offered to her, she sets her hand to three several Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; In the first of which, she gave over the Kingdom to her young Son, at that time little more then a twelve Month old; in the second, she constituted <hi>Murray</hi> Vice-Roy during his minority; and in the third, in case that <hi>Murray</hi> should refuse it, she substitutes Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Lenox, Arguile, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thol, Morton, Glencarne</hi> and <hi>Marre</hi>; all but the two first being sworn Servants unto <hi>Murray,</hi> and the two first made use of one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to discharge the matter.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Thus furnished and impowered, the Lords return in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to their fellows at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> with the sound of a Trumpet; and presently it was resolved to Crown the Infant-King with as much speed as might be, for fear of all such altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as might otherwise happen. And thereunto they spurred on with such precipitation, that whereas they extorted those subscriptions from her on St. <hi>Iame</hi>'s day, being the 25 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Coronation was dispatched on the 29. The Sermon, for the greater grace of the matter, must be preached by <hi>Knox</hi>; but the superstitious part and ceremony of it was left to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Bishop of <hi>Orknay,</hi> another of the natural Sons of <hi>Iames</hi> the Fifth, assisted by two Superintendents of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54836:107"/>
And that all things might come as near as might be to the Ancient Forms, the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> and the Lord <hi>Humes</hi> took Oath for the King, that he should maintain the Religion which was then received, and minister Justice equally to all the Subjects. Of which particular the King made afterwards an especial use, in justifying the use of God-fathers and God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at the Baptizing of Infants, when it was questioned in the Conference at <hi>Hampton-court.</hi> Scarce fifteen days were past from the Coronation, when <hi>Murray</hi> shewed himself in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as if he had dropt down from Heaven for the good of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he had took <hi>England</hi> in his way, and made himself so sure a party in that Court, that he was neither affraid to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Regencie in such a dangerous point of time, nor to expostulate bitterly with his own Queen for her former actions: not now the same man as before in the time of her glories. For the first handselling of his Government, he calls a Parliament, and therein ratifies the Acts of 1560 for suppressing Popery, as had been promised to the last general Assembly; and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the Arraignment of <hi>Hepbourne, Hay</hi> and <hi>Daglish</hi> for the horrible murther of the King: by each of which it was confessed at their execution, that <hi>Bothwel</hi> was present at the murther, and that he had assured them at their first ingaging that most of the Noble-men in the Realm (<hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Morton</hi> amongst others) were consenting to it.</p>
            <p n="16">16. And now or never must the Kirk begin to bear up brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: In which if they should fail, let <hi>Knox</hi> bear the blame for want of well-tutoring them in the Catechism of their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. They found themselves so necessary to this new Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, that it could not well subsist without them; and they resolved to make the proudest he that was, to feel the dint of their spirit. A general Assembly was convened not long after the Parliament, by which the Bishop of <hi>Orknay</hi> was convented and deposed from his Function, for joyning the Queen in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the Earl of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> though he proceeded by the Form of their own devising. And by the same the Countess of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile</hi> was ordained (after citation on their part, and appearance on hers) to give satisfaction to the Kirk, for being present at the Baptism of the Infant-King, because performed according to the Rites of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> the satisfaction to be made in <hi>Stirling</hi> where she had offended, upon a Sunday after Sermon; the more particular time and manner of it, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the Superintendent of <hi>Lothian.</hi> And this was pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty handsome for the first beginning, according whereunto it was thought fit by the Chief Leaders to run on till they came to the end of the Race; of which in general King <hi>Iames</hi> hath given us this description in a Declaration of his published not long after the surprising of his person by the Earl of <hi>Gowry</hi> 15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="17">17. But all this was not done at once, though laid here together, to shew how answerable their proceedings were to their first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings. To cool which heats, and put some Water in their Wine,<note place="margin">1568.</note> the Queen by practising on her Keepers escapes the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and puts her self into <hi>Hamilton</hi> Castle; to which not onely the dependants of that powerful Family, but many great Lords, and divers others, did with great cheerfulness repair unto her with their several followers. Earl <hi>Murray</hi> was at <hi>Stirling</hi> when this news came to him; and it concerned him to bestir himself with all celerity, before the Queens power was grown too great to be disputed. He therefore calls together such of his Friends and their adherents as were near unto him, and with them gives bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail to the Queen, who in this little time had got together a small Army of four thousand men. The honour of the day attends the Regent, who with the loss of one man onely bought an easie Victory; which might have proved more bloudy to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Army, (for they lost but three hundred in the fight) it he had not commanded back his Souldiers from the execution. The Queen was placed upon a Hill to behold the battail. But when she saw the issue of it, she posted with all speed to the Port of <hi>Kerbright,</hi> took Ship for <hi>England,</hi> and landed most unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately (as it after proved) at <hi>Wirckington</hi> in the County of <hi>Cumberland.</hi> From thence she dispatched her Letters to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> full of Complaints, and passionate bewailings of her wretched fortune; desires admittance to her presence, and that she might be taken into her protection; sending withal a Ring which
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54836:108"/>
that Queen had given her, to be an everlasting token of that love and amity which was to be maintained between them. But she soon found how miserably she had deceived her self in her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. <hi>Murray</hi> was grown too strong for her in the Court of <hi>England</hi>; and others which regarded little what became of him, were glad of her misfortunes in relation to their own se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; which could not better be consulted, then by keeping a good Guard upon her, now they had her there. And so in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead of sending for her to the Court, the Queen gives order by Sir <hi>Francis Knollis</hi> (whom she sent of purpose) to remove the distressed Lady to <hi>Carlisle,</hi> as the safer place, until the equity of her cause might be fully known. She hath now took possession of the Realm which she had laid claim to, but shall pay dearly for the purchase; the Crown whereof shall come at last to her Posterity, though it did not fall upon her person.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Now that the equity of her cause might be understood, the Regent is required by Letters from the Court of <hi>England</hi> to desist from any further prosecution of the vanquished party, till that Queen were perfectly informed in all particulars touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Affairs. Which notwithstanding, he thought fit to make use of his Fortune, summoned a Parliament, in which some few of each sort, noble and ignoble, were proscribed for the present; by the terrour whereof many of the rest submitted, and they which would not were reduced by force of Arms. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> not well pleased with these proceedings, requires that some Commissioners might be sent from <hi>Scotland</hi> to render an account to her, or to her Commissioners, of the severity and hard dealing which they had shewed unto their Queen. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he was necessitated to conform, as the case then stood: The <hi>French</hi> being totally made against him, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> more displeased then they, and no help <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

At <hi>York</hi> Commissioners attend from each part in the end of <hi>September.</hi> From Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk, Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Sussex,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph Sadlier</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> For the unfortunate Queen of <hi>Scots, Iohn Lesly</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> the Lords <hi>Levington, Boyd, &amp;c.</hi> And for the Infant King, besides the Regent himself, there appeared the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lindsay,</hi> and certain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. After such protestations made on both sides as seemed expedient for preserving the Authority of the several Crowns, an Oath is took by the Commissioners to proceed in the business according to the Rules of Justice and Equity. The Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from the Infant-King present a Declaration of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the former troubles; to which an answer is returned by those of the other side. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> desiring to be better sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in some particulars, requires the Commissioners of both sides, some of them at the least, to repair unto her; where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much sending and proving (as the saying is) there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done which might redound unto the benefit of the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>

For whilst these matters were in agitation in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> Letters of hers were intercepted, written by her to those which continued of her party in the Realm of <hi>Scotland.</hi> In which Letters she complained, <hi>that the Queen of</hi> England <hi>had not kept promise with her; but yet desired them to be of good heart, because she was assured of aid by some other means, and hoped to be with them in a short time.</hi> Which Letters being first sent to <hi>Murray,</hi> and by him shewed to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so much for his advantage, that he was not onely dismissed with favour, but waited on by her command through every County by the Sheriffs and Gentry, till he came to <hi>Berwick</hi>; from whence he passed safely unto <hi>Edenborough,</hi> where he was welcomed with great joy by his Friends and Followers. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else memorable in this Treaty which concerns our History, but that when <hi>Murray</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissioners were commanded by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to give a reason of their proceedings against that Queen, they justified themselves by the Authority of <hi>Calvin:</hi> by which they did endeavour to prove, (as my Author hath it) <hi>That the</hi> Popular Magistrates <hi>are appointed and made to moderate, and keep in order, the excess and unruliness of Kings; and that it was lawful for them to put the Kings, that be evil and wicked, into prison, and also to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their Kingdoms.</hi> Which Doctrine, how it relished with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> may be judged by any that knows with what a Soveraign power she disposed of all things in her own Dominions, without fear of rendring an account to such Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Magistrates, as <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrine might encourage to require it of her. But <hi>Calvin</hi> found more Friends in <hi>Scotland,</hi> then in all the world; there being no Kingdom, Principality, or other Estate, which had herein followed <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrine, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoning, deposing, and expelling their own natural Prince, till the <hi>Scots</hi> first led the way unto it in this sad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Between the last Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Regents journey into <hi>England,</hi> a general Assembly of the Kirk was held at <hi>Edenborough</hi> In which they entred into consideration of some disorders which had before been tolerated in the said Assem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly, and were thought fit to be redressed. For remedy whereof, it was enacted, <hi>That none should be admitted to have voice in these Assemblies, but Superintendents, Visitors of Churches, Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners of Shires and Vniversities; together with such other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, to be elected or approved by the Superintendents, as were of knowledge and ability to dispute and reason of such Matters as were there propounded.</hi> It was ordained also, <hi>That all Papists which continued obstinate after lawful admonition, should be Excommunicated; as also, that the committers of Murther, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest, Adultery, and other such hainous crimes, should not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to make satisfaction by any particulur Church, till they did first appear in the habit of penitents before the general Assembly,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54836:109"/>
and there receive their Order in it.</hi> It was also condescended to, upon the humble Supplication of the Bishop of <hi>Orkney,</hi> that he should be restored unto his place, from which they had deposed him, for his acting in the Queens Marriage: Which favour they were pleased to extend unto him, upon this Condition, That for removing of the scandal, he should in his first Sermon acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the fault which he had committed; and crave pardon of God, the Kirk, and the State, whom he had offended. But their main business was to alter the Book of Discipline, especially in that part of it which related to the Superinterdents, whom though they countenanced for the present by the former Sanction, till they had put themselves in a better posture; yet they resolve to bring them by degrees to a lower station, and to lay them level with the rest. In reference whereunto, the Regent is sollicited by their Petition, that certain Lords of secret Council might be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confer with some of the said Assembly, touching the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lity and Jurisdiction of the Kirk, and to assign some time and place to that effect, that it might be done before the next Session of Parliament. To which Petition they received no answer, till the <hi>Iuly</hi> following: But there came no great matter of it, by reason of the Regents death, which soon after hapned.</p>
            <p n="21">21. For so it was, that after his return from <hi>England,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more feared by some, and obeyed by others, then he had been formerly; which made him stand more highly upon terms of Honor and Advantage, when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had propounded some Conditions to him in favour of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> whose cause appearing desperate in the eyes of most who wished well to her, they laboured to make their own peace, and procure his Friendship. Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> amongst the rest, negotiated for a Reconcilement, and came to <hi>Edenborough</hi> to that purpose; but unadvisedly interposing some delays in the business, because he would not act apart from the rest of the Queens Adherents, he was sent Prisoner to the Castle. This puts the whole Clan of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> into such displeasures (being otherwise no good friends to the Race of the <hi>Stewarts</hi>) that they resolved upon his death; compassed not long after by <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> whose life he had spared once when he had it in his power. At <hi>Lithgoe,</hi> on the 23 of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> he was shot by this <hi>Hamilton</hi> into the belly; of which wound he dyed, the Murtherer escaping safely into <hi>France.</hi> His death much sorrowed for by all that were affected to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-King, of whom he had shewed himself to be very tender; which might have wiped a way the imputation of his former aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, if the Kings death could have opened his way unto the Crown, before he had made sure of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it. But none did more lament his death, then his Friends of the Kirk; who in a General Assembly which they held soon after, decreed, <hi>That the Murtherer should be Excommunicated in all the chief Boroughs of the Realm</hi>; and, <hi>That whosoever else should happen to be afterwards convicted of the Crime, should be
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54836:110"/>
proceeded against in the same sort also.</hi> And yet they were not so intent upon the prosecution of the Murtherers, as not to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of themselves and their own Concernments. They had before addressed their desires unto the Regent, that remedy might be provided against chopping and changing of Benefices, diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Rentals, and setting of Tythes into long Leases, to the defrauding of Ministers and their Successors; That they who possessed pluralities of Benefices, should leave all but one; and, That the Jurisdiction of the Kirk, might be made separate and distinct from that of the Civil Courts. But now they take the benefit of the present distractions, to discharge the thirds assigned unto them from all other Incumbrances then the payment of Five thousand Marks yearly for the Kings support; which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to English money, would not amount unto the sum of Three hundred pound; and seems to be no better, then the stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a feather (in the ancient By-word) when the Goose was stollen.</p>
            <p n="22">22. As touching the distractions which emboldened them to this Adventure, they did most miserably afflict the whole State of that Kingdom. The Queen of Scots had granted a Commission to Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Arguile,</hi> to govern that Realm in her Name, and by her Authority; in which they were opposed by those, who for their own security, more then any thing else, professed their obedience to the King. Great spoils and Rapines hereupon ensued upon either side; but the Kings party had the worst; as having neither hands enough to make good their interest, nor any head to order and direct those few hands they had. At last the Earl of <hi>Sussex,</hi> with some Souldiers, came toward the borders, supplied them with such Forces as enabled them to drive the Lords of the Queens Faction out of all the South; and thereby gave them some encouragement to nominate the old Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> for their Lord-Lieutenant, till the Queens pleasure in it might be further known. And in this Broyl the Kirk must needs act somewhat also; For finding that their party was too weak to compel their Opposites to obedience by the Mouth of the Sword, they are resolved to try what they can do by the Sword of the Mouth: And to that end, they send their Agents to the Duke of <hi>Chasteau-Harald,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Arguile, Eglington, Cassels,</hi> and <hi>Cranford,</hi> the Lords <hi>Boyde</hi> and <hi>Ogilby,</hi> and others, Barons and Gentlemen of name and quality; whom they require to return to the Kings obedience, and ordain Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to be made unto them, that if they did otherwise, the Spiritual Sword of Excommunication should be drawn against them. By which, though they effected nothing which advanced the cause, yet they shewed their affections, and openly declared thereby to which side they inclined, if they were left unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seves And for a further evidence of their inclinations, they were so temperate at that time, or so obsequious to the Lords, whose cause they favoured, that they desisted from censuring a sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54836:110"/>
Sermon, upon an Intimation sent from the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that the Sermon contained some matter of Treason, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Cognizance of it belonged unto themselves and the Secular Judges.</p>
            <p n="23">23. The Confusions still encrease amongst them;<note place="margin">1570.</note> the Queen of <hi>England</hi> seeming to intend nothing more, then to ballance the one side by the other, that betwixt both she might preserve her self in safety. But in the end, she yields unto the importunity of those who appeared in favour of the King, assures them of her aid and succours when their needs required, and recommends the Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> as the fittest man to take the Regency upon him. The Breach now widens more then ever: The Lords commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the Queen are possest of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and having the Castle to their Friend, call a Parliament thither; as the new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent doth the like at <hi>Stirling</hi>; and each pretends to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence above the other. The one, because it was assembled in the Regal City; the other, because they had the Kings Person for their countenance in it. Nothing more memorable in that at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> then that the Queens extorted Resignation was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>null</hi> and void in Law; and nothing so remarkable in the other, as that the Young King made a Speech unto them (which had been put into his mouth) at their first setting down. In each they forfeit the Estates of the opposite party; and by Authority of each, destroy the Countrey in all places in an hostile manner. The Ministers had their parts also in these common sufferings; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled in all such places where the Queen prevailed, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend her in their Prayers by her Name or Titles, or otherwise to leave the Pulpit unto such as would. In all things else the Kirk had the felicity to remain in quiet; care being taken by both parties for the Preservation of Religion, though in all other things,<note place="margin">1571.</note> at an extream difference amongst themselves. But the new Regent did not long enjoy his Office, of which he reaped no fruit, but cares and sorrows. A sudden Enterprize is made on <hi>Stirling</hi> by one of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> on the third of <hi>September,</hi> at what time both the Parliament and Assembly were there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened: And he succeeded so well in it, as to be brought private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Town, to seize on all the Noblemen in their several Lodgings, and amongst others, to possess themselves of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents person: But being forced to leave the place, and quit their Prisoners, the Regent was unfortunately kill'd by one of <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> Souldiers, together with the Gentleman himself unto whom he had yielded. The Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> is on the fifth of the same moneth proclaimed his Successor: His Successor indeed, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his cares and sorrows, but in the shortness of his Rule; for having in vain attempted <hi>Edenborough</hi> in the very beginning of his Regency, he was able to effect as little in most places else, more then the wasting of the Country,<note place="margin">1572.</note> as he did <hi>Edenborough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="24">24. The Subjects in the mean time were in ill condition, and the King worse: They had already drawn their Swords against their
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54836:111"/>
Queen, first forced her to resign the Crown, and afterwards drove her out of the Kingdom. And now it is high time to let the young King know what he was to trust to; to which end, they command a piece of Silver of the value of Five shillings to be coyned, and made currant in that Kingdom; on the one side whereof, was the Arms of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the Name and Title of the King, in the usual manner; on the other side, was stamped an Armed Hand grasping a naked Sword, with this Inscription; <hi>viz. Si bene, pro me; si male, contra me:</hi> By which the people were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if the King should govern them no otherwise then he ought to do, they should then use the Sword for his preservation; but if he governed them amiss, and transgressed their Laws, they should then turn the point against him. Which words being said to have been used by the Emperor <hi>Trajan,</hi> in his delivering of the Sword unto one of his Courtiers, when he made him Captain of his Guard, have since been used by some of our Presbyterian Zealots, for justifying the Authority of inferior Officers, in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring the actions, and punishing the persons of the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. It was in the year 1552, that this learned piece of Coyn was minted; but whether before or after the death of the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> I am not able to say: for he having but ill success in the course of his Government, contracted such a grief of heart, that he departed this life on the eighth of <hi>October,</hi> when he had held that Office a little more then a year; followed about seven weeks after, by that great Incendiary <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> who dyed at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> on the 27 of <hi>November</hi>; leaving the State imbroyled in those disorders, which by his fire and fury had been first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned.</p>

Of which, though many of them tasted, yet <hi>Grange</hi> himself, who first or last had held the place against all the four Regents, together with one of his Brothers, and two Goldsmiths of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> were hanged at the Market-Cross of that City. By which surrender of the Castle, the Queens Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was so broke in pieces, that it was never able to make head again;<note place="margin">1574.</note> all of them labouring to procure their own peace by some Composition. For now the Regent being at leisure to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the miscarriages of the years preceding, he sends his <hi>Iustices
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54836:111"/>
in Eyre</hi> into all parts of the Countrey, who exercised their Commissions with sufficient Rigour; people of all sorts being forced to compound, and redeem themselves, by paying such sums of money as by these Justices were imposed. Some of the Merchants also were called in question, under colour of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Coyn; fined in great sums, or else committed to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>Blackness,</hi> till they gave satisfaction. By which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he incurred the censure of a covetous man, though he had other ends in it then his own enriching. For by these rigorous exactions, he did not onely punish such as had been most active in the late distempers, but terrified them from the like attempts against the present Government for the times ensuing. To such Confusions and Disorders, such miserable Rapines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Spoils and Devastations, such horrible Murthers and Assassinates, was this poor Realm exposed for seven years together, by following the <hi>Genevian</hi> Doctrines of Disobedience which <hi>Knox</hi> had preached, and <hi>Buchanan</hi> in his Seditious Pamphlets had dispersed amongst them. Not to say any thing that indeleable reproach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, which the whole Nation had incurred in the eye of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for their barbarous dealings towards a Queen, who had so graciously indulged unto them the exercise of that Religion which she found amongst them, without disturbance unto any.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Which matters being thus laid together, we must proceed to such affairs as concern the Kirk, abstracted from the troubles and commotions in the Civil State. In reference whereunto, we may please to know, that after divers Sollicitations made by former Assemblies, for setling a Polity in the Church, certain Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners were appointed to advise upon it. The Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> then Regent, nominated for the Lords of the Council, the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> Chancellor, the Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> Treasurer, the Titular Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Dumferling</hi> principal Secretary of Estate in the place of <hi>Ledington, Mackgil</hi> chief Register, <hi>Bullenden</hi> the then Justice Clerk, and <hi>Colen Campbel</hi> of <hi>Glenarchy.</hi> The Assembly then sitting at <hi>Leith,</hi> named for the Kirk, <hi>Iohn Ereskin</hi> of <hi>Dun</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent of <hi>Angus, Iohn Winram,</hi> Superintendent of <hi>Fife, Andrew Hay</hi> Commissioner of <hi>Gladisdale, David Lindesay</hi> Commissioner of the West, <hi>Robert Pont</hi> Commissioner of <hi>Orknay,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Craige</hi> one of the Ministers of <hi>Edenborough.</hi> The Scots were then under some necessity of holding fair quarter with the English; and therefore to conform (as near as conveniently they might) to the Government of it in the outward Polity of the Church. Upon which reason, and the prevalency of the Court Commissioners, those of the Kirk did condescend unto these Conclusions; and condescended the more easily, because <hi>Knox</hi> was absent, detained by sickness from attending any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick business. Now these Conclusions were as followeth; 1. <hi>That the Archbishopricks and Bishopricks presently void, or should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen hereafter to be void, should be disposed to the most qualified
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54836:112"/>
of the Ministry:</hi> 2. <hi>That the Spiritual Iurisdictions should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised by the Bishops in their several Diocesses:</hi> 3. <hi>That all Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And because divers persons were possessed of places in some of the said Chapters, which did bear no Office in the Church</hi>; It was ordered, <hi>That a particular nomination of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in every Diocess should be made, to supply their rooms until their Benefices in the said Churches should fall void:</hi> 5. <hi>That all Benefices of Cure under Prelacies, should be disposed to actual Ministers, and no others:</hi> 6. <hi>That the Ministers should receive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from the Bishop of the Diocess; and where no Bishop was then placed, from the Superintendent of the bounds:</hi> 7. <hi>That the Bishops and Superintendents at the Ordination of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, should exact of them an Oath for acknowledging his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Authority, and for obedience to their Ordinary in all things Lawful, according to a Form then condescended.</hi> Order was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so taken for disposing of Provestries, Colledge charges, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planaries, and divers other particulars most profitable for the Church; which were all ordained to stand in force until the Kings minority, or till the States of the Realm should deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine otherwise. How happy had it been for the Isles of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> if the Kirk had stood to these Conclusions, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelled all the Web to advance a Faction, as they after did?</p>
            <p n="27">
               <note place="margin">1572.</note>27. For in the next general Assembly held in <hi>August</hi> at the Town of <hi>Perth,</hi> where these conclusions were reported to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est of the Brethren, some of them took offence at one thing, some at another: some took exception at the Title of <hi>Archbishop</hi> and <hi>Dean</hi>; and others at the name of <hi>Archdeacon, Chancellor</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> not found in the <hi>Genevian</hi> Bibles, and otherwise Popish, and offensive to the ears of good Christians. To satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie whose queazie stomacks, some of the Lay-Commissioners had prepared this Lenitive; that is to say, That by using of these Titles, they meant not to allow of any Popish Superstition in the least degree; and were content they should be changed to others which might seem less scandalous. And thereupon it was proposed, that the name of <hi>Bishop</hi> should be used for <hi>Archbishop,</hi> that the <hi>Chapter</hi> should be called the <hi>Bishops Assembly,</hi> and the <hi>Dean</hi> the Moderator of it. But as for the Titles of <hi>Archdeacon, Chancellor, Abbot,</hi> and <hi>Pryor,</hi> it was ordered that some should he appointed to consider how far these Functions did extend, and give their opinion to the next Assembly for the changing of them, with such others, as should be thought most agreeable to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54836:112"/>
the Word of God, and the Polity of the best Reformed Churches, Which brings into my minde the fancy of some people in the Desarts of <hi>Affrick,</hi> who having been terribly wasted with Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and not able otherwise to destroy them, passed a Decree that none should thenceforth call them Tygers; and then all was well. But notwithstanding all this care, and these qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the conclusions could not be admitted, but with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, that they received those Articles for an interim onely, till a more perfect Order might be attained at the hands of the King, the Regent, or the States of the Realm. And it was well that they admitted them so far: For presently upon the rising of this Assembly, Mr. <hi>Iohn Douglass,</hi> Provost of the new Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> was preferred to the Archbishoprick of that See; Mr. <hi>Iames Boyd</hi> to the Archbishoprick of <hi>Glasco</hi>; Mr. <hi>Iames Paton</hi> to the Bishoprick of <hi>Dunkeld</hi>; and Mr. <hi>Andrew Grahame</hi> to the See of <hi>Dumblane</hi>; the rest to be disposed of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards as occasion served.</p>
            <p n="28">28. But long it was not that they held in so good a Posture.<note place="margin">1573.</note> 
               <hi>Morton</hi> succeeding in the Regencie to the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a consideration of the injury which was done the King by the invading of his Thirds, and giving onely an allowance yearly of five thousand Marks. These he brings back unto the Crown, upon assurance that the Pensions of the Ministers should be better answered then in former times, and to be payable from thenceforth by the Parish in which they served. But no sooner had he gained his purpose, when to improve the Kings Revenue, and to increase the Thirds, he appointed to one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister two or three Churches, in which he was to preach by turns; and where he did not preach, to appoint a Reader. Which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the most part was allowed but twenty or forty pounds yearly; each pound being valued at no more then one shilling eight pence of our English money. And in the payment of these Pensions, they found their condition made worse then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was: for, whereas, they could boldly go to the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and make their poor Estates known unto them, from whom they were sure to receive some relief and comfort; they were now forced to dance attendance at the Court, for getting warrants for the payment of the sums assigned, and suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating for such augmentations as were seldom granted. And when the Kirk desired to be restored unto the Thirds, as was also promised in case the assignations were not duly paid, it was at last told them in plain terms, <hi>That since the Surplus of the Thirds belonged to the King, it was fitter the Regent and Council should modifie the Stipends of Ministers, then that the Kirk should have the appointment and designation of a Surplus.</hi> Nor did the Superintendents speed much better, if not worse, when they addressed themselves to any of the Court-Officers for the receiving the Pensions assigned unto them; which being greater then the others, came more coldly in. And if they prest
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54836:113"/>
at any time with more importunity then was thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, it was told them that the Kirk had now no use of their services, in regard that Bishops were restored in some places to their Jurisdictions.</p>
            <p n="29">29. And now the Discipline begins to alter, from a mixed to a plain Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bytery. Before the confirming of Episcopacie by the late conclusions, the Government of the Kirk had been by Superintendents, assisted by Commissioners for the Countries, as they called them then. The Commissioners changed, or new Elected at every general Assembly; the Superintendents setled for term of life. To them it appertained to approve and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Ministers; they presided in all Synods, and directed all Church-censures within their bounds; neither was any Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication pronounced without their Warrant. To them it also was referred to proportion the Stipends of all Ministers; to appoint the Collectors of the Thirds, (as long as they were chosen by the general Assembly) to make payment of them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such form and manner as to them seemed best; and to dispose of the Surplusage, if any were, toward the charges of the State. And to this <hi>Knox</hi> consented with the greater readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, because in an unsetled Church, the Ministers were not thought of parts sufficient to be trusted with a power of Jurisdiction; and partly because such men as were first designed for Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents, were for the most part possessed of some fair Estate, whereby they were not onely able to support themselves, but to afford relief and comfort to the poor Ministers. But when these men grew old or dyed, and that the entertaining of the Reformed Religion in all parts of the Realm had given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to men of Parts and Learning to enter into the Ministry, they then began more universally to put in practice those restrictions with which the Superintendents had been fettered, and the power of the Ministers extended by the Book of <hi>Discipline,</hi> according to the Rules whereof the Minister and Elders of every Church, with the assistance of their Deacons, if occasion were, were not alone enabled to exercise most part of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over their several Congregations, but also to joyn themselves with the chief Burgesses of the greater Towns for censuring and deposing their own Superintendents. In which respect the Government may be said to be a mixt, not a plain Presbytery, as before was noted; though in effect, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery was the more predominant, because the Superintendents by the Book of Discipline were to be subject to the Censures of their own Presbyteries.</p>
            <p n="30">30. But these Presbyteries, and the whole power ascribed unto them by the Book of Discipline, were in a way to have been crushed by the late conclusions, when they flew out again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occasion of the hard dealing of the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> in putting them besides their <hi>Thirds.</hi> And then withal, because the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of some Ministers into Bishops Sees, had been used by him
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54836:113"/>
for a pretence to defraud the Superintendents of their wonted means, the Bishops were inhibited by the general Assembly which next followed, from exercising any Ecclesiastical Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction within the bounds which they had formerly assigned to their Superintendents, without their consent and approbation. Which opportunity was both espied and taken by <hi>Andrew Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> for making such an innovation in the Form of Government, as came most near unto the Pattern of <hi>Geneva,</hi> where he had studied for a time, and came back thence more skilful in Tongues and Languages then any other part of Learning. And being hot and eager upon any business which he took in hand, emulous of <hi>Knoxes</hi> greatness, and hoping to be Chronicled for his equal in the Reformation; he entertained all such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted to him, with the continual commendations of that Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which he found at <hi>Geneva,</hi> where the Presbyteries carried all, without acknowledging any Bishop or Superintendent in power above them. Having by this means much insinuated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divers Ministers,<note place="margin">1572.</note> he dealt with one <hi>Iohn Drury,</hi> one of the Preachers of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> to propound a question in the general Assembly which was then convened, touching the lawfulness of the Episcopal Function, and the Authority of Chapters in their Election. Which question being put according as he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, he first commends the Speakers Zeal (as if he had been unacquainted with the motion) and then proceeds to a long and well-framed discourse, touching the flourishing Estate of the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the opinions of those great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men, <hi>Calvin</hi> then dead, and <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> then alive, in the point of Church-Government. After which premises, he fell upon this conclusion, <hi>That none ought to bear any Office in the Church of Christ, whose titles were not found in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: That though the name of</hi> Bishop <hi>did occur in Scripture, yet was it not to be taken in that sence in which it was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood: That no Superiority was allowed by Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Ministers of the Church; all of them being of the same degree, and having the same power in all Sacred Matters: That the corruptions crept into the Estate of</hi> Bishops <hi>were so great and many, that if they should not be removed, Religion would not long remain in Purity.</hi> And so referred the whole matter to their consideration.</p>
            <p n="31">31. The Game being thus started and pursued by so good a Huntsman, it was thought fit by the Assembly, to commend the chase thereof to six chosen Members, who were to make report of their diligence to the rest of the Brethren. Of which, though <hi>Melvin</hi> took a care to be named for one, and made use of all his wit and cunning to bring the rest of the Referrees to his own opinion, yet he prevailed no further at that time, then under colour of a mannerly declining of the point in hand, to lay some further restrictions upon the Bishops in the exercise of their Power and Jurisdictions, then had been formerly imposed. The sum
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54836:114"/>
of their report was to this effect; <hi>Viz. That they did not hold it expedient to answer the Questions propounded for the present; but if any Bishop was chosen, that had not qualities required by the Word of God, he should be tryed by the General Assembly: That they judged the name of a Bishop, to be common to all Ministers who had the charge of a particular flock; and that by the Word of God, his chief function consisted in the Preaching of the Word, the Ministration of the Sacraments, and the exercise of Ecclesiastical Discipline with the consent of the Elders: That from amongst the Ministry, some one might be chosen to oversee and visit such reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bounds besides his own flock, as the General Assembly should appoint: That the Minister so elected, might in those bounds ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Preachers, with the advice of the Ministers of that Province, and the consent of the flock which should be admitted; and that he might suspend Ministers from the exercise of their Office, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reasonable causes, with the consent of the Ministers of the bounds.</hi> This was the sum of the Report; and that thus much might be reported to begin the game with, great care was took by <hi>Melvin</hi> and his Adherents, that neither any of the Bishops nor Superintendents which were then present in the Assembly (being eight in number) were either nominated to debate the points proposed, nor called to be present at the Conference. But somewhat further must be done, now their hand was in: And therefore, that the rest might see what they were to trust to, if this world went on, they deposed <hi>Iames Patton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelden</hi> from his place and dignity, without consulting the Lord-Regent, or any of the secret Council in so great a business.</p>
            <p n="32">32. The next Assembly makes some alteration in propounding the question, and gives it out with a particular reference to their own concernment, in this manner following; that is to say, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bishops, as they were in</hi> Scotland, <hi>had their Function war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Word of God?</hi> But the determining of this question was declined as formerly. Onely it was conceived expedient for a further preparative, both to approve the opinions of the Referrees in the former Meeting, and to add this now unto the rest, <hi>That the Bishops should take to themselves the service of some one Church within their Diocess, and nominate the particular flock whereof they would accept the charge.</hi> News of which last addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being brought to the Regent, he required by a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Message, either to stand to the Conclusions before mentioned, which were made at <hi>Leith,</hi> or else devise some other Form of Church-Government which they would abide. And this fell out as <hi>Melvin</hi> and his Tribe would have it: For after this, there was nothing done in the Assemblies for two years together, but ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering, forming and reforming a new Book of Discipline, to be a standing Rule for ever to the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But possible it is, that the design might have been brought to perfection soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if the Regent had not thought himself affronted by them, in the person of his Chaplain Mr. <hi>Patrick Adamson,</hi> whom he had
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54836:114"/>
recommended to the See of S. <hi>Andrews.</hi> For the Election being purposely delayed by the Dean and Chapter, till the sitting of the next Assembly; <hi>Adamson</hi> then present, was interrogated whether he would submit himself unto the tryal, and undertake that Office upon such conditions as the Assembly should prescribe. To which he answered, That he was commanded by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent not to accept thereof upon any other terms, then such as had been formerly agreed upon between the Commissioners of the Kirk and the Lords of the Council. On this refusal, they inhibit the Chapter from proceeding in the said Election; though afterwards, for fear of the displeasure of so great a man, their command therein was disobeyed, and the party chosen. Which so provoked those meek and humble-spirited men, that at their next Meeting they discharged him from the exercise of all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, till by some General Assembly he were lawfully li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed. And this did so exasperate the Regent on the other side, that he resolved to hinder them from making any further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation in the Churches Polity as long as he continued in his place and power.</p>
            <p n="33">33. But the Regent having somewhat imprudently dismissed himself of the Government, and put it into the hands of the King, in the beginning of <hi>March, An.</hi> 1577, they then conceived they had as good an opportunity as could be desired to advance their Discipline, which had been hammering ever since in the Forge of their Fancies. And when it hapned (as it was not long before it did) they usher in the Design with this following Preamble; viz. <hi>The General Assembly of the Kirk finding universal corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole Estates of the body of this Realm the great coldness and slackness in Religion in the greatest part of the Professors of the same, with the daily increase of all kind of fearful sins and enormities; as, Incests, Adulteries, Murthers</hi> (<hi>committed in</hi> Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough <hi>and</hi> Stirling) <hi>cursed Sacriledge, ungodly Sedition and Division within the bowels of the Realm, with all manner of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered and ungodly living; which justly hath provoked our God, although long-suffering and patient, to stretch out his arm in his anger to correct and visit the iniquity of the Land; and namely, by the present penury, famine and hunger, joyned with the Civil and Intestine Seditions: Whereunto doubtless greater judgements must succeed, if these his corrections work on Reformation and amendment in mens hearts: Seeing also the bloody exclusions of the cruel counsels of that Roman Beast, tending to extermine and rase from the face of all</hi> Europe, <hi>the true light of the blessed Word of Salvation: For these causes, and that God of his mercy would bless the Kings Highness, and his Regiment, and make him to have a happy and prosperous Government, as also to put in his Highness heart, and in the hearts of his Noble Estates of Parliament, not onely to make and establish good politick Laws for the Weal and good Government of the Realm, but also to set and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish such a Polity and Discipline in the Kirk, as is craved in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54836:115"/>
the Word of God, and is contained and penned already to be presented to his Highness and Council; that in the one and in the other God may have his due praise, and the age to come an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of upright and Godly dealing.</hi> Which Act of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pass'd on the 24 of <hi>April</hi> 1578.</p>
            <p n="34">34. The Discipline must be of most excellent use, which could afford a present remedy to so many mischiefs; and yet as excellent as it was, it could obtain no Ratification at that time of the King or Parliament; which therefore they resolve to put in practise by the strength of their party, without insisting any further on the leave of either. In which respect, it will not be unnecessary to take a brief view of such particulars in which they differ from the Ancient Government of the Church of Christ, or the Government of the Church of <hi>England</hi> then by Law esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished; or finally, from the former Book of Discipline which themselves had justified. Now by this Book it is declared, <hi>That none that bear Office in the Church of Christ, ought to have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over it, or be called</hi> Lords: <hi>That the Civil Magistrates are so far from having any power to Preach, administer the Sacraments, or execute the Censures of the Church,</hi> that they ought not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe any Rule how it should be done: <hi>and that as Ministers are subject to the judgement and punishment of Magistrates in Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things, if they offend; so ought the Magistrates submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Discipline of the Church, if they transgress in matter of Conscience and Religion: That the Ministers of the Church ought to govern the same by mutual consent of Brethren, and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of power, according to their several Functions: That there are onely four ordinary Office bearers in the Church; that is to say, The Pastor, Minister or Bishop; the Doctor, the Elder, and the Deacon; and that no more ought to be received in the Word of God; and therefore that all ambitious Titles invented in the Kingdom of Antichrist and his usurped Hierarchy, which are not of these four sorts-together with the Offices depending thereupon</hi> (<hi>that is to say,</hi> Archbishops, Patriarchs, Chancellours, Deans, Archdeacons, &amp;c.) <hi>ought in one word to be rejected: That all which bear Office in the Church, are to be elected by the Eldership, and consent of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to whom the person presented is appointed, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. That the Ordination of the person so elected, is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with Fasting, Prayer, and the Imposition of the hands of the Eldership</hi> (Remember that <hi>Imposition of hands</hi> was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally rejected in the former Book:) <hi>That all Office-bearers in the Church should have their own particular flocks, amongst whom they ought to exercise their charge, and keep their residence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="35">35. But more particularly it declares, <hi>That it is the Office of the Pastor, Bishop or Minister, to preach the Word of God, and to administer the Sacraments in that particular Congregation unto which he is called: and it belongs unto them, after lawful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Eldership, to pronounce the sentence of binding and loosing; as also, to solemnize Marriage between persons contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54836:115"/>
being by the said Eldership thereunto required: That it is the Office of the Doctor, simply to open the mind of the Spirit of God in the Scriptures, without making any such application as the Minister useth; and that this Doctor being an Elder, ought to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the Pastor in the Government of the Church, by reason that the Interpretation of the Word, which is the onely Iudge in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical matters, is to him committed: That it is the Office of the Elder (that is to say, The Lay-Elder, for so they mean) both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately and publickly, to watch with all diligence over the flock committed to them, that no corruptions of Religion or manners grow amongst them; as also to assist the Pastor or Minister in examining those that come to the Lords Table, in visiting the sick, in admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all men of their duties according to the Rule of the Word; and in holding Assemblies with the Pastors and Doctors, for establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good order in the Church, the Acts whereof he is to put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: That it is the Office of the Deacon to collect and distribute the goods of the Church, at the appointment of the Elders, amongst which he is to have no voyce in the common Consistory</hi>; contrary to the Rules of the former Book: <hi>That all Ecclesiastical Assemblies have a power lawfully to convene together for that effect: That it is in the power of the Eldership to appoint Visitors for their Churches within their bounds; and that this power belongs not to any single person, be he Bishop or otherwise: That every three, four or more Parishes, may have an Eldership to themselves; but so, that the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be chosen out of each in a fit proportion: That it is the Office of these Elderships to enquire of naughty and unruly Members, and to bring them into the way again, either by Admonition, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Gods Iudgements, or by Correction, even to the very Censure of Excommunication; as also to admonish, censure, and (if the case require) to depose their Pastor, if he be found guilty of any of those grievous crimes</hi> (<hi>among which</hi> Dancing <hi>goes for one</hi>) <hi>which belongs to their cognizance: The Errors committed by the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to be corrected by Provincial Assemblies, and those in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials by the General. The maintainance and assisting of which Discipline, and the inflicting of Civil punishments upon such as do not obey the same, without confounding one Iurisdiction with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, is made to be the chief Office of Kings and Princes. And that this Discipline might be executed without interruption, it was required that the Name and Office of Bishops, as it then was, and had been formerly exercised in the Church of</hi> Scotland; <hi>as also the Names and Offices of Commendators, Abbots, Priors, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Chancellors, Archdeacons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>should from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be utterly abolished, and of no effect.</hi> Which points, and all the rest therein contained, being granted to them, all right of Patronages destroyed, that popular Elections may proceed in all their Churches, and finally, the whole Patrimony of the Church in Lands, Tythes or Houses, permitted to the distribution of the Deacons in every Eldership, they then conceive that such a right Reformation may be made as God requires.</p>
            <p n="36">

               </gap>her time; they took this not for a delay, but a plain denyal; and therefore it was agreed in the next general Assembly (as before is said) to put the same in execution by their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, without expecting any further confirmation of it from the King or Council. Which that they might effect without fear of disturbance, they first discharge the Bishops and Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents from intermedling in Affairs which concerned Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but onely in their own particular Churches; that so their Elderships (according to this new establishment) might grow up and flourish. And then they took upon them, with their own adherents, to exercise all Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to Prince or Prelate; they altered the Laws according to their own appetite; they assembled the Kings Subjects, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned Ecclesiastical pains unto them; they made Decrees, and put the same in execution; they prescribed Laws to the King and State; they appointed Fasts throughout the whole Realm, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when some of their Faction were to move any great enterprise; they used very traytorous, seditious and contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious words in the Pulpits, Schools, and otherwise, to the disdain and reproach of the King; and being called to answer the same, they utterly disclaimed the Kings Authority, saying he was an incompetent Judge, and that matters of the Pulpit ought to be exempted from the judgement and correction of Princes. And finally, they did not onely animate some of those that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered unto them, to seize upon the Kings person, and usurp his power; but justified the same in one of their general Assemblies held at <hi>Edenborough</hi> for a lawful Act; ordaining all those to be excommunicated which did not subscribe unto the same. This we take up by <hi>whole-sale</hi> now, but shall return it by <hi>retail</hi> in that which follows.</p>
            <p n="37">37. And first they begin with Mr. <hi>Iames Boyd,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Glasco,</hi> a man of a mild and quiet nature, and therefore the more like to be conformable to their commands; requiring him to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himself to the Assembly, and to suffer the corruptions of the Episcopal Order to be reformed in his person. To which proud intimation of their will and pleasure, he returned this Answer, which, for the modesty or piety thereof, deserves to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perpetual memory. <hi>I understand</hi> (saith he) <hi>the name, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Reverence given to a Bishop to be lawful, and allowed by the Scriptures of God; and being elected by the Church and King to be Bishop of</hi> Glasco, <hi>I esteem my Office and Calling lawful, and shall endeavour with all my power to perform the duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, submitting my self to the judgement of the Church, if I shall be tryed to offend; so as nothing be required of me, but the performance of those duties which the Apostle prescribeth.</hi> Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him not so tractable as they had expected, they Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate certain of their Members to require his subscription to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54836:116"/>
the Act made at <hi>Stirling,</hi> for reformation of the State Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal; by which it was agreed, that every Bishop should take charge of some flock in particular. And this they prest upon him with such heat and violence, that they never left prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the poor man, till they had brought him to his Grave. By none more violently pursued then by <hi>Andrew Melvin,</hi> whom he had brought to <hi>Glasco,</hi> and made Principal of the Colledge there, gave him a free access to his House and Table, or otherwise ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry liberally provided for him. But <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are not won by favours, nor obliged by Benefits. For <hi>Melvin</hi> so disguised his nature, that when he was in private with him at his Table or elsewhere, he would use him with all reverence imaginable, giving him the title of his <hi>Lordship,</hi> with all the other honours which pertained unto him; but in all particular Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whatsoever they were, he would onely call him Mr. <hi>Boyd,</hi> and otherwise carried himself most despitefully towards him.</p>
            <p n="38">38. Their rough and peremptory dealing with this Reverend Prelate, discouraged all the rest from coming any more to their Assemblies: Which hapned as they could have wished. For thereupon they agree amongst themselves upon certain Articles, which every Bishop must subscribe, or else quit his place; that is to say, 1. <hi>That they should be content to be Ministers and Pastors of a flock:</hi> 2. <hi>That they should not usurp any criminal jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> 3. <hi>That they should not vote in Parliament in the name of the Church, unless they had a Commission from the general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:</hi> 4. <hi>That they should not take up for maintaining their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Rents which might maintain many Pastors, Schools and Poor, but content themselves with a reasonable portion for discharge of their Offices:</hi> 5. <hi>That they should not claim the title of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Lords, nor usurp any Civil Iurisdiction, whereby they might be drawn from their charge:</hi> 6. <hi>That they should not Empire over Presbyteries, but be subject to the same:</hi> 7. <hi>That they should not usurp the power of Presbyteries, nor take upon them to visit any bounds that were not committed to them by the Church:</hi> 8. <hi>That if any more corruptions should afterwards be tryed, the Bishop should agree to have them reformed.</hi> These Articles were first tendred to <hi>Patrick Adamson,</hi> Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and Metropolitan of all <hi>Scotland</hi>; against whom they had a former quarrel, not onely because he was preferred, elected, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to that eminent Dignity without their consent, but had also exercised the Jurisdiction which belonged unto it, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and direct opposition unto their commands. And first they quarrelled with him for giving Collation unto Benefices, and for giving voice in Parliament, not being authorized thereunto by the Kirk. They quarrelled with him afterwards for drawing or advising the Acts of Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1584, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be so prejudicial to the Rights of the Kirk; and held the King so hard unto it, that he was forced to counsel the poor Prelate to subscribe some Articles, by which he seemed in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54836:117"/>
to renounce his Calling; of which more hereafter. They quarrelled with him again in the year 1589, for marrying one of the Daughters of the late Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Huntly</hi> without their consent; wherein the King was also fain to leave him to their discretion. And finally, they so vexed and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted him from one time to another, upon pretence of not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to their lawless pleasures, that they reduced him in the end to extreme necessity, published a false and scandalous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in his name, as he lay on his death bed, containing a <hi>Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> (as they called it) or rather a renouncing of his Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Function; together with his approbation of their Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: which Paper he disowned at the the hearing of it. By which, and many such unworthy courses, they brought his gray hairs (as they did some others of his Order) with shame and sorrow to the Grave.</p>
            <p n="39">39. Mention was made before of an Act of Parliament made in the time of the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> before the Queens coming back from <hi>France,</hi> for demolishing all Religious Houses, and other Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry. Under which name all the Cathedrals were interpreted to be contained, and by that means involved in the general ruine; onely the Church at <hi>Glasco</hi> did escape that storm, and remained till this time undefaced in its former glory: But now becomes a very great eye-sore to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Melvin,</hi> by whose practices and sollicitations it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed unto by some Zealous Magistrates, that it should forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with be demolished; that the materials of it should be used for the building of some lesser Churches in that City for the ease of the people; and that such Masons, Quarriers, and other Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whose service was requisite thereunto, should be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for that purpose at the day appointed. The Arguments which he used to perswade those Magistrates to this Act of Ruine, were the resorting of some people to that Church for their private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions; the huge vastness of the Fabrick, which made it incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious in respect of hearing; and especially the removing of that old Idolatrous Monument, which only was kept up in despite of the Zeal and Piety of their first Reformers. But the business was not carried so closely, as not to come unto the knowledge of the Crafts of the City, who, though they were all sufficiently Zealous in the cause of Religion, were not so mad as to deprive their City of so great an Ornament. And they agreed so well together, that when the Work-men were beginning to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselves to speed the business, they made a tumult, took up Arms, and resolutely swore, that whosoever pulled down the first stone, should be buried under it. The Work-men upon this are discharged by the Magistrates, and the people complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of to the King for the insurrections. The King upon the hearing of it, receives the actors in that business into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, allows the opposition they had made, and layes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand upon the Ministers (who had appeared most eager in the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54836:117"/>
prosecution) not to meddle any more in that business, or any other of that nature; adding withal, that too many Churches in that Kingdom were destroyed already, and that he would not tolerate any more abuses of such ill example.</p>
            <p n="40">40. The King for matter of his Book had been committed to the institution of <hi>George Buchanan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1580.</note> a most fiery and seditious <hi>Calvinist</hi>; to moderate whose heats, was added Mr. <hi>Peter Young,</hi> (father of the late Dean of <hi>Winchester</hi>) a more temperate and sober man, whom he very much esteemed, and honoured with Knighthood, and afterwards preferred to the Mastership of St. <hi>Cross</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> But he received his Principles for ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ter of State, from such of his Council as were most tender of the pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lick interest of their Native Country. By whom, but most especially by the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> he was so well instructed, that he was able to distinguish between the Zeal of some in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Reformed Religion, and the madness or sollies of some others, who practised to introduce their innovations under that pretence. Upon which grounds of State and Prudence, he gave order to the general Assembly, sitting at this time, not to make any alteration in the Polity of the Church, as then it stood, but to suffer things to continue in the state they were till the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Parliament, to the end that the determinations of the three Estates might not be any ways prejudged by their conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. But they neglecting the command, look back upon the late proceedings which were held at <hi>Stirling,</hi> where many of the most material points in the Book of Discipline were demurred upon. And thereupon it was ordained, that nothing should be altered in Form or Matter, which in that Book had been concluded by themselves. With which the King was so displeased, that from that time he gave less countenance to the Ministers then he had done formerly. And to the end that they might see what need they had of their Princes favour, he suffered divers sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to be past at the Council Table, for the suspending of their Censures and Excommunications, when any matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was heard against them. But they go forwards howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, confirmed and animated by a Discourse of <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> which came out this year, entituled, <hi>De Triplici Episcopatu.</hi> In which he takes notice of three sorts of Bishops; <hi>the Bishop of Divine Institution,</hi> which he makes to be no other then the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Minister of a particular Congregation; <hi>the Bishop of humane Constitution,</hi> that is to say, the President or Moderator in the Church-assemblies; and last of all, <hi>the Devils Bishop,</hi> such as were then placed in a perpetual Authority over a Dioces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or Province in most parts of Christendom; under which last capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city they beheld their Bishops in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And in the next Assembly, held at <hi>Dundee</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> following, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>That the Office of a Bishop, as it was then used and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken in that Realm, had neither foundation, ground, nor warrant in the holy Scriptures.</hi> And thereupon it was decreed,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54836:118"/>
               <hi>That all persons either called unto that Office, or which should here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be called unto it, should be required to renounce the same, as an Office unto which they are not warranted by the Word of God.</hi> But because some more moderate men in the next Assembly held at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> did raise a scruple touching that part of the Decree in which it was affirmed, <hi>That the calling of Bishops was not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Word of God,</hi> it was first declared by the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that they had no other meaning in that Expression, then <hi>to condemn the estate of Bishops as they then stood in</hi> Scotland. With which the said moderate men did not seem contented, but desired that the conclusion of the matter might be respited to another time, by reason of the inconvenience which might ensue. They are cryed down by all the rest with great heat and violence; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that it was proposed by one <hi>Montgomery</hi> Minister of <hi>Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that some Censure might be laid on those who had spoken in defence of that corrupted estate</hi> Nay, such was the extream ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to that Sacred Function in the said Assembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> that they stayed not here; They added to the former, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree more strange, inserting, <hi>That they should desist and cease from Preaching, ministring the Sacraments, or using in any sort of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Pastor in the Church of Christ, till by some General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly they were</hi> De Novo <hi>Authorized and admitted to it; no lower Censure then that of Excommunication, if they did the contrary.</hi> As for the Patrimony of the Church, which still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in their hands, it was resolved that the next General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly should dispose thereof.</p>
            <p n="49">49. There hapned at this time an unexpected Revolution in the Court of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which possibly might animate them to these high presumptions. It had been the great Master-piece of the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> in the time of his Regency, to fasten his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance most specially on the Queen of <hi>England</hi>; without which he saw it was impossible to preserve the Kings Person, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Power against the practices and attempts of a prevalent Faction, which openly appeared in favour of his Mothers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions. And in this course he much desired to keep the King, when he had took the Government upon himself, as before was said, prevailing with him, much against the mind of most of the Lords, to send an Ambassador for that purpose. Which put such fears and jealousies into the heads of the <hi>French,</hi> on whom the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ots</hi> had formerly depended upon all occasions, that they thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it to countermine the English party in the Court, and so blow them up. No better Engine for this purpose then the Lord <hi>Esme Stewart,</hi> Seignieur of <hi>Aubigny</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and Brothers Son to <hi>Matthew</hi> the late Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> the Young Kings Grandfather. By him it was conceived that they might not onely work the King to the party of <hi>France,</hi> but get some ground for re-establishing the old Religion, or at least to gain some countenance for the Favourers and Professors of it. With these Instructions he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to the Court of <hi>Scotland,</hi> makes himself known unto the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54836:118"/>
King, and by the affability of his conversation wins so much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that no Honor or Preferment was thought great enough for so dear a Kinsman. The Earldom of <hi>Lenox</hi> being devolved upon the King by the death of his Grandfather, was first confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on <hi>Robert</hi> Bishop of <hi>Orknay,</hi> one of the Natural Sons of King <hi>Iames</hi> V. Which he, to gratifie the King, and oblige the Favorite, resigned again into his hands; in recompence whereof, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto the title of Earl of <hi>March.</hi> As soon as he had made this Resignation of the Earldom of <hi>Lenox,</hi> the King confers it presently on his Cosin <hi>Aubigny,</hi> who studied to appear more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to him every day then other. And that his service might appear the more considerable, a report is cunningly spread abroad, that the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> had a purpose to convey the King into <hi>England</hi>; by means whereof the <hi>Scots</hi> would forfeit all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which they held <hi>France. Morton</hi> sufficiently clear'd himself from any such practice. But howsoever, the suspicion prevailed so far, that it was thought fit by those of the Adverse party to appoint a Lord-Chamberlain, who was to have the care of His Majesties Person; and that a Guard of twenty four Noblemen should be assigned to the said Lord-Chamberlain for that end and purpose. Which Trust and Honor was immediately conferred on the Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> who had been sworn to the Council much about that time, and within less then two years after was created Duke.</p>
            <p n="50">50. The sudden Preferments of this man, being well known to be a professed Votary of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1581.</note> encouraged many Priests and Jesuits to repair into <hi>Scotland</hi>; who were sufficiently practical in propagating the Opinions, and advancing the interest of that Church. Which gave occasion to the Brethren to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim against him, and many times to fall exceeding foul on the King himself. The King appears sollicitous for their satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and deals so effectually with his Kinsman, that he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive instruction from some of their Ministers, by whom he is made a real Proselyte to the Religion then establish'd; which he declared, by making profession of his Faith in the great Church of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and his diligent frequenting the Church at their Prayers and Sermons. But it hapned very unfortunately for him, that some Dispensations sent from <hi>Rome</hi> were intercepted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Catholicks were permitted to promise, swear, subscribe, and do what else should be required of them, if still they kept their hearts, and secretly imployed their counsels for the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Against this blow the Gentleman could find no buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, nor was there any ready way either to take off the suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to still the clamors which by the Presbyterian Brethren were raised against him. Their out-cries much encreased, by the severities then shewed to the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> whom they esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a most assured Friend (as indeed he was) to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though indeed in all points not corresponding with them to the book of Discipline. For so it was, that to break off all
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54836:119"/>
hopes of fastning a dependance on the Realm of <hi>England, Morton</hi> was publickly accused at the Council Table for being privy to the Murther of His Majesties Father, committed to the Castle of <hi>Edenborough</hi> on the second of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> removed to <hi>Dunbritton</hi> on the twentieth: Where having remained above four moneths, he was brought back to <hi>Edenborough</hi> in the end of <hi>May,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned upon the first of <hi>Iune,</hi> and the next day executed: His Capital Accuser being admitted to sit Judge upon him.</p>
            <p n="51">51. This news exceedingly perplexed the Queen of <hi>England:</hi> she had sent <hi>Bows</hi> and <hi>Randolph</hi> at several times to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> who were to use their best endeavours as well to lessen the Kings favour to the Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> as to preserve the life of <hi>Morton.</hi> For the effecting of which last, a promise was made by <hi>Randolph</hi> unto some of his Friends, both of men and money. But as <hi>Walsingham</hi> sent word from <hi>France,</hi> she had not took the right course to effect her purpose. She had of late been negligent in paying those persons which had before confirmed the <hi>Scots</hi> to the English interest; which made them apt to tack about, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves to those who would bid most for them. And yet the business at the present was not gone so far, but that they might have easily been reduced unto her devotion, if we had now sent them ready money instead of promises; for want whereof, that Noble Gentleman, so cordially affected to Her Majesties ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, was miserably cast away. Which quick advice, though it came over-late to preserve his life, came time enough to put the Queen into a way for recovering Her Authority amongst the <hi>Scots</hi>; of which more hereafter. Nor were the Ministers less troubled at it then the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> imputing unto <hi>Lenox</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of so sad a Tragedy. Somewhat before this time he had been taxed in the Pulpit by <hi>Drury,</hi> one of the Brethren of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> for his unsoundness in Religion, and all means used to make him odious with the people. For which committed by the Council to the Castle of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> he was, not long after, at the earnest intreaty of his Fellow-Ministers,<note place="margin">1582.</note> and some promise on his own part for his good behaviour, restored again unto his charge. But after <hi>Mortons</hi> death (some other occasions coming in) he breaks out again, and mightily exclaims against him; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that the King gave order to the Provost of <hi>Edenborough</hi> to see him removed out of the Town. The Magistrate advises him to leave the Town of his own accord: But he must first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the pleasure of the Kirk, convened at the same time in an Assembly. Notwithstanding whose Mediation, he was forced to leave the Town a little while, to which he was brought back in Triumph within few moneths after. A Fast was also kept by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the said Assembly: For the ground whereof they alledged, amongst other things, not onely the oppression of the Church in general, but the danger wherein the Kings Person stood, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of wicked men, who laboured to corrupt him in Religion as well as manners.</p>
            <p n="52">
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:54836:119"/>52. But no man laid more hastily about him, or came better off then <hi>Walter Belcanqual,</hi> another Preacher of that City. Who in a Sermon by him preached, used some words to this purpose, <hi>That within this four years Popery had entred into the Countrey and Court, and was maintained in the Kings Hall, by the Tyranny of a great Champion, who was called</hi> Grace (which Adjunct they gave ordinarily to their Dukes in <hi>Scotland</hi>;) <hi>but that if his</hi> Grace <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in opposing himself to God and his Word, he should come to little</hi> Grace <hi>in the end.</hi> The King at the first hearing of it, gives order to the General Assembly to proceed therein. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing signified to <hi>Belcanqual,</hi> he is said to have given thanks to God for these two things; first, <hi>For that he was not accused for any thing done against his Majestie and the Laws:</hi> But principally, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he perceived the Church had obtained some Victory.</hi> And for the last he gave this reason, <hi>That for some quarrel taken at a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sermon, the Council had took upon them to be Iudges of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters Doctrine; but now that he was ordered to appear before the Assembly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1573.</note> 
               <hi>he would most joyfully submit his Doctrine to a publick Tryal.</hi> But those of the Assembly sending word to the King, that they could not warrantably proceed against him, without the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness were prosecuted by some Accuser, and made good by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; the King was forced, for fear of drawing any of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants into their displeasures, to let fall the cause. But <hi>Belcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual</hi> would not so give over: The Kings desisting from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution would not serve his turn, unless he were absolved also by the whole Assembly, who had been present at the Sermon. This was conceived to be most reasonable and just; for having put it to the vote, his Doctrine was declared to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound and Orthodox, and that he had delivered nothing which might give just offence unto any person. The King begins to see by these particulars what he is to trust to. But they will presently find out another expedient, as well for tryal of their own power, as his utmost patience.</p>
            <p n="52">52. A corrupt Contract had been made betwixt <hi>Montgomery</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, and the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi>; by which it was agreed, That <hi>Montgomery</hi> should be advanced, by the Dukes Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the Archbishoprick of <hi>Glasgow</hi>; and that <hi>Montgomery,</hi> in requital of so great a favour, should grant unto the Duke and his Heirs for ever, the whole Estate and Rents of the said Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishoprick, upon the yearly payments of One thousand pound <hi>Scotch,</hi> with some Horse, Corn and Poultry. No sooner had the Kirk notice of this Transaction, but without taking notice of so base a Contract, they censured him for taking on him the Episcopal Function. The King resolves to justifie him in the Acceptation, unless they could be able to charge him with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundess of Doctrine, or corruption of manners. Hereupon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Articles are preferred against him; and, amongst others, it was charged, that he had said, <hi>The Discipline was a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and might stand the one way or the other; That to prove the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54836:120"/>
of Bishops in the Church, he had used the Examples of</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose <hi>and</hi> Augustine: <hi>That at another time, he called the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and the lawful Calling of the Church,</hi> the triefls of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy: <hi>That he said the Ministers were captious, and men of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious brains: That he charged them with sedition, and warned them not to meddle in the disposing of Crowns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that if they did, they should be reproved: That he accused them of Pasquils, Lying, Backbiting,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And finally, he denyed that any mention of Presbytery or Eldership was made in any part of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For which and other Errours of like nature in point of Doctrine, though none of them sufficiently proved when it came to tryal, it was resolved by the Assembly, that he should stand to his Ministry in the Church of <hi>Stirling,</hi> and meddle no further with the Bishoprick, under the pain of Excommunication. But not content with ordering him to give off the Bishoprick, they suspend him on another quarrel from the use of his Ministry. To neither of which sentences when he would submit, as being supported by the King on one side, and the Duke on the other, they cited him to appear before the Synod of <hi>Lothian</hi> to hear the sentence of Excommunication pronounced against him. This moved the King to interpose his Royal Authority, to warn the Synod to appear before him at the Court at <hi>Stirling,</hi> and in the mean time to desist from all further Process. <hi>Pont</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers make appearance in the name of the rest; but withal make this protestation, <hi>That though they had appeared to testifie their obedience to his Majesties warrant, yet they did not acknowledge the King and Council to be competent Iudges in that matter; and therefore that nothing done at that time should either prejudge the Liberties of the Church, or the Laws of the Realm.</hi> Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation notwithstanding, they were inhibited by the Council from using any further proceedings against the man, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted for the present.</p>
            <p n="54">54. But the next general Assembly would not leave him so, but prosecute him with more heat then ever formerly; and were upon the point of passing their judgement on him, when they were required by a Letter missive from the King, not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him for any matter about the Bishoprick, or any other cause preceding, in regard the King resolved to have the business heard before himself. But <hi>Melvin</hi> hereupon replyed, <hi>That they did not meddle with any thing belonging to the Civil Power; and that for matters Ecclesiastical, they had Authority enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against him, as being a Member of their Body.</hi> The Master of the Requests, who had brought the Letter, perceiving by these words, that they meant to proceed in it, as they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, commanded a Messenger at Arms, whom he had brought along with him, to charge them to desist upon pain of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This moves them as little as the Letter, and he is summoned peremptorily to appear next morning, that he might receive his sentence. Next morning he appears by his Procurator, and puts
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54836:120"/>
up an appeal from them to the King and Council; the rather, in regard that one who was his principal Accuser in the last As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, was now to sit amongst his Judges. But neither the Appeal it self, nor the Equity of it, could so far prevail, as to hinder them from passing presently to the Sentence; by which, upon the specification and recital of his several crimes, he was ordained to be deprived, and cast out of the Church. And now the courage of the man begins to fail him. He requires a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Conference with some of the Brethren, submits himself to the Decrees of the Assembly, and promiseth neither to meddle further with the Bishoprick, nor to exercise any Office in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, but as they should license him thereunto. But this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie he makes worse, by another as bad; for finding the Kings countenance towards him to be very much changed, he resolves to hold the Bishoprick; makes a journey to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and entring into the Church with a great train of Gentlemen which had attended him from the Court, he puts by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Preacher, and takes the Pulpit to himself. For this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance, the Presbytery of the Town send out Process against him, but are prohibited from proceeding by his Majesties War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, presented by the Mayor of <hi>Glasgow.</hi> But when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the Moderator, <hi>That they would proceed in the cause notwithstanding this Warrant,</hi> and that some other words were multiplyed upon that occasion; the Provost pulled him out of his Chair, and committed him Prisoner to the <hi>Talebooth.</hi> The next <hi>Assembly</hi> look on this action of the Provost as a foul indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and prosecute the whole matter unto such extremity, that notwithstanding the Kings intercession, and the advantage which he had against some of their number; the Provost was decreed to be excommunicated; and the Excommunication for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly decreed against <hi>Montgomery,</hi> was actually pronounced in the open Church.</p>
            <p n="55">55. The Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> findes himself so much concerned in the business, that he could not but support the man, who for his sake had been exposed to all these affronts; he entertains him at his Table, and hears him preach, without regard unto the Censures under which he lay. This gives the general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a new displeasure. Their whole Authority seemed by these actions of the Duke to be little valued; which rather then they would permit, they would proceed against him in the self-same manner. But first it was thought fit to send some of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as well to intimate unto him that <hi>Montgomery</hi> was actually excommunicated; as also to present the danger in which they stood by the Rules of the Discipline, who did converse with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated persons. The Duke being no less moved then they, demanded in some choler, <hi>Whether the King or Kirk had the Supreme Power</hi>; and therewith plainly told them, <hi>That he was commanded by the King to entertain him, whose command he would not disobey for fear of their Censures.</hi> Not satisfied with
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54836:121"/>
this defence, the Commissioners of the general Assembly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it unto the King amongst other grievances; to which it was answered by the King, that the Excommunication was il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal, and was declared to be so upon very good Reasons to the Lords of the Council; and therefore that no manner of person was to be lyable to censure upon that account. The King was at this time at the Town of <hi>Perth,</hi> to which many of the Lords repaired, who had declared themselves in former times for the Faction of <hi>England,</hi> and were now put into good heart by supplies of money, (according unto <hi>Walsinghams</hi> counsel) which had been secretly sent unto them from the Queen. Much ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, or exasperated rather, by some Leading-men, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the Affairs of the late Assemblies, and spared not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate to them the apparent dangers in which Religion stood by the open practices of the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> and the Kings cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with them upon all occasions. To which the Sermons of the last Fast did not add a little; which was purposely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, as before was said, in regard of those oppressions which the Kirk was under; but more, because of the great danger which the company of wicked persons might bring to the King, whom they endeavoured to corrupt both in Religion and Manners. All which inducements coming together, produced a resolution of getting the King into their power, forcing the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> to retire into <hi>France,</hi> and altering the whole Government of the Kingdom as themselves best pleased.</p>
            <p n="56">56. But first, the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> must be sent out of the way. And to effect this, they advised him to go to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and to erect there the Lord-Chamberlains Court, for the reviving of the ancient Jurisdiction which belonged to his Office. He had not long been gone from <hi>Perth,</hi> when the King was solemnly invited to the House of <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> (not long before made Earl of <hi>Gowry</hi>) where he was liberally feasted: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to depart, he was stayed by the Eldest Son of the Lord <hi>Glammis,</hi> (the Master of <hi>Glammis,</hi> he is called, in the Scottish Dialect) and he was stayed in such a manner, that he perceived himself to be under a custody. The apprehensions whereof, when it drew some tears from him, it moved no more compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion nor respect from the froward <hi>Scots, but that it was fitter for boys to shed tears then bearded men.</hi> This was the great work of the 23 day of <hi>August</hi>; to which concurred at the first, to avoid suspi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion, no more of the Nobility but the Earls of <hi>Marre</hi> and <hi>Gowry,</hi> the Lords <hi>Boyd</hi> and <hi>Lindsay,</hi> and to the number of ten more of the better sort; but afterwards the act was owned over all the Nation, not onely by the whole Kirk-party, but even by those who were of contrary Faction to the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> who was chiefly aimed at. The Duke, upon the first advertisement of this surprize, dispatched some men of Noble Quality to the King, to know in what condition he was,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54836:121"/>
whether free or Captive. The King returned word that he was a Captive, and willed him to raise what force he could to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem him thence. The Lords on the other side declared, That they would not suffer him to be misled by the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> to the oppression of Himself, the Church, and the whole Realm; and therefore the Duke might do well to retire into <hi>France,</hi> or otherwise they would call him to a sad account for his former actions. And this being done, they caused the King to issue out a Proclamation on the 28. In which it was declared, <hi>That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in that place of his own free-will: That the Nobility then present had done nothing which they were not in duty obliged to do: That he took their repairing to him for a service acceptable to himself, and profitable to the Commonwealth: That therefore all manner of persons whatsoever which had levied any Forces, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of his present restraint, should disband them within six hours, under pain of Treason.</hi> But more particularly, they cause him to write a Letter to the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> (whom they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be grown considerably strong for some present action) by which he was commanded to depart the Kingdom, before the 20 of <hi>September</hi> then next following. On the receipt whereof, he withdraws himself to the strong Castle of <hi>Dunbritton,</hi> that there he might remain in safety whilst he staid in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from thence pass safely into <hi>France</hi> whensoever he pleased.</p>
            <p n="57">57. The news of this Surprize is posted with all speed to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> And presently the Queen sends her Ambassadors to the King; by whom he was advertised to restore the Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> who had lived an Exile in <hi>England</hi> since the death of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> to his Grace and Favour; but most especially, that in regard of the danger he was fallen into by the perverse counsels of the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> he would interpret favourably whatsoever had been done by the Lords which were then about him. The King was able to discern, by the drift of this Ambassie, that the Queen was privy to the practice; and that the Ambassadors were sent thither rather to animate and encourage the Conspirators, then advise with him. But not being willing at that time to displease ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Her or them, he absolutely consents to the restoring of the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi>; and to the rest gave such a general answer, as gave some hope, that he was not so incensed by this Surprize of his person, but that his displeasure might be mitigated on their good behaviour. And that the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> also had the same ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions concerning the encouragement which they had from the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> appears by her Letter to that Queen, bearing date at <hi>Sheffield,</hi> on the eighth of <hi>November.</hi> In which she intimates unto Her, <hi>That She was bound in Religion, Duty and Iustice; not to help forwards their Designs, who secretly conspire His ruine and Hers, both in</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> England: And thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did earnestly perswade her, by their near Alliance, <hi>to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Her Sons welfare, not to intermeddle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any further with the affairs of</hi> Scotland, <hi>without her privity or the French Kings; and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54836:122"/>
to hold them for no other then Traytors, who dealt so with Him at their pleasures.</hi> But as Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was not moved with her complaints, to recede from the business; so the Conspirators were resolved to pursue their advantage. They knew on what terms the King stood with the people of <hi>Edenborough</hi>; or might have known it, if they did not, by their Triumphant bringing back of <hi>Dury</hi> their excluded Minister, as soon as they heard the first news of the Kings Restraint. In confidence whereof, they bring him unto <hi>Halyrood</hi>-House on the Eighth of <hi>October</hi>; the rather, in regard they understood, that the General Assembly of the Kirk was to be held in that Town on the next day after; of whose good inclinations to them, they were nothing doubtful, nor was there reason why they should.</p>
            <p n="58">58. For having made a Formal Declaration to them, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the necessity of their repair unto the King, to the end they might take him out of the hands of his <hi>Evil Counsellors,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the said Assembly to deliver their opinion in it. And they, good men, pretending to do <hi>all things in the fear of God, and after mature deliberation</hi> (as the Act importeth) first <hi>justifie them</hi> in that horrid Enterprize, <hi>to have done good and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble service to God, their Soveraign, and their Native Countrey.</hi> And that being done, they gave order, <hi>That all Ministers should publickly declare to their several flocks, as well the danger into which they were brought, as the deliverance which was effected for them by those Noble Persons; with whom they were exhorted to unite themselves, for the further deliverance of the Kirk, and perfect Reformation of the Commonwealth.</hi> Thus the Assembly leads the way, and the Convention of Estates follows shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. By which it was declared, in favour of the said Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, <hi>That in their repairing to the King the Three and twentieth of</hi> August <hi>last, and abiding with him since that time, and whatsoever they had done in pursuance of it, they had done good, thankful and necessary service to the King and Countrey; and therefore they are to be exonerated of all actions Civil or Criminal that might be intended against them, or any of them in that respect; inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby all the Subjects to speak or utter any thing to the contrary, under the pain to be esteemed Calumniators and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersers of false Rumors, and to be punished for the same accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</hi> The Duke perceives by these proceedings, how that cold Countrey, even in the coldest time of the year, would be too hot for him to continue any longer in it; and having wearied himself with an expectation of some better fortune, is forced at last on the latter end of <hi>December</hi> to put into <hi>Berwick,</hi> from whence he passeth to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> and from thence to <hi>France,</hi> never returning more unto his Natural, but Ingrateful Countrey. The Duke had hardly left the Kingdom, when two Ambassadors came from <hi>France</hi> to attone the differences, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate for the Kings deliverance, and to sollicite that the Queen (whose liberty had been negotiated with the Queen of <hi>England</hi>)

The King gives order to the Provost and other Magistrates of the City of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> that the Ambassadors should be feasted at their going away; and care is taken in providing all things necessary for the Entertainment. But the good Brethren of the Kirk, in further manifestation of their peevish Follies, Indict a Fast upon that day, take up the people in their long-winded Exercises from the morning till night, rail all the while on the Ambassadors; and with much difficulty, are disswaded from Excommunicating both the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and the Guests to boot.</p>

The time of the Kings deliverance drew on apace, sooner then was expected by any of those who had the custody of his person.<note place="margin">1583.</note> Being permitted to retire with his Guards to <hi>Falkland,</hi> that he might recreate himself in Hunting, which he much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, he obtained leave to bestow a visit on his Uncle the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> who then lay in S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> not far off. And after he had taken some refreshment with him, he procures leave to see the Castle: Into which he was no sooner entred, but Col. <hi>Stewart</hi> the Captain of his Guard (to whom alone he had communicated his design) makes fast the gates against the rest; and from thence makes it known to all good Subjects, that they should repair unto the King, who by Gods great mercy had escaped from the hands of his Enemies. This news brings thither on the next morning the Earls of <hi>Arguile, Marshal, Montross</hi> and <hi>Rothess</hi>; and they drew after them, by their example, such a general concourse, that the King finds himself of sufficient strength to return to <hi>Edenborough</hi>; and from thence, having shewed himself to be in his former liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he goes back to <hi>Perth.</hi> Where first by Proclamation, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the late restraint of his Person to be a most treasonable act: but then withal, to manifest his great affection to the peace of his Kingdom, he gives a Free and General Pardon to all men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever which had acted in it; provided that they seek it of him, and carry themselves for the time coming like obedient subjects. The Kings escape was made in the end of <hi>Iune</hi>; and in <hi>December</hi> following, he calls a Convention of the Estates, in which the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Proclamation was approved and verified, the fact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be <hi>Crimen laesae Majestatis,</hi> or Treason in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.

Onely the Earl of <hi>Gowry</hi> staid behind the rest, and he paid well for it. For being suspected to be hammering some new design, he was took Prisoner at <hi>Dundee</hi> in the <hi>April</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, 1584, thence brought to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed, as he had deserved.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Kirk-men were as troublesome as the Lay-Conspirators. <hi>Dury,</hi> so often mentioned, in a Sermon at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> had justified the fact at <hi>Ruthen</hi>; for which being cited to appear before the Lords of the Council, he stood in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that which he had delivered; but afterwards submitting himself unto the King on more sober thoughts, he was kept upon his good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Andrew Melvin</hi> was a man of another metal; who being commanded to attend their Lordships for the like offence, declined the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King and Council, as having no cognizance of the cause. To make which good, he broached this Presbyterian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>That whatsoever was spoken in the Pulpit, ought first to be tryed by the Presbyterie; and that neither the King nor Council were to meddle with it, though the same were treasonable, till the Presbyterie had first taken notice of it.</hi> But finding that the King and Council did resolve to proceed, and had entred upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of some Witnesses which were brought against him, he told the King (whether with greater Confidence or Impudence is hard to say) <hi>That he preached the Laws both of God and man.</hi> For which undutiful Expression, he was commanded Prisoner to the Castle of <hi>Blackness.</hi> Instead whereof, he takes Sanctuary in the Town of <hi>Berwick,</hi> where he remained till way was made for his return; the Pulpits in the mean time sounding nothing, but <hi>that the Light of the Countrey for Learning and Piety, was forced for safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his life to forsake the Kingdom.</hi> In which Exile he was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed within few moneths after by <hi>Palvart</hi> Sub-Dean of <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow, Galloway</hi> and <hi>Carmichiel,</hi> two inferior Ministers; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warned to tender their appearance to the King and Council, and not appearing at the time, were thereupon pronounced Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and fled after the other. Nor was the General Assembly held at <hi>Edenborough</hi> of a better temper then these Preachers were, in which the Declaration made at the last Convention of Estates, was stoutly crossed and encountred. The King, with the advice of his Estates, had resolved the Fact of surprizing His
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54836:123"/>
Majesties person to be treasonable. But the Brethren in the said Assembly <hi>did not onely authorize and avow the same, but also (esteeming their own judgement to be the Soveraign judgement of the Realm) did ordain all them to be excommunicated that would subscribe unto their opinion.</hi>

            <p n="61">61. The King perceiving that there was no other way to deal with these men, then to husband the present opportunity to his best advantage, resolved to proceed against them in such a way, as might disable them from committing the like insolencies for the time to come. The chief Incendiaries had been forced to quit the Kingdom, or otherwise deserted it of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, the better to escape the punishment which their crimes had merited. The great Lords, on whose strength they had most presumed, were either under the like exile in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries, or else so weakned and disanimated, that they durst not stir. So that the King being clearly Master of the Field, his Counsellors in good heart, and generally the Lords and Commons in good terms of obedience, it was thought fit to call a Parliament, and therein to enact such Laws, by which the honour of Religion, the personal safety of the King, the peace and happiness of the Kingdom, and the prosperity of the Church, might be made secure. In which Parliament it was enacted amongst others things, (the better to encounter the proceedings of the Kirk, and most Zealous Kirkmen) <hi>That none of his Highness Subjects in time coming, should presume to take upon them by word or writing, to justifie the late treasonable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at</hi> Ruthen, <hi>or to keep in register or store any Books ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the same in any sort.</hi> And in regard the Kirk had so abused his Majesties goodness, by which their Presbyterial Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, the general Assemblies, and other meetings of the Kirk, were rather connived at then allowed; an Act was made to regulate and restrain them for the times ensuing: for by that Act it was ordained, <hi>That from thenceforth none should presume or take upon them to Convocate, Convene, or assemble themselves together for holding of Councils, Conventions, or Assemblies; to treat, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, or determine in any matters of Estate, Civil or Ecclesiastical, (excepting the ordinary judgements) without the Kings special commandment.</hi>

In the next place, the Kings lawful Authority in causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical, so often before impugned, was approved and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it was made treason for any man to refuse to answer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, though it were concerning any matter which was Ecclesiastical. The third Estate of Parliament (that is, the Bishops) were restored to the ancient dignity; and it was made treason for any man, after that time, to procure the innovation or diminution of the Power and Authority of any of the three Estates. <hi>And for as much as through the wicked, licentious, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private Speeches, and untrue calumnies of divers his Highness subjects</hi> (I speak the very words of the Act) <hi>to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,

            <p n="63">63. The Ministers could not want intelligence of particulars before they were passed into Acts. And now or never was the time to bestir themselves, when their dear <hi>Helena</hi> was in such apparent danger to be ravished from them. And first, it was thought necessary to send one of their number to the King, to mediate either for the total dismissing of the <hi>Bills</hi> prepared, or the suspending of them at the least for a longer time; not doubting, if they gained the last, but that the first would easily follow of it self. On this Errand they imploy Mr. <hi>David Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi> Minister of the Church of <hi>Leith</hi>; a man more moderate then the rest, and therefore more esteemed by the King then any other of that body. And how far he might have prevailed, it is hard to say: But Captain <hi>Iames Stewart</hi> (commonly called the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi>) who then governed the Affairs of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, having notice of it, caused him to be arrested, under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of maintaining intelligence with the Fugitive Ministers in <hi>England</hi>; imprisoned him for one night in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and sends him the next day to the Castle of <hi>Blackness,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained almost a year. Upon the news of his commitment, <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>Belcanqual,</hi> two of the Ministers of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> forsake their Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, and joyn themselves unto their Brethren in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; first leaving a Manifest behind them, in which they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished the Reasons of their sudden departure. <hi>Iohn Dury,</hi> so often before mentioned, had lately been confined at <hi>Montross</hi>; so that no Preacher was now left in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> or the Port ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, to intercede for themselves and the Kirk in that present exigent. By means whereof the Acts were passed without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption. But when they were to be proclaimed, as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom is, Mr. <hi>Robert Pont,</hi> Minister of St. <hi>Cutberts,</hi> and one of the Senators of the Colledge of Justice, (for the good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters might act in Civil Matters, though the Bishops might not) took Instruments in the hands of a publick Notary, and openly protested against those Acts, never agreed to by the Kirk;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:54836:124"/>
and therefore that neither the Kirk, nor any of the Kirk-men, were obliged to be obedient to them. Which having done, he fled also into <hi>England,</hi> to the rest of his Brethren; and being proclaimed Rebel, lost his place in the Sessions.</p>
            <p n="64">64 The flying of so many Ministers, and the noise they made in <hi>England</hi> against those Acts, encreased a scandalous opinion which themselves had raised, of the Kings being inclined to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery: and it began to be so generally believed, that the King found himself under a necessity of rectifying his reputation in the eye of the world, by a publick <hi>Manifest.</hi> In which he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified as well to his good subjects, as to all others whatsoever whom it might concern, as well the just occasion which had moved him to pass those Acts, as the great Equity and Reason which appeared in them. And amongst these occasions, he reckoneth the justifying of the Fact at <hi>Ruthen,</hi> by the publick suffrage of the Kirk; <hi>Melvins</hi> declining of the judgement of the King and Council; the Fast indicted at the entertainment of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors; their frequent general Fasts, proclaimed and kept in all parts of the Realm by their Authority, without his privity and consent; the usurping of the Ecclesiastical ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction by a certain number of Ministers, and unqualified Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, in the Presbyteries and Assemblies; the alteration of the Laws, and making new ones at their pleasure, which must binde the Subject; the drawing to themselves of all such Causes, though properly belonging to the Courts of Justice, in which was any mixture of scandal: On which account, they forced all those also to submit to the Churches Censures, who had been accused in those Courts, for Murther, Theft, or any like enormous crimes, though the party either were absolved by the Court it self, or pardoned by the King after condemnation. But all this could not stop the Mouthes, and much less stay the Pens of that Waspish Sect; some flying out against the King in their scurrilous Libels, bald Pamphlets, and defamatory Rythmes; others with no less violence inveighing against him in their Pulpits, but most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>England,</hi> where they were out of the Kings reach, and consequently might rail on without fear of punishment. By them it was given out, to render the King odious both at home and abroad, That the King endeavoured to extinguish the light of the Gospel, and to that end had caused those Acts to pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it: That he had left nothing of the whole ancient Form of Justice and Polity, in the Spiritual Estate, but a naked shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: That Popery was immediately to be established, if God and all good men came not in to help them: That for opposing these impieties, they had been forced to flee their Country, and sing the Lords Song in a strange Land; with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reproachful and calumnious passages of like odious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

THE Reformation of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so good a way by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, that it was no hard matter to proceed upon his beginnings. He had once declared himself so much in favour of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by writing against <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> that he was honored with the Title of <hi>Defensor Fidei</hi> (or the <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi>) by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> X. Which Title he afterwards united by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to the Crown of this Realm, not many years before his death. But a breach hapning betwixt him and Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VII, concerning his desired Divorce; he first prohibits all appeals and other occasions of resort to the See of <hi>Rome</hi>; procures himself to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54836:126"/>
be acknowledged by the Prelates and Clergie in their Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for <hi>Supream Head</hi> on Earth of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; obtained a promise of them in <hi>verbo Sacerdotii</hi> (which was then equal to an Oath) neither to make, promulge nor execute any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Constitutions, but as they should be authorized there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by his Letters-Patents; and then proceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> unto an Act for extinguishing the usurped Authority of the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> But knowing what a strong party the Pope had in <hi>England,</hi> by reason of that huge multitudes of Monks and Fryers which depended on him, he first dissolves all Monasteries and Religious Houses which were not able to dispend Three hundred Marks of yearly Rent; and after draws in all the rest upon Surrendries, Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, or some other Practices. And having brought the work so far, he caused the Bible to be published in the English Tongue; indulged the private reading of it to all persons of quality, and to such others also as were of known judgement and discretion; commanded the Epistles and Gospels, the Lords Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandment, to be rehearsed openly to the people on every Sunday and Holy Day in the English Tongue; and ordered the Letany also to be read in English upon <hi>Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> and <hi>Fridays.</hi> He had caused moreover many rich Shrines and Images to be defaced, such as had most notoriously been abused by Oblations, Pilgrimages, and other the like acts of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Worship; and was upon the point also to abolish the Mass it self, concerning which he had some secret communication with the French Ambassador, if <hi>Fox</hi> speak him rightly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But what he did not live to do, and perhaps never would have done, had he lived much longer, was brought to pass in the next Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. In the beginning whereof, by the Authority of the Lord Protector, the diligence of Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and the endeavours of many other Learned and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, a Book of Homilies was set out to instruct the people; Injunctions published for the removing of all Images formerly abused to Superstition, or false and counterfeit in themselves. A Statute past in Parliament for receiving the Sacrament in both kinds, and order given to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Some other Prelates, to draw a Form for the Administration of it accordingly, to the honor of God, and the most Edification of all good people. The news whereof no sooner came unto <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> but <hi>Calvin</hi> must put in for a share; and forthwith writes his Letters to Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> in which he offereth his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to promote the service, if he thought it necessary. But neither <hi>Cranmer, Kidley,</hi> nor any of the rest of the English Bishops, could see any such necessity of it, but that they might be able to do well without him. They knew the temper of the man, how busie and pragmatical he had been in all those places in which he had been suffered to intermeddle; that in some points of Christian Doctrine he differed from the general current of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and had devised such a way of Ecclesiastical Polity, as
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54836:126"/>
was destructive in it self to the Sacred Hierarchy, and never had been heard of in all Antiquity. But because they would give him no offence, it was resolved to carry on the work by none but English hands, till they had perfected the composing of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Liturgie, with all the Rites and Ceremonies in the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. And that being done, it was conceived not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, if they made use of certain Learned men of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churches for reading the Divinity-Lectures, and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Disputations in both Universities; to the end that the younger Students might be trained up in sound Orthodox Doctrine. On which account they invited <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> two men of eminent parts and Learning, to come over to them; the one of which they disposed in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and the other at <hi>Cambridge.</hi> This might have troubled <hi>Calvin</hi> more then his own repulse, but that he thought himself sufficiently assured of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> who by reason of his long living amongst the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and his nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Neighborhood to <hi>Geneva,</hi> might possibly be governed by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. But because <hi>Bucer</hi> had no such dependance on him, and had withal been very much conversant in the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, keeping himself in all his Reformations in a moderate course; he practiseth to gain him also, or at least to put him into such a way as might come nearest to his own. Upon which grounds he posts away his Letters to him, congratulates his invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into <hi>England</hi>; but above all, adviseth him to have a care that he endeavoured not there, as in other places, either to be the Author or Approver of such moderate counsels, by which the parties might be brought to a Reconcilement.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the satisfaction of these strangers, but the last especially, the Liturgie is translated into Latine by <hi>Alexander Alesius,</hi> a right Learned <hi>Scot.</hi> A Copy of whose Translation, or the sum there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, being sent to <hi>Calvin,</hi> administred no small matter of offence unto him; not so much because any thing in it could be judged offen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The people of <hi>England</hi> had received it as an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly treasure sent down by Gods great mercy to them; all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate men beyond the Seas, applauded the felicity of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in fashioning such an excellent Form of Gods Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship; and by the Act of Parliament which confirmed the same, it was declared to have been done <hi>by the special aid of the Holy Ghost.</hi> But <hi>Calvin</hi> was resolved to think otherwise of it, declaring his dislike thereof in a long Letter written to the Lord Protector: In which he excepteth more particularly against Commemoration of the dead (which he acknowledgeth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to be very ancient;) as also against <hi>Chrism,</hi> or Oyl in Baptism, and the Form of Visiting the sick; and then adviseth, that as well these, as all the rest of the Rites and Ceremonies, be cut off at once. And that this grave advice might not prove unwelcome, he gives us such a Rule or Reason, as afterwards raised more trouble to the Church of <hi>England</hi> then his bare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54836:127"/>
His Rule is this, <hi>That in carrying on the work of a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, there is not any thing to be exacted, which is not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and required by the Word of God: That in such cases there is no Rule left for worldly wisdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for moderation and compliance; but all things to be ordered as they are directed by his will revealed.</hi> What use his Followers made of their Masters Rule, in crying down the Rites and Ceremonies of this Church (as <hi>Superstitiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the mean time, we must behold him in his Applications to the King and Council, his tampering with Archbishop <hi>Canmer,</hi> his practising on men of all conditions to encrease his party<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For finding little benefit to redound unto him by his Letter to the Lord Protector, he sets upon the King himself; and tells him plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there were many things amiss which required Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In his Letters unto the King and Council, as he writes to <hi>Bullinger,</hi> he had excited them to proceed in the good work which they had begun; that is to say, that they should so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as he had directed. With <hi>Cranmer</hi> he is more particular, and tells him in plain terms, <hi>That in the Liturgie of this Church, as then it stood, there remained a whole mass of Popery, which did not onely blemish, but destroy Gods Publick Worship.</hi> But fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he might not edifie with the godly King, assisted by so wise a Council, and such Learned Prelates, he hath his Emissaries in the Court, and amongst the Clergie; his Agents in the City and Countrey, his Intelligencers (one Monsieur <hi>Nicholas</hi> amongst the rest) in the University. All of them active and industrious to advance his purposes; but none more mischievously practical then <hi>Iohn Alasco,</hi> a <hi>Polonian</hi> born, but a profest <hi>Calvian</hi> both in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Forms of Worship; who coming out of <hi>Poland</hi> with a mixed Congregation, under pretence of being forced to fly their Countrey for professing the Reformed Religion, were gratified with the Church of <hi>Augustine</hi>-Fryers in <hi>London</hi> for their publick use; and therein suffered to enjoy their own way, both in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Government, though in both exceeding different from the Rules of this Church. In many Churches of this Realm the Altars were left standing as in former times, and in the rest the holy Table was placed Altar-wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But by his party in the Court, he procures an Order from the Lords of the Council, for causing the said Table to be removed, and to be placed in the middle of the Church or Chancel, like a common Table. It was the usage of this Church to give the holy Sacrament unto none but such as kneeled at the participation, according to the pious order of the primitive times. But <hi>Iohn Alasco</hi> coming out of <hi>Poland,</hi> where the <hi>Arrians</hi> (who deny the Divinity of Christ our Saviour) had introduced the use of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tion, he publisheth a Pamphlet in defence of that irreverend and sawey gesture, because most proper for a Supper. The Liturgie had appointed several Offices for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Festivals observed in the most regular times of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: Some of the Clergy in the Convocation must be set on work to question the conveniencie, if not the lawfulness of those observations, considering that all days are alike, and therefore to be equally regarded in a Church Reformed. And some there were which raised a scruple touching the words which were prescribed to be used in the delivery of the Bread and Wine to the Congregation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Not to proceed to more particulars, let it suffice that these Emissaries did so ply their work, by the continual solliciting of the King, the Council, and the Convocation, that at the last the Book was brought to a review. The product or result whereof was the second Liturgie, confirmed in Parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 5, 6 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. By the tenour of which Act it may appear, first, that there was nothing contained in the said Book, but <hi>what was agreeable to the Word of God, and the Primitive Church, very comfortable to all good people desiring to live in Christian conversation, and most profitable to the Estate of this Realm.</hi> And secondly, That <hi>such doubts as had been raised in the use and exercise thereof, proceeded rather from the curiosity of the Minister and Mistakers, then of any other worthy cause.</hi> And thereupon we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the first Liturgie was discontinued, and the second superinduced upon it after this review, to give satisfaction unto <hi>Calvins</hi> Cavils, the curiosities of some, and the mistakes of others of his Friends and Followers. But yet this would nor serve the turn; they must have all things modelled by the Form of <hi>Geneva,</hi> or else no quiet to be had: Which since they could not gain in <hi>England,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> (who did not long out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live the setling of the second Liturgie) they are resolved more eagerly to pursue the project in a Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In contrary whereof, such as approved not of that Liturgy when they were in <hi>England,</hi> united themselves into a Church or Congregation in the City of <hi>Frankfort,</hi> where they set up a mixt Form of their own devising, but such as carried some resemblance to the Book of <hi>England. Whittingham</hi> was the first who took upon himself the charge of this Congregation; which after he resigned to <hi>Knox,</hi> as the fitter man to carry on the work intended, who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Geneva</hi> on the death of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and from thence published some tedious Pamphlets against the Regiment of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and otherwise defamatory of the Emperour and the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> was grown exceeding dear to <hi>Calvin</hi> and the rest of that Consistory. By his indeavours, and forwardness of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54836:128"/>
too many of the Congregation, that little which was used of the English Liturgie was quite laid aside, and all things brought more near the Order which be found at <hi>Geneva</hi>; though so much differing from that also, as to intitle <hi>Knox</hi> for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The noise of this great Innovation brings <hi>Gryndal</hi> and <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> from the Church of <hi>Strasburg</hi> to set matters right. By whom it was purposed, that the <hi>substance</hi> of the English Book being still retained, there might be a forbearance of some Ceremonies and Offices in it. But <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Whittingham</hi> were as much bent against the substance of the Book, as against any of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantials and Extrinsecals which belonged unto it. So that no good effect following on this interposition, the Agents of the Church of <hi>Strasburg</hi> return back to their brethren, who by their Letters of the 13 of <hi>December</hi> expostulate in vain about it. To put an end to these Disputes, no better way could be devised by <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Whittingham,</hi> then to require the countenance of <hi>Calvin,</hi> which they thought would carry it. To him they send an Abstract of the Book of <hi>England,</hi> that by his positive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Sentence (which they presumed would be in favour of his own) it might stand or fall.

This Answer so prevailed upon all his Followers, that they who sometimes had approved, did now as much dislike the <hi>English Liturgie</hi>; and those who at first had conceived a dislike thereof, did afterwards grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an open detestation of it. In which condition of Affairs, Dr. <hi>Richard Cox,</hi> Dr. <hi>Horne,</hi> and others of great Note and Quality, put themselves also into <hi>Frankfort,</hi> where they found all things contrary to their expectation. <hi>Cox</hi> had been Almoner to King <hi>Edward</hi> VI, Chancellor of the University of <hi>Oxon,</hi> Dean of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> one that had a chief hand in composing the <hi>English Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie</hi>; which made him very impatient of such Innovations, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to no less then a total rejection of it, as he found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them. By his Authority and appointment, the <hi>English Litany</hi> is first read, and afterwards the whole Book reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to use and practice. Against which when <hi>Knox</hi> began to rail in a publick Sermon, (according to his wonted custom) he is accused by <hi>Cox</hi> to the Senate of <hi>Frankfort</hi> for his defamatory writings against the Emperour and the Queen of <hi>England.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the news whereof, <hi>Knox</hi> forsakes the Town, retires himself unto his Sanctuary at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and thither he is followed by a

great part of his Congregation, who made foul work in <hi>England</hi> at their coming home.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But this about the Liturgy, though it was the greatest, was not the onely quarrel which was raised by the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> or <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian</hi> Zealors. The Church prescribed the use of <hi>Surplices</hi> in all Sacred Offices, and <hi>Coapes</hi> in the officiating at the holy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. It prescribed also a distinct habit in the Clergy from the rest of the people; <hi>Roche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Chimeres</hi> for the Bishops; <hi>Gowns, Tippets,</hi> and <hi>Canonical Coats</hi> for the rest of the Clergy; the square <hi>Cap</hi> for all. Their opposition in the use of the Surplice, much confirmed and countenanced, as well by the writings, as the practice of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>; who kept a constant intercourse with <hi>Calvin</hi> at his being here. For in his Writings he declared to a Friend of his, (who required his judgement in the case) that such Vestments being in themselves indifferent, could make no man godly or ungodly, either by forbearance or the use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he thought it more expedient to the good of the Church, that they and all others of that kinde should be taken away, when the next convenient opportunity should present it self. Which judgement as he grounds upon <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Rule, that nothing should be acted in a Reformation which is not warranted expresly by the Word of God; so he adds this to it of his own, that where there is so much contending for these outward mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, there is but little care of the true Religion. And he assures us of himself (in point of practice) that though he were a Canon of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> and diligent enough in attending Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as the others did, yet he could never be perswaded to use that Vestment; which must needs animate all the rest of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevians</hi> to forbear it also. The like was done by <hi>Iohn Alasco,</hi> in crying down the Regular habit of the Clergie before describ'd. In which prevailing little by his own authority, he writes to <hi>M. Bucer</hi> to declare against it; and for the same was most severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprehended by that moderate and learned man, and all his cavils and objections very solidly answered. Which being sent unto him in the way of a Letter, was afterwards print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dispersed, for keeping down that opposite humour, which began then to over-swell the Banks, and threatned to bear all before it. But that which made the greatest noise, was the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Mr. <hi>Iohn Hooper,</hi> Lord Elect of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> who having lived amongst the <hi>Switzers</hi> in the time of King <hi>Henry,</hi> did rather choose to be denied his Consecration, then to receive it in that habit which belonged to his Order. At first the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> (who after was Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi>) interceded for him, and afterwards drew in the King to make one in the business. But <hi>Cranmer, Ridley,</hi> and the rest of the Bishops who were most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, craved leave not to obey His Majestie against his Laws; and in the end prevailed so far, that <hi>Hooper</hi> for his contumacy was committed Prisoner; and from the Prison writes his Letters to <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> for their opinion in the case.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54836:129"/>
From the last of which, who had declared himself no Friend to the English Ceremonies, he might presume of some encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the rather, in regard that <hi>Calvin</hi> had appeared on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, who must needs have a hand in this quarrel also. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding how things went, he writes unto the Duke of <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset</hi> to attone the difference, not by perswading <hi>Hooper</hi> to conform himself to the received Orders of the Church, but to lend the man a helping hand, by which he might be able to hold out against all Authority.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But <hi>Hooper</hi> being deserted by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and not daring to relie altogether upon <hi>Calvins</hi> credit, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to support him, submits at last unto the pleasure of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan, and the Rules of the Church. So that in fine the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was thus compromised; that is to say, <hi>That he should receive his Consecration attired in his Episcopal Robes: That he should be dispensed withal from wearing them at ordinary times as his daily habits; but that he should be bound to use them whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he preached before the King in his own Cathedral, or any other place of like publick nature.</hi> According to which Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being appointed to preach before the King, he shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self apparelled in his Bishops Robes; <hi>viz.</hi> A long Scarlet <hi>Chimere</hi> reaching down to the ground for his upper Garment (changed in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time to one of black Sattin) and under that a white linen <hi>Rochet,</hi> with a Square Cap upon his head. This <hi>Fox</hi> reproacheth by the name of a <hi>Popish Attire,</hi> and makes it to be a great <hi>cause of shame and contumelie to that godly man.</hi> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the submission of this Reverend Prelate, too many of the inferior Clergie were not found so tractable in their confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Cap and Tippet, the Gown, and the Canonical Coat; the wearing whereof was required of them, whensoever they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in publick: Being decryed also by <hi>Alasco</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Zuinglians</hi> or <hi>Galvinians,</hi> as a <hi>Superstitions</hi> and <hi>Popish At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,</hi> altogether as unfit for Ministers of the holy Gospel, as the Chimere and Rochet were for those who claimed to be the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of the Lords Apostles. So <hi>Tyms</hi> replied unto Bishop <hi>Gardiner,</hi> when being asked whether a Coat, with stockins of divers colours, were a fit apparel for a Deacon: He sawcily made answer, that <hi>his Vesture did not so much vary from a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, as his Lordships did from that of an Apostle.</hi> Which passage, as well concerning the debates about the Liturgie, as about the Vestments, I have here abbreviated, leaving the Reader for his further satisfaction to the History of the Reformation not long since published, in which they are laid down at large in their times and places.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Nor did they work less trouble to the Church in those early days, by their endeavouring to advance some <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Doctrines, by which the blame of all mens sins was either charged upon Gods will, or his Divine Decree of Predestination. These men are called in Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi>'s Preface to the Ten Commandments, by
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54836:129"/>
the name of <hi>Gospellers,</hi> for making their new Doctrines such a necessary part of our Saviours Gospel, as if men could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be saved without it. These Doctrines they began to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi>; but never were so busie at it, as when they lived at <hi>Geneva,</hi> or came newly thence. For first, <hi>Knox</hi> publisheth a book against an <hi>Adversary of Gods Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination</hi>; wherein it is declared, <hi>That whatsoever the Ethnicks and ignorant did attribute to Fortune, by Christians is to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to Gods heavenly Providence: That we ought to judge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to come of Fortune, but that all cometh by the determinate counsel of God: And finally, that it would be displeasing unto God, if we esteem any thing to proceed from any other; and that we do not onely behold him as the principal cause of all things, but also the Author, appointing all things to one or the other by his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Counsel.</hi> After, came out a book first written in French, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>terwards by some of them translated into English, which they called, <hi>A brief Declaration of the Table of Predestination:</hi> In which is put down for a principal Aphorism, <hi>That in like manner as God hath appointed the end, it is necessary that he should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the causes leading to the same end; but more particularly, That by virtue of Gods will all things are done, yea, even those things which are evil and execrable.</hi>

At the same time came out another of their books, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be writ <hi>Against a privy Papist,</hi> as the Title tells us; wherein is maintained more agreeably to <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrine, <hi>That all evil springeth of Gods Ordinance, and that Gods Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the cause of</hi> Adams <hi>fall, and of all wickedness.</hi> And in a fourth book published by <hi>Robert Cowley,</hi> who afterwards was Rector of the Church of S. <hi>Giles</hi> near <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> intituled, <hi>The confutation of Thirteen Articles</hi>; it is said expresly, <hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>being so perfect a creature that there was in him no lust to sin, and yet so weak, that of himself he was not able to resist the assault of the subtile Serpent; that therefore there can be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, but that the onely cause of his fall must needs be the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination of God.</hi> In which book it is also said, <hi>That the most wicked persons that have been, were of God appointed to be wicked even as they were: That if God do predestinate a man to do things rashly, and without any deliberation, he shall not deliberate at all, but run headlong upon it be it good or evil: And in a word, That we are compelled by Gods Predestination to do those things for which we are damned.</hi> By which Defenders of the absolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Reprobation, as God is made to be Author of sin, either in plain terms, or undeniable consequence; so from the same men, and the <hi>Genevian</hi> Pamphlets by them dispersed, our English <hi>Calvinists</hi> have borrowed all their Grounds and Principles on which they build the absolute and irrespective Decree of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, contrary to the Doctrines publickly maintained and taught in the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and afterwards more clearly explicated under Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>

Such was the posture of affairs at Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> first coming to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> when to the points before disputed both at home and abroad, was raised another of more weight and consequence then all the rest; and such, as (if it could be gained) would bring on the other. Such as had lived in exile amongst the <hi>Zwitzers,</hi> or followed <hi>Knox</hi> at his return unto <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> became exceedingly enamored of <hi>Calvins</hi> Platform; by which they found so much Authority ascribed unto the Ministers in the several Churches, as might make them absolute and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant, without being called to an account by King or Bishop. This Discipline they purposed to promote at their coming home; and to that end, leaving some few behind them to attend the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of the Bible with the <hi>Genevian</hi> Notes upon it, which was then in the Press, the rest return a main for <hi>England</hi> to pursue the Project. But <hi>Cox</hi> had done their errand before they came; and she had heard so much from others of their carriage at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> and their untractableness in point of Decency and comely Order in the Reign of her brother, as might sufficiently forewarn her not to hearken to them. Besides, she was not to be told with what reproaches <hi>Calvin</hi> had reviled her Sister, nor how she had been persecuted by his followers in the time of her Reign; some of them railing at her person in their scandalous Pamphlets; some practising by false, but dangerous allusions, to subvert her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and others openly praying to God, <hi>That he would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turn her heart, or put an end to her days.</hi> And of these men she was to give her self no hope, but that they would proceed with her in the self-same manner, whensoever any thing should be done (how necessary and just soever) which might cross their humours. The consideration whereof was of such prevalency with those of her Council, who were then deliberating about the altering of Religion, that amongst other remedies which were wisely thought of to prevent such dangers as probably might ensue upon it, it was resolved to have an eye upon these men, who were so hot in the pursuit of their flattering hopes, that out of a desire of Innovation (as my Author tells me) they were busied at that very time in setting up a new Form of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Polity, and therefore were to be supprest with all care and diligence before they grew unto a head.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But they were men of harder metal then to be broken at the first blow which was offered at them. Queen <hi>Maries</hi> death being certified to those of <hi>Geneva,</hi> they presently dispatched their Letters to their Brethren at <hi>Frankfort</hi> and <hi>Arrow</hi>; to which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of theirs, an answer is returned from <hi>Frankfort</hi> on the third, from <hi>Arrow</hi> on the 16 of <hi>Ianuary:</hi> And thereupon it is resolved to prepare for <hi>England,</hi> before their party was so sunk, that it could not without much difficulty be buoyed up again. Some of their party which remained all the time in <hi>England,</hi> being impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of delay, and chusing rather to anticipate then expect Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, had set themselves on work in defacing Images, demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:54836:130"/>
the Altars; and might have made foul work, if not stopped in time. Others began as hastily to preach the Protestant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in private Houses first, and afterwards as opportunity was offered, in the open Churches: Great multitudes of people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorting to them without Rule or Order. To give a check to whose forwardness, the Queen sets out her Proclamation in the end of <hi>December</hi>; but which she gave command, <hi>That no Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation should be made in the State of Religion, and that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons should conform themselves for the present to the practices of Her Majesties Chappel, till it was otherwise appointed.</hi> Another Proclamation was also issued, by which all preaching was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, but by such onely as were licensed by her Authority; which was not like to countenance any men of such turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent spirits. The news whereof much hastned the return of those Zealous Brethren, who knew they might have better fishing in a troubled water, then in a quiet and composed. <hi>Calvin</hi> makes use also of the opportunity, directs his Letters to the Queen and Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil,</hi> in hope that nothing should be done but by his advice. The contrary whereof gave matter of cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort both to him and them, when they were given to understand, that the Liturgie had been revised and agreed upon: That it was made more passable then before with the Roman Catholicks; and that not any of their number was permitted to act any thing in it, except <hi>Whitehead</hi> onely, who was but half theirs neither, and perhaps not that. All they could do in that Conjuncture, was to find fault with the Translation of the Bible which was then in use, in hope that their <hi>Genevian</hi> Edition of it might be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and to except against the paucity of fit men to serve the Church, and fill the vacant places of it, on the like hopes that they themselves might be preferred to supply the same.</p>
            <p n="13">13. And it is possible enough,<note place="margin">1559.</note> that either by the mediation of <hi>Calvin,</hi> or by the intercession of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> (who wrote un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Queen at the same time also) the memory of their former Errors might have been obliterated; if <hi>Knox</hi> had not pulled more back with one hand, then <hi>Calvin, Martyr</hi> and the rest could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance with both. For in a Letter of his to Sir <hi>William Cecil,</hi> dated <hi>April</hi> the 24, 1559, he first upbraids him <hi>with consenting to the suppressing of Christs true Evangel, to the erecting of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to the shedding of the blood of Gods most dear children, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Reign of</hi> Mischievous <hi>Mary,</hi> that professed Enemy of God, as he plainly calls her. Then he proceeds to justifie his treason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and seditious book against the Regiment of Women. Of the truth whereof he positively affirmeth <hi>that he no more doubteth, then that he doubted that was the voyce of God which pronounced this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon that Sex, That in dolour they should bear their children.</hi> Next he declares in reference to the Person of Queen <hi>Elizabeth, That he could willingly acknowledge her to be raised by God, for the manifestation of his glory, although not Nature onely, but Gods own Ordinance did oppugn such Regiment.</hi> And thereupon he
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:54836:131"/>
doth infer, <hi>That if Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>would confess, that the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Dispensations of Gods great mercy did make that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in her, which both Nature and Gods Laws did deny in all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men besides, none in</hi> England <hi>should be more ready to maintain her lawful Authority then himself.</hi> But on the other side he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth this Sentence on her, <hi>That if she built her Title upon Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, Laws and Ordinances of men, such foolish presumption would grievously offend Gods Supreme Majestie, and that her ingratitude in that kind should not long lack punishment.</hi> To the same purpose he writes also to the Queen Herself, reproaching her withal, <hi>That for fear of her life she had declined from God, bowed to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and gone to Mass, during the persecution of Gods Saints in the time of her Sister.</hi> In both his Letters he complains of some ill offices which had been done him, by means whereof he was denyed the liberty of Preaching in <hi>England:</hi> And in both Letters he endeavoured to excuse his flock of late <hi>assembled in the most godly Reformed Church and City of</hi> Geneva, from being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any offence by his publishing of the book; the blame where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he wholly takes upon himself. But this was not the way to deal with Queens and their Privy Counsellors; and did effect so little in relation to himself and his flock, that he caused a more watchfull eye to be kept upon them, then possibly might have been otherwise, had he scribled less.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Yet such was the necessity which the Church was under, that it was hardly possible to supply all the vacant places in it, but by admitting some of the <hi>Genevian</hi> Zealots to the Publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery. The Realm had been extreamly visited in the year fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going with a dangerous and Contagious Sickness, which took away almost half the Bishops, and occasioned such Mortality amongst the rest of the Clergy, that a great part of the Parochial Churches were without Incumbents. The rest of the Bishops, twelve Deans, as many Archdeacons, Fifteen Masters of Colledges and Halls, Fifty Prebendaries of Cathedral Churches, and about Eighty Beneficed-men were deprived at once, for refusing to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap> to the Queens Supremacy. For the filling of which vacant places though as much care was taken as could be imagined to stock the Church with moderate and conformable men, yet many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ast amongst the rest, who either had not hitherto discovered their dis-affections, or were connived at in regard of their parts and learning. Private opinions not regarded, nothing was more considered in them then their zeal against Popery, and their abilities in Divine and Humane studies to make good that zeal. On which account we find the Queens-Professor in <hi>Oxford</hi> to pass amongst the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> though somewhat more moderate then the rest; and <hi>Cartwright</hi> the Lady <hi>Margarets</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to prove an unextinguished fire-brand to the Church of <hi>England; Wittingham</hi> the chief Ring-leader of the <hi>Frankfort</hi>-Schismaticks, preferred unto the Deanry of <hi>Durham,</hi> from thence encouraging <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Goodman</hi> in setting up Presbyterie and sedition in the

Kirk of <hi>Scotland. Sampson</hi> advanced unto the Deanry of Christ-Church, and not long after turn'd out again for an <hi>incorrigible Non-Conformist. Hardiman,</hi> one of the first twelve Prebends of <hi>Westminster,</hi> deprived soon after, for throwing down the Altar, and defacing the Vestments of the Church. And if so many of them were advanced to places of note and eminence, there is no question to be made, but that some numbers of them were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Countrey-Cures; by means whereof, they had as great an opportunity as they could desire, not onely to dispute their <hi>Genevian</hi> Doctrines, but to prepare the people committed to them for receiving of such Innovations both in Worship and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as were resolved in time convenient to be put upon them.</p>
            <p n="15">15. For a preparative whereunto,<note place="margin">1560.</note> they brought along with them the <hi>Genevian</hi> Bible, with their Notes upon it, together with <hi>Davids Psalms</hi> in English metre; that by the one they might ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect an Innovation in the points of Doctrine, and by the other bring this Church more neer to the Rules of <hi>Geneva</hi> in some chief acts of Publick Worship. For to omit the incongruities of the Translation, which King <hi>Iames</hi> judged to be the worst that he had ever seen in the English Tongue, the Notes upon the same in many places savour of Sedition, and in some of Faction, destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of the Persons and Powers of Kings, and of all civil inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and humane society. That Learned King hath told us in the Conference at <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court, that the Notes on the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> Bible were <hi>partial, untrue, seditious, and savouring too much of dangerous and trayterous conceits.</hi> For proof whereof he instanced in the Note of <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 19. where they allow of disobedience unto Kings and Soveraign Princes: And secondly, in that on 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8.15, 16. where <hi>Asa</hi> is taxed for not putting his Mother to death, but deposing her onely from the Regency which before she executed. Of which last note the <hi>Scotish Presbyterians</hi> made especial use, not onely in deposing <hi>Mary</hi> their lawful Queen, but prosecuting her openly and under-hand till they had took away her life. And to this too he might have added that on <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.12. where it is said, that <hi>Promise ought not be kept where Gods honor and preaching of his truth is hindred, or else it ought not to be broken.</hi> Which opens a wide gap to the breach of all Oaths, Covenants, Contracts and Agreements, not onely between man and man, but between Kings and their Subjects. For what man can be safe, or King secure; what Promise can oblige, or what Contract bind; or what Oath tye a man to his Faith and duty, if on pretence of <hi>Gods honor,</hi> or the <hi>propagating of his truth,</hi> he may lawfully break it? And yet this Doctrine passed so currantly amongst the <hi>French,</hi> that it was positively affirmed by <hi>Eusebius Philadelphus,</hi> whosoever he was, <hi>That Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>was no more bound to keep the League which she had made and sworn with</hi> Charles IX, (because forsooth the <hi>preaching of the Gospel</hi> might be hindred by it) <hi>then</hi> Herod <hi>was obliged to keep the Oath
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:54836:132"/>
which he had sworn to the Dancing-Harlot.</hi> Follow them to <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. and they will tell us in their Notes upon that Chapter, that by the <hi>Locusts which came out of the smoak,</hi> are meant <hi>false Teachers, Hereticks, and worldly subtile Prelates, with Monks, Fryers, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, Doctors, Batchelors and Masters.</hi> To which though they subjoyn these words, <hi>viz. Which forsake Christ to maintain false Doctrine</hi>; yet lays it a disgrace on all Archbishops and Bishops, and on all such as take Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical degrees, by bringing them under the name of <hi>Locusts,</hi> and joyning them with <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers,</hi> whom they beheld no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then as <hi>Limbs of Antichrist.</hi> Which being the design of their Annotations, agreeable to <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrine in reference to Civil &amp; Ecclesiastical Government, there is no doubt but that they come up roundly to him in reference to Predestination, and the points appendant: for which I shall refer the Reader to the Notes themselves; observing onely in this place, that they exclude Christ and all his sufferings from being any way considerable in mans Election, which they found onely on the absolute will and pleasure of Almighty God, but are content to make him an <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour cause</hi> (and onely an <hi>inferiour cause</hi>) of a mans salvation: For which consult them on <hi>Rom</hi> 9.15.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Now with this Bible, and these Notes, which proved so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to them in their main projectments, they also brought in <hi>Davids Psalms</hi> in English metre, of which they served them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to some tune in the time succeeding. Which device being first taken up by <hi>Clement Marot,</hi> and continued afterwards by <hi>Beza,</hi> as before is said, was followed here in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Thomas Sternhold</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and afterwards by <hi>Iohn Hopkins</hi> and some others, who had retired unto <hi>Geneva</hi> in the time of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> Being there finished, and printed at the end of their Bibles, they were first recommended to the use of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Families; next brought into the Church for an entertainment before the beginning of the Morning and Evening Service: And finally, published by themselves, or at the end of the <hi>Psalter,</hi> with this Declaration, that they were <hi>set forth and allowed to be sung in all Churches before and after Morning and Evening Prayer, as also before and after Sermons.</hi> But first, no such al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance can be found as is there pretended, nor could be found when this allowance was disputed in the <hi>High Commission,</hi> by such as have been most industrious and concerned in the search thereof. And then whereas it is pretended that the said Psalms should be sung <hi>before and after Morning and Evening Prayer, as also before and after Sermons</hi> (which shews they were not to be intermingled with the Publick Liturgie) in very little time they prevailed so far in most Parish-Churches, as to thrust out the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and the <hi>Benedicite,</hi> the <hi>Benedictus,</hi> the <hi>Magnificat,</hi> and the <hi>Nunc Dimittis</hi> quite out of the Church. And thirdly, by the practices and endeavours of the <hi>Puritan</hi> party (who had an eye upon the usage of <hi>Geneva</hi>) they came to be esteemed the most
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:54836:132"/>
Divine part of Gods publick service; the reading <hi>Psalms,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the first and second Lessons, being heard in many places with a covered head; but all men sitting bare-headed when the <hi>Psalm</hi> is sung. And to that end, the Parish-Clerk must be taught to call upon the people to sing it <hi>to the Praise and Glory God</hi>; no such preparatory Exhortation being used at the naming of the Chapters or the daily <hi>Psalms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. By these preparatives they hoped in time to bring in the whole body of <hi>Calvinism,</hi> as well in reference to Government, and forms of Worship, as to points of Doctrine. But then they were to stay their time, and not to shew too much at once of the main designe, but rather to divert on some other counsels. The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy was so well fortified by the Law, and the Bishops so setled in their jurisdictions, that it had been a madness to attempt on either, till they should finde themselves increased both in power and number, and that they had some Friend in Court not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to excuse, but defend their actions. In which respect, nothing seemed more expedient to them, then to revive the Quarrels of King <hi>Edwards</hi> time about Caps and Tippets, and other Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Clergy which had not the like Countenance from the Laws of the Land. In which as they assured themselves of all help from the hands of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> so they despaired not of obtaining the like from <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> whensoever it should be required. But as one Wave thrusts another forwards, so this dispute brings in some others, in which the judgement of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> was demanded also; that is to say, concerning the Episcopal Habit, the Patrimony of the Church, the manner of proceedings to be held against Papists, the Perambulation used in the Rogation-Week; with many other points of the like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which Quarrels they pursued for five years together, till the setling of that business by the Book of <hi>Advertisements, Anno</hi> 1565. They also had begun to raise their thoughts unto higher matters then Caps and Tippets: In order whereunto, some of them take upon them in their private Parishes, to ordain set Fasts; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to neglect the observation of the Annual Festivals which were appointed by the Church; some to remove the holy Table from the place of the Altar, and to transpose it to the middle of the Quire or Chancel, that it might serve the more conveniently for the posture of sitting; and others, by the help of some silly Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries, to impose Books of Forreign Doctrine on their several Parishes; that by such Doctrine they might countenance their Actings in the other particulars. All which, with many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations of the like condition, were presently took notice of by the Bishops, and the rest of the Queens Commissioners; and remedies provided for them in a book of <hi>Orders,</hi> published in the year 1561; or the <hi>Advertisements</hi> before mentioned, about four years after. Such as proceeded in their oppositions after these <hi>Advertisements,</hi> had the name of <hi>Puritans</hi>; as men that did profess a greater <hi>Purity</hi> in the Worship of God, a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54836:133"/>
of the Ceremonies and Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then the rest of their brethren: under which name were comprehended, not onely those which hitherto had opposed the Churches Vestments, but also such as afterwards endeavoured to destroy the Liturgy, and subvert the Goverment.</p>
            <p n="18">18. In all this time they could obtain no countenance from the hands of this State, though it was once endeavoured for them by the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> (whom they had gained to their Patron.) But it was onely to make use of them as a counterpoise to the Popish party, at such time as the Marriage was in agitation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lord <hi>Henry Stewart</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> if any thing should be attempted by them to disturb the Kingdom; the fears whereof, as they were onely taken up upon politick ends, so the intended favours to the opposite Faction vanished also wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h them. But on the contrary, we finde the State severe enough against their proceedings, even to the deprivation of Dr. <hi>Thomas Sampson,</hi> Dean of <hi>Christ-church.</hi> To which dignity he had been unhappily preferred in the first year of the Queen; and being looked upon as head of this Faction, was worthily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived thereof by the Queens Commissioners. They found by this severity what they were to trust to, if any thing were practised by them against the Liturgy, the Doctrine of the Church, or the publick Government. It cannot be denyed, but <hi>Goodman, Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, Whittingham,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Genevian</hi> Conventicle, were very much grieved, at their return, that they could not bear the like sway here in their several Consistories, as did <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> at <hi>Geneva</hi>; so that they not onely repined and grudged at the Reformation which was made in this Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not fitted to their Fancies, and to <hi>Calvins</hi> Plat-form; but have laboured to sow those Seeds of Heterodoxy and Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which afterwards brought forth those troubles and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which ensued upon it. But being too wise to put their own Fingers in the fire, they presently fell upon a course which was sure to speed, without producing any danger to themselues or their party. They could not but remember those many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which <hi>Iohn Alasco</hi> and his Church of strangers afforded to the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Gospellers, in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi>; and they despaired not of the like, nor of greater neither, if a <hi>French</hi> Church were setled upon <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Principles in some part of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. For the advancement of this project, <hi>Calvin</hi> directs his Letters unto Bishop <hi>Grindal,</hi> newly preferred unto that See, that by his countenance or connivance, such of the <hi>French</hi> Nation as for their Conscience had been forced to flee into <hi>England,</hi> might be permitted the Free Exercise of their Religion: whose leave being easily obtained, for the great reverence which he bares to the name of <hi>Calvin,</hi> they made the like use of some Friends which they had in the Court. By whose sollicitation they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the Church of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> not far from <hi>Merchant-taylors-Hall,</hi>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:54836:133"/>
then being of no present use for Religious Offices, to be assigned unto the <hi>French,</hi> with liberty to erect the <hi>Genevian</hi> Discipline, for ordering the Affairs of their Congregation, and to set up a Form of Prayer which had no manner of conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the English Liturgy. Which what else was it in effect, but a plain giving up of the Cause at the first demand, which afterwards was contended for with such opposition? what else but a Foundation to that following Anarchy which was designed to be obtruded on the Civil Government? For certainly, the tolerating of Presbytery in a Church founded and established by the Rules of Episcopacie, could end in nothing but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of a Commonwealth in the midst of a Monarchy. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> perceived this well enough, and thereupon gave <hi>Grindal</hi> thanks for his favour in it, of whom they after served themselves upon all occasions; a <hi>Dutch</hi>-Church being after setled on the same Foundation in the <hi>Augustine Fryars,</hi> where <hi>Iohn Alasco</hi> held his Congregation in the Reign of King <hi>Edward.</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences whereof were not seen at the first; and when they were perceived, were not easily remedied. For the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of which ends, there was no man more like to serve them with the Queen, then Sir <hi>Francis Knollis</hi>; who having Married a Daughter of the Lord <hi>Cary</hi> of <hi>Hunsdon,</hi> the Queens Cosin-German, was made Comptroller of the Houshold, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in good Credit and Authority with her upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. And being also one of those who had retired from <hi>Frankfort</hi> to <hi>Geneva</hi> in the time of the Schism, did there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a great acquaintance with <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and the rest of the Consistorians, whose cause he managed at the Court upon all occasions; though afterwards he gave place to the Earl of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> as their Principal Agent.</p>
            <p n="20">20. But the <hi>Genevians</hi> will finde work enough to imploy them both; and having gained their ends, will put on for more. The Isles of <hi>Guernsey</hi> and <hi>Iarsey,</hi> the onely remainder of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Normandy,</hi> had entertained the Reformation in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi>; by whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the publick Liturgy had been turned into <hi>French,</hi> that it might serve them in those Islands for their Edifications. But the Reformed Religion being suppressed in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> revived again immediately after her decease, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of such <hi>French</hi> Ministers as had resorted thither for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in the day of their troubles. In former times these Islands belonged unto the jurisdiction of the Bishop of <hi>Constance,</hi> who had in each of them a Subordinate Officer, mixt of a Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor and Arch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But these <hi>French</hi> Ministers desiring to have all things modelled by the Rules of <hi>Calvin,</hi> endeavoured
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54836:134"/>
by all the Friends they could to advance his Discipline; to which they were incouraged by the brothers here, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors there. The Governours in each Island advanced the project, out of a covetous intent to inrich themselves by the spoil of the Deanries; the brethren have hereupon a hope to gain ground by little and little, for the erecting of the same in most parts of <hi>England.</hi> And in pursuance of this plot, both Islands joyn in confederacy to petition the Queen for an allowance of this Discipline, <hi>Anno</hi> 1563. In the year next following, the <hi>Signiour de St. Owen</hi> and <hi>Monsieur de Soulemount</hi> were dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to the Court to sollicite in it; where they received a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious answer, and full of hopes returned to their several homes. In the mean time, the Queen being strongly perswaded that this designe would much advance the Reformation in those Islands, was contented to give way unto it, in the Towns of St. <hi>Peters Port</hi> and St. <hi>Hillaries</hi> only, but no further. To which purpose there were Letters decretory from the Council, directed to the <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff,</hi> the <hi>Iurates,</hi> and others of each Island; subscribed by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; the Marquess of <hi>Northampton</hi>; the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi>; the Lord <hi>Clynton,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne; Rogers, Knollis</hi> and <hi>Cecil.</hi> The Tenour of which Letter in relation to the Isle of <hi>Iarsey,</hi> was this that followeth.</p>

The news of which severity flies to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>; occasioning <hi>Beza</hi> in the one, and <hi>Knox</hi> and his Comrades in the other, to interpose themselves in behalf of their brethren. With what Authority <hi>Beza</hi> acted in it, we shall see anon. And we may now take notice, that in <hi>Knoxes</hi> Letter, sent from the general Assembly of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Vestments in dispute are not onely called <hi>Trifles</hi> and <hi>Rags</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> but are discountenanced and decryed, <hi>for being such Garments as Idolaters in time of greatest darkness, used in their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious and idolatrous service:</hi> &amp; thereupon it is inferred, That <hi>if Surplice, Cap and Tippet have been badges of Idolaters in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of their Idolatry, that then the Preachers of Christian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Rebukers of Superstition, were to have nothing to do with the dregs of that Romish beast.</hi> Which inference is second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Request, <hi>viz. That the Brethren in</hi> England <hi>which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused those</hi> Romish Rags, <hi>might finde of them (the Bishops) who use and urge them, such favour, as their Head and Master commandeth each one of his Members to shew to another. And this they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to receive of their courtesie, not onely because they hoped that they, the said Bishops, would not offend God in troubling their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren for such</hi> Vain trifles; <hi>but because they hoped that they would not refuse the request of them, their Brethren and fellow-Ministers; in whom, though there appeared no</hi> worldly Pomp, <hi>yet they assured themselves, that they were esteemed the</hi> servants of God, <hi>and such as travelled to set forth Gods Glory against the</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ <hi>of</hi> Rome, that conjured enemy of true Religion, the Pope. <hi>The days,</hi> say they, <hi>are evil, iniquity abounds, charity (alas) waxeth cold; and therefore that it concerned them all to walk diligently, because it was uncertain at what hour the Lord would come, to whom they were to render an account of their Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.</hi> After which Apostolical Admonition, they commit them to the Mighty protection of the Lord Jesus Christ. And so we conclude their Zealous Letter, dated <hi>December</hi> 27. 1566.</p>

With more Authority writes <hi>Beza,</hi> as the greater Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch; and he writes too concerning things of greater consequence then Caps and Surplices. For in a Letter of his to <hi>Grindal,</hi> bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing date <hi>Iuly, anno</hi> 1566, he makes a sad complaint concerning certain Ministers, <hi>unblameable</hi> (as he saith) <hi>both in life and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, suspended from the Ministery by the Queens Authority, and the good liking of the Bishops, for not subscribing to some new Rites and Ceremonies imposed upon them.</hi> Amongst which Rites, he specifies the <hi>wearing of such Vestments as were then worn by</hi> Baals <hi>Priests in the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>the Cross in Baptism, kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Communion, and such Rites, as had</hi> degenerated <hi>(as he tell us)</hi> into most filthy Superstition. But he seems more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, <hi>that Women were suffered to baptize in extreme necessities: That power was granted to the Queen for ordaining such other Rites and Ceremonies as should seem convenient; but most especially,</hi> (which was indeed the point most grieved at) <hi>that the Bishops were invested with a sole Authority for all matters of the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consulting with the Pastors of particular flocks.</hi> He was too well versed in the Writings of the Ancient Fathers, as not to know that all the things which he complains of, were approved and practiced in the best and happiest times of Christianity; as might be otherwise made apparent out of the Writings of <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Hierome, Chrysostome</hi>; and indeed who not? But <hi>Beza</hi> has a word for this. For first he blames the Ancient Fathers for borrowing many of their Ceremonies from the Jews and Gentiles, though done by them out of a good and honest purpose; that <hi>being all things to all men,</hi> they might gain the more. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he gives this Rule, <hi>That all such Rites as had been borrowed either from the Iew or Gentile without express Warrant from Christ or the holy Apostles, as also all other significant Ceremonies, which had been brought into the Church against right and reason, should be immediately removed, or otherwise the Church could never be restored to her Native Beauty.</hi> Which Rule of his, if once admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there must be presently an end of all external Decency and Order in the Worship of God, and every man might be left to serve him, both for time and place, and every particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in that Sacred action, as to him seemed best. And what a horrible confusion must needs grow thereby, not onely in a whole National Church, but in every particular Congregation, be it never so small, is no hard matter to conceive.</p>

At the Reforming of this Church, not onely the Queens Chappel, and all Cathedrals, but many Parochial Churches also had preserved their Organs; to which they used to sing the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Hymns; that is to say, the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> the <hi>Benedictus,</hi> the <hi>Magnificat,</hi> the <hi>Nunc Dimittis, &amp;c.</hi> performed in an Artificial and Melodious manner, with the addition of Cornets, Sackbuts, and the like, on the Solemn Festivals.

At first, they sung them onely in their private houses, and afterwards (as beforesaid) adventured to sing them also in the Church, as in the way of entertainment, to take up the time till the beginning of the Service, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to sing them as a part of the Service it self. For so I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that passage in the <hi>Church Historian,</hi> in which he tells us, That Dr. <hi>Gervis</hi> being then Warden of <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge, had abolished certain Latine superstitious Hymns which had been used on some of the Festivals, appointing the <hi>Psalms</hi> in English to be sung in their place; and that as one <hi>Leech</hi> was ready to begin the <hi>Psalm,</hi> another of the Fellows called <hi>Hall,</hi> snatched the book out of his hands, and told him, <hi>That they could no more dance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his pipe.</hi> But whatsoever <hi>Hall</hi> thought of them, <hi>Beza</hi> and his Disciples were persw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that he might the better cry down that Melodious Harmony which was retained in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and so make way for the <hi>Genevian</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion even in that point also; he tells us in the same Letter to Bishop <hi>Gryndal, That the Artificial Musick then retained in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>was fitter to be used in Masks and Dancings, then Religious Offices; and rather served to please the ear, then to move the affections.</hi> Which censure being pass'd upon it by so great a <hi>Rabby,</hi> most wonderful it was how suddenly some men of good note and quality, who otherwise deserved well enough of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> did bend their wits and pens against it; and with what earnestness they laboured to have their own Tunes publickly introduced into all the Churches.

otherwise then to them seemed good: And rather to deprive many hungry souls of their heavenly food, then give them leave to receive it otherwise then upon their knees.</hi> And this being said, he questions the Authority of the Supreme Magistrate, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Word of God, and the Ancient Canons, for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining any new Rites and Ceremonies in a Church established; but much more the Authority ascribed to Bishops, in ordering any thing which concerned the Church, without calling the Presbytery to advise about it, and having their approbation in it. This was indeed the point most aimed at. And to this point his followers take the courage to drive on amain; the Copies of this Letter being presently dispersed for their greater comfort, if not also printed. Some of the brethren, in their zeal to the name of <hi>Calvin,</hi> preferred him once before S. <hi>Paul</hi>; and <hi>Beza</hi> out of question would have took it ill, if he had been esteemed of less Authority then any of those who claimed to be Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors to S. <hi>Peter.</hi> And therefore it were worth the while to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Epistles of these men, with those of Pope <hi>Leo</hi>; and then to enter seriously into consideration, whether of the two took more upon him; either Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> where he might pretend to some command; or <hi>Beza,</hi> where he had no authority to act at all. How much more moderate and discreet were the most eminent men for Learning amongst the <hi>Zwitzers,</hi> may appear by the example of <hi>Gualter</hi> and <hi>Bullinger,</hi> no way inferior unto the other, but in Pride and Arrogancy; who being desired by some of the English Zealots to give their judgement in the point of the Churches Vestments, returned their approbation of them; but sent it in a Letter directed to <hi>Horn, Sandys</hi> and <hi>Grindal,</hi> to let them see, that they would not intermeddle in the affairs of this Church without their privity and advice.

But first they must prepare the matter, and remove all doubts which otherwise might interrupt them in the course of their building. And herein <hi>Beza</hi> is consulted as the Master-Workman. To him they send their several scruples; and he returns such answer to them, as did not onely confirm them in their present obstinacy, but fitted and prepared them for the following Schism. To those before, they add the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Ministers, and their ordaining by the Bishops; neither the Presbyterie being consulted, nor any particular place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their Ministration. Which he condemns as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Word of God and the ancient Canons; but so, that he conceives it better to have such a Ministery, then none at all; praying withal, that God would give this Church a more lawful Ministery (the Church was much beholding to him for his zeal the while) in his own good time. Concerning the <hi>Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories</hi> proposed to Infants in their Baptism, he declares it to be onely <hi>a corruption of the ancient Form,</hi> which was used in

the baptizing persons of riper years. And thereupon desires as heartily as before, <hi>That as the Church had laid aside the use of</hi> Oyl, <hi>and the old Rite of</hi> Exorcising, <hi>though retained at</hi> Rome; <hi>so they would also abdicate those</hi> foolish and unnecessary Interrogations <hi>which are made to Infan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This he acknowledgeth of it self for a thing indifferent; but so, that ordinary leavened bread is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before it, as being more agreeable to the Institution of our Lord and Saviour. And yet he could not chuse but grant, that Christ administred the Sacrament in unleavened bread, no other being to be used by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> at the time of the Passover. He dislikes also the deciding of Civil causes (by which he means those of Tythes, Marriages, and the Last-Wills or Testaments of men deceased) in the Bishops Courts; but more, that the Bishops Chancellors did take upon them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree any Excommunication without the approbation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Presbyters. Whose acts therein, he Majestically pronounceth to be void and <hi>null,</hi> not to oblige the Conscience of any man in the sight of God; and otherwise, to be a foul and shameful prophanation of the Churches Censures.</p>

And whether out of a desire of Reformation (which pretence had gilded many a rotten post) or for singularity sake and Innovation, they openly questioned the received Discipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the same, together with the Publick Liturgie, and the Calling of Bishops, as savouring too much of the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Against which they frequently protested in their Pulpits; affirming, <hi>That it was an impious thing to hold any correspondency with the Church</hi>; and labouring with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence

But now he takes notice of the Schism, a manifest defection of some members from the rest of the body; but yet he cannot chuse but tamper with him to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their doings, or otherwise to mitigate the rigour of the Laws in force. For having first besprinkled him with some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation for his zeal to the Gospel, and thanked him for his many favours to the new French Church, he begins roundly, in plain terms, to work him to his own perswasions. He lays be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him first, how great an obstacle was made in the course of Religion, by those petite differences; not onely amongst weak and ignorant, but even Learned men. And then adviseth that some speedy remedy be applied to so great a mischief, by calling an Assembly of such Learned and Religious men as were least contentious; of which he hoped to be the chief, if that work went forwards: With this Proviso notwithstanding, That nothing should be ordered and determined by them, with reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ancient or Modern usages; but that all Popish Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies being first abolished, they should proceed to the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of such a Form of Ministration in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as might be grounded on some express Authorities of the Word of God. Which as he makes to be a work agreeable

            <p n="30">30. Nor were these years less fatal to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by the defection of the Papists, who till this time had kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in her Communion, and did in general as punctually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend all Divine Offices in the same, as the vulgar Protestants. And it is probable enough, that they might have held out lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in their due obedience, if first, the scandal which was given by the other Faction, and afterwards the separation which ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it, had not took them off. The Liturgie of the Church had been exceedingly well fitted to their approbation, by leaving out an offensive passage against the Pope; restoring the old Form of words, accustomably used in the participation of the holy Sacrament; the total expunging of a Rubrick, which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make a Question of the <hi>Real presence</hi>; the Scituation of the holy-Table in the place of the Altar; the Reverend posture of kneeling at it, or before it, by all Communicants; the retaining of so many of the ancient Festivals; and finally, by the Vestments used by the Priest or Minister in the Ministration. And so long as all things continued in so good a posture, they saw no caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of separating from the rest of their Brethren in the acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. But when all decency and order was turned out of the Church, by the heat and indiscretion of these new Reformers; the holy-Table brought into the midst of the Church like a common-Table; the Communicants in some places sitting at it with as little Reverence as at any ordinary Table; the ancient Fasts and Feasts deserted, and Church-Vestments thrown aside, as the remainders of the Superstition of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> they then began visibly to decline from their first conformity. And yet they made no general separation, nor defection neither, till the <hi>Genevian</hi> brethren had first made the Schism, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chose to meet in Barns and Woods, yea, and common Fields, then to associate with their brethren, as in former times. For, that they did so, is affirmed by very good Authors, who much bemoaned the sad condition of the Church, in having her bowels torn in pieces by those very Children which she had cherished in her bosom. By one of which, who must needs be of years and judgement at the time of this Schism, we are first told what great contentions had been raised in the first ten years of her Majesties Reign, through the peevish frowardness, the out-cryes of such as came from <hi>Geneva</hi> against the Vestments of the Church, and such like matters. And then he adds, That being crossed in their desires touching those particulars, they separated from the rest of their Congregations; and meeting together in Houses, Woods, and common Fields, kept there their most unlawful and disorderly Conventicles.</p>

the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction had first made the Schism, <hi>Harding</hi> and <hi>Sanders,</hi> and some others of the Popish Fugitives, imployed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as busily in perswading those of that Religion to the like temptation: For being licensed by the Pope to exercise Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal jurisdiction in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> they take upon them to absolve all such in the Court of Conscience, who should return to the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; as also to dispense in Causes of irregularity, except it were incurred by wilful murther; and finally, from the like irregularities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred by Heresie, if the party who desired the benefit of the Absolution, abstain'd from Ministring at the holy Altar for three years together. By means whereof, and the advantages before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned which were given them by the <hi>Puritan Faction,</hi> they drew many to them from the Church, both Priests and People; their numbers every day increasing, as the scandal did. And finding how the Sectaries inlarged their numbers by erecting a <hi>French</hi> Church in <hi>London,</hi> and that they were now upon the point of procuring another for the use and comfort of the <hi>Dutch</hi>; they thought it no ill piece of Wisdom to attempt the like in some convenient place near <hi>England,</hi> where they might train up their Disciples, and fit them for imployment upon all occasions. Upon which ground, a Seminary is established for them at <hi>Doway</hi> in <hi>Flanders, Anno</hi> 1568; and another not long after at <hi>Rhemes</hi> a City of <hi>Champaigne</hi> in the Realm of <hi>France.</hi> Such was the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which redounded to the Church of <hi>England</hi> by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness of the Brethren of this first separation, that it occasioned the like Schism betwixt her and the Papists, who till that time had kept themselves in her Communion, as before was said. For that the Papists generally did frequent the Church in these first ten years, is positively affirmed by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in his Speech at the Arraignment of <hi>Garnet</hi> the Jesuit, and afterward at the Charge which was given by him at the general Assizes held in <hi>Norwich.</hi> In both which he speaks on his own certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, not on vulgar hearsay; affirming more particularly, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e had many times seen <hi>Bedenfield, Cornwallis,</hi> and some other of the Leading <hi>Romanists,</hi> at the Divine Service of the Church, who afterwards were the first that departed from it. The like averred by the most Learned Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> in his Book called <hi>Tortura Torti, p.</hi> 130. and there asserted undeniably against all opposition. And which may serve instead of all, we finde the like affirmed also by the Queen her self, in her Instructions given to <hi>Walsingham,</hi> then being her Resident with the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Anno</hi> 1570. In which Instructions, bearing date on the 11 of <hi>August,</hi> it is affirmed expresly of the Heads of that party, and therefore we may judge the like of the Members also, that <hi>they did ordinarily resort, from the beginning of her Reign, in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen places, to the Churches, and to Divine Service in the Church, without any contradiction, or shew of misliking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="32">32. The parallel goes further yet. For as the <hi>Puritans</hi> were
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:54836:138"/>
encouraged to this separation by the Missals and Decretory Letters of <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1569.</note> whom they beheld as the chief Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of this Church: So were the Papists animated to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by a Bull of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth, whom they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged most undoubtedly for the Head of theirs. For the Pope being thrust on by the importunity of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> whose Title they preferred before that of <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; and by the Court of <hi>France,</hi> in hatred to the Queen her self, for aiding the <hi>French Hugonots</hi> against their King, was drawn at last to issue out this Bull against her, dated at <hi>Rome Feb.</hi> 24. 1569. In which Bull he doth not onely Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate her person, deprive her of her Kingdoms, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve all her Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all her Subjects, of what sort soever, not to obey her Laws, Injunctions, Ordinances or Acts of State. The Defection of the Papists had before been voluntary, but is now made necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the Popes command being superadded to the scandal which had before been given them by the <hi>Puritan Faction.</hi> For after this, the going or not going to Church was commonly reputed by them for a signe distinctive, by which a Roman Catholick might be known from an English Heretick. And this appears most plainly by the Preamble to the Act of Parliament <hi>against bringing or executing of Bulls from</hi> Rome, 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 2. Where it is reckoned amongst the effects of those Bulls and Writings, <hi>That those who brought them, did by their lewd practices and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile perswasions work so farforth, that sundry people, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant persons have been contented to be reconciled to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and to have withdrawn and absented themselves from all Divine Service, most godlily exercised in this Realm.</hi> By which it seems, that till the roaring of those Bulls, those of the Popish party did frequent the Church, though not so generally in the last five years (as our Learned <hi>Andrews</hi> hath observed) as they did the first, before they were discouraged by the Innovations of the <hi>Puritan Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="33">33. But for their coming to our Churches for the first ten years, that is to say, before the first beginning of the <hi>Puritan Schism,</hi> there is enough acknowledged by some of their own. <hi>Parsons</hi> himself confesseth, in his Pamphlet which he calls by the name of <hi>Green-Coat, That for twelve years together the Court and State was in great quiet, and no question made about Religion.</hi> Brierly in his <hi>Apologie</hi> speaks it more at large: by whom it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, <hi>That in the beginning of the Queens Reign, most part of the Catholicks for many years did go to the Heretical Churches and Service: That when the better and truer opinion was taught them by Priests and Religious men from beyond the Seas as more perfect and necessary, there wanted not many which opposed themselves of the elder sort of Priests of Queen</hi> Maries <hi>days: and finally, That this division was not onely favoured by the Council, but nourished also for many years by divers troublesome people of their own,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:54836:139"/>
both in teaching and writing.</hi> On which the Author of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, whomsoever he was, hath made this Descant, <hi>viz. That for the Catholicks going to Church, it was perchance rather to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented then blamed, before it came to be a</hi> sign Distinctive, <hi>by which a Catholick was known from one who was no Catholick.</hi> Thus as the Schisms began together, so are they carried on by the self-same means, by Libelling against the State: the Papists, in their <hi>Philopater</hi>; the <hi>Puritans,</hi> in <hi>Martin Mar-Prelate,</hi> and the rest: by breeding up their novices beyond the Seas; the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, at <hi>Rheims</hi> and <hi>Doway</hi>; the Presbyterians, at <hi>Geneva, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam</hi> or <hi>Saumure</hi>: by raising sedition in the State, and plotting Treason against the person of the Queen; the Papists, by <hi>Throgmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Parry, Tichbourn, Babington,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Puritans,</hi> by <hi>Thacker, Penry, Hacket, Coppinger,</hi> &amp;c. And finally, by the executions made upon either part; of which, in reference to the Presbyterians, we shall speak hereafter. But as none of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Parallels is so exact, but that some difference may be noted, and is noted by him, betwixt the persons and affairs of whom he writes; so was there a great difference in one particular between the fortunes of the Papists and the contrary faction. The Presbyterians were observed to have many powerful Friends at Court, in which the Papists had scarce any but mortal Enemies. Spies and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencers were employed to attend the Papists, and observe all their words and actions; so that they could not stir without a discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But all mens eyes were shut upon the other party, so that they might do what they listed without observation. Of which no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can be given, but that the Queen being startled at the Popes late Bull, and finding both her Person and Estate indangered, under divers pretences, by many of the Romish party, both at home and abroad, might either take no notice of the lesser mischief, or suffer that faction to grow up to confront the other.</p>
            <p n="34">34. And now comes <hi>Cartwright</hi> on the Stage, on which he acted more then any of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, till their last going off again in the Reign of this Queen. It was upon a discontent that he first left <hi>Cambridge</hi>; and in pursuance of the same, that he left the Church. For being appointed one of the Opponents at the Divinity-Act in <hi>Cambridge, Anno</hi> 1564, at such time as the Queen was pleased to honor it with her Royal presence; he came not off so happily in her esteem, but that <hi>Preston</hi> of <hi>Kings Colledge</hi> for action, voyce and elocution, was preferred before him. This so afflicted the proud man, that in a sudden humour he retires from the University, and sets up his studies in <hi>Geneva,</hi> where he became as great with <hi>Beza,</hi> and the rest of that Consistory, as ever <hi>Knox</hi> had been with <hi>Calvin</hi> at his being there. As soon as he had well acquainted himself with the Form of their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and studied all such points as were to be reduced to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice at his coming back, well stocked with Principles, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Instructions, he prepares for <hi>England,</hi> and puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into his Colledge. Before, upon the apprehension of the
<pb facs="tcp:54836:139"/>
said neglect, he had begun to busie himself with some discourses against the Ecclesiastical Government then by Law established; and seemed to entertain a great opinion of himself, both for Learning and Holiness; and therewithal a great contemner of such others as continued not with him. But at his coming from <hi>Geneva,</hi> he became more practical, or pragmatical rather, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Vocation of Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, and other <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Officers; the Administration of our holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and observations of our Rites and Ceremonies. And buzzing these conceits into the Heads of divers young Preachers and Scholars of the University, he drew after him a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Disciples and Followers. Amongst whom he prevailed so far by his secret practices, but much more by a Sermon which he Preached one Sunday-morning in the Colledge-Chappel, that in the afternoon all the Fellows and Scholars threw aside their Surplices (which by the Statutes of the House they were bound to use) and went to the Divine Service onely in their Gowns and Caps. Dr. <hi>Iohn Whitgift</hi> was at that time Master of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge, and the Queens Professor for Divinity; a man of great temper and moderation, but one withal that knew well how to hold the Reins, and not suffer them to be wrested out of his hand by an Head-strong beast. <hi>Cartwright</hi> was Fellow of that Colledge, emulous of the Masters Learning, but far more envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at the Credit and Authority which he had acquired: for which cause he procured himself to be chosen the Professor for the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> that he might come as near to him as he could, both in place and power. But not content with that which he had done in the Colledge, he puts up his Disciples into all the Pulpits in the University, where he and they inveigh most bitterly against the Government of the Church, and the Governours of it; the Ordination of Priests and Deacons, the Liturgie established, and the Rites thereof. And though <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi> Preached them down as occasion served with great applause unto himself, but greater satisfaction to all moderate and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men; yet <hi>Cartwright</hi> and his Followers were now grown unto such a head, that they became more violent by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
            <p n="32">32. It hapneth commonly, as a Learned man hath well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, That <hi>those fervent Reprehenders of things established by publick Authority, are always confident and bold spirited men</hi>; and such as will not easily be taken off from their prosecutions by any fair and gentle usage. Which <hi>Whitgift</hi> found at last, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his patience; insomuch, that having many times in vain endeavoured, by gentle Admonitions and fair perswasions, to gain the man unto himself, or so to moderate and restrain him, as that he should no longer trouble both that Colledge and the whole University with his dangerous Doctrines; he was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated in the end to expel him out of the House, and after to deprive him also of the <hi>Margaret</hi>-Lecture. Which last he acted
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:54836:140"/>
as Vice-chancellor upon this account, that he had delivered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers errors in his Lectures, which he had neither recanted as he was required, nor so expounded as to free himself from that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; and that withal he had exercised the Function of a Minister, without being able to produce any Letters of Orders. Hereupon <hi>Cartwright</hi> and his Followers began to mouth it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that the man had been mightily wronged, in being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his preferments in the University, without being called unto his answer; that <hi>Cartwright</hi> had made many offers of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for tryal of the points in Question, but could never be heard; and therefore that <hi>Whitgift</hi> supplyed this by excess of power, which he was not able to make good by defect of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. To stop which clamour, <hi>Whitgift</hi> not onely offered him the opportunity of a Conference with him, but offered it in the presence of sufficient witnesses; and put the man so hard unto it, that he not onely declined the Conference at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but confest that <hi>Whitgift</hi> had made him the like offers formerly, and that he had refused the same, as he now did also. All which appears by a Certificate, subscribed by eight sufficient Witnesses, and a publick Notary, dated the 18 of <hi>March</hi> 1570. But this disgrace was followed by a greater, much about that time: for finding himself in a necessity to depart from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he would have taken the degree of Doctor along with him for his greater credit, but was denyed by the major part of the Regent Masters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and others which had votes therein; which so displeased both him and all his adherents, that from this time the Degrees of Doctors, Batchellors and Masters were esteemed unlawful, and those that took them reckoned for the Limbs of Antichrist, as appears by the <hi>Genevian</hi> Notes on the <hi>Revel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion.</hi> But for this, and all the other wrongs which he had suffered (as was said) in the University, he will revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the Church in convenient time; and in convenient time we shall hear more of it.</p>
            <p n="36">36. In the mean season, we must make a step to <hi>Banst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> where we shall finde a knot of more Zealous <hi>Calvinists,</hi> then in other places; so Zealous and conceited of their own dear Sanctity, that they separated themselves from the rest of their brethren, under the name of <hi>the Anoynted.</hi> The Bond of Peace was broken by the rest before, and these men meant not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the unity of spirit with them, as they had done formerly. Their Leader was one <hi>Wright</hi>; their Opinions these, <hi>viz. That no man is to be accused of sin, but he that did reject the truths by them professed. That the whole New Testament contained nothing but predictions of things to come; and therefore that Christ (whom they grant to have appeared in the flesh before) shall come before the Day of Iudgement, and actually perform those things which are there related: That he whose sins are once pardoned, cannot sin again: And that no credit was to be afforded to men of Learning, but all things to be taught by the Spirit onely.</hi> Of these men

               <hi>Sanders</hi> tells us in his Book <hi>De visibile Monarchia,</hi> Fol. 707, and placeth them in this present year 1570. But what became of them, I finde not there, or in any others. And therefore I conceive, that either they were soon worn out for want of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or lost themselves amongst the <hi>Anabaptists, Familists,</hi> or some other. And this I look upon as one of the first Factions amongst the <hi>Puritans</hi> themselves, after they had begun their separation from the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Which separation, so begun as before is said, was closed again about this time by the hands of those who first had laboured in the breach.</p>
            <p n="37">37. For so it was, that either out of love to their own profit, or the publick peace, some of them had consulted <hi>Beza</hi> touching this particular; that is to say, <hi>Whether he thought it more expedient for the good of the Church, That the Ministers should chuse rather to forsake their Flocks, then to conform unto such Orders as were then prescribed.</hi> Whereunto he returns this Answer: <hi>That many things both may and ought to be obeyed, which are not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably commanded: That though the Garments in dispute were not imposed upon the Church by any warrant from the Word of God; yet having nothing of impiety in them, he conceived that it were fitter for the Ministers to conform themselves, then either voluntarily to forsake their Churches, or be deprived for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal: That in like manner the people were to be advised to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Churches, and hear their Pastors so apparelled as the Church required, rather then utterly to forsake that spiritual food, by which their souls were to be nourished to eternal life: But so, that first the Ministers do discharge their Consciences, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a modest protestation against those Vestments, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Queens Majesty, as their several Bishops; and so apply themselves to suffer what they could not remedy.</hi> This might have stopt the breach at the first beginning, if either the English <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> had not been too hot upon it, to be cooled so suddenly, or that he had not made his own good counsel ineffectual in the close of all: In which he tells them in plain terms, <hi>That if they could no otherwise preserve their standing in the Church, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by subscribing to the lawfulness of the Orders, Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies which were then required, or by giving any countenance to them by a faulty silence; they should then finally give way to that open violence which they were not able to resist</hi>; that is to say, (for so I understand his meaning) that they should rather leave their Churches, then submit themselves to such conditions. But this direction being given toward the end of <hi>October, Anno</hi> 1567, seems to be qualified in his Epistle to the Brethren of the Forreign Churches which were then in <hi>England,</hi> bearing date <hi>Iune</hi> the fifth in the year next following; in which he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves the case proposed unto him: <hi>That for avoiding all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive ruptures in the body of Christ, by dividing the members thereof from one another, it was not lawful for any man, of what Rank soever, to separate himself, upon any occasion, from the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54836:141"/>
Church of Christ, in which the Doctrine is preserved whereby the people are instructed in the ways of God, and the right use of the Sacraments ordained by Christ is maintained invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="38">38. This might, I say, have stopped the breach in the first beginning, had not the English <hi>Puritans</hi> been resolved to try some conclusions before they hearkned to the Premises. But finding that their party was not strong enough to bear them out, or rich enough to maintain them on their private purses, they thought it not amiss to follow the directions of their great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator. And hereunto the breaking out of those in <hi>Surrey</hi> gave some further colour, by which, they say, that nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion must needs fall upon them; and that so many Factions, Subdivisions, and Schismatical Ruptures, as would inevitably ensue on the first separation, must in fine crumble them to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And on these grounds it was determined to unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the main body of the Church, to reap the profit of the same; and for their safer standing in it, to take as well their Orders as their Institution from the hands of the Bishops. But so, that they would neither wear the Surplice oftner then meer necessity compelled them, or read more of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayers then what they thought might save them harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less if they should be questioned; and in the mean time by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to bring in that Discipline, which could not be advanced at once, in all parts of the Kingdom. Which half Conformity they were brought to on the former grounds; and partly by an Act of Parliament which came out this year, 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 12. for the reforming of disorders amongst the Ministers of the Church. And they were brought unto no more then a half-Conformity, by reason of some clashing which appeared unto them, between the Canons of the Convocation, and that Act of Parliament; as also in regard of some interposings which are now made in their behalf, by one of a greater Title, though of no more power, then <hi>Calvin, Martyr, Beza,</hi> or the rest of the Advocates.</p>
            <p n="39">39. The danger threatned to the Queen, by the late sentence of Excommunication which was past against her, occasioned her to call the Lords and Commons to assemble in Parliament, the Bishops and Clergy to convene in their Convocation. These last accordingly met together in the Church of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> on the 5 of <hi>April</hi> 1571. At which time Dr. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> Master of <hi>Trinity</hi>-Colledge in <hi>Gambridge,</hi> preached the Latine Sermon. In which he insisted most especially, upon the Institution and Authority of Synodical Meetings, on the necessary use of Ecclesiastical Vestments, and other Ornaments of the Church; the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition made against all Orders formerly Established, as well by <hi>Puritans</hi> as <hi>Papists</hi>; touching in fine on many other particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, in rectifying whereof the care and diligence of the Synod was by him required. And as it proved, his counsel was not
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54836:141"/>
given in vain. For the first thing which followed the Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prolocutor, was a command given by the Archbishop, <hi>That all such of the lower House of Convocation, who not had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly subscribed unto the Articles of Religion agreed upon</hi> Anno 1562, <hi>should subscribe them now; or on their absolute refusal, or procrastinations, be expelled the House.</hi> Which wrought so well, that the said Book of Articles being publickly read, was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally approved, and personally subscribed by every Member of both Houses, as appears clearly by the <hi>Ratification</hi> at the end of those Articles. In prosecution of which necessary and prudent course, it was further ordered, <hi>That the Book of Articles so approved, should be put into Print, by the appointment of the Right Reverend Dr.</hi> John Jewel <hi>then Bishop of</hi> Sarum; <hi>and that every Bishop should take a competent number of them, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed in their Visitations, or Diocesan Synods, and to be read four times in every year in all the Parishes of their several and respective Diocesses.</hi> Which questionless might have settled a more perfect Conformity in all parts of the Kingdom, som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Convocation running much that way, if the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had spoke as clearly in it as the Convocation; or if some sinister practice had not been excogitated to pervert those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, in making them to come out imperfect, and consequently deprived of life and vigour, which otherwise they would have carried.</p>
            <p n="40">40. The Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> at that time was of great Authority, and had apparently made himself the head of the Puritan faction. They also had the Earl of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> the Lord <hi>North,</hi> and others in the House of Peers; Sir <hi>Francis Knollis, Walsingham,</hi> and many more in the House of Commons. To which (if <hi>Zanchy</hi> be to be believed, as perhaps he may be) some of the Bishops may be added; who were not willing to tye the Puritans too close to that Subscription by the Act of Parliament, which was required of them by the Acts and Canons of the Convocation. It had been ordered by the Bishops in their Convocation, <hi>That all the Clergy then assembled, should subscribe the Articles.</hi> And it was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the unanimous consent of the Bishops and Clergie, <hi>That none should be admitted from thenceforth unto Holy-Orders, till he had first subscribed the same; and solemnly obliged himself to defend the things therein contained, as consonant in all points to the Word of God,</hi> Can. 1571.

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54836:142"/>
by which Subscription is required indefinitely unto all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; yet did the first Branch seem to have such influence upon all the rest, that it was made to serve the turn of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, whensoever they were called upon to subscribe to the Episcopal Government, the Publick Liturgie of the Church, or the Queens Supremacy.

No purpose either in the Bishops or Clergie to justifie all or any of the passages in the same contained, which have been since made use of by the Disciplinarians, either to countenance some strange Doctrine, or decry some Ceremony; to which he shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Friend or Enemy, as the case might vary.</p>

For whether it were, that they relyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Friends in Court, or that some Lawyers had informed them that by the Statute no Subscription was to be required of them, but only unto points of Doctrine; certain it is, that they were now more insolent and intractable then they had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.

and the report is spread abroad (to gain the greater credit to their own perverseness) that many of the Bishops did as much abominate those Popish Vestments as any of the brethren did. For so writes <hi>Zanchy</hi> a Divine of <hi>Heidelburg,</hi> in his Letters unto Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>September</hi> the second; and writes so by direction from the Prince Elector (whom they had engaged in the cause) out of an hope to take her off from giving any further counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the Bishops in that point of Conformity. To the same purpose he writes also to Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> on the 11 of <hi>September.</hi> Where he informs (as he had been informed himself) <hi>That many of the Ecclesiastical Order would rather chuse to quit their station in the Church, and resign their Offices, then yield to the wearing of those Vestments which had been formerly defiled by such gross Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</hi> He also signifies what he had writ unto the Queen, of whose relenting he could give himself no great assurance; and that he had also been advised to write to some of the Clergie, to the end that they might be perswaded to a present Conformity, rather then deprive the Church of their future Ministery. The prosecution of which work he commends to <hi>Iewel,</hi> that by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing of his Authority, they might be brought to yield to the points proposed, and thereby be continued in the exercise of their Vocation. Which last clause could not chuse but be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding acceptable to that Reverend Prelate; who had shewed himself so earnest for Conformity, in a Sermon preached by him at the Cross, that he incurred some censure for it amongst the brethren. Which put him to this Protestation before his death, <hi>That his last Sermon at S.</hi> Pauls <hi>Cross, and Conference about the Ceremonies and state of the Church, was not to please any man living, nor to grieve his brethren of a contrary opinion; but onely to this end, that neither party might prejudice the other.</hi> But he was able to act nothing in pursuance of <hi>Zanchy</hi>'s motion, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his death within few days after, if not some days before he received that Letter. For on the 22 of the same Moneth, it pleased God to take him to himself; and thereby to deprive the Church of the greatest Ornament which she could boast of in that age.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THe English <hi>Puritans</hi> had hitherto maintained their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel by the Authority of <hi>Calvin,</hi> the sawciness of <hi>Knox,</hi> the bold activities of <hi>Beza,</hi> and the more moderate interposings of some Forreign Divines, whose name was great in all the Churches of the Reformation. But now they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to try it out by their proper valour; to fling away their Bulrushes, and lay by their Crutches, or at the best to make no other use of Out-landish Forces, then as Auxiliaries and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, if the worst should happen. And hitherto they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared onely against Caps and Surplices, or questioned some Rites and Ceremonies in the publick Liturgie which might be thought to have been borrowed from the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But now they are resolved to venture on the Episcopal Government, and to endeavour the erecting of the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> as time and opportunity should make way unto it. Amongst which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54836:144"/>
none more eminent, because none more violent then <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> formerly remembred: <hi>Snape</hi> of <hi>Northampton,</hi> a great stickler for the holy Discipline; and <hi>Feild</hi> a Lecturer in <hi>London,</hi> as ridiculously zealous to advance <hi>Presbytery,</hi> as the most forward in the pack. But <hi>Cartwright</hi> was the man upon whose Parts and Learning they did most depend, and one who both by private Letters, and some Printed Pamphlets, had gained more credit to the side then all the rest. And yet it was amongst his own onely that he gained such credit: For when his Papers had been shewn unto Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> and that the Judgement of that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Learned Prelate was demanded of them, he is said to have returned this answer, That the Arguments therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>were too slight to build up, and too weak to pull down.</hi> And so it proved in the event, when <hi>Cartwrights</hi> whole discourses against the Forms of Government and Publick Worship, here by Law established, came to be seriously debated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For having been long great with Childe of some new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, the Babe comes forth in the beginning of the Parliament which was held in the year 1572, intituled by the name of an <hi>Admonition</hi>; in which, complaint was made of their many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, together with a Declaration of the onely way to redress the same; which they conceived to be no other then the setling of the <hi>Genevian</hi> Platform in all parts of the Kingdom. But the Parliament was so little pleased with the Title, and so much displeased with the matter of the <hi>Admonition,</hi> that the Authors and Preferrers of it were imprisoned by them. But this impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment could lay no Fetters on their spirits, which grew the more exasperated, because so restrained. For towards the end of the Parliament, out comes the <hi>second Admonition,</hi> far more importunate then the first; and it comes out with such a flash of Lightning, and such claps of Thunder, as if Heaven and Earth were presently to have met together. In the first, he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>massed together all those several Arguments which either his reading could afford, or his wit suggest, or any of that party could excogitate for him against the Government of Bishops, the whole body of the English Liturgie, and almost all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Offices in the same contained. And in the second, he not onely justified whatsoever had been found in the first, but chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged the Parliament for not giving it a more gratious wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: For there he tells them in plain terms, <hi>That the State did not shew it self upright, alledge the Parliament what it will: That all honest men should finde lack of equity, and all good Consciences condemn that Court: That it should be easier for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrha <hi>in the day of Iudgement, then for such a Parliament: That there is no other thing to be looked for then some speedy vengeance to light upon the whole Land, let the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. About this time, <hi>Clark, Travers, Gardiner, Barber, Cheston</hi>; and lastly, <hi>Crook</hi> and <hi>Egerton,</hi> joyned themselves to the Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Amongst whom, the handling of such points as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Discipline became very frequent, many motions being made, and some conclusions setled in pursuance of it; but more particularly, it was resolved upon the question, <hi>That for as much as divers Books had been written, and sundry Petitions exhibited to her Majesty, the Parliament, and their Lordships, to little purpose, every man should therefore labour by all means possible to bring the Reformation into the Church.</hi> It was also then and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, <hi>That for the better bringing in of the said holy Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, they should not onely, as well publickly as privately teach it, but by little and little, as well as possibly they might, draw the same into practice.</hi> According to which Resolution, a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery was erected on the 20 of <hi>November,</hi> at a small Village in <hi>Surrey,</hi> called <hi>Wandsworth,</hi> where <hi>Field</hi> had the Incumbencie, or cure of Souls; a place conveniently scituate for the <hi>London</hi>-Brethren, as standing near the bank of the <hi>Thames,</hi> but four miles from the City, and more retired and out of sight then any of their own Churches about the Town. This first Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they indorsed by the name of the <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Wandsworth.</hi> In which the Elders names are agreed on, the manner of the Election declared, the approvers of them mentioned, their Offices agreed on also, and described. And though the Queen might have no notice of this first Establishment, yet she knew very well both by their Preachings and Writings, that they had defamed the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that many of them refused to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at that Form of Worship which had the countenance of the Laws, and had set up a new Form of their own devising: Which moved the Queen to look upon them as men of an unquiet and seditious spirit, greedy of change, intent on the destruction of all things which they found established, and ready once again to break out into open Schism. For the preventing whereof, she gave command, <hi>That the severity of the Laws for keeping up the Vniformity of Gods Publick Worship, should be forthwith put in execution: And that all such scandalous Books and Pamphlets (the first and second</hi> Admonition <hi>amongst the rest) should ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be immediately delivered to some Bishop in their several Diocesses, or to some one or other of the Lords of the Council, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of imprisonment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. This Proclamation much amazed the Disciplinarians, who were not onely more sollicitous in searching into the true Cause and Originial of it, then ready to execute their vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all such Councellors as they suspected for the Authors. Sir <hi>Christopher Hatton</hi> was at that time in especial favour, Vice-chamberlain, Captain of the Guard, and aftewards Lord-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor

also; in the whole course of his preferments, of a known aversness to the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and consequently no friend to the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction. This obstacle must be removed one way or other, according to that Principle of the ancient <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> for murthering any man of what Rank soever which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed their Practices. This Office <hi>Burchet</hi> undertakes; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes the Office upon this Opinion, that it was lawful to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassinate any man who opposed the Gospel. But being blind with too much light, he mistook the man; and meeting in the Street with <hi>Hawkins,</hi> one of the greatest Sea-Captains of the times he lived in, he stabbed him desperately with a Ponyard, conceiving that it had been <hi>Hatton</hi> their professed Enemy. For which committed to the Tower, he was there examined, found to hold many dangerous and erronious Tenents; and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sent Prisoner to the <hi>Lollards</hi>-Tower. From thence being called into the Consistory of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> before the Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and divers others, and by them examined, he still persist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his errors, till the sentence of death was ready on the 4 of <hi>November</hi> to be pronounced against him as an Heretick. Through the perswasions of some men, who took great pains with him, he made a shew as if he had renounced and abjured those Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions for erronious and damnable, which formerly he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with so strong a passion. From thence returned unto the Tower by the Lords of the Council, he took an opportunity when one of his Keepers was withdrawn, to murther the other; intending the like also to his Fellow, if he had not happily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped it. For which Fact he was arraigned and condemned at <hi>Westminster</hi> on the morrow after; and the next day he was hanged up in the very place where he wounded <hi>Hawkins,</hi> his Right hand being first cut off, and nailed to the Gibbet: a piece of Justice not more safe then seasonable; the horridness of the Fact, and the complexion of the times, being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Regular Clergy slept not in so great a tempest as was then hanging over their heads; but spent themselves in censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and confuting <hi>Cartwrights</hi> Pamphlets, which gave the first Animation to those bold attempts. What censure Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> past upon <hi>Cartwrights</hi> Papers, hath been shewn before; and he will give you his opinion of the Author also, of whom it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that he gave this Character, <hi>viz. Stultitia nata est in corde pueri, sed virga Disciplinae fugabit eam:</hi> That is to say, <hi>That folly had been bred in the heart of the young man, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Rod of correction would remove it from him.</hi> But <hi>Iewel</hi> had onely seen some scattered Papers intended for mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials in the following Pamphlet, which <hi>Whitaker</hi> both saw and censured when it was compleat. For writing of it unto <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift,</hi> he reports him thus: <hi>Quem</hi> Cartwrightus <hi>nuper emisit li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have read over</hi> (saith he) <hi>a great part of the Book which</hi> Cartwright <hi>hath lately set forth.

ever saw any thing more loose, and almost more childish. As for words indeed, he hath store of them, trim and fresh enough; but as for matter, none at all. Besides which, he not onely holds some peevish opinions derogatory to the Queens Authority in causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical; but had revolted also in that point to the Popish party, from whom he would be thought to fly with such deadly hatred.</hi> He adds in fine, <hi>That he complied not with the Papists in that point alone, but borrowed from them most of his other weapons, wherewith he did assault the Church: And in a word</hi> (<hi>as</hi> Jerome <hi>did affirm of</hi> Ambrose) <note n="a" place="margin">

Which Book of his, intituled; <hi>An Answer to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,</hi> followed so close upon the heels of the other, that it was published in the same year with it, 1572. To which <hi>Answer, Cartwright</hi> sets out a <hi>Reply</hi> in the year next following; and <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi> presently rejoyns in his <hi>Defence of the Answer, An.</hi> 1574. against which <hi>Cartwright</hi> never stirred, but left him Master of the field, possest of all the signs of an absolute Victory. And not long after, on the apprehension of his foil therein, he withdraws to <hi>Guernsey</hi> first, and to <hi>Antwerp</hi> afterwards; erecting the Presbytery in those Forreign Nations, which he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass in his own.</p>
            <p n="7">7. For though the Brotherhood had attempted to advance their Discipline, and set up their Presbyterie in the Church of <hi>Wandsworth</hi>; yet partly by the terror of the Proclamation, and partly by the seasonable execution of <hi>Burchet,</hi> they were restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from practising any further at the present on the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But what they durst not do directly, and in open sight, they found a way to act obliquely, and under the disguise of setting up another Church of strangers in the midst of <hi>London.</hi> Many of the Low Countrey men, both Merchants, Gentlemen and others, had fled their Countrey at the coming in of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> settled their dwellings in the Ports and Sea-Towns of <hi>England</hi> which lay nearest to them, and in good numbers took up their abode in <hi>London.</hi> Nor did they onely bring Families with them, but their Factories also: Their several Trades and Manufactures; as the making of all sorts of Stuffs, rich Tapistries, and other Hangings of less worth; and by their diligence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, not onely kept many poor English Families in continual work, but taught the English the same Arts which they brought hither with them. Such welcome Guests must needs have some En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to remain here always. And what Encouragement could be greater and more welcome to them, then to enjoy the liberty of their own Religion, according to such Government and Forms of Worship as they had exercised at home?

In which he reckons it as a great and signal blessing from Almighty God, that they had introduced in <hi>Scotland,</hi> not onely the true Worship of God, but the Discipline also, which was the best Preservative of the truth of Doctrine. Which therefore he desires him so to keep toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to be sure, that if the one be lost (that is, laid aside) the other is not like to continue long. And <hi>Cartwright</hi> leading in the same path also, heightned it above all which had gone before,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54836:147"/>
or that followed after him. Some of the Brethren have extolled it to the very Skies, as being <hi>the onely Bond of Peace; the Bane of Heresie; the Punisher of Sin, and maintainer of Righteousness: A Discipline full of all goodness, for the peace and honour of Gods people, ordained for the joy and happiness of all the Nations.</hi> But <hi>Cartwright</hi> sets them such a leap, as they durst not reach at, not onely telling us in his last Book against Learned <hi>Whitgift, That the want of the Elderships is the cause of all evil, and that it is not to be hoped that any Commonwealth can flourish without it</hi>; but also, <hi>that it is no small part of the Gospel, yea, the substance of it.</hi>

            <p n="9">9. And if it proved to be a part of our Saviours Gospel, what could the brethren do less then pretend some Miracles for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the same? and to what Miracles could they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with more shew of Sanctity, and manifestation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then to the casting out of Devils? <hi>Cambden</hi> inform us in this year, that the credulity of some <hi>London</hi>-Ministers had been abused by a young Wench, who was pretended at that time to be possessed of the Devil. But I rather think that the <hi>London</hi>-Ministers were confederate with this Wench, then abused by her; considering the subsequent practice in that kinde of casting out Devils by the <hi>Puritan</hi> Preachers, to gain the greater credit to their Cause: for in this very year they practised the casting of a Devil out of one <hi>Mildred,</hi> the base Daughter of <hi>Alice Norrington</hi> of <hi>Westwell</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi> Which for all the godly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences made by <hi>Roger Newman,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Brainford,</hi> two of the Ministers of that County, who were parties to it; was at the last confessed to be but a false imposture. Dr. <hi>Harsnet,</hi> (who afterward dyed Archbishop of <hi>York</hi>) informs us also in his Book against <hi>Darrel,</hi> that there were at this time two Wenches in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Agnes Bridges,</hi> and <hi>Rachel Pinder,</hi> who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly were given out to be so possessed; and it is possible that one of them may be she whom <hi>Cambden</hi> speaks of. Under which head may be also ranged the dispossessing of one <hi>Margaret Goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> at <hi>Ditchet</hi> in the County of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> about ten years after, 1584. But all inferiour to the Pranks which were played by <hi>Darrel,</hi> with whom none of the <hi>Puritan Exorcists</hi> is to hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison; of which we are to speak hereafter in its proper place. The Papists have been frequently and justly blamed for their impostures in this thing, and no terms are thought vile enough to express their falshoods. But they were onely <hi>pious frauds</hi> in the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> because conducing to such godly and religious ends, in the advancing of the Scepter and Throne of Christ, by the holy Discipline. And it is strange that none of all their Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots have endeavoured to defend them in it, as well as <hi>Cartwright</hi> laboureth to excuse their unlawful meetings from the name of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles; that being, as he tells us, too light a word to express the Gravity and Piety of those Assemblies, in which Sacraments are Administred, and the Gospel Preached. If so, all other Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries

whatsoever may excuse themselves from the holding of Conventicles, or being obnoxious to any penal Laws and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon that account, because they hold their Factious and Schismatical Meetings for the self-same ends.

For so it was,<note place="margin">1575.</note> that many of those Forreigners which resort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hither from the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces, and were incorporated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a distinct Society or Congregation, differing both in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Forms of Worship from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> did by degrees withdraw themselves from her Communion, and held their Conventicles a part from the rest of that body. Of these, some openly declared themselves for the Sect of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi>; others would needs be Members of the Family of <hi>Henry Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas,</hi> (who had been once a Member of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church under <hi>Iohn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And not content to entertain those new Opinions and devices amongst themselves, they must draw in the English also to participate with them; who having deviated from the paths of the Church, were like enough to fall into any other, and to pursue those crooked ways, in which the cunning He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks of those times did, and had gone before them. But such a diligent eye was had upon all their practices, that they were crossed in the beginning. For upon <hi>Easter-day,</hi> about nine in the Morning, was disclosed a Conventicle of these <hi>Anabaptists, Dutch-men,</hi> at an House without the <hi>Bars</hi> of <hi>Aldgate</hi>; whereof twenty seven were taken and sent to prison, and four of them bearing Fagots at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross, recanted in form following, <hi>viz. Whereas I,</hi> N N, <hi>being seduced by the spirit of Error, and by false Teachers his Ministers, have fallen into many damnable and detestable Heresies,</hi> viz. 1. <hi>That Christ took not flesh of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Blessed Virgin</hi> Mary: 2. <hi>That Infants horn of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Parents, ought to be Rebaptized:</hi> 3. <hi>That no Christian man ought to be a Magistrate, or bear the Sword or Office of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> 4. <hi>And that it is not lawful for a Christian man to take an Oath. Now by the Grace of God, and through Conference with good and Learned Ministers of Christ his Church; I do understand and acknowledge the same to be most damnable and detestable Heresies; and do ask God here before his Church mercy for my said former Errors, and do forsake them, recant, and renounce them, and abjure them from the very bottom of my heart. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I confess, that the whole Doctrine and Religion established in this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>as also that which is received and practised in the</hi> Dutch <hi>Church here in this City, is sound, true, and acording to the Word of God; whereunto in all things I submit my self, and will most gladly be a Member of the said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dutch Church; from henceforth utterly abandoning and forsaking all and every</hi> Anabaptistical <hi>Error.</hi>

But some there were, who neither would be terrified with the fear of punishment, or edified by the Retractation which those four had made; continued in their former courses with great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacity; insomuch, that on the 21 of <hi>May,</hi> being <hi>Whitson-Eve,</hi> no fewer then eleven of that Sect, all <hi>Dutch,</hi> (that is to say, one man and ten Women) were condemned in the Consistory at St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> to be burned in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> And though great pains was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to reclaim them from those wicked Errors; yet such was their obstinacie and perversness, that one Woman onely was converted.

Which put the State upon a just necessity of proceeding more severely against some of them, then by Bonds and banishments: Two of the same Nation and Opinions being burnt in <hi>Smithfield</hi> on the second of <hi>Iuly,</hi> where they dyed with very great horror, exprest by many roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and cryings, but without any signe or shew of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Before the executing of which sentence, <hi>Iohn Fox</hi> the English Martyrologist addrest his Letters to the Queen, in which he supplicated for the lives of those wretched men, and offered many pious and prudential reasons for the reversing of that sentence; or at the least, for staying it from execution. By which he so prevailed upon her, that she consented to a gratious sparing of their lives, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor had the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church of <hi>Norwich</hi> any better Fortune, or could pretend to be more free from harbouring some Fanatical spirits, then the <hi>Dutch</hi> Congregation in the <hi>Augustine Fryars.</hi> From some of which it may be probably supposed, that <hi>Matthew Hamant,</hi> a poor Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright of <hi>Featherset,</hi> within three Miles of <hi>Norwich,</hi> took his first impressions, which afterwards appeared in more horrid bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemies then any English ever had been acquainted with in the times preceding. For being suspected to hold many dangerous and unsound Opinions, he was convented before the Bishop of that City; at what time it was charged upon him, that he had publickly maintained these Heresies following; that is to say, <hi>That the new Testament or Gospel was but meer foolishness, and a story of men, or rather a meer Fable: That he was restored to Grace of the free Mercy of God, without the means of Christ his Blood and Passion: That Christ is not God, or the Saviour of the World, but a sinful man, a meer man, and an abominable Idol; and that all they that worship him, are abominable Idolaters: That Christ did not rise again from death to life by the power of his Godhead, neither that he ascended into Heaven: That the

About the same time that the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> were first brought to Censure, there spawned another Fry of Hereticks, who had its first Original amongst the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and from thence came for <hi>England</hi> with the rest of their brethren. These called themselves the <hi>Family of Love,</hi> as before is said; and were so well conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their own great holiness, that they thought none to be Elected to Eternal life, but such as were admitted into their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. The particulars of their Opinions, and the strange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Expressions, have been insisted on before. Let it suffice, that by their seeming Sanctity, and other the like deceitful arts of Dissimulation, they had drawn some of the English to them; who having broke the bond of peace, could not long keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Spirit of Unity. Some of them being detected, and convented for it, were condemned to do Penance at S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross; and there to make a Retractation of their former Errors.

And to that end, she gave a strict Command to all Temporal Judges, and other Ministers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, to be assistant to the Bishops and their under Officers, in the severe punishing of those Sects and Sectaries, by which the happiness of the Church was so much endangered. By which severities, and a Formal Abjuration prescribed unto them by the Lords of the Council, these Sects were seasonably sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, or had the reason to conceal themselves amongst such of the Brethren as did continue in their Separation from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

Which though it might sufficiently have discouraged them from the like Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet the next year they ventured on a business of a higher nature, which was the falsifying and corrupting of the Common-Prayer-Book.

Nothing being done for punishing of this great abuse, they enter upon another Project: Which seemed to tend onely to the encrease of Piety in the Professors of the Gospel; but was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended really for the furtherance of the Holy Discipline. The design was, that all the Ministers within such a Circuit, should meet upon a day appointed to exercise their gifts, and expound the Scriptures; one being chosen at each meeting for the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, to govern and direct the Action; the manner whereof was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And the Exercise being begun and concluded with prayer, the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent giving them another Theam for the next Meeting (which was every Fortnight) the said Assembly was dissolved.</hi> The Exercise they called by the name of <hi>Prophecying</hi>; grounded upon those words of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.13. viz. <hi>For ye may all prophecy one by one, that all may learn, and all be comforted.</hi> But finding that the Text was not able to bear it out, they added thereunto such pious and prudential Reasons, as the best wits amongst them could devise for the present.

These Meetings <hi>Grindal</hi> first connived at when he sate at <hi>York,</hi> under pretence of training up a preaching Ministery for the Northern parts. But afterwards he was so much possessed with the fancy of it, that he drew many of the Bishops in the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to allow them also. By means whereof, they came to be so frequent in most parts of the Kingdom, that they began to look with a face of danger, both on Prince and Prelate. For having once settled themselves in these new Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with some shew of Authority, the Leading-Members exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised the Jurisdiction over all the rest, intrenching thereby on the power of their several Ordinaries. And they incroached so far at last on the Queens Prerogative, as to appoint days for solemn Fasts, under pretence of Sanctifying those Religious Exercises to the good of the Nation, as afterwards in their Classical and Synodical Meetings, which took growth from hence. Three years these Prophesyings had continued in the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> before the Queen took notice of them. But then they were presented to her with so ill a complexion, that she began to startle at the first sight of them. And having seriously weighed all inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences which might thence ensue, she sends for <hi>Grindal</hi> to come to her; reproves him for permitting such an Innovation to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded on the Church, and gave him charge to see it suddenly suppressed. She complained also, that the Pulpit was grown too common, invaded by unlicensed Preachers, and such as preached sedition amongst the people; requiring him to take some order, that the Homilies might be read more frequently, and such Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons preached more sparingly then of late they had been. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> this was hard meat, not so easily chewed; therefore not like to be digested by so weak a stomach. Instead of acting any thing in order to the Queens Commands, he writes unto her a most tedious and voluminous Letter: In which he first presents her <hi>with a sad remembrance of the Discourse which past between them, and the great sorrow which he had conceived on the sense thereof.</hi> Which said, he falls into a <hi>commendation of Sermonizing; of the great benefit thereby redounding unto all her Subjects; the manifold advantages which such preachings had, above the Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; of wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> necessary use those</hi> Prophesyings <hi>were, toward the training up of Preachers.</hi> In fine, he also lets her know, <hi>that by the example of S.</hi> Ambrose, <hi>and his proceedings toward</hi> Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius <hi>and</hi> Valentinian, <hi>two most mighty Emperors, he could not satisfie his conscience in the discharge of the great trust commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, if he should not admonish her upon this occasion, not to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54836:150"/>
do any thing which might draw down Gods displeasure upon her and the Nation, by stopping the Free Exercise of Gods true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and his promoting of his Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. These Premises being laid together, he comes at last to this conclusion, as to assure her in plain terms, but with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>That he could not with a safe Conscience, and without the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Majesty of God, give his assent to the suppressing of the said Exercises, much less send out any Injunction for the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and universal subversion of the same: that he might say with the Apostle, That he had no power to destroy, but onely to edifie; that he could do nothing against the Truth, but for it: And therefore finally, that if it were her Majesties pleasure, for this or any other cause to remove him out of his place, he would with all humility yeild thereunto, and render again unto her Majesty that which he had received from her. For to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</hi> as he said, <hi>should he endeavour to retain a Bishoprick, or to gain the world, with the loss and hazard of his Soul? consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that he which doth offend against his Conscience, doth but digg out his own way to Hell.</hi> In which respect he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly desires her to bear with him, <hi>if he rather chuse to offend her earthly Majesty, then the Heavenly Majesty of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God.</hi> But not content with such an absolute refusal, and setting her at such a distance from Almighty God, he takes upon him to advise her to discharge her self of the concernments of the Church, or not to manage it at the least with so high a hand as she had done hitherto. Fitter it was, as he conceived it, <hi>That all Ecclesiastical matters which concerned Religion, the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church, should be referred unto the Bishops, and the Divines of this Realm, according to the example of all Christian Emperours, and the godly Princes of all ages, in the times before her.</hi> And this he further pressed upon her, by her own Example, in not deciding any questions about the Laws of the Realm, in her Court or Palace; but sending them to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by her Judges in the Courts of <hi>Westminster</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the self-same Reason, when any question did arise about the Discipline and Doctrine of the Church within her Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the ordinary way must be to refer the same to the Decision of the Bishops, and other chief Ministers of the Church in Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall Meetings, and not to determine of them in the Court by the Lords of her Council.</p>
            <p n="18">18. But notwithstanding his refusal to conform to her will and pleasure on the one side,<note place="margin">1580.</note> and this harsh Counsel on the other, which must needs be unwelcome to a Prince that loved and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood her own Authority so well as his Mistress did, he might have kept his Bishoprick, with her Majesties favour, which he appeared so willing to resign unto her. He might, I say, have kept them both, having so many great Friends about the Queen, who app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the <hi>Puritan Faction,</hi> occasion'd by his denying at the Earls request to alienate his goodly House and Mannor of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> that it might serve for a retiring place to that mighty favourite. And hereunto he did contribute further, as was said by others, for refusing to grant a Dispensation to marry one which was too near of kindred to him, clearly within the Compass of those degrees which seemed to him to be prohibited by the Word of God. This <hi>Leicester</hi> thought he might command, and was exceedingly vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to finde obedience, in one who had been raised by him, and depended on him. Upon which ground, all passages which b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By them she comes to understand, what a neglect there was of the publick Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in most parts of the Kingdom, what ruine and decay of Churches, what innovations made already, and what more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; by which she would be eased in time of all cares of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and finde the same to be transferred to the <hi>Puritan</hi> Consistories: She was told also of the general disuse of all week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fasts, and those which annually were required by the Laws of the Realm; and that instead thereof, the Brethren had took upon them, according to the <hi>Arrian Doctrine,</hi> to appoint solemn and occasional Fasts in several places, as at <hi>Leicester, Coventry, &amp;c.</hi> in defiance of the Laws, and her own Prerogative. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which last, she gave another hot Alarm to Archbishop <hi>Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> who in a long Letter did excuse the matter, as not being done by his allowance or consent; though it could not be denyed but that it had been done by his connivance, which came all to one: so that the Accusation being strong, his Defences weak, and no Friend left about the Queen who durst mediate for him (for who durst favour him on whom <hi>Leicester</hi> frowned?) the Archi-Episcopal Jurisdiction was sequestred from him, conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on four Suffragans of the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confined to one of his Country-houses, till the Queens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Which Sequestration must needs happen before the beginning of the Convocation which was held this year; the Pesidency whereof was then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved on the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> by reason of <hi>Grindals</hi> incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to perform that Service.</p>
            <p n="19">19. For on the sixteenth day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> it pleased the Queen to call a Parliament to be held at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in which some things occurred of great importance, in order to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> History which we have in hand. The <hi>Puritans</hi> following the <hi>Arrians</hi> in that particular, as in many others, had openly decryed all set and determinate Fasts; but then ascribed more merit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those of their own appointing, then any Papists do to those of the Popes Ordaining.

that time was read accustomably in the House of Commons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Members setled upon any business. But in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Parliament, it was moved by one <hi>Paul Wentworth</hi> in the House of Commons, that there might be a Sermon every Morning before they sate, and that they would nominate some day for a solemn Fast. How the first motion sped, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where found; but may conclude by the event, that it came to nothing, because I never heard that any thing was done in puisance of it till the late Long Parliament, where the like Toy was taken up for having Sermons every Morning in the Abbey-Church. But that about the Fast being made when more then half the Members were not present at it, was carried in the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative by fifteen voices. And thereupon it was ordered, as the Journal t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For some of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made the Queen acquainted with their purpose in it, she sends a Message to them by Sir <hi>Christopher Hatton,</hi> who was then Vice-Chamberlain; by which he lets them know, <hi>That her Majesty did much admire at so great a rashness in that House, as to put in execution such an Innovation, without her privity and pleasure first made known unto them.</hi> Which Message being so delivered, he moved the House <hi>to make humble submission to her Majesty, acknowledging the said offence and contempt, craving the remission of the same, with a full purpose to forbear the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of the like hereafter.</hi> Which motion being hearkned to (as there was good reason) Mr. <hi>Vice-Chamberlain</hi> is desired to present their submission to the Queen, and obtain her pardon; which he accordingly performed.</p>
            <p n="20">20. This practice gave the Queen so fair a Prospect into the counsels of the Faction, that she perceived it was high time to look about her, and to provide for the preserving of her power and Prerogative-Royal, but more for the security of her Realm and Person. To which end she procured a Statute to be made in that very Parliament, by which it was Enacted, <hi>That if any person or persons, forty days after the end of that Session, should advis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to the same belonging: Or if any person after the time aforesaid, as well within the Queens Dominions, as in any other place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the same, should procure such Book, Rhyme, Ballad,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be written, printed, published or set forth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(the said offence not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the compass of Treason by vertue of any former Statute) that then the said Offenders, upon sufficient proof thereof by two lawful witnesses, should suffer death and loss of goods, as in case of Felony.</hi> And that the Queen may be as safe from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of the <hi>Papists,</hi> as she was secured by this Act from the plots of the Puritans, a Law was past, <hi>To make it Treason for any Priest or Iesuit to seduce any of the Queens Subjects to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Religion; and for the Subjects to be reconciled to the Church of</hi> Rome. This Act, intituled, <hi>An Act for retaining the Queens Subjects in their due obedience</hi>; the other, <hi>For the punishing se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious words against the Queen,</hi> 23 Eliz. cap. 1, 2. Which Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes were contrived of purpose to restrain the Insolency of both Factions; and by which, many of them were adjudged to death in times ensuing: Some of them, as in case of Treason; and others, as the Authors or the Publishers of Seditious Pamphlets. But the last Statute being made with Limitation to the life of the Queen, it expired with her. And had it been revived (as it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was) by either of the two last Kings, it might possibly have prevented those dreadful mischiefs which their posterity for so long a time have been involved in.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Together with this Parliament, was held a Convocation, as the Custom is. In the beginning whereof, an Instrument was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced under the Seal of Archbishop <hi>Grindal,</hi> for substituting Dr. <hi>Iohn Elmore</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London</hi> (a Prelate of great parts and spirit, but of a contrary humour to the said Archbishop) to preside therein; which in the incapacity of the other, he might have challenged as of right belonging to him. Nothing else me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable in this Convocation, but the admitting of Dr. <hi>William Day</hi> then Dean of <hi>Windsor,</hi> to be Prolocutor of the Clergie; the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of a Bill for the grant of Subsidies; and a motion made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prelates, in the name of the Clergie, for putting the late Book of Articles in execution. Nothing else done within those walls, though much was agitated and resolved on by those of <hi>Grindals</hi> party in their private Meetings. Some of the hotter heads amongst them had proposed in publick, <hi>That the Clergie should decline all business, even the grant of Subsidies, till the Archbishop were restored to his place and suffrage.</hi> But this could find no entertainment amongst wiser men. Others advised, <hi>That a Petition should be drawn in the name of both Houses, by which Her Majestie might be moved to that restitution.</hi> And though I find nothing to this purpose in the Publick Registers (which may sufficiently evince, that it never passed as an Act of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) yet I find that such a Petition was agreed upon and drawn into form by Dr. <hi>Tobie Matthews</hi> then Dean of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> and by some Friends presented to Her Majesties sight. <hi>Matthews</hi> was
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:54836:152"/>
master of an elegant and fluent stile, and most pathetically had bemoaned those sad misfortunes which had befallen that Prelate, and the Church in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>im, by suffering under the displeasure of a gratious Sovereign. The mitigation whereof was the rather hoped for, in regard he had offended more out of the tenderness of his Conscience, then from the obstinacy of his will. But no such answer being given unto this Petition, as by his Friends might be expected, <hi>Grindal</hi> continued under his Suspension till the time of his death. Once it was moved, <hi>to have a Co-adjutor imposed upon him, who should not onely exercise the Iurisdiction, but receive all the Rents and profits which belonged to his Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</hi> And so far they proceeded in it, that Dr. <hi>Iohn Whitgift</hi> (who had been preferred to the See of <hi>Worcester,</hi> 1576.) was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated for the man, as one sufficiently furnished with abilities to discharge the trust. But he most worthily declined it, and would not suffer the poor man to be stript of his clothes, though for the apparelling of his own body with the greater honour, till death had laid him in the bed of Eternal rest.</p>
            <p n="22">22. But the troubles of this year were not ended thus. For neither those good Laws before remembred, nor the Executions done upon them, could prevail so far, as to preserve the Church from falling into those distractions, which both the Papists and the Presbyterians had projected in it.

To which end, <hi>Heywood, Parsons</hi> and <hi>Campian</hi> first set foot in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and both by secret practices and printed Pamphlets, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to withdraw the Subjects from their due obedience. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ordinary in their mouths, or upon their pens, then <hi>that the Crown belonged of right to the Queen of</hi> Scots: <hi>That</hi> Elizabeth <hi>was to be deprived: That if the Pope commanded one thing, and the Queen another, the Popes commands were to be obeyed, and not the Queens:</hi> And in a word, <hi>That all the Subjects were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued from their Allegiance, and might declare as much when they found it necessary.</hi> Which that it might be done with the greater safety, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the XIII is desired to make an Explication of the former Bull. By which it should be signified to the English Catholicks, that the said former Bull of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V should remain obligatory unto none but the Hereticks onely; but that the Romish Catholicks should not be bound by it, as the case then stood, till they should find themselves in a fit capacity to put the same in execution without fear of danger. And presently upon their first entrance, a Book is published by one <hi>Howlet,</hi> containing many reasons for deterring the Papists from joyning in any Act of Worship with the English Protestants; the going, or not going to Church, being from henceforth made a

sign <hi>distinctive,</hi> as they commonly phrased it. In this year also <hi>Beza</hi> published his Schismatical Pamphlet, intituled, <hi>De triplici Episcopatu</hi>; of which see <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>numb.</hi> 47. <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>numb.</hi> 40. first written at the request of <hi>Knox</hi> and other of the Presbyterians of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they might have the better colour to destroy Episcopacy; translated afterwards into English for the self-same reason, by <hi>Field</hi> of <hi>Wandsworth.</hi> Against this Book, Dr. <hi>Iohn Bridges</hi> Dean of <hi>Sarum</hi> writ a large Discourse, intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>A Defence of the Government established in the Church of England</hi>; not published till the year 1587, when the Authority thereof was most highly stood on.

Who having settled the Presbytery in <hi>Iersey</hi> and <hi>Guernsey,</hi> first sends back <hi>Snape</hi> to his old Lecture at <hi>Northampton,</hi> there to pursue such Orders and Directions as they had agreed on; and afterwards put himself into the Factory of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and was soon chosen for their Preacher. The news whereof brings <hi>Travers</hi> to him; who receives Ordination (if I may so call it) by the Presbytery of that City, and thereupon is made his Partner in that charge. It was no hard matter for them to perswade the Merchants to admit that Discipline, which in their turns might make them capable of voting in the Publick Consistory: And they endeavoured it the rather, that by their help they might effect the like in the City of <hi>London,</hi> whensoever they should find the times to be ready for them. The like they did also in the English Church at <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleborough</hi> the chief Town in <hi>Zealand,</hi> in which many English Merchants had their constant residence: To which two places they drew over many of the English Nation, to receive admission to the Ministery in a different Form from that which was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Some of which following the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Cartwright</hi> himself, renounced the Orders which they had from the hands of the Bishops, and took a new Vocation from these Presbyters; as, <hi>Fennor, Arton, &amp;c.</hi> and others there admitted to the rank of Ministers, which never were ordained in <hi>England</hi>; as <hi>Hart, Guisin, &amp;c.</hi> not to say any thing of such as were elected to be Elders or Deacons in those Forreign Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistories, that they might serve the Churches in the same capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at their coming home. And now at last they are for <hi>England,</hi> where <hi>Travers</hi> puts himself into the service of the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> by whose Recommendation he is chosen Lecturer of the <hi>Temple</hi> Church; which gave him opportunity for managing all affairs which concerned the Discipline with the <hi>London</hi>-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. <hi>Cartwright</hi> applies himself to the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> by whom he is sent down to <hi>Warwick,</hi> and afterwards made Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of an Hospital of his Foundation. In the chief Church of which Town, he was pleased to preach, as often as he could
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:54836:153"/>
dispense with his other business. At his admission to which place, he faithfully promised, if he might be but tolerated to Preach, not to impugne the Laws, Orders, Policy, Government, nor Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours in this Church of <hi>England</hi>; but to perswade and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, so much as he could, both publickly and privately, the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and peace of this Church.</p>
            <p n="24">24. But scarce was he setled in the place, when he made it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by all his actions, how little care he took of his words and promises: for so it was, when any Minister, either in private Conferences, or by way of Letters, required his advice in any thing which concerned the Church, he plainly shewed his mislike of the Ecclesiastical Government then by Law Established, and excepted against divers parts of the Publick Liturgie; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Tenour of the two <hi>Admonitions,</hi> by him formerly published. By means whereof, he prevailed with many, who had before observed the Orders of the Common-prayer-book, now plainly to neglect the same; and to oppose themselves against the Government of Bishops, as far as they might do it safely, in relation to the present times. And that he might not press those points to others, which he durst not practice in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he many times inveighed against them in his Prayers and Sermons: The like he also did against many p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ssages in the Publick Liturgie, as namely, <hi>The use of the Surplice; the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories to God-fathers in the name of Infants; the Cross in Baptism; the Ring in Marriage; the Thanksgiving after Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth; Burials by Ministers; the kneeling at Communions; some points of the Litany; certain Collects and Prayers; the reading of Portions of Scripture for the Epistle and Gospel; and the manner of singing in Cathedral Churches.</hi> And for example unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he procured his Wife not to give thanks for her Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from the peril of Childbirth, after such Form, and in such place and manner as the Church required. Which as it drew on many other women to the like contempt, so might he have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon many more, if he had not once discoursed upon matters of Childbirth with such in discretion, that some of the good Wives of <hi>Warwick</hi> were almost at the point to stone him as he walked the streets. But that he might not seem to pull down more with one hand, then he would be thought sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to build up with both; he highly magnified in some of his Sermons the Government of the Church by Elderships in each Congregation, and by more Publick Conferences in <hi>Classical</hi> and <hi>Synodical</hi> Meetings; which he commended for the onely lawful Church-Government, as being of Divine Institution, and ordained by Christ. A Form whereof he had drawn up in a little Book: Which having past the approbation of some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Friends, was afterwards recommended to the use of the rest of the brethren, assembled together by his means for such ends and purposes, by whom it was allowed of as most fit to be put in practice. For being a new nothing, and of <hi>Cartwrights</hi>

In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it was conceived to be a good Rule in the School of Policy, to grant a little more liberty to the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction; though possibly it were done on no other score, then that of their notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enmity to the Popish party.</p>
            <p n="26">26. About this time it also was, that by the practices of <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> and his adherents, their Followers began to be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their names and titles, from the rest of the people. First, in relation to their Titles. Thus those of his Faction must be called <hi>the Godly, the Elect, the Righteous</hi>; all others being looked
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:54836:154"/>
upon as <hi>carnal Gospellers, the Prophane, the Wicked.</hi> And next, in reference to their names. Their Children must not be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by the names of their Ancestors, as <hi>Richard, Robert,</hi> and the like; but by some name occurring in the holy Scriptures, but more particularly in the Old Testament, because meerly <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and not prophaned with any mixture of the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman:</hi> concerning which there goes a story, that an Inhabitant of <hi>Northampton,</hi> called <hi>Hodgkingson,</hi> having a Childe to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, repaired to <hi>Snape,</hi> before mentioned, to do it for him; and he consented to the motion, but with promise that he should give it some name allowed in Scripture. The holy action being so far forwards, that they were come to the naming of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, they named it <hi>Richard,</hi> which was the name of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father by the Mothers side. Upon this a stop was made, nor would he be perswaded to Baptize the Childe, unless, the name of it were altered. Which when the God-father refused to do, the Childe was carried back unchristened. It was agreed by him and <hi>Cartwright,</hi> in the Book of Discipline which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon the Islands, <hi>That the Minister in Baptizing Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren should not admit of any such names as had been used in the time of</hi> Paganism, <hi>the names of Idols, and the like.</hi> Which Rule though calculated like a common Almanack, for the Meridian of those Islands onely, was afterwards to be observed on the like occasions, in all the Churches of Great <hi>Britain.</hi> Such was their humour at that time: but they fell shortly after on another Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.

            <p n="27">27. Some stop they had in their proceedings, which might have terrified them at the present from adventuring further, but that they were resolved to break through all difficulties, and try the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the State to the very utmost. The Queen had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a treaty of Marriage, <hi>Anno</hi> 1581, with <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjow,</hi> the youngest Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and the onely surviving brother of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, then Reigning in <hi>France.</hi> For the negotiating whereof, <hi>Monsieur Simier,</hi> a most compleat Courtier, was sent Ambassador from that King. By whom the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness was sollicited with such dexterity, that the Match was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conceived to be fully made. The <hi>Puritans</hi> hereupon begin to clamour, as if this Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch did aim at nothing but the reduction of Popery, &amp; the destruction of Religion here by Law established. But
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54836:155"/>
fearing more the total ruine of their hopes and projects, then any other danger which could happen by it. The Queen took care to tye the Duke to such conditions, that he could hardly be permitted to hear Mass in his private Closet; and had caused <hi>Camp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an</hi> to be executed at his being here, to let him see how little favour was to be expected by him for the Catholick party. Yet all this would not satisfie the zealous Brethren, who were resolved to free themselves from their own fears, by what means soever. First therefore it was so contrived, that as <hi>Simere</hi> passed between <hi>Greenwich</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> before the coming of the Duke, a shot was made at him from a ship, with which one of the Watermen was killed, but the Ambassador therewith more amazed then hurt. The Gunner afterwards was pardoned, by the great power the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> had in Court; it being pretended, that the Piece was discharged upon meer accident, and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on malice or design. After this, follows a seditious Pamphlet, writ by one <hi>Stubs</hi> of <hi>Lincolns</hi> Inn, who had married one of the Sisters of <hi>Thomas Cartwright</hi>; and therefore may be thought to have done nothing in it without his privity. This Book he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Gaping Gulf</hi>; in which <hi>England</hi> was to have been swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, the wealth thereof consumed, and the Gospel irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably drown'd; writ with great bitterness of spirit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful language, to the disgrace of the French Nation, the dishonor of the Dukes own person; and not without some vile reflections on the Queen herself, as if she had a purpose to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray her Kingdom to the power of Strangers.</p>
            <p n="28">28. For publishing this book, no such excuse could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as was insisted on in defence of the former shot; nor could the Queen do less in Justice to her self and her Government, as the case then stood, then to call the Authors and the Publishers of it to a strict account. To which end the said <hi>Stubs,</hi> together with <hi>Hugh Singleton</hi> and <hi>William Page,</hi> were on the 13 day of <hi>October</hi> arraigned at <hi>Westminster,</hi> for Writing, Printing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersing that Seditious Pamphlet; and were all then and there condemned to lose their right hands for the said offence. Which Sentence was executed on the third of <hi>November</hi> upon <hi>Stubs</hi> and <hi>Page,</hi> as the chief offenders; but <hi>Singleton</hi> was pardoned as an Accessary, and none of the Principals in the Crime. Which execution gave great grief to the <hi>Disciplinarians</hi>; because they saw by that Experiment, that there was no dallying with the Queen, when either the honor of her Government, or the peace of her Dominions seemed to be concerned. And they were most afflicted at it in regard of <hi>Cartwright,</hi> whose inability to preserve so near a Friend from the severity and shame of so great a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was looked on as a strong presumption that he could be as little able to save himself, whensoever it was thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient upon reason of State to proceed against him. But now they are engaged in the same bottom with him, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to steer their course by no other Compass, then that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:54836:155"/>
which this grand Pilot had provided for them. Not terrified from so doing, by the open Schism which was the next year made by one <hi>Robert Brown,</hi> once a Disciple of their own, and one who built his Schism upon <hi>Cartwrights</hi> Principles; nor by the hanging of those men who had dispersed his Factious and Schismatical Pamphlets. For the better clearing of which matter, we must fetch the story of this <hi>Brown</hi> a little higher, and carry it a little lower then this present year.</p>

He was bred sometimes in <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge (commonly called <hi>Bennet</hi> Colledge) in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Where, though he was not known to take any degree, yet he would many times venture into the Pulpit. It was observed, that in his preaching he was very vehement; which <hi>Cartwrights</hi> Followers imputed onely to his zeal, as being one of their own number. But other men suspected him to have worse ends in it. Amongst many, whom rather curiosity then Devotion had brought to hear him, Dr. <hi>Iohn Still</hi> (though possibly not then a Doctor) hapned to be one. Who being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Master of Trinity-Colledge, and finally Lord Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> was used to say, <hi>That he discerned something extraordinary in him at the very first, which he presaged would prove a disturbance to the Church, if it were not seasonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</hi> Being well verst and conversant in <hi>Cartwrights</hi> Books, and other the like Pamphlets of that time, he became more and more estranged from the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Whose Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Not able to abide longer in a Church so impure and filthy, he puts himself over into <hi>Zealand,</hi> and joyns with <hi>Cartwrights</hi> new Church in the City of <hi>Middleborough.</hi> But finding there some few remainders of the old impiety, he resolves to constitute a new Church of his own Projectment, which should have nothing in it but what was most pure and holy. The Draught whereof, he comprehended in a Book which he printed at <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleborough, An.</hi> 1582, intituled, <hi>A Treatise of Reformation:</hi> and having sent as many of them into <hi>England</hi> as might serve his turn, he followed after in pursuit of his new Plantation.</p>

               <note place="margin">1583.</note> as before was said, more numerous then any other Church or Congregation within the Precincts of that City. Many of which enclining of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> were apt enough to entertain any new Opinions which held Conformity with that Sect. Amongst them he

begins, and first begins with such amongst them as were most likely to be ruled and governed by him; he being of an imperious nature, and much offended with the least dissent or contradiction, when he had uttered any Paradox in his discourses. Having gotten into some Authority amongst the <hi>Dutch,</hi> whose Language he had learned when he lived in <hi>Middleborough,</hi> and grown into a great opinion for his Zeal and Sanctity, he began to practise with the English; using therein the service and assistance of one <hi>Richard Harrison,</hi> a Country School master, whose ignorance made him apt enough to be seduced by so weak a Prophet. Of each Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he began to gather Churches to himself, of the last especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially; inculcating nothing more to his simple Auditors, then that the Church of <hi>England</hi> had so much of <hi>Rome,</hi> that there was no place left for Christ, or his holy Gospel. But more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly he inveighed against the Government of the Bishops, the Ordination of Ministers, the Offices, Rites and Ceremonies of the publick Liturgie, according as it had been taught out of <hi>Cartwrights</hi> Books; descending first to this Position, <hi>That the Church of</hi> England <hi>was no true and lawful Church.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to this conclusion, <hi>That all true Christians were obliged to come out of</hi> Babylon, <hi>to separate themselves from those impure and mixt Assemblies, in which there was so little of Christs Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and finally, that they should joyn themselves to him and to his Disciples, amongst whom there was nothing to be found which savoured not directly of the Spirit of God; nothing of those impurities and prophanations of the Church of</hi> England. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followed a defection from the Church it self; not as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore amongst the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> from some Offices in it. <hi>Browns</hi> Followers (which from him took the name of <hi>Brownists</hi>) refusing obstinately to joyn with any Congregation, with the rest of the people, for hearing the Word preached, the Sacraments admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, and any publick act of Religious Worship. This was the first gathering of Churches which I finde in <hi>England</hi>; and for the justifying hereof, he caused his Books to be dispersed in most parts of the Realm. Which tending as apparently to Sedition, brought both the Dispersers of them within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the Statute 23 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. Of which we are informed by <hi>Stow,</hi> that <hi>Elias Thasker</hi> was hanged at <hi>Bury</hi> on the fourth of <hi>Iune</hi>; and <hi>Iohn Copping,</hi> on the sixth of the same Month, for spreading certain Books, seditiously penned by <hi>Robert Brown</hi> against the Book of Common-prayer established by the Laws of this Realm; as many of their Books as could be found, being burnt before them.</p>
            <p n="31">31. As for the Writer of the Books, and the first Author of the Schism, he was more favourably dealt with then these wretched instruments, and many other of his Followers in the times suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Being convented before Dr. <hi>Edmond Freak,</hi> then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and others of the Queens Commissioners in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with him; he was by them upon his refractory carriage
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:54836:156"/>
committed to the custody of the Sheriff of <hi>Norwich.</hi> But being a near kinsman by his Mother to the Lord Treasurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> he was at his request released from his imprisonment, and sent to <hi>London,</hi> where some course was taken to reclaim him, if it might, be possible, totally, or in part at least, as God pleased to bless it. <hi>Whitgift</hi> by this time had attained to the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; a man of excellent patience and dexterity in dealing with such men as were so affected. By whose fair usage, powerful Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and exemplary piety, he was prevailed upon so far, as to be brought unto a tolerable compliance with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> In which good humour he was favourably dismist by the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and by the Lord-Treasurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> to the care of his Father; to the end that being under his eye, and dealt with in a kinde and temperate manner, he might in time be well recovered, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally withdrawn from all the Reliques of his fond opinions. Which Letters of his bear date on the 8 of <hi>October</hi> 1585. But long he had not staid in his Fathers house, when he <hi>returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his vomit,</hi> and proving utterly incorrigible, was dismist again; the good old Gentleman being resolved upon this point, that he would not own him for a Son, who would not own the Church of <hi>England</hi> for his Mother. But at the last, though not till he had passed through two and thirty prisons, as he used to brag, by the perswasions of some Friends, and his own neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities (the more powerful Orators of the two) he was prevailed with to accept of a place called <hi>A Church</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> beneficed with cure of Souls; to which he was presented by <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> after Earl of <hi>Exon,</hi> and thereunto admitted by the Bishop of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> upon his promise not to make any more disturbances in the proceedings of the Church: A Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of good value, which might tempt him to it, the rather, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that he was excused as well from preaching, as from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming any other part of the publick Ministry; which Offices he discharged by an honest Curate, and allowed him such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent maintainance for it, as gave content unto the Bishop, who had named the man. And on this Benefice he lived to a very great age, not dying till the year 1630; and then dying in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton</hi> Gaol, not on the old account of his inconformity, but for breach of the Peace. A most unhappy man to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in being the Author of a Schism which he could not close; and most unfortunate to many of his Friends and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, who suffered death for standing unto those conclusions, from which he had withdrawn himself divers years before.</p>
            <p n="32">32. But it is time that we go back again to <hi>Cartwright,</hi> upon whose principles and positions he first raised this Schism. Which falling out so soon upon the Execution which was done on <hi>Stubs,</hi> could not but put a great rebuke upon his spirit; and might perhaps have tended more to his discouragement, had not his sorrows been allayed and sweetned by a Cordial which was sent from <hi>Beza,</hi> sufficient to revive a half-dying brother. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:54836:157"/>
which there is no more to be premised, but that <hi>Geneva</hi> had of late been much wasted by a grievous pestilence, and was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what distressed at this time by the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> Their peace not to be otherwise procured, but by paying a good sum of money, and money not to be obtained but by help of their Friends. On this account he writes to <hi>Travers,</hi> being then Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Chaplain to the Lord Treasurer <hi>Burleigh</hi>; but so, that <hi>Cartwright</hi> was to be acquainted with the Tenour of it; that by the good which the one might do upon the Queen by the means of his Patron, and the great influence which the other had on all his party, the contribution might amount to the higher pitch. But as for so much of the said Letter as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns our business, it is this that followeth; <hi>viz. If as often, dear Brother, as I have remembred thee and our</hi> Cartwright, <hi>so often I should have written unto thee, you had been long since over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with my Letters; no one day passing, wherein I do not onely think of you and your matters; which not onely our ancient Friendship, but the greatness of those affairs wherein you take pains, seems to require at my hands. But in regard that you were fallen into such times, wherein my silence might be safer far then my writing, I have, though most unwillingly, been hitherto silent. Since which time, understanding that by Gods Grace the heats of some men are abated, I could not suffer this my Friend to come unto you without particular Letters from me, that I may testifie my self to be the same unto you as I have been formerly; as also, that at his return I may be certified of the true state of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</hi> After which Preamble, he acquaints him with the true cause of his writing, the great extremities to which that City was reduced, and the vast debts in which they were plunged; whereby their necessities were grown so grievous, that except they were relieved from other parts, they could not be able to support them: And then he addes, <hi>I beseech thee, my dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not onely to go on in health with thy daily prayers; but that if you have any power to prevail with some persons, shew us by what honest means you can, how much you love us in the Lord.</hi> Finally, having certified him of other Letters which he had writ to certain Noblemen, and to all the Bishops, for their assistance in that case; not without some complaints of a dis-respect which he had found to some of his late Addresses, he concludes it thus; viz. <hi>Farewel my dear Brother; the Lord Iesus every day more and more bless thee, and all that earnestly desire his glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="33">33. This Letter dated in the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> 1582. came very seasonably both to comfort <hi>Cartwright,</hi> who could not but be much afflicted with his late misfortunes, and encouraged him to proceed in pursuit of that business in which they had took such pains. This was enough to make them hasten in the work, who wanted no such Spurs to set them forwards. Till this time they had no particular Form, either of Discipline or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which generally was allowed of for the use of their Churches; But every man gathered some directions out of <hi>Cartwrights</hi> books,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:54836:157"/>
as seemed most proper for that purpose. But <hi>Cartwright</hi> having now drawn up his form of Discipline, mentioned before amongst the rest of his practices, 1580, that book of his was looked on as the onely Rule, by which they were to regulate their Churches in all publick duties. But in regard of the great scandal given by <hi>Brown,</hi> the execution done at <hi>Bury</hi> upon <hi>Thacker</hi> and <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> and the severity of the Laws in that behalf; it was thought fit to look before them, and so to carry on the business as to make no rupture in the Church, and to create no eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to themselves. In reference to which ends, they held a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assembly, wherein they agreed upon some order for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the said Discipline in execution, but with as little violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the peace of the Church as they could possibly devise: And therefore that they might proceed with the greater safety, it was advised and resolved on, 1. <hi>That such as are called unto the Ministery of any Church, should be first approved by the Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, or some greater Assembly, and then commended to the Bishop by their special Letters, to receive their Ordination at his hands.</hi> 2. <hi>That those Ceremonies in the Book of Common-Prayer which seemed to have been used in the times of Popery, were totally to be omitted, if it might be done without being deprived of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery; or otherwise the matter to be left to the consideration of the Classis, or other greater Assembly, that by the judgement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it might be determined what was most fitting to be done.</hi> 3. <hi>That if Subscription to the Articles of Religion and the Book of Common-prayer should be urged again, that they might be then subscribed unto, according to the Statute of</hi> 13 Eliz. <hi>that is to say, to such of them onely as contain the sum of Christian Faith, and the Doctrine of the Sacraments. But</hi> 4. <hi>That for many weighty causes, neither the rest of the said Articles, nor the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer were to be subscribed; no, though a man should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his Ministery upon such refusal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="34">34. A Consultation was held also in the said Assembly, <hi>That without changing of the names, or any sensible alteration in the state of the Church, the Church-Wardens and Collectors of every Parish might serve in the place of Elders and Deacons; and to that end, that notice might be given of their election, about the space of</hi> 15 <hi>days before the times appointed for it by the Law of the Land: To the intent that the Church might joyn in prayer to God to be so directed, as to make choice of fit men to supply those Ministeries.</hi> It was advised also, <hi>That before the ordinary times of the said Elections, the Ordinance of Christ should be publickly intimated to the Congregation, concerning the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Watchmen and Overseers in the Church; it being their duty to foresee that no offence or scandal arise in the Church; and that if any such offence or scandal should happen, it might be seasonably remedied and abolished by them: as also that the names of the parties chosen be published on the next Lords Day; their duties toward the Church, and the Churches duty toward them, being then declared; and then the said Officers to be admitted to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54836:158"/>
their several Ministeries, with the general Prayers of the whole Church.</hi> Orders were also made for a division of the Churches into Classical and Synodical Meetings, according to the tenor of the Book of Discipline; for keeping a Registry of the Acts of the Classis and Synods; for dealing with Patrons to present fit men, when any Church fell void belonging to their Presentations; for making Collections at the General Assemblies (which were then held for the most part at the Act in <hi>Oxon,</hi> or the Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ambridge</hi>) towards the relief of the poor, but most especially of those who had been deprived of their Benefices for their not subscribing; as also of such Ministers of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as for their factiousness and disobedience had been forced to abandon that Kingdom: and finally, for nominating some set-time at the end of each Provincial Synod, in which the said Provincial Synod was to sit again; as also for the sending of fit men to the General Synods, which were to be held either in times of Parliament, or at such other times as seemed most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</p>
            <p n="35">35. By these disguisings it was thought that they might breed up their Presbytery under the Wing of Episcopacie, till they should finde it strong enough to subsist of it self, and bid defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to that power which had given it shelter. It was resolved also, that instead of Prophesying, which now began to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in every place, Lectures should be set up in some chief Towns in every County: to which the Ministers and Lay-bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren might resort securely, and thereby prosecute their designe with the like indempnity. But no disguise could fit them in their alterations of the Forms of Worship; of which nothing was to be retained by <hi>Cartwrights</hi> Rules, but that which held confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the Church of <hi>Geneva.</hi> According to the Rules where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Minister had no more to do on the days of Worship, but to Preach his Sermon, with a long Prayer before it, and another after it, of his own devising; the people being entertained both before and after with a <hi>Psalm</hi> in Meter, according to such Tune or Tunes as the Clerk should bid. For having distributed the whole Worship of God into these three parts; that is to say, Prayers, Praises, and Prophesyings; the singing of the <hi>Psalms</hi> (which they conceived to be the onely way of giving praise) became, in fine, as necessary as the Prayers or Preachings. Their other aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations from the publick Liturgie in Sacraments and Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, may best be found in <hi>Cartwrights</hi> practice, as before laid down; it being not to be supposed that he would practise one thing and prescribe another, or that his own practice might not be a sufficent Canon, to direct all the Churches of this Platform. But these alterations being so gross, that no Cloak could cover them; another expedient was devised somewhat more charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then the other, but of greater safety. For neither daring to reject the publick Liturgie, and being resolved not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselves unto it; they fell upon a course of hiring some
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:54836:158"/>
Lay-brother, (as <hi>Snape</hi> did a Lame Souldier of <hi>Barwick</hi>) or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some ignorant Curate, to read the Prayers to such as had a minde to hear them; neither themselves, nor their Disciples coming into the Church, till the singing of the <hi>Psalm</hi> before the Sermon. Concerning which, one of the brethren writes to <hi>Field,</hi>

                  </gap>llizing,</hi> by winking at the plots and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the <hi>Puritan Faction.</hi> So highly valued by the Queen, that when she first preferred him to the See of <hi>Worcester, Anno</hi> 1576, she gave him the disposing of all the Prebendaries of that Church, to the end he might be served with the ablest and most Learned men. Nor was he less esteemed for his civil pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; which moved Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to select him before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be his Vice-President in <hi>Wales,</hi> at such time as he was to go Lord-Deputy for the Realm of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Upon this man the Queen had always kept her eye since <hi>Grindal</hi> fell into disfavour, and willingly would have made him his Co-adjutor, if he could have been perswaded to accept the offer. Which moderation altered nothing of the Queens minde toward him, who was so constant in her choice and designations of fit men to serve her, that upon <hi>Grindals</hi> death, which happened on the 6 of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1583, she preferred <hi>Whitgift</hi> to the place. To which he was actually translated before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> following, that he might have the benefit of the half-years-rent. Which as it was another Argument of the Queens good affection to him (who otherwise was sufficiently intent on her personal profit) so for a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of it, she caused one hundred pounds to be abated in his Tenths and first Fruits, which had been over-charged on his Predecessor. And, which was more then both together, she suffered him to Commence a Suit against Sir <hi>Iames Crofts,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptroller of her Houshold, Governour of the Town of <hi>Barwick,</hi> and a privy Councellor, for the recovery of some Lands, to the quantity of one thousand Acres, which had been first alienated to the Queen, and by the Queen was given to <hi>Crofts</hi> on a Court-petition. Which suit, as he had courage enough to take in hand, so had he the felicity of an happy Issue, in the recovering of those Lands from such Potent Competitors, without loosing any part of her Majesties favour. But these things are not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to my present business, unless it be to shew upon what ground he stood, and that he was resolved to abate of nothing
<pb facs="tcp:54836:159"/>
which concerned the honour of the Church, who was so vigilant and intent (without fear of envy or displeasure) on the profit of it.</p>
            <p n="37">37. The Queen was set upon a point of holding her Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-Royal at the very height; and therefore would not yield to any thing in Civil matters, which seemed to tend to any sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible diminution of it. And in like sort she was resolved touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Supremacy, which she considered as the fairest Jewel in the Regal Diadem; and consequently, could as little hearken to such Propositions as had been made in favor of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by their great Agents in the Court, though she had many times been sollicited in it. To ease herself of which Sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the time to come, she acquaints <hi>Whitgift</hi> at his first coming to the place, that she determined to discharge herself from the trouble of all Church-concernments, and leave them wholly to his care: That he should want no countenance and encouragement for carrying on the great trust committed to him: That she was sensible enough into what disorder and confusion the affairs of the Church were brought, by the connivance of some Bishops, the obstinancy of some Ministers, and the power of some great Lords both in Court and Countrey; but that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all these difficulties, he must resolve, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to assert the Episcopal Power, but also to restore that Uniformity in Gods Publick Worship, which by the weakness of his Predecessor was so much endangered. Thus authorized and countenanced, he begins his Government. And for the first Essay thereof, he sends abroad three Articles to be subscribed by all the Clergy of his Province. The Tenour of which Articles, because they afterwards created so much trouble to him, I shall here subjoyn. First therefore, he required the Clergy to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to this, <hi>That the Queen had Supreme Authority over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons born within her Dominions, of what condition soever they were; and that no other Prince, Prelate or Potentate, either had, or ought to have any jurisdiction Civil or Ecclesiastical within her Realms and Dominions.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Book of Common-prayer, and the Ordination of Bishops, Priests and Deacons, contained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to the Word of God, but might lawfully be used; and that they would use that and no other.</hi> 3. <hi>That he allowed the Articles of Religion, agreed in the Synod holden at</hi> London, <hi>in the year of our Lord</hi> 1562, <hi>and published by the Queens Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and did believe them to be consonant to the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="38">38. It is not easie to imagine what clamours were raised amongst the Brethren upon this occasion; how they moved Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, the Court and Country, and all the Friends they had of the Clergie or Laity, to come to their assistance in this time of their tryal. By means whereof, they raised so strong an opposition against his proceedings, that no man of less courage then <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and none but <hi>Whitgift</hi> so well backed and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:54836:159"/>
by a gratious Mistress, could have withstood the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and fury of it. But by the Queens constancie on the one side, who gave <hi>Semper Eadem</hi> for her Motto, to shew that she was always one; and by his most invincible patience on the other side, whose <hi>Motto</hi> being <hi>Vincit qui patitur,</hi> declared what hopes he had, that by a discreet patience he might get the Victory; he had the happiness to see the Church reduced to her former lustre, by the removing of all obstacles which lay before him. The first of which was laid by some of his own Diocess, who being required by him to subscribe for an Example to others, not onely refused so to do, but being thereupon suspended for their contumacy in due Form of Law, they petitioned to the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for relief against him: the like Petition was presented to them, by some Ministers of the Diocess of <hi>Norwich,</hi> against Dr. <hi>Edmond Freak</hi> their Bishop; to whom the planting of so many Dutch Churches in the principal City, and other of the chief Towns of his Diocess, had given trouble enough. To the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Kentish</hi> Ministers, which concerned himself, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to answer at the Council-Table, on the Sunday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Instead whereof, he lays before them in the Letter, <hi>That the Petitioners, for the most part, were ignorant and raw young men, few of them licensed Preachers, and generally disaffected to the present Government: That he had spent the best part of two or three days in labouring to reduce them to a better understanding of the points in question; but not being able to prevail, he had no otherwise proceeded then the Law required: That it was not for him to sit in that place, if every Curate in his Diocess might be permitted so to use him; nor possible for him to perform the Duty which the Queen expected at his hands, if he might not proceed to the execution of that power by her Majesty committed to him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption: That he could not be perswaded, that their Lordships had any purpose to make him a party, or to require him to come before them to defend those actions, wherein he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that he had no other Iudge but the Queen her self; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in regard that he was called by God to that place and functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein he was to be their Pastor, he was the rather moved to desire their assistance in matters pertaining to his Office, for the quietness of the Church, the credit of Religion, and the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of the Laws in defence thereof, without expecting any such attendance on them as they had required, for fear of giving more advantage to those wayward persons, then he conceived they did intend.</hi> And thereunto he added this protestation, <hi>That the three Articles whereunto they were moved to subscribe, were such, as he was ready by Learning to defend, in manner and form as there set down, against all opponents, either in</hi> England <hi>or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="39">39. In reference to the paper of the <hi>Suffolk</hi> Ministers, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns this answer: <hi>It seemeth something strange to me, that the Ministers of</hi> Suffolk <hi>finding themselves agrieved with the doings of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:54836:160"/>
their Diocesans should leave the ordinary course of proceeding by the Law, (which is to appeal unto me) and extraordinarily trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your Lordships in a matter not so incident (as I think) to that honourable Board, seeing it hath pleased her Majesty her own self in express words to commit these causes Ecclesiastical to me, as to one who is to make answer unto God and her Majesty in this behalf; my Office also and place requiring the same. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer unto their complaint; touching their ordinary proceedings with them, I have herewith sent your Lordships a Copy of a Letter lately received from his Lordship, wherein I think that part of their Bill to be fully answered. Touching the rest, I know not what to judge of it; but in some points it talketh (as I think) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly and charitably. They say, they are no Iesuits sent from</hi> Rome <hi>to reconcile,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>True it is, neither are they charged to be so; but notwithstanding, they are contentious in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and by their contentions minister occasion of offence to those which are seduced by</hi> Jesuits; <hi>and give the Sacraments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the form of publick Prayer used in this Church, and by Law established, and thereby increase the number of them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in their wilfulness. They also make a Schism in the Church, and draw many other of her Majesties Subjects to a misliking of her Laws and Government in Causes Ecclesiastical. So far are they from perswading them to obedience; or at the least, if they perswade them to it in the one part of her Authority, it is in Causes Civil; they disswade them from it as much in the other, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

More of which Letter might be added, were not this suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, as well to shew how perfectly he understood both his place and power, as with what courage and discretion he proceeded in the maintenance of it. Which being observed by some great men about the Court, who had ingaged themselves in the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> quarrels, but were not willing to incur the Queens displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by their opposition; it was thought best to stand a while behind the Curtain, and set <hi>Beal</hi> upon him, of whose impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and edge against him they were well assured. This <hi>Beal</hi> was in himself a most eager <hi>Puritan,</hi> trained up by <hi>Walsingham</hi> to draw dry-foot after Priests and Jesuits; his extream hatred to those men, being looked on as the onely good quality which he could pretend to. But being over-blinded by zeal and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was never able to distinguish rightly between truth and falshood; between true Sanctity, and the counterfeit appearance of it. This made him first conceive, that whatsoever was not <hi>Puritan,</hi> must needs be <hi>Popish</hi>; and that the Bishops were to be esteemed no otherwise then the sons of Antichrist, because they were not looked upon as Fathers by the holy Brotherhood. And so far was he hurried on by these dis-affections, that though he was preferred to be one of the Clerks of the Council, yet he preferred the interest of the Faction before that of the Queen.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:54836:160"/>
Insomuch that he was noted to jeer and gibe at all such Sermons as did most commend Her Majesties Government, and move the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory to obedience; not sparing to accuse the Preachers upon such occasions to have broached false Doctrine, and falsly to alledge the Scriptures in defence thereof. This man had either writ or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced a sharp Discourse against Subscription, inscribed to the Archbishop, and presented to him; and thereupon caused speeches to be cast abroad, that the three Articles to which Subscription was required, should shortly be revoked by an Act of the Council: which much encreased the obstinacy of the self-willed Brethren. But after, fearing lest the Queen might have a sight of the Papers, he resolved to get them out of his hands; and thereupon went over to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where he behaved himself in such a rude and violent manner, as forced the Archbishop to give an acconnt thereof by Letter to the Lord Treasurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> who hitherto had stood fair towards him, in these following words:</p>
            <p n="41">41. <hi>I have born</hi> (saith he) <hi>with Mr.</hi> Beals <hi>intemperate speeches, unseemly for him to use, though not in respect of my self, yet in respect of Her Majestie whom he serveth, and of the Laws esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, whereunto he ought to sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I told him, That the book was written unto me, and therefore no reason why he should require it again, especially seeing I was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that he had a Copy thereof; otherwise I would cause it to be written out for him: Whereupon he fell into very great passions with me (which I think was the end of his coming) for proceeding in the execution of the Articles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and told me in effect, that I would be the overthrow of this Church, and a cause of tumult; with many other bitter and hard speeches, which I heard patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wished him to consider with what spirit he was moved to say so: For I said, it could not be by the Spirit of God, which worketh in men Patience, Humility and Love; and your words declare (said I) that you are very Arrogant, Proud, Impatient and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable. Moreover, the Spirit of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And all this while</hi> (saith he) <hi>I talked with him in the upper end of my Gallery: My Lord of</hi> Winchester <hi>and divers strangers being in the other part thereof. But Mr.</hi> Beal <hi>beginning to extend his voyce that all might hear, I began to break off. Then he being more and more kindled, very impatiently uttered very proud and contemptuous speeches in the justifying of his book, and condemning the Orders established, to the offence of all the bearers. Whereupon, being very desirous to be rid of him, I made small answer; but told him that his speeches were intolerable, that he forgot himself, and that I would complain of him to Her Majestie: whereof he seemed to make small account, and so he departed in great heat.</hi> Which said, he lets his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship know, <hi>That though he was never more abused by any man in his life, then since his coming to that place he had been by</hi> Beal, <hi>and that upon no other ground but for doing his duty, yet that he
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:54836:161"/>
was not willing to do him any ill office with the Queen about it, or otherwise to proceed any further in it then his Lordship should think most convenient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="42">42. Finding by these Experiments how little good was to be done upon him either way, it was resolved to make some tryal on the opposite party, in hope to bring them by degrees unto some at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement. The Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> shall first break the ice; who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some complaint made against the Liturgie by some of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, required them to compose another, such as they thought might generally be accepted by them. The first <hi>Classis</hi> thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on devised a new one, agreeable in most things to the Form of <hi>Geneva.</hi> But this Draught being offered to the consideration of a second <hi>Classis</hi> (for so the wise States-man had of purpose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived the plot) there were no fewer then six hundred Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made against it, and consequently so many alterations to be made therein, before it was to be admitted. The third <hi>Classis</hi> quarrelled at those Alterations, and resolved therefore on a new Model, which should have nothing of the other: And against this, the fourth was able to pretend as many Objections as had been made against the first. So that no likelihood appearing of any other Form of Worship, either better or worse, to be agreed upon between them, he dismist their Agents for the present; with this assurance, that whensoever they could agree upon any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie which might be universally received amongst them, they should find him very ready to serve them in the settling of it. Just so <hi>Pacuvius</hi> dealt with the people of <hi>Capua,</hi> when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to put all their Senators to death. For when he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised them not to execute that sentence upon any one Senator, till they were agreed upon another to supply the place, there followed such a division amongst them in the choice of the new, and so many Exceptions against every man which was offered to them, that at the last it was resolved to let the old Senate stand in force, till they could better their condition in the change of the persons. <hi>Walsingham</hi> tries his fortune next, in hope to bring them to allow or the English Liturgie, on the removal of such things as seemed most offensive. And thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he offered, in the Queens name, that the three Ceremonies at which they seemed most to boggle; that is to say, <hi>Kneeling at the Communion; The Surplice</hi>; and, <hi>The Cross in Baptism,</hi> should be expunged out of the Book of Common-Prayer, if that would content them. But thereunto it was replied in the words of <hi>Moses, Ne ungulam esse relinquendum</hi>; That they would not leave so much as a hoof behind. Meaning thereby, that they would have a total abolition of the Book, without retaining any part of Office in it in their next new-nothing. Which peremptory answer did much alienate his affection from them; as afterwards he affirmed to <hi>Knewstubs,</hi> and <hi>Knewstubs</hi> to Dr. <hi>Iohn Burges</hi> of <hi>Colshil</hi>; from whose pen I have it.</p>

               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:54836:161"/>43. The Brethren on the other side finding how little they had gotten by their application to the Lords of the Council, began to steer another course, by practising upon the temper of the following Parliaments, into which they had procured ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their chief Friends to be retained for Knights or Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses, as they could prevail. By whose means (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Queen had charged them not to deal in any thing which was of concernment to the Church) they procured a Bill to pass in the House of Commons 1585, for making tryal of the sufficiency of such as were to be ordained or admitted Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters by twelve Lay-men; whose approbation and allowance they were first to pass, before they were to receive <hi>Institution</hi> into any Benefice. Another Bill was also past, for making Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage lawful at all times of the year; which had been formerly attempted by the Convocation, and tendred to the Queen amongst other Articles there agreed upon, but was by her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellished and rejected, as before was said. They were in hand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so with a third, concerning Ecclesiastical Courts, and the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Visitations; pretending onely a redress of some Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances in excessive Fees, but aiming plainly at the overthrow of the Jurisdiction. Of which particulars, <hi>Whitgift</hi> gives notice to the Queen; and the Queen so far signified her dislike of all those proceedings, that all those Projects dyed in the House of Commons, without ever coming into Acts. The like attempts were made in some following Sessions; in which some Members shewed themselves so troublesome to sober men, so alienated from the present Government, and so dis-respective toward the Queen, that she was fain to lay some of them by the heels, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive others of their places, before she could reduce them to a better temper. Of which we shall speak more hereafter, in the course of this History.</p>

And first, beginning with the <hi>Scots,</hi> it is to be remembred, that we left them at a very low ebb; the Earl of <hi>Goury</hi> put to death, many of the Nobility exiled into Forreign Countreys, and the chief Zealots of the Faction amongst the Ministers, putting themselves into a voluntary Banishment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not have their wills on the King and Council.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:54836:163"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> as nearest hand, was the common Sanctuary, to which some Lords, and almost all the Refractory Ministers had retired themselves. Much countenanced by Mr. Secretary <hi>Walsingham,</hi> who had set them on work; and therefore was obliged to gratifie them in some fit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. To such of the Nobility as had fled into <hi>England,</hi> he assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Isle of <hi>Lindisfarm,</hi> (commonly called the <hi>Holy Island</hi>) not far from <hi>Berwick</hi>; with order to the Lord <hi>Hundsdon,</hi> who was then Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of that Town, to give them the possession of it. But <hi>Hunds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> though he had less Zeal, had so much knowledg of his Duty, as to disobey him; considering the great consequence of the place, and that there was no impossibility in it, but that the <hi>Scots</hi> might make use of it to the common prejudice, if they should prove Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to this Crown, as perhaps they might. A matter, which the Secretary would not have passed over in so light a manner, but that an Ambassador was sent at the same time from the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> by whom it was desired that the Fugitives of that Nation, whatsoever they were, might either be remitted home, or else commanded not to live so near the Borders, where they had opportunity, more than stood with the good of that Kingdom, to pervert the Subjects. Which Reasonable Desire being yeelded unto, the Lords and Great men of that Nation were ordered to retire to <hi>Norwich,</hi> and many of the Ministers, permitted to prepare for <hi>London, Oxon, Cambridg,</hi> and some other places; where some of them procured more mischief to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than all of them could have done to their own Countrey, had they staid at <hi>Berwick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. At <hi>London</hi> they are suffered, by some zealous Brethren, to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess their <hi>Pulpits,</hi> in which they rail, without comptroll, against their King, the Council of that Kingdom, and their natural Queen; as if by the practises of the one, and the connivence of the other, the Reformed Religion was in danger to be rooted out. Some Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had been made at that time by the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> by which it was desired that she might be restored unto the Liberty of her person, associating with the young King in the Government of the Realm of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and be suffered to have the Mass said in her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Closet, for her self and her Servants. The news whereof being brought to <hi>London,</hi> filled all the <hi>Pulpits</hi> which the <hi>Scots</hi> were suffered to invade, with terrible Complaints and Exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; none of them sparing to affirm, That her Liberty was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Safety: That both Kingdoms were undone, if she were admitted to the joynt-Government of the Realm of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and, That the Reformed Religion must needs breathe its last, if the <hi>Popish</hi> were permitted within the Walls of the Court. Which points they pressed with so much vehemence and heat, that many were thereby inflamed to join themselves in the Association against that Queen, which soon after followed. Against their King they railed so bitterly, and with such reproach, (one <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinson</hi> more than any other) that upon complaint made by the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ambassador, the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> was commanded to silence all the <hi>Scots</hi> about the City; and the like Order given to the rest of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:54836:163"/>
Bishops, by whom they were inhibited from preaching in all other places. But the less noise they made in the Church, the more closely and dangerously they practised on particular persons, in whom they endeavoured to beget an ill opinion of the present Government, and to engage them for advancing that of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in the place thereof. But this they had followed more successfully at the Act in <hi>Oxon,</hi> where they are liberally entertained by <hi>Genebrand</hi> and the rest of the Brethren; amongst which, <hi>Wilcox, Hen,</hi> and <hi>Ackton,</hi> were of greatest note. And at this time a question was propounded to them concerning the proceeding of the Minister in his duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the assistance or tarrying for the Magistrate. How they resolved this question, may be easily guessed, partly by that which they had done themselves when they were in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and partly by the Actings of their <hi>English</hi> Brethren, in pursuance of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For presently after, <hi>Gelibrand</hi> deals with divers Students in their several Colledges, to put their hands unto a paper, which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to contain somewhat in it of such dangerous nature, that some did absolutely refuse, and others required further time of deliberation: of which <hi>Gelibrand</hi> thus writes to <hi>Field,</hi> on the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ian.</hi> then next following: <hi>I have already</hi> (saith he) <hi>entred into the matters whereof you write, and dealt with three or four several Colledges, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those amongst whom they live. I find that men are very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in this point, generally favouring Reformation; but when it comes to the particular point, some have not yet considered of the things for which others in the Church are so much troubled: others are afraid to testifie any thing with their hands, lest it breed danger before the time: and many favour the Cause of the Reformation, but they are not Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, but young Students; of whom there is good hope, if they be not cut off by violent dealing before the time. As I hear by you, so I mean to go forward where there is any hope, and to learn the number, and certifie you thereof,</hi> &amp;c. But that these secret practises might not be suspected, they openly attend the <hi>Parliament</hi> of this year, as at other times, in hope of gaining some advantage against the Bishops, and the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Orders of the Church: For in the <hi>Parliament</hi> of this year, which began on the Twenty third of <hi>November,</hi> they petitioned, amongst other things, That a Restraint might be laid upon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, for granting of Faculties, conferring of Orders, as also in the executing of Ecclesiastical Censure, the Oath <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Non-residence, and the like. But the Queen would not hearken to it, partly because of the dislike she had of all Innovations, which commonly tend unto the worse; but chiefly, in regard that all such Applications as they made to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> were by her looked on as derogatory to her own Supremacy. So that instead of gaining any of those points at the hands of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> they gained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but displeasure from the Queen, who is affirmed by <hi>Stow</hi> to have made a Speech at the end of their Session, and therein to have told the Bishops, That if they did not look more carefully to the discharge of their Duties, she must take order to deprive them. Sharp words! and such as might necessitate the Bishops to look well about them.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:54836:164"/>4. It happened also, that some of the great Lords at Court whom they most relyed on, began to cool in their affections to the Cause, and had informed the Queen of the weakness of it, upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. The Earl of <hi>Leicester, Walsingham,</hi> and some others of great place and power, being continually prest unto it by some Leading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, prevailed so far on the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as to admit them (in their hearing) to a private Conference: To which the Arch-bishop condescends; and having desired the Arch-bishop of <hi>York,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> to associate with him, that he might not seem to act alone in that weighty business; he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to hear such Reasons as they could alledg for refusing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselves to the Orders of the Church established. At which time though the said most Reverend Prelate sufficiently cleared all their Doubts, and satisfied all Exceptions which they had to make; yet at the earnest request of the said great persons, he gave way unto a second Conference to be held at <hi>Lambeth</hi>; at which such men were to be present, whose Arguments and Objections were conceived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable, because they had not yet been heard. But when the points had been canvased on both sides for four hours together, the said great persons openly professed before all the Company, That they did not believe the Arch-bishops Reasons to have been so strong, and those of the other side so weak and trivial, as they now perceived them. And having thanked the Lord Arch-bishop for his pains and patience, they did not only promise him to inform the Queen in the truth of the business; but endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the opposite Party to a present Conformity. But long they did not stay in so good a humour; of which more hereafter.</p>
            <p n="5">5. With better fortune sped the Lords of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation, in the advance of their Affairs: Who being admitted to the Queens presence by the means of <hi>Walsingham,</hi> received such countenance and support, as put them into a condition of returning home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and gaining that by force and practise, which they found impossible to be compassed any other way. All matters in that Kingdom were then chiefly governed by the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> formerly better known by the name of Captain <hi>Iones,</hi> who being of the House of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> and fastening his dependence on the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> at his first coming out of <hi>France,</hi> had on his instigation undertaken the impeaching of the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi>: after which, growing great in favour with the King himself, he began to ingross all Offices and Places of Trust, to draw unto himself the managery of all Affairs, and finally to assume the Title of Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> at such time as the Chiefs of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were exiled and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited. Grown great and powerful by these means, and having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Office of Lord Chancellor to the rest of his Honours, he grew into a general hatred will all sorts of people: And being known to have no very good affections to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> she was the more willing to contribute towards his destruction. Thus animated and prepared, they make toward the Borders, and raising the Countrey as they went, marched on to <hi>Sterling</hi> where
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54836:164"/>
the King then lay. And shewing themselves before the Town with Ten thousand men, they publish a Proclamation in their own terms, touching the Reasons which induced them to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into Arms. Amongst which it was none of the least,
<q>That Acts and Proclamations had, not long before, been published against the Ministers of the Kirk, inhibiting their Presbyteries, Assemblies, and other Exercises, Priviledges, and Immunities, by reason whereof the most Learned and Honest of that number were compelled for safety of their Lives and Consciences, to abandon their Countrey. To the end therefore that all the aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icted Kirk might be comforted, and all the said Acts fully made in prejudice of the same, might be cancelled, and for ever abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they commanded all the King's Subjects to come in to aid them.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The King perceiving by this Proclamation what he was to trust to, first thinks of fortifying the Town: but finding that to be untenable, he betakes himself unto the Castle, as his surest strength. The Conquerors having gained the Town on the first of <hi>October,</hi> possest themselves also of the Bulwarks about the Castle; which they inviron on all sides, so that it was not possible for any to escape their hands: In which extremity the King makes three Requests unto them, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Life, Honour, and Estate, might be preserved. That the Lives of certain of his Friends might not be touched. And that all things might be transacted in a peaceable manner. They, on the other side, demand three things for their security and satisfaction, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>1. That the King would allow of their intention, and subscribe their Proclamation, until further Order were established by the Estates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he would deliver into their hands all the Strong-holds in the Land. 2. That such as had disquieted the Commonwealth, might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to them, and abide their due tryal by Law. And, 3. That the old Guard might be removed, and another placed, which was to be at their disposal.</q>
To which Demands the King consents at last, as he could not otherwise; though in their Second they had purposely run a-cross to the Second of his, wherein he had desired that the Lives of such as were about him, might not be endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Upon the yeelding of which points, which in effect was all that he had to give unto them, he puts himself into their hands, hath a new Guard imposed upon him, and is conducted by them wheresoever they please. And now the Ministers return in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to their Widowed Churches, where they had the Pulpits at command, but nothing else agreeable to their expectation. For the Lords having served their own turns, took no care of theirs; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that in a Parliament held in <hi>Lithgoe,</hi> immediately after they had got the King into their power, they caused an Act to pass for ratifying the appointment betwixt them and the King; by which they provided well enough for their own Indempnity. But then withall, they suffered it to be Enacted, <hi>That none should either publikely declare, or privately speak or write in reproach of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54836:165"/>
Person, Estate, or Government.</hi> Which came so cross upon the stomacks of the Ministers, whom nothing else could satisfie but the repealing of all former Statutes which were made to their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, that they fell foul upon the King in a scandalous manner: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that one <hi>Gibson</hi> affirmed openly in a Sermon at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> That heretofore the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> was suspected to have been the <hi>Persecutor,</hi> but <hi>now they found it was the King</hi>; against whom he denounced the Curse that fell on <hi>Ieroboam, That he should dye Childless, and be the last of his Race.</hi> For which, being called to an account before the Lords of the Council, he stood upon his justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication without altering, and was by them sent Prisoner to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>Blackross.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Of the same temper were the rest; who notwithstanding the late Acts of Parliament inhibiting all Assembly and Classical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, without leave from the King, held a new Synod at St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> in the <hi>April</hi> following, consisting (for the most part) of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons and Lay-Gentlemen, Masters of Colledges, and ignorant School-Masters. Which Synod (if it may be called so) was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely indicted by <hi>Andrew Melvin,</hi> for censuring the Arch-bishop of that City, whom they suspected and gave out to be the chief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver of the Acts of Parliament made in 1584, so prejudicial to the Kirk; and to have penned the Declaration in defence thereof. And hereunto he found the rest so ready to conform themselves, that they were upon the point of passing the Sentence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication against him, before he was cited to appear; most of them crying out aloud, <hi>It was the Cause of God</hi>; and, <hi>That there needed no citation, where the iniquity was so manifest.</hi> But being cited, at the last, he appears before them, puts up his Protestation concerning the unlawfulness of that Convention, and his disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Jurisdiction which they challenged over him; and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of them, What they had to say? His Accusation was, That he had devised the Acts of Parliament in —84, to the subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Kirk, and the Liberties of it. To which he answered, That he only had approved, and not devised the said Acts; which having past the approbation of the Three Estates, were of a nature too Supreme for such Assemblies; and thereupon appealed unto the King, the Council, and the following Parliament. But notwithstanding this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Appeal, the Sentence of Excommunication is decreed against him, drawn into Writing, and subscribed. Which when neither the Moderator, being a meer Layick, nor any of the Ministers themselves, had confidence enough to pronounce and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish; one <hi>Hunter,</hi> a Pedagogue in the House of <hi>Andrew Melvin,</hi> (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing that he had the Warrant of the Spirit for it) took the charge upon him, and with sufficient audacity pronounced the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The informality and perversness of these proceedings, much displeased the King; but more he feared what would be done in the next Assembly, appointed to be held at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and then near at hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Melvin</hi> intended in the same, not only to make good what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54836:165"/>
had been done at the former Meeting, but to dispute the nature and validity of all Appeals which should be made against them on the like occasions. To break which blow, the King could find no other way, but to perswade the Arch-bishop to subscribe to these three points, <hi>viz.</hi> That he never publickly professed or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to claim any Superiority, or to be judg over any other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Ministers, or yet a vowed the same to have any warrant in Gods Word: That he never challenged any Jurisdiction over the late Synod at St. <hi>Andrews</hi>; and must have erred, by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the said Meeting, if he had so done. And thirdly, That he would behave himself better for the time to come; desiring pardon for the oversight of his former Actions; promising to be such a Bishop from thenceforth, as was described by St. <hi>Paul</hi>: And finally, submitting both himself and Doctrine, to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the said Assembly, without appealing from the same in the times to come. To such unworthy Conditions was the poor man brought, only to gain the King some peace, and to reserve that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Power which was left unto Him; though the King lost more by this Transaction, than possibly He could have done by his standing out. For, notwithstanding the Submissions on the part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, the Assembly would descend no lower than to declare, That they would hold the said Sentence for not pronounced, and thereby leave the Bishop in the same estate in which they found him; and not this neither, but upon some hopes and assurance given them, that the King would favourably concurr with them in the building of the House of God. Which Agreement did so little satisfie the adverse party, that they justified their former process, and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily confirmed the Sentence which had been pronounced. Which, when it could not be obtained from the greater part of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, who were not willing to lose the glory of so great a Victory; <hi>Hunter</hi> stands up, by the advice of <hi>Andrew Melvin,</hi> and publickly protested against it; declaring further, That notwithstanding any thing which had been done to the contrary, the Bishop should be still reputed for an Excommunicated person, and one delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Satan. It was moved in this Assembly also, That some Censure should be laid upon the Ministers, who had subscribed the Acts of Parliament made in —84. But their number proved so great, that a Schism was feared; and they were wise enough to keep all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they might be the better able upon all occasions to oppose the King. Somewhat was also done concerning the Establishment of their <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> and the defining of their Power: of which the King would take no notice, reserving his disgust of so many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies, till he should find himself in a condition to do them Reason.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In these Exorbitances, they are followed by the <hi>English Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> who had been bad enough before, but henceforth showed themselves to have more of the <hi>Scot</hi> in them, than in former times. For presently upon the news of the good success which their <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Brethren had at <hi>Sterling,</hi> a scandalous Libel, in the nature
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54836:166"/>
of a <hi>Dialogue,</hi> is published, and dispersed in most parts of <hi>England:</hi> in which the state of this Church is pretended to be laid open in a Conference between <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> (representing the person of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop) <hi>Tertullus,</hi> (a <hi>Papist,</hi> brought in to plead for the Orders of our Church) <hi>Demetrius,</hi> an Usurer, (signifying such as live by unlawful Trades) <hi>Pandocheus,</hi> an Inn-keeper, (a receiver of all, and a soother of every man for his Gain) and <hi>Paul,</hi> (a <hi>Preacher of the Word of God</hi>) sustaining the place and person of the <hi>Consistorians).</hi> In the contrivance of which piece, <hi>Paul</hi> falls directly on the Bishop, whom he used most proudly, spightfully, and slanderously. He condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both the Calling of Bishops as <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and censureth their proceedings as Wicked, Popish, Unlawful, and Cruel. The Bishop is supposed to have been sent out of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> there, and is made upon his return home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to be the Reporter of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Affairs; and withall, to signifie his great fear lest he, and the rest of the Bishops in <hi>England,</hi> should be served shortly as the Bishops had lately been in <hi>Scotland,</hi> viz. at <hi>Edenborough, St. Andrews,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tertullus,</hi> the <hi>Papist,</hi> is made the Bishop's only Counsellor in the whole course of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church; by whose Advice the Bishops are made to bear with the <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> and that so many ways are sought to suppress the <hi>Puritans</hi>: And he, together with <hi>Pandocheus</hi> the Host, and <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Usurer, relate unto the Bishop such Occurrences as had happened in <hi>England</hi> during his stay amongst the <hi>Scots.</hi> At which, when the Bishop seemed to wonder, and much more marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that the Bishops had not yet suppressed the <hi>Puritans</hi> some way or other; <hi>Pandocheus</hi> is made to tell him, That one of their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers had affirmed in the Pulpit, That there were One hundred thousand of them in <hi>England</hi>; and that their Number in all places did encrease continually.</p>
            <p n="10">10. By this last brag about their Numbers, and somewhat which escaped from the mouth of <hi>Paul,</hi> touching his hopes of seeing the Consistorian Discipline, erected shortly, it may be gathered, That they had a purpose to proceed in their Innovations, out of a hope to terrifie the State to a compliance, by the strength of their Party. But if that failed, they would then do as <hi>Penry</hi> had advised and threatned; that is to say, they would present themselves with a Petition to the Houses of Parliament, to the delivering whereof, One hundred thousand Hands should be drawn together. In the mean time, it was thought fit to dissemble their purposes, and to make tryal of such other means as appeared less dangerous. To which end they present with one Hand a Petition to the Convocation, in which it was desired, That they might be freed from all Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and with the other, publish a seditious Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>A Complaint of the Commons for a Learned Ministry.</hi> But, for the putting of their Counsels in execution, they were for the present at a stand. The Book of Discipline, upon a just examination, was not found so perfect, but that it needed a review; and the review thereof is referred to <hi>Traverse.</hi> By whom being finished, after a
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:54836:166"/>
tedious expectation, it was commended to the Brethren, and by them approved. But the worst was, it was not so well liked of in the Houses of Parliament, as to pass for current; which so incensed those meek-spirited men, that they fell presently to threatning and reviling all who opposed them in it.
They had prepared their way to the Parliament then sitting, <hi>Anno</hi> 1586, by telling them, <q>That if the Reformation they desired, were not granted, they should betray God, his Truth, and the whole Kingdom, that they should declare themselves to be an Assembly, wherein the Lords Cause could not be heard, wherein the felicity of misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men could not be respected; wherein Truth, Religion, and Piety, could bear no sway; an Assembly that willingly called for the Judgments of God upon the whole Realm; and finally, that not a man of their seed should prosper, be a Parliament-man, or bear rule in <hi>England</hi> any more.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. This necessary preparation being thus premised, they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Parliament, A Book of the form of Common-Prayer by them desired, containing also, in effect, the whole pretended Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, so revised by <hi>Traverse</hi>; and their Petition in behalf thereof, was in these words following, <hi>viz. May it therefore please your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that the Book hereunto annexed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Entituled,</hi> A Book of the Form of Common-Prayers, and Administration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. <hi>and every thing therein contained,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may be from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth put in use, and practised through all your Majesty's Dominions,</hi> &amp;c. But this so little edified with the Queen, or that Grave Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that in the drawing up of a General Pardon to be passed in Parliament, there was an Exception of all those that committed any offence against the Act for the Uniformity of Common-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or that were Publishers of Seditious Books, or Disturbers of Divine Service. And to say the truth, the Queen had little reason to approve of that Form of Discipline in which there was so little consideration of the Supreme Magistrate in having either vote or place in any of their Synodical Meetings, unless he be chosen for an Elder, or indicting their Assemblies, either Provincial or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, or what else soever; or insomuch as nominating the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular time or place, when, and where to hold them; or finally, in requiring his assent to any of their Constitutions. All which, they challenge to themselves with far greater arrogancy than ever was exercised by the Pope, or any Bishop or inferior Minister un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Command, during the times of greatest Darkness. But the Brethren not considering what just Reason the Queen had to reject their Bill, and yet fearing to fall foul upon her, in regard of the danger; they let flye at the Parliament in this manner; that is to say, That they should be in danger of the terrible Mass of God's Wrath, both in this life, and that to come; and that for their not abrogating the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Government, they might well hope for the Favour and Entertainment of <hi>Moses,</hi> that is, the Curse of the Law: the Favour and loving-Countenance of Jesus Christ, they should never see.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:54836:167"/>12. It may seem strange that Queen <hi>ELIZABETH</hi> should carry such a hard hand on her <hi>English Puritans,</hi> as well by severe Laws, and terrible Executions, as by excluding them from the benefit of a General Pardon; and yet protect and countenance the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in all places else. But that great Monster in Nature, called <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of State,</hi> is brought to plead in her defence; by which she had been drawn to aid the <hi>French Hugonots</hi> against their King; to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Rebel-<hi>Scots</hi> with Men, Money, Arms and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon all occasions; and hitherto support those of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces, against the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Now she receives these last into her protection, being reduced at that time unto great Extremities, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by reason of the death of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; and partly in regard of the great Successes of the Prince of <hi>Parma.</hi> In which extremity they offered her the Soveraignty of <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and <hi>West-Friesland</hi>; to which they frame for her an unhandsom Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, grounded on her descent from <hi>Philippa,</hi> Wife of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, Sister of <hi>William</hi> the third, Earl of <hi>Heynalt, Holland,</hi> &amp;c. But she not harkning to that offer about the Soveraignty, as a thing too invidious, and of dangerous consequence; cheerfully yeelded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them into her protection, to raise an Army presently toward their defence, consisting of Five thousand Foot, and One thousand Horse, with Money, Ammunition, Arms, and all other necessaries; and finally, to put the same Arms so appointed, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of some Person of Honour, who was to take the charge and trust of so great a Business. The Confederates, on the other side, being very prodigal of that which was none of their own, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into her hands the Keys of the Countrey, that is to say, the Towns of <hi>Brill</hi> and <hi>Flushing,</hi> with the Fort of <hi>Ramekins.</hi> And more then so, as soon as the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> came amongst them, in the Head of this Army, which most ambitiously he affected for some other Ends; they put into his hands the absolute Government of these Provinces, gave him the Title of His Excellency, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally submitted to him with more outward cheerfulness than ever they had done to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> It is not to be thought, but that the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Discipline went on succesfully in those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, under this new Governor; who having countenanced them in <hi>England</hi> against the Laws, might very well afford them all his best assistances, when Law and Liberty seemed to speak in favour of it. But being there was nothing done by them, which was more than ordinary; as little more than ordinary could be done amongst them, after they had betrayed their Countrey to the Power of Strangers; We shall leave him to pursue their Warrs, and return for <hi>England,</hi> where we shall find the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> upon the point of acting the last part of her Tragedy.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Concerning which, it may not be unfit to recapitulate so much of Her story as may conduct us fairly to the knowledg of her present condition. Immediately on the death of Queen <hi>MARY,</hi> she had taken on her self the Title and Arms of <hi>England</hi>; which though she did pretend to have been done by the command of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:54836:167"/>
her Husband, and promised to disclaim them both in the Treaty of <hi>Edenborough</hi>; yet neither were the Arms obliterated in her Plate and Hangings, after the death of that Husband; nor would she ever ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and confirm that Treaty, as had been conditioned. On this first grudg, Queen <hi>ELIZABETH</hi> furni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heth the <hi>Scots</hi> both with Men and Arms, to expel the <hi>French</hi>; affords them such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure both of Money and Countenance, as made them able to take the Field against their Queen, to take her Prisoner, to depose her; and finally, to compel her to forsake the Kingdom. In which Extremity, she lands in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and casts her self upon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Queen <hi>ELIZABETH</hi>; by whom she was first confined to <hi>Carlisle,</hi> and afterwards committed to the custody of the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi> Upon the death of <hi>FRANCIS</hi> the Second, her first Husband, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> designed her for a Wife to his Eldest Son. But the Ambition of the young Prince spurred him on so fast, that he brake his Neck in the Career. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> was too great for a private Subject; of a Revenue not inferior to the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi>: insomuch that the Queen was counselled, when she came first to the Throne, either to take him for her Husband, or to cut him off. He is now drawn into the Snare, by being tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a hope of Marriage with the Captive-Queen; which <hi>Leicester</hi> and the rest, who had moved it to him, turned to his destruction. Don <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> had the like design, that by her Title he might raise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> To which end he recalled the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Soldiers out of <hi>Italy,</hi> to whose dismission he had yeelded when he first came to that Government; and thereby gave Q. <hi>ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH</hi> a sufficient colour to aid the Provinces against him. But his aspirings cost him deer; for he fell soon after. The <hi>Guisards</hi> and the Pope had another project, which was, To place her first on the Throne of <hi>England,</hi> and then to find an Husband of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Power to maintain her in it. For the effecting of which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the Pope commissionated his Priests and Jesuits; and the <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sards</hi> employed their Emissaries of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, by Poyson, Pistol, open Warr, or secret practises, to destroy the one, that so they might advance the other to the Regal Diadem.</p>
            <p n="14">14. With all these Practises and Designs, it was conceived that the Imprisoned Queen could not be ignorant; and many strong presumptions were discovered to convict her of it: Upon which grounds, the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> drew the form of an <hi>Association,</hi> by which he bound himself, and as many others as should enter into it, <hi>To make enquiry against all such persons as should attempt to invade the Kingdom, or raise Rebellion, or should attempt any evil against the Queen's Person, to do her any manner of hurt, from, or by whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that layed any claim to the Crown of England. And that, that Person by whom, or for whom they shall attempt any such thing, shall be altogether uncapable of the Crown, shall be deprived of all manner of Right thereto, and persecuted to the death by all the Queen's Loyal Subjects, in case they shall be found guilty of any such Invasion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54836:168"/>
or Treason, and should be so publickly declared.</hi> Which Band or Association, was confirmed in the Parliament of this year, ending the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March, Ann.</hi> 1585, exceedingly extolled for an Act of Piety, by those very men who seemed to abominate nothing more, than the like Combination made not long before between the Pope, the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> called the <hi>Holy League</hi>; which League was made for maintenance of the Religion then established in the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> and the excluding of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the rest of the House of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> from their succession to the Crown, as long as they continued Enemies to that Religion. The Brethren in this case not unlike the <hi>Lamiae,</hi> who are reported to have been stone-blind when they were at home, but more than Eagle-sighted when they went abroad. Put that they might not trust to their own strength only, Queen <hi>ELIZABETH</hi> tyes the <hi>French</hi> King to her, by investing him with the Robes and Order of St. <hi>George,</hi> called the Garter: She draws the King of <hi>Scots</hi> to unite himself unto her in a League Offensive and Defensive against all the World; and under colour of some danger to Religion by that <hi>Holy League</hi>; she brings all the Protestant Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> to confederate with her.</p>
            <p n="15">15. And now the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> is brought to a publick Tryal, accelerated by a new Conspiracy of <hi>Babington, Tichborn,</hi> and the rest; in which nothing was designed without her privity. And it is very strange to see how generally all sorts of people did contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her destruction; the <hi>English</hi> Protestants, upon an honest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of the Dangers to which the Person of their Queen was subject by so many Conspiracies: the <hi>Puritans,</hi> for fear lest she should bring in <hi>Popery</hi> again, if she came to the Crown: the <hi>Scots,</hi> upon the like conceit of over-throwing their Presbyteries, and ruinating the whole <hi>Machina</hi> of their Devices, if ever she should live to be Queen of <hi>England.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> and his Faction in the Court, had their Ends apart; which was, To bring the Imperial Crown of this Realm, by some means or other, into the Family of the <hi>Dudley</hi>'s. His Father had before designed it, by marrying his Son <hi>Guilford</hi> with the Lady <hi>Iane,</hi> descended from the younger Sister of K. <hi>HENRY</hi> the Eighth. And he projects to set it on the Head of the Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> who had married his Sister, and looked upon himself as the direct Heir of <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence.</hi> And that they might not want a Party of sufficient strength to advance their Interest, they make themselves the Heads of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> in the Court, and the Earl of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> in the Countrey. For him, he obtaineth of the Queen the command of the <hi>North,</hi> under the Title of <hi>Lord President of the Councel iu York,</hi> to keep out the <hi>Scots:</hi> and for himself, the Conduct of the <hi>English</hi> Armies which served in the Low-Countreys, to make sure of all. He takes a course also to remove the Imprisoned Queen from the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and commits her to the custody of <hi>Paulet,</hi> and <hi>Drury,</hi> two notorious <hi>Puritans,</hi> though neither of them were so base as to serve his turn, when he practised on them to assassinate her in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54836:168"/>
way. I take no pleasure in recounting the particulars of that Horrid Act, by which a Soveraign Queen, lawfully Crowned and Anointed, was brought to be arraigned before the Subjects of her nearest Kinswoman, or how she was convicted by them; what Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were devised to bring her to the fatal Block; or what dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations practised to palliate and excuse that Murther.</p>
            <p n="16">16. All I shall note particularly in this woful story, is the behaviour of the <hi>Scots,</hi> (I mean the <hi>Presbyters</hi>) who being required by the King to recommend her unto God in their publick Prayers, refused most unchristianly so to do, except only <hi>David Lindesay</hi> at <hi>Leith,</hi> and the King's own Chaplains. And yet the Form of Prayer prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, was no more than this, <hi>That it might please God to illuminate her with the Light of his Truth, and save her from the apparent danger wherein she was cast.</hi> On which default, the King appointed solemn Prayers to be made for her in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> on the third of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>; and nominates the Arch-bishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> to perform that Office. Which being understood by the Ministers, they stirred up one <hi>Iohn Cooper,</hi> a bold young man, and not admitted into Orders, of their own conferring to invade the Pulpit, before the Bishop had an opportunity to take the place: Which being noted by the King, he commanded him to come down, and leave the Pulpit to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, as had been appointed; or otherwise, to perform the Service which the Day required. To which the sawcy Fellow answered, That he would do therein <hi>according as the Spirit of God should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him in it.</hi> And then perceiving that the Captain of the Guard was coming to remove him thence, he told the King with the same impudence as before, <hi>That this day should be a witness against him in the Great Day of the Lord</hi>: And then denouncing a Wo to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> he went down; and the Bishop of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> entring the Pulpit, did the Duty required. For which intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Affront, <hi>Cooper</hi> was presently commanded to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords of the Council, and he took with him <hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Belcanqual,</hi> two of the Preachers of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> for his two Supporters: Where they behaved themselves with so little rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the two Ministers were discharged from preaching in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and <hi>Cooper</hi> was sent Prisoner to the Castle of <hi>Blackness.</hi> But so unable was the King to bear up against them, that having a great desire that <hi>Montgomery,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> might be absolved from the Censures under which he lay, he could no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise obtain it, than by releasing this <hi>Cooper,</hi> together with <hi>Gibson</hi> before-mentioned, from their present Imprisonment: which, though it were yeelded to by the King, upon condition that <hi>Gibson</hi> should make some acknowledgment of his Offence in the face of the Church; yet, after many triflings, and much tergiversation, he took his flight into <hi>England,</hi> where he became a useful Instrument in the Holy Cause.</p>
            <p n="17">17. For so it was, that notwithstanding the Promise made to Arch-bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> by <hi>Leicester, Walsingham,</hi> and the rest, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is said, they gave such encouragements under-hand to the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54836:169"/>
               <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that they resolved to proceed toward the putting of the Discipline in execution, though they received small counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in it from the Queen and Parliament. Nor were those great Persons altogether so unmindful of them, as not to entertain their Clamours, and promote their Petitions at the Council-Table, cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and thwarting the Arch-bishop whensoever any Cause which concerned the Brethren, had been brought before them. Which drew from him several Letters to the Lords of the Council, each syllable whereof, (for the great Piety and Modesty which appears in them) deserves to have been written in Letters of Gold. Now the sum of these Letters, as they are laid together by Sir <hi>George Paul,</hi> is as followeth.</p>
            <p n="18">18.
<q>God knows, (saith he) how desirous I have been from time to time, to have my doings approved by my ancient and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Friends: for which cause, since my coming to this place, I have done nothing of importance against these Sectaries, without good Advice. I have risen up early, and sate up late, to yeeld Reasons, and make Answer to their Contentions, and their Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Objections. And shall I now say, I have lost my labour? Or, shall my just dealing with disobedient and irregular persons, cause my former professed and ancient Friends to hinder my just proceedings, and make them speak of my doings, yea, and of my self, what they list? <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>An old Friend is better than a new</hi>: I trust those that love me indeed, will not so lightly cast off their old Friends, for any of these new-fangled and factious Sectaries, whose fruits are to make division, and to separate old and assured Friends. In my own private Affairs, I know I shall stand in need of Friends; but in these publick Actions, I see no cause why I should seek any, seeing they to whom the care of the Commonwealth is committed, ought of duty therein to joyn with me. And if my honourable Friends shall forsake me (especially in so good a Cause) and not put their helping-hand to the redress of these Enormities, (being indeed a matter of State, and not of the least moment) I shall think my coming unto this Place to have been for my punishment; and my hap very hard, that when I think to deserve best; and, in a manner, consume my self to satisfie that which God, Her Majesty, and the Church, requireth of me, I should be evilly rewarded. <hi>Sed meliora spero.</hi> It is objected, by some, that my desire of Uniformity, by way of Subscription, is for the better maintenance of my Book.

<q>I am further burthened with Wilfulness: I hope my Friends are better perswaded of me, to whose Consciences I appeal. It is strange that a man of my place, dealing by so good a warrant as I do, should be so encountred; and, for not yeelding, counted Wilful. But I must be content, <hi>Vincit qui patitur.</hi> There is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Wilfulness and Constancy.

<q>For my own part, I neither have done, nor do any thing in these matters, which I do not think my self in Conscience and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bound to do, and which Her Majesty hath not with earnest Charge committed unto me, and which I am not well able to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie to be most requisite for this Church and State; whereof, next to Her Majesty, (though most unworthy, if not most unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py) the chief Care is committed to me; which I will not (by the Grace of God) neglect, whatsoever come upon me there-for. Neither may I endure their notorious Contempts, unless I will become <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Block; and undo all that which hitherto hath been done. It is certain, that if way be given unto them, upon their unjust Surmises and Clamours; it will be the cause of that confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which hereafter the State will be sorry for.

So was <hi>Cyprian</hi> himself used, and other godly Bishops, to whom I am not comparable. But that which most of all grieveth me, and is to be wondered at and lamented, is, That some of those who give countenance to these men, and cry out for a Learned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, should watch their opportunity, and be Instruments and Means to place most unlearned men in the chiefest Places and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of the Ministry, thereby to make the state of the Bishops and Clergy contemptible, and, I fear, salable. This Hypocrisie and Dissembling with God and Man, (in pretending one thing, and doing another) goeth to my heart, and maketh me think, that God's Judgments are not far off. The day will come, when all mens hearts shall be opened. In the mean time, I will depend upon Him who never faileth those that put their trust in Him.</q>

            <p n="21">21. It may be gathered from this Abstract, what a hard Game that Reverend Prelate had to play, when such great Masters in the Art, held the Cards against him: For at that time the Earls of <hi>Huntington</hi> and <hi>Leicester, Walsingham</hi> Secretary of Estate, and <hi>Knolls</hi> Comptroller of the Houshold (a professed <hi>Genevian</hi>), were his open Adversaries; <hi>Burleigh,</hi> a Neutral at the best; and none but <hi>Hatton</hi> (then Vicechamberlain, and afterwards Lord Chancellor) firmly for him. And him he gained but lately neither; but gained him at the last by the means of Dr. <hi>Richard Bancroft,</hi> his Domestick Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, of whom we shall have cause to speak more hereafter. By his procurement he was called to the Council-Table, at such time as the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> was in <hi>Holland</hi>; which put him into a capacity of going more confidently on (without checks or crosses, as before) in the Church's Cause. A thing which <hi>Leicester</hi> very much stomack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his coming back; but knowing it was the Queen's pleasure, he disguised his trouble, and appeared fair to him in the publick, though otherwise he continued his former Favours to the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction. Sure of whose countenance, upon the perfecting and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of the Book of Discipline, they resolved to put the same in practise in most parts of the Realm, as they did accordingly. But it was no where better welcome, than it was in <hi>London,</hi> the Wealth and Pride of which City, was never wanting to cherish and support those men which most apparently opposed themselves to the present Authority, or practised the introducing of Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both in Church and State. The several Churches, or Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles rather, which they had in that City, they reduced into one
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:54836:170"/>
great and general Classis, of which <hi>Cartwright, Egerton,</hi> or <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi> were for the most part Moderators; and whatsoever was there ordered, was esteemed for current: from thence the Brethren of other places did fetch their light; and as doubts did arise, thither they were sent to be resolved; the Classical and Synodical Decrees of other places, not being Authentical indeed, till they were ratified in this, which they held the Supreme Consistory and chief Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of the Nation. But in the Countrey, none appeared more forward than they did in <hi>Northampton-shire,</hi> which they divide into three <hi>Classes</hi>; that is to say, the Classis of <hi>Northampton, Daventry,</hi> and <hi>Kettring</hi>: and the device forthwith is taken up in most parts of <hi>England,</hi> but especially in <hi>Warwick-shire, Suffolk, Norfolk, Essex</hi> &amp;c. In these <hi>Classes,</hi> they determined in points of Doctrine, interpreted hard places of Scripture, delivered their Resolution in such Cases of Conscience as were brought before them, decided Doubts and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties touching Contracts of Marriage. And whatsoever was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by such as were present (but still with reference to the better judgment of the <hi>London</hi>-Brethren) became forthwith bindi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At these Classes they enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Life and Doctrine of all that had subscribed unto them; censuring some, deposing others, as they saw occasion; in nothing more severe, than in censuring those who had formerly used the Cross in Baptism, or otherwise had been con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ormable to the Rules of the Church. And unto every Classis there belonged a Register, who took the Heads of all that passed, and saw them carefully entred in a Book for that purpose, that they might remain upon Record.</p>

It may seem strange, that in a constituted Church, backed by Authority of Law, and countenanced by the Favour of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magistrate; a distinct Government or Discipline should be put in practise in contempt of both: but more, that they should deal in such weighty matters as were destructive of the Government by Law established. Some Questions had before been started at a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> the final decision whereof, was thought fit to be referred to the <hi>Classis</hi> of <hi>Warwick,</hi> where <hi>Cartwright</hi> governed as the perpetual Moderator: And they accordingly assembling on the tenth day of the fourth Month, (for so they phrased it) did then and there determine in this manner follow:
<q>That private Baptism is unlawful: That it is not lawful to read Homilies in the Church: and that the sign of the Cross is not to be used in Baptism: That the Faithful ought not to communicate with unlearned Ministers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may be present at their Service, in case they come of purpose to hear a Sermon (the reading of the Service being look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as a Lay-man's Office): That the Calling of Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is unlawful: That, as they deal in Causes Ecclesiastical, there is no duty belonging to them, nor any publickly to be given them? That it is not lawful to be ordained by them into the Ministry, or to denounce either Suspensions or Excommunications sent by their Authority: that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54836:171"/>
it is not lawful for any man to rest in the Bishop's deprivation of him from his Charge, except upon consultation it seem good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Flock and the Neighbouring-Ministers; but that he continue in the same, until he be compelled to the contrary by Civil Force. That it is not lawful to appear in a Bishop's Court, but with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of their unlawfulness. That Bishops are not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged either for Doctors, Elders, or Deacons, as having no ordinary Calling in the Church of Christ. That touching the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration of the Ecclesiastical Discipline, it ought to be taught to the people (<hi>datâ occasione</hi>) as occasion should serve; and that as yet the people are not to be sollicited publickly to practise the Discipline, till they be better instructed in the knowledg of it. And finally, That men of better understanding are to be allured pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to the present allowing the Discipline, and the practise of it, as far as they shall be well able with the <hi>Peace of the Church.</hi>

            <p n="23">23. But here we are to understand, That this last Caution was subjoined in the close of all; not that they had a care of the <hi>Church</hi>'s <hi>Peace,</hi> but that they were not of sufficient strength to disturb the same, without drawing ruine on themselves; which some of the more hot-headed Brethren were resolved to hazzard: of which they had some loss this year, by the Imprisonment of <hi>Barrow, Greenwood, Billet, Boudler,</hi> and <hi>Studley</hi>; who building on their Principles, and following the Example of <hi>Robert Brown,</hi> before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, had brake out into open Schism, when their more cunning Brethren kept themselves within the Pale of the Church. But these we only touch at now, leaving the further prosecution of them to a fitter place: Suffice it, that their present sufferings did so little moderate the heats of some fiery spirits, that they resolved to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all for the Holy Discipline, as appears by <hi>Pain</hi>'s Letter unto <hi>Feild: Our zeal to Gods Glory</hi> (saith he), <hi>our love to his Church, and the due planting of the same in this For-headed Age, should be so warm and stirring in us, as not to care what adventure we give, or what censures we abide, &amp;c. For otherwise, the Diabolical boldness of the Iesuits and Seminaries, will cover our faces with shame,</hi> &amp;c. And then he adds, <hi>It is verily more than time to register the Names of the fittest and hottest Brethren round about our several dwellings, whereby to put the godly Counsel of</hi> Specanus <hi>in execution,</hi> (Note, that <hi>Specanus</hi> was one of the first Presbyterian Ministers in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches) that is to say, <hi>Si quis objiciat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If any man object, That the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the lawful practise of the Discipline in the Church, be hindred by the Civil Magistrate; let the Magistrate be freely and modestly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished of his duty in it; and if he esteem to be accounted either a Godly or Christian Magistrate, without doubt he will admit wholesome Counsels: but if he do not, yet let him be more exactly instructed, that he may serve God in fear, and lend his Authority in defence of God's Church and his Glory. Marry if by this way there happen no good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, then let the Ministers of the Church execute their Office according to the appointment of Christ: for they must rather obey God than men. In which last point,</hi> (saith <hi>Pain</hi>) <hi>we have dolefully failed, which
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54836:171"/>
now or never stands us in hand to prosecute with all celerity, without lingring or staying so long for Parliaments.</hi> But this Counsel of <hi>Paine</hi> being thought too rash, in regard they could not find a sufficient number of Brethren to make good the Action, it was thought fit to add the Caution above-mentioned. The Hundred thousand Hands which they so much bragged of, were not yet in readiness; and therefore it was wisely ordered, That as yet the whole multitude were not to be allured publickly to the practise of it, until men were better instructed in the knowledg of so rare a Mystery: Till when, it could not be safe for them to advance their Discipline in the way of force.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Now to prepare the people for the entertainment of so great a Change, it was found necessary in the first place to return an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to some Books which had been written in defence of <hi>Episcopal</hi> Government: and, in the next, to make the Bishops seem as odious and contemptible in the eyes of their Profelytes, as Wit and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice could devise.

For printing these pestiferous Libels, they chiefly made use of <hi>Walgrave</hi>'s Press, which he removed from place to place, for his greater safety; that is to say, at <hi>Moulsey,</hi> near <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Thames</hi>; thence to <hi>Fausly</hi> in <hi>Northampton-shire,</hi> so to <hi>Norton</hi>; afterwards to <hi>Coventry,</hi> and so to <hi>Welstome</hi> in <hi>Warwick-shire</hi>; and from thence, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, to the Town of <hi>Manchester,</hi> where both the Work-men and the Press were seized on by the Earl of <hi>Darby,</hi> as they were Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bold Pamphlet, called <hi>More Work for Cooper.</hi> For the dispersing of these Libels, they made use of one <hi>Newman,</hi> a Cobler, a Fellow fit for such a business; and it had been great pity if they had employed any other Instrument. But for their countenance and support, (especially as to the bearing of their Charges) they had the Purse of <hi>Knightly</hi> of <hi>Fausley,</hi> (at whose House some of them were Printed) being a Gentleman of good Note, but of greater Zeal, whom <hi>Snape,</hi> and other Leading-men of that County, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled to them. But he and all the rest might have payed deer for it, if he whom they most wronged, had not stood their Friend: For, being called into the Starr-Chamber, and there deeply Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, they were upon submission, at the humble and most earnest suit of the Arch-Bishop, released from their Imprisonment, and their Fines remitted.

At what time they conceived, and that not improbably, that the Queen and Council would be otherwise busied, than to take notice of their Practises, or suppress their doings; or rather, that they durst not call them into question for their Words or Actions, for fear of alienating the Affections of so strong a Party as they had raised un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themselves. The serious apprehension of which mischievous Counsels, prevailed so far on <hi>Leicester</hi> and <hi>Walsingham,</hi> that they did absolutely renounce any further intercession for them; professing, That they had been horribly abused with their Hypocrisie; which possibly might happen better for themselves, than it did for the Church; the Earl of <hi>Leicester going to his own Place,</hi> before the end of this Year; and <hi>Walsingham</hi> being gathered to his Fathers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Two years after.</p>

Behold the Bishops and Clergy in their Convocation, and we shall see them termed by one of the Captains of this Crew, <hi>Right puissant, poysoned, persecuting, and terrible Priests, Clergie Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Confocation-House, the Holy-League of Subscription, the Crew of monstrous and ungodly Wretches, that mingle Heaven and Earth together: Horned Monsters of the Conspiration-House: An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian Swinish Rabble, Enemies of the Gospel, most covetous wretched Popish priests, and the Convocation-House of Devils, and</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub <hi>of</hi> Canterbury <hi>the chief of these Devils.</hi> The like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches they bestow on the Common-Prayer, of which they say, That <hi>it is full of Corruption; and that many of the Contents thereof, are against the Word of God; the Sacraments wickedly mangled and prophaned therein, the Lord's Supper not eaten, but made a Pageant or Stage-play; and that the Form of publick Baptism, is full of Childish Superstitious Toys.</hi> So that we are not to admire, if the <hi>Brownists</hi> please themselves in their separation from a Church so polluted and unreformed, from men so wicked and prophane, from <hi>such a Cinque of Satan,</hi> such a <hi>Den of Devils.</hi> But much less can we wonder that the Papists should make use of these horrible Slanders, not only to confirm, but encrease their Party, By shewing them, from the Pens of their greatest Adversaries, what ugly Monsters had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:54836:173"/>
of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; from what Impieties they were preserved, by not joyning with them. One, I am sure, that is, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> in his Book of <hi>Three Conversions,</hi> reports these Calumnies and Slanders for undoubted Truths; That <hi>Martin Mar-Prelate</hi> is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Sir <hi>Edwine Sandys,</hi> to pass in those times for unquestion'd Credit in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; his Authority much insisted on to disgrace this Church; and finally, that <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Kellison,</hi> one of later date, doth build as much upon the Credit of these Libels, to defame the Clergy, as if they had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated by the same Infallible Spirit which the Pope pretends to. Such excellent Advantages did these Saints give unto the Devil, that all the <hi>Locusts</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> which <hi>came out of the Pit,</hi> never created so much scandal to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times.</p>
            <p n="28">28. To still these Clamours, or at the least to stop the mouths of these Railing <hi>Rabshecha's,</hi> that so the abused people on all sides might be undeceived; as good a course was took by <hi>Whitgift</hi> and the rest of the Prelates, as Human Wisdom could devise. For first, A grave Discourse is published in the year next following, entituled, <hi>An Admonition to the People of England,</hi> in answer to the slanderous Untruths of <hi>Martin</hi> the Libeller: But neither this nor any other grave Refutal, would ever put them unto silence, till they were undertaken by <hi>Tom Nash,</hi> a man of a Sarcastical and jeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wit; who by some Pamphlets written in the like loose way, which he called, <hi>Pasquill,</hi> and <hi>Marsorius, The Counter-Scuffle, Pappe with a Hatchet,</hi> and the like; stopped their mouths for ever, none of them daring to deal further in that Commodity, when they saw what Coyn they should be paid in by so frank a Customer. Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made before of a sorry Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>The Complaint of the Commons for a Preaching-Ministry</hi>; which <hi>Penry</hi> seconded by another called by the Name of, A <hi>Supplication</hi> for Preaching in <hi>Wales</hi>: In both which it was intimated to all sorts of people, That the Gospel had no free passage amongst us: That there was no care taken for Preaching the Word of God for the instruction of the people; for want whereof they still remained in darkness and the shadow of death. For the decrying of which scandalous and leud suggestions, Order was given unto the Bishops to take the Names and Number of the Preachers in their several Diocesses, and to present a true and perfect Catalogue of them, in the Convocation, which was then at hand. By which Returns it will appear, That at this time when so much noise was made for want of Preaching, there were within the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and the Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> no fewer than Seven thousand four hundred sixty three Preachers and Catechisers; which last may be accounted the best sort of Preachers for the instruction of the people. Of which great Number there were found to be no fewer than One hundred forty five Doctors in Divinity, Three hundred forty eight Batchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54836:173"/>
of Divinity, Thirty one Doctors of both Laws, Twenty one Batchelors of the same; Eighteen hundred Masters in Arts, Nine hundred forty six Batchelors of Arts, and Two thousand seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred forty six Catechisers. So that neither the number of bare Reading-Ministers was so great, nor the want of Preaching so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable, in most parts of the Kingdom, as those Pamphlets made it; the Authors whereof ought rather to have magnified the Name of God for sending such a large Encrease of Labourers in his Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Husbandry, as could not any where be parallel'd in so short a time; there passing no more than Thirty years between the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Reign, and the rendring of this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the Convocation.</p>
            <p n="29">29. And that the Parliament might receive the same satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a most excellent and judicious Sermon was Preached at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross, on <hi>Sunday</hi> the ninth of <hi>February,</hi> being the first <hi>Sunday</hi> after their Assembling, by Dr. <hi>Richard Bancroft,</hi> being then Chaplain to the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hatton,</hi> preferred within some few years after to the See of <hi>London,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Canterbury.</hi> In the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which Service, he selected for the Theam or Subject of his Discourse, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.1. viz. <hi>Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they be of God: for many false prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> In canvasing which Text, he did so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently set forth the false Teachers of those times in their proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, their Railing against Bishops, their Ambition, their Self-love, their Covetousness, and all such Motives as had spurred them on to disturb this Church, as satisfied the greatest part of that huge Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, touching the Practises and Hypocrisies of these holy Brethren. He also shewed on what a weak Foundation they had built their Discipline, of which no tract or footsteps could be found in the Church of Christ from the Apostles days to <hi>Calvin</hi>; and with what Infamy the <hi>Aerian</hi> Hereticks were reproached in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, for labouring to introduce that Parity which these men designed. He further laid before them the great danger which must needs ensue, if private men should take upon them to deny or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute such matters as had been setled in the Church by so good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: Against which troublesome Humour many Provisions had been made by the Canons of Councils, and the Edicts of Godly and Religious Emperors. To which he added, the necessity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Subscription, in a Church well constituted, by all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the same; which he justified by the example of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Germauy,</hi> to be the best way to <hi>try the spirits whether they be of God or not,</hi> as his Text required. Next, he insisted on the excellency of the Common-Prayer-Book, applauded by the Divines of Foreign Churches; approved by <hi>Bucer, Fox, Alesius,</hi> the Parliaments and Convocations of this Kingdom; and after, justified by Arch-bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> against the Papists; by Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> against <hi>Knox</hi>; and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others: showing withall, the many gross Absurdities found in <hi>extemporary</hi> Prayers, to the great dishonour of God, and the shame of Religion. Hence he proceeds to justifie the Superiority of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54836:174"/>
and the Supremacy of the Queen, together with the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Practises and Designs of the Disciplinarians, exemplified by their Proceedings in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and their Positions in <hi>England,</hi> of which more anon. All which particulars, with many more upon the by, he proved with such evidence of demonstration, such great variety of Learning, and strength of Arguments, that none of all that Party could be found to take Arms against them, in defence either of their leud <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or more scandalous <hi>Vses.</hi> And this being done, he closed up all with a grave and serious Application, in reference to the prevalency and malignity of the present Humours: which wrought so much upon his Auditors of both Houses of Parliament, that in the passing of a general Pardon at the end of the Sessions, there was Exception <hi>of Seditious Books, Disturbances of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and Offences against the Act of Vniformity in the Worship of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="30">30. And yet it is not altogether improbable, but that this Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made rather at the Queen's Command, or by some Caveat interposed by the House of Peers, than by the sole Advice, or any voluntary Motion of the House of Commons; in which the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> at that time had a very strong Party. By whose Endeavour, a smart Petition is presented to the Lords, in the Name of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, for rectifying of many things which they conceived to be amiss in the state of the Church. The whole Petition did consist of Sixteen particulars, of which the first Six did relate to a Preaching-Ministry; the want of which, was much complained of in a Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which had been lately Printed and presented to them; but such a Supplication, as had more in it of a Factious and Seditious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, than of a Dutiful Remonstrance. In the other Ten it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
<q>1. That no Oath or Subscription might be tendred to any at their entrance into the Ministry, but such as was prescribed by the Statutes of the Realm, and the Oath against corrupt Entring. 2. That they may not be troubled for omission of some Rites or Offices prescribed in the Book of Common-Prayer. 3. That such as had been suspended or deprived for no other offence, but only for not subscribing, might be restored. 4. That they may not be called and urged to answer before the Officials and Commissaries, but before the Bishops themselves. 5. That they might not be called into the High Commission, or Moot of the Diocess where they lived, except for some notable Offence. 6. That it might be permitted to them, in every Arch-Deaconry, to have some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Exercises and Conferences amongst themselves, to be limited and prescribed by the Ordinaries. 7. That the high Censure of Excommunication may not be denounced or executed for small matters: 8. Nor by Chancellors Commissioners or Officials, but by the Bishops themselves, with the assistance of grave persons. 9. That Non-residency may be quite removed out of the Church. Or, 10. That at least, according to the Queen's Injunctions (<hi>Art.</hi> 44.), no Non-resident, having already a License or Faculty, may enjoy it, unless he depute an able Curate, that may weekly Preach and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54836:174"/>
Catechise, as was required by Her Majesty in the said Injunctions.</q>
Against the violence of this Torrent, Arch-bishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed both his Power and Reason; affirming with a sober confidence in the H. of Peers, not only that <hi>England</hi> flourished more at that time with able Ministers, than ever it had done before; but that it had more able men of eminent Abilities in all parts of Learning, than the rest of <hi>Christendom</hi> besides. But, finding that the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and others of that House, had been made of the Party, he drew the rest of the Bishops to joyn with him in an humble Address to Her Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty; in which they represented to Her the true estate of the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, together with those many Inconveniences which must needs arise to the State present and to come, to the Two Universities, to all Cathedral Churches, and the Queen Her Self, if the Commons might have had their will, though in no other Point than in that of Pluralities. All which they prest with such a Dutiful and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Gravity, that the Queen put an end to that Dispute, not only for the present, but all Parliaments following.</p>
            <p n="31">31. Somewhat there must be in it, which might make them so afraid of that Subscription which was required at their hands to the Queen's Supremacy, as well as to the Consecration of Arch-bishops and Bishops, to the Liturgy, and to the Articles of Religion by Law established: and therefore it will not be amiss (as we have done already in all places else) to touch upon the Principles and Positions of our <hi>English Puritans,</hi> that we may see what Harmony and Consent there is betwixt them and their dear Brethren of the Discipline in other Nations: For if we look into the Pamphlets which came out this Year, we shall find these Doctrines taught for more Sacred Truths, viz. <hi>That if Princes do hinder them that seek for this Discipline, they are Tyrants both to the Church and Ministers; and being so, may be deposed by their Subjects. That no Civil Magistrate hath pre-eminence by ordinary Authority, either to determine of Church-Causes, or to make Ecclesiastical Orders and Ceremonies. That no Civil Magistrate hath such Authority, as that without his consent it should not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Ecclesiastical persons to make and publish Church-Orders. That they which are no Elders of the Church, have nothing to do with the Government of it. That if their Reformation be not hastned forward by the Magistrate, the Subjects ought not any longer to tarry for it, but must do it themselves. That there were many thousands which desired the Discipline: And, That great Troubles would ensue if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them. That their Presbyteries must prevail: And, That if it be brought about by such ways and means as would make the Bishops hearts to ake, let them blame themselves.</hi> For explication of which last passage, <hi>Martin Mar-Prelate</hi> in his first Book, threatens only <hi>fists</hi>; but in the second, he adviseth the Parliament then assembled, <hi>to put down Lord Bishops, and bring in the Reformation which they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, whether Her Majesty would or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="32">32. But these perhaps were only the Evaporations of some idle Heads, the Freaks of Discontent and Passion, when they were cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in their Desires: Let us see therefore what is taught by <hi>Thomas
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:54836:175"/>
Cartwright,</hi> the very <hi>Calvin</hi> of the <hi>English</hi>; as highly magnified by <hi>Martin,</hi> and the rest of that Faction, as the other was amongst the <hi>French.</hi> Dr. <hi>Harding</hi> in his Answer to Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> assures us, That the Office of a King is the same in all places, not only amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but amongst the Heathen. Upon which Premises he concludes, That a Christian Prince hath no more to do in deciding of Church-matters, or in making Ceremonies and Orders for the same, than hath a Heathen. <hi>Cartwright</hi> affirms himself to be of the same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; professing seriously his dislike of all such Writers as put a difference between the Rights of a Prophane and a Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. <hi>Specanus,</hi> a stiff <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces, makes a distinction between <hi>potestas Facti,</hi> and <hi>potestas Iuris</hi>; and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers upon the same, That the Authority of determining what is fit to be done, belongs of right unto the Ministers of the Church, though the execution of the Fact in Civil Causes, doth properly appertain to the Supreme Magistrate. And more than this, the greatest Clerks amongst themselves would not give the Queen. If she assume unto Her self the exercise of Her farther Power, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Matters of the Church according to the lawful Authority which is inherent in the Crown, She shall presently be compared unto all the wicked Kings, and others, of whom we read in the Scriptures; that took upon them, unlawfully to intrude themselves into the Priest's Office; as unto <hi>Saul,</hi> for his offering of Sacrifice; unto <hi>Osias</hi> for burning Incense upon the Altar; unto <hi>Gideon,</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an <hi>Ephod</hi>: and finally, to <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> for offering with strange fire unto the Lord.</p>
            <p n="33">33. According to these Orthodox and sound Resolves, they hold a Synod in St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Colledg in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> taking the opportunity of <hi>Sturbridg</hi>-Fayr, to cloak their meeting for that purpose. At which Synod (<hi>Cartwright</hi> and <hi>Perkins</hi> being present amongst the rest) the whole Book-Discipline, reviewed by <hi>Traverse,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally approved of by the Brethren in their several Classes, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a more Authentick approbation: insomuch, that first it was decreed amongst them, That all which would might subscribe unto it, without any necessity imposed upon them so to do. But not long after, it was made a matter necessary, so necessary, as it seems that no man could be chosen to any Ecclesiastical Office amongst them, nor to be of any of their Assemblies, either Classical, Provincial, or National, till he had first subscribed to the Book of Discipline. Another <hi>Synod</hi> was held at <hi>Ipswich,</hi> not long after, and the Results of both confirmed in a Provincial and National Synod held in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which gave the Book of Discipline a more sure establishment than an Act of State. It is reported, that the night before the great Battel in the Fields of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> betwixt <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> the <hi>Pompeyan</hi> Party was so confident of their good success, that they cast Dice amongst themselves for all the great Offices and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracies of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> even to the Office of the Chief-Priest-hood, which then <hi>Caesar</hi> held. And the like vanity or infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation had possessed these men, in the opinion which they had of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:54836:175"/>
their Strength and Numbers: Insomuch that they entred into this consideration, how Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Chancellors, Deans, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Arch-Deacons, Commissaries, Registers, Apparitors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (all which, by their pretended Reformation, must have been thrust out of their Livings) should be provided for, that the Commonwealth might not be thereby pestered with Beggars. And this they did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the confidence of some unlawful Assistance to effect their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, if neither the Queen, nor the Lords of the Council, nor the Inferior Magistrates in their several Counties (all which they now sollicited with more heat than ever) should co-operate with them. For about this time it was, that <hi>Cartwright</hi> in his Prayer before his Sermon, was noted to have used these words, viz. <hi>Because they</hi> (meaning the Bishops) <hi>which ought to be Pillars in the Church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine themselves against Christ and his Truth; therefore, O Lord, give us Grace and Power, all, as one man, to set our selves against them.</hi> Which words he used frequently to repeat, and to repeat with such an earnestness of spirit, as might sufficiently declare that he had a purpose to raise Sedition in the State, for the imposing of that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline on the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which was not likely to be countenanced by any lawful Authority; which put the Queen to a necessity of calling him, and all the rest of them, to a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; to which they shall be brought in the years next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p n="33">33. In the mean time we must pass over into <hi>France,</hi> where we find <hi>HENRY</hi> the Third, the last King of the House of <hi>Valoise,</hi> most miserably deprived of his Life and Kingdom; driven out of <hi>Paris</hi> first by the <hi>Guisian</hi> Faction; and afterwards assassinated by <hi>Iaques Clement,</hi> a Dominican Fryar, as he lay at St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reduction of that stubborn City. Upon whose death the Crown descended lineally on <hi>HENRY</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Vendosme,</hi> as the next Heir-male: For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of which Prince, and the rest of that House, the <hi>Holy League</hi> was first contrived, as before is said. There was at that time in the late King's Army, a very strong Party of <hi>French Catholicks,</hi> who had preferred their Loyalty to their Natural Prince, before the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Interest and Designs of the House of <hi>Guise</hi>; and now general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare in favour of the true Successor. By their Assistance, and the concurring-Forces of the <hi>Hugonot</hi>-Faction, it had been no hard matter for him to have Mastered the Duke of <hi>Maine,</hi> who then had the Command of the <hi>Guisian Leagues.</hi> But in the last he found himself deceived of his expectation. The <hi>Hugonots,</hi> which formerly had served with so much cheerfulness under his Command their King, would not now serve him in his just and lawful Warrs against his Enemies: Or, if they did, it shall be done upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions so intolerable, that he might better have pawned his Crown to a Forreign Prince, than on such terms to buy the favour of his Subjects. They looked upon him as reduced to a great necessity; most of the Provinces, and almost all the Principal Cities, having before engaged against <hi>HENRY</hi> the Third, and many others falling off
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:54836:176"/>
when they heard of his death. So that they thought the new King was not able to subsist without them; and they resolved to work their own Ends out of that Necessity. Instead of leading of their Armies, and running cheerfully and couragiously towards his defence, who had so oft defended them, they sent Commissioners or Delegates to negotiate with him, that they may know to what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions he would yeeld for their future advantage, before they acted any thing in order to his preservation: and their Conditions were so high, so void of all Respects of Loyalty, and even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Honesty, that he conceived it safer for him, and far more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in it self, to cast himself upon the Favour of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> than condescend to their unreasonable and unjust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. So that, in fine, the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> to a very great number, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook him most disloyally in the open Field, drew off their Forces, and retired to their several dwellings, inforcing him to the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of imploring succours from the professed Enemies of his Crown and Nation. Nor did he find the Queen unwilling to supply him both with Men and Money on his first desires. For which She had better reason now, than when She aided him and the rest of the <hi>French Hugonots,</hi> in their former Quarrels. And this She did with such a cheerful openness both of Heart and Hand, as did not only make him able to keep the Field, but to gain ground on the untra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable and insulting Rebels. Which when the <hi>Hugonots</hi> observed, and saw that he was like enough to do well without them, they then came freely to his aid, and were content to take such terms as he pleased to give them.</p>
            <p n="34">
               <note place="margin">1587.</note>34. And now again we are for <hi>Scotland,</hi> where we shall find the King's Affairs grown from bad to worse. We left him in a great vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for not being able to prevail in any thing in behalf of <hi>Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery,</hi> unless he relinquished his pursuit against <hi>Gibson</hi> and <hi>Cooper.</hi> For so it was, that he must do and suffer more than he had done hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, before he could give himself any hopes of living peaceably amongst them. A Parliament is therefore summoned to be held at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> in the end of <hi>Iuly:</hi> In which he was contented to pass some Acts for ratifying all Laws made in his Minority, in favour of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for trying and censuring the Adversaries of true Religion; as also, for the punishing of such as did menace or invade the Ministers. But that which gave them most content, was an Act of Parliament for Annexing of all the Temporalties of Bishopricks, Abbeys, and other Religious Houses, which had not otherwise been disposed of to the Crown of that Realm; which they promoted under colour of improving the Royal Patrimony, that the King might have Means to bear forth the Honour of his Estate, and not trouble his Subjects with Taxations; but in plain truth, to overthrow the Calling and Estate of Bishops, which they presumed that no man of Quality would accept, when the Lands were aliened. And this the King was the more willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to, in regard that he had been perswaded by some about him, That the Episcopal Houses being reserved out of that Grant, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:54836:176"/>
with the Tythes of the Churches formerly annexed to their Benefices, would be sufficient to maintain their Dignity in some fit proportion. But the King soon found himself abused: For the rest of the Temporalties which formerly had been disposed of amongst the Laity, being setled and confirmed upon them in the present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, there remained so little to the Crown by this Annexation, as left him nothing behind, but the envy of so high a Sacriledg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the gain and benefit whereof was injoyed by others. And of that little which remained unto him by the Annexation, he received very small contentment, most of it being squandered away by some begging Courtiers till he had left himself unable to reward or gratifie a deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Minister. But this he did not find till it was too late; though the disease was past all remedy, had he found it sooner. But what he could not do himself when he lived in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he first commended to the doing of his Son Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> in his Book called <hi>Basilicon Doron</hi>; and after lived to see it remedied, in part, when he reigned in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="35">35. There hapned also a Dispute in the present Parliament, betwixt the Ministers of the Kirk, and such of the Gentry as formerly had possessed themselves of Abbeys and Priories, and thereby challenged to themselves a place in Parliament: Concerning which we are to know, that most of the Monasteries and Religious Houses, had been founded upon Tythes and Impropriations, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some good proportion of Demesnes, which were laid unto them. But when the <hi>Scots</hi> were set upon the humour of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and set upon it in a way which shewed them rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon private Ends, than the publick Interest of Religion; the principal men amongst them seized on all which they could lay hands on, and after kept it to themselves by no better Title than that of the first Usurpation only, and no more than so. Some of the Bishops and Abbots also, seeing how things were like to go, and that the Church's Patrimony was not like to hold in the same Successions which had conveyed it unto them, dismembred the best Tythes and Mannors from them, or otherwise resigned the whole to the hands of such as appeared most able to protect them. And so it stood, till <hi>Murrey</hi> was made Regent of the Realm in the King's first Infancy; who did not only wink at those Usurpations, (the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning whereof would most infallibly have estranged the Occupants from adhering to him) but suffered many of the Layards and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to invade the Tythes, which had not formerly been appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to Religious Houses, and to annex them to the rest of their own Estates. By means whereof, some of them were possessed of six, ten, twelve, or twenty Tythings, united into one Estate, as they lay most convenient for them. The Ministers being put off with beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly stipends, amounting in few places to ten pounds <hi>per annum</hi> of good <hi>English</hi> money. These, with the rest, they called the <hi>Lords of new erection</hi>; and they did Lord it over the poor people with pride and tyranny enough; For, neither would they suffer the Occupant or Land-holder to carry away his nine parts of the Fruits, till
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:54836:177"/>
they had taken off their Tenth; and sometimes out of spight, or self-will, or any other pestant humour, would suffer their tenth part to lye at waste in the open Field, that the poor Labourer of the Earth might suffer the more damage by it. But that which did most grieve the Ministers in the present exigent, was, That such Lairds and Gentlemen as had robbed the Church, and plumed their own Nests with the Feathers of it, should sit and vote in Parliament as Spiritual Persons, and they themselves be quite excluded from those publick Councils. A great heat hereupon was struck in the present Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by <hi>Pont</hi> and <hi>Lindsey,</hi> commissionated by the Kirk for that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; who openly propounded, in the Name of the Kirk, That the said pretended Prelates might be removed at the present, and disabled for the time to come, to sit in Parliament, as having no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the Church, and most of them no Function or Calling in it. <hi>Bruce,</hi> Commendator of <hi>Kinlosse,</hi> was chosen for the mouth of the rest; and he appeared so strongly in it, that the Petition of the Ministers was referred to the Lords of the Articles, and by them rejected; though afterwards they had their Ends in it, by a follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parliament.</p>
            <p n="36">36. Being made secure from any further fear of Bishops, by reason of the Poor Submission which was made by <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and the annexing of Arch-bishops Lands to the Royal Patrimony; the Ministers became more insolent and imperious than they had been formerly; and in that jolly humour they so vexed and terrified him, that he could find no other way in point of King-craft, to preserve himself against their insolences and attempts, but by giving some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Popish party. The exercise whereof brought out many Priests and Jesuits; some of them more particularly to negotiate in behalf of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was then a setting forward his great <hi>Armada.</hi> But the King well knowing of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence that imployment was, and how destructive of his Interest to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> commanded them by publick Proclamation to avoid the Kingdom. But withal gave them day till the last of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> that they might not complain of being taken unprovided: Which small Indulgence so offended the unquiet brethren, that they called a number of Noble-men, Barons, and Commissioners of <hi>Burg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (without so much as asking the King's leave in it) to meet at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> on the sixt of <hi>February,</hi> to whom they represented the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches dangers, and thereupon agreed to go all together in a full body to the Court, to attend the King; to the end that by the terror of so great a company, they might work him to their own desires. But the King hearing of their purpose, refused to give access to so great a multitude; but signified withall that he was ready to give audience unto some few of them which should be chosen by the rest. But this affront the King was forced to put up also, to pass by the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that Convention, to acknowledg their grievances to be just, and to promise a redress thereof in convenient time. Which drew him into Action against <hi>Maxwel</hi> and some others of the Popish Lords and for the same received the publick thanks of the next Assembly,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:54836:177"/>
that being no ordinary favour in them; and was so far gratified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as to be suffered to take Mr. <hi>Patrick Galloway</hi> from his Charge in <hi>Perth,</hi> to be one of the Preachers at the Court. Of which particular I had perhaps took little notice, but that we are to hear more of him on some other occasion.</p>
            <p n="37">37. The next fine pranck they plaid, relates to the Crowning of Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> with whom the King landed out of <hi>Denmark</hi> at the Port of <hi>Leith,</hi> on the 20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1590. aud designed her Coronation on the morrow after. None of the Bishops being at hand, the King was willing to embrace the opportunity to oblige the Kirk, by making choice of one of their own Brethren, to perform that Ceremony; to which he nominated Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> a Preacher at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and one of the most moderate men in a whole As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly. But when the fitness of it came to be examined by the rest of the Brethren, it was resolved to pretermit the Unction (or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing of Her) as a <hi>Iewish</hi> Ceremony, abolished by Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored into Christian Kingdoms by the Pope's Authority, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be continued in a Church Reformed. The Doubt first started by one <hi>Iohn Davinson,</hi> who had then no Charge in the Church, though followed by a Company of ignorant and seditious people, whom <hi>Andrew Melvin</hi> set on work to begin the Quarrel, and then stood up in his defence to make it good. Much pains was taken to convince them by the Word of God, That the Unction, or Annointing of Kings, was no <hi>Iewish</hi> Ceremony: but <hi>Melvin</hi>'s Will was neither to be ruled by Reason, nor subdued by Argument; and he had there so strong a Party, that it passed in the Negative. Insomuch that <hi>Bruce</hi> durst not proceed in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, for fear of the Censures of the <hi>Kirk.</hi> The King had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, and returns this word, That if the Coronation might not be performed by <hi>Bruce,</hi> with the wonted Ceremonies, he would stay till the coming of the Bishops, of whose readiness to conform therein, he could make no question. Rather than so, said <hi>Andrew Melvin,</hi> let the Unction pass: better it was that a Minister should perform that honourable Office, in what Form soever, than that the Bishops should be brought again unto the Court upon that occasion. But yet, unwilling to prophane himself by consenting to it, he left them to agree about it, as to them seemed best; and he being gone, it was concluded by the major part of the Voices, That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing should be used. According whereunto, the Queen was Crowned and Annointed on the Sunday following, with the wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ceremonies, but certainly with no great State; there being so short an interval betwixt Her Landing, and the appointed day of Her Coronation.</p>
            <p n="38">38. It was not long before,<note place="margin">1591</note> that they had a quarrel with the Lords of the Session, touching the Jurisdiction of their several Courts; but now the Assembly would be held for the chief Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal. One <hi>Graham</hi> was conceived to have suborned a publick Notary to forge an Instrument, which the Notary confessed on Examination, to have been brought to him ready drawn, by one
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:54836:178"/>
of the said <hi>Graham</hi>'s Brethren. <hi>Graham</hi> enraged thereat, enters an Action against <hi>Sympson,</hi> the Minister of <hi>Sterling,</hi> as one who had induced the man, by some sinister Practises, to make that Confession. The Action being entred, and the Process formed, <hi>Sympson</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains to the Assembly, and they give Order unto <hi>Graham</hi> to appear before them, to answer upon the scandal raised on one of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. <hi>Graham</hi> appears, and tells them, That he would make good his Accusation before competent Judges, which he conceived not them to be. And they replyed, That he must either stand to their judgment in it, or else be censured for the slander. The Lords of the Session hereupon interpose themselves, desiring the Assembly not to meddle in a Cause which was then dependent in their Court in due form of Law. But the Assembly made this Answer, That <hi>Sympson</hi> was a Member of theirs: That they might proceed in the purgation of one of their own number, without intrenching on the Jurisdiction of the Civil Courts; and therefore, that their Lordships should not take it ill, if they proceeded in the Tryal. But let the Lords of the Session, or the Party interested in the Cause, say what they pleased, the Assembly vote themselves to be Judges in it, and were resolved to proceed to a Sentence against him as a false Accuser. In fine, the business went so high on the part of the Kirk, that the Lords of the Session were compelled to think of no other Victory than by making a drawn Battel of it; which by the Mediation of some Friends was at last effected.</p>
            <p n="39">39. The Kirk is now advancing to the highest pitch of her <hi>Scotch</hi> Happiness, in having her whole Discipline, that is to say, their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and Provincial Assemblies, together with their Presbyteries and Parochial Sessions; confirmed by the Authority of an Act of Parliament. In order whereunto, they had ordained in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly held at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> on the 4th of <hi>August, Anno</hi> 1590. That <hi>all such as then bore Office in the Kirk, or from thenceforth should bear any Office in it, should actually subscribe to the Book of Discipline.</hi> Which Act being so material to our present History, deserves to be exemplified <hi>verbatim,</hi> as it stands in the Registers, and is this that followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. 4. 1590.</note>40. Forasmuch that it is certain, That the Word of God cannot be kept in the own sincerity, without the <hi>Holy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi> be had in observance: It is therefore by the common consent of the whole Brethren and Commissioners present, concluded, That whosoever hath born Office in the Ministry of the Kirk within this Realm, or that presently bears, or shall hereafter bear Office therein, shall be charged by every particular Presbytery, where their residence is, to subscribe the Heads of the Discipline of the Kirk of their Realm, at length set down and allowed by Act of the whole As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, in the Book of Polity, which is registrate in the Assembly-Books, and namely the Heads controverted by Enemies of the Discipline of the Reformed Kirk of this
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:54836:178"/>
Realm, betwixt this and the next Synodal Assemblies of the Provinces, under the pain of Excommunication to be executed against the Non-subscribers: and the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which shall be found remiss and negligent herein, to receive publick rebuke of the whole Assembly. And to the effect the said Discipline may be known as it ought to be, to the whole Brethren; it is ordained, That the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator of each Presbytery shall receive from the Clerk of the Assembly, a Copy of the said Book, under his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, upon the Expences of the Presbytery, betwixt this and the first day of <hi>September</hi> next to come, under the pain of being openly accused in the face of the whole Assembly.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="41">41. This Preparation being made, they present their whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to the King, in the following Parliament, convened at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> in the Month of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1592. In which it was proposed,
<q>1. That the Acts of Parliament made in the year 1584, against the Discipline of the Kirk, and the Liberty thereof, should be abrogated and annulled; and a Ratification of the Discipline granted, whereof they were then in practise. 2. That the Act of Annexation should be repealed, and restitution made of the Church's Patrimony. 3. That the Abbots, Priors, and other Prelates, bearing the Titles of Kirk-men, and giving Voices for the Kirk without Power and Commission from the same, should not be permitted in time coming, to give Voice in Parliament, or convene in the Name of the Kirk. And, 4. That a solid Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might be taken for purging the Realm of Idolatry and Blood, wherewith it was miserably polluted.</q>
On the second and third of these Desires, the King took longer time of deliberation, as being points of great concernment to Himself and others, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the main of their Estates. But He resolved to give them satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the first and last. It was answered therefore to the first part of the last Article, <hi>That saying of Mass, receiving of Iesuits, Seminary Priests, and Trafficking Papists, against the King's Majesty and Religion presently professed, should be a just cause to infer the pain of Treason:</hi> with this Proviso notwithstanding, <hi>That if the Iesuits and Seminary Priests did satisfie the Prince and the Church, the foresaid Penalty should not be laid on the Receivers.</hi> And to the second part thereof, concerning Blood, it was answered, That the same should be remitted to the Courts of Justice. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it was answered to the first branch of their first Proposal, <hi>That the said Statutes should be no ways prejudicial, nor derogatory to the Priviledges that God had given to the spiritual Office-bearer in the Church, concerning Heads of Religion, matters of Heresie, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, Collation, or Deprivation of Ministers, or any such Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Censures, grounded and having warrant of the Word of God.</hi> But to the second branch thereof, he gave his Plenary assent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor of the Act here following; which in regard
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54836:179"/>
it contains the sum of all their Projects for life-time then past, and the ground of all their Insolencies for the times ensuing; it shall not grieve me to subjoyn, nor be troublesome to the <hi>Reader</hi> to pass it over, if he have not patience enough to go thorow with it. Now the tenor of the said Act is as followeth.</p>

Such was the Act by which the Presbyterian Discipline was setled in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> They had given Him trouble enough before, when they had no authority of Law to confirm their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But now He must expect much more; and they will see His expectation satisfied to the very full. So that it may be much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired that He yeelded to it, the rather in regard the Reasons of it are not certainly known, nor very easie to be guessed at. Whether it were, that he were not well enough informed touching the low condition which the <hi>English Puritans</hi> were at this time brought to, or that He stood so much in fear of the Earl of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> (whose treacherous practises threatned Him with continual danger) that He was under a necessity of conforming to them for His own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; or that He thought it His best way to let them have their own Wills, and pursue their own Counsels, till they had wearied both themselves and the rest of the Subjects, by the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government of that Power which He had given them; or whether it were all, or none of these, it is hard to say. Nor is it less to be admired, that the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who had found the weight of that heavy yoke in the times fore-going, should take it so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on their necks, and not joyn rather with the King to cast it off. But they had gotten most of the Church-Lands into their possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thought it a greater piece of wisdom to let the Presbytery over-top them in their several Consistories, than that the Bishops, Deans, and Chapters, or any other who pretended unto their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, should be restored again to their Power and Places, and thereby brought to a capacity of contending with them for their own. In which respect they yeelded also to another Act against the everting of Church-Lands and Tenths into Temporal Lordships: for, To what purpose should they strive for such empty Titles, as added little to their profit, and not much to their pleasures? There also passed some other Acts which seemed much to favour both the Kirk and the Kirk-men; as namely, For the ratification of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Act, 1587, in favour of the Ministers, their Rents and Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; for enabling Lay-Patrons to dispose of their Prebendaries and Chaplinaries unto Students; and that no Benefices with Cure pay any Thirds. There passed another Act also which concerned the Glebes and Manses in Cathedral Churches, preserved of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by the King (though they thought not of it) that when he found it necessary to restore Episcopacy, the Bishops might find Houses, and other fit Accommodations, near their own Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals.</p>
            <p n="47">47. Thus have the Presbyterians gained two Acts of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; The one for setling their Presbyteries in all parts of the Kingdom: The other for repressing all thoughts of restoring Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,

by passing over the Church-Lands to the use of the Crown. And to make as sure of it as they could, (because a three-fold Cord is not easily broken) they had before called upon the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce the Band, or National Covenant, which had been made for their adhaesion to the true Religion, and renouncing Popery. For so it was, that some suspitions had been raised by the Presbyterians, That the King was miserably seduced, and enclined to Popery; and that the Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> had been sent from <hi>France</hi> for no other purpose, but to work Him to it. And thereupon the King gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto Mr. <hi>I. Craige,</hi> being then a Preacher in the Court, to form a short Confession of Faith; wherein not only all the Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in point of Doctrine, but even those also which related unto Discipline and Forms of Worship, were to be solemnly abjured. Which Confession, for example to others, the King Himself, with all His Court and Council, did publickly both subscribe and swear, <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. And the next year He required the like Oath and Subscription from all His Subjects, for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of those Fears and Jealousies which the Kirk had of Him. But in regard this general Confession was not found sufficient to hinder the encrease of Popery, for want of some strict Combination amongst the Subjects which professed the Reformed Religion; it was desired, that a <hi>Solemn League or Band</hi> might be authorized, by which they should be bound to stand to one another in defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; that is to say, both of their Covenant and Religion, against all Opponents. The <hi>Guisian</hi> Papists had projected the like League in <hi>France,</hi> to suppress the Gospel; and why should they in <hi>Scotland</hi> be less zealous for the true Religion, than the <hi>Guisian Papists</hi> for the false? Upon which ground the King was easily entreated to consent unto it: and first subscribed the Band Himself, with all His Family, <hi>An.</hi> 1589; which the next year he caused to be subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by all sorts of people, as the General Assembly had desired.</p>
            <p n="48">48. Now in this Covenant and Confession, they did not only bind themselves to renounce the Pope, together with all the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions and Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; but in particular, <hi>to continue in obedience to the Doctrine and Discipline of the Kirk of</hi> Scotland; <hi>and to defend the same according to their vocation and power, all the days of their lives.</hi> And though it cannot be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that under those general words of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> there could be any purpose to abjure the Episcopal Government, which was in being when that Confession was first framed, and for many years after: yet being now received and subscribed unto, and their Presbyteries established by Act of Parliament, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by the <hi>Covenanters</hi> of succeeding times, <hi>Anno</hi> 1638, to contain in it an express renouncing of Episcopacy, as also of such Rites and Ceremonies as had been introduced amongst them by the Synod of <hi>Perth, Anno</hi> 1618. The sad Effects whereof, the King foresaw not at the present; but He took order to redress them in the time to come: For now the Temporal Estates of Bishops being alienated and annexed to the Crown by Act of Parliament,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:54836:181"/>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1587. <hi>Episcopacy</hi> tacitly abjured by Covenant, and that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant strengthned by a Band or Association, <hi>Anno</hi> 1590. And finally, their <hi>Presbyteries</hi> setled by like Act of Parliament in this present year <hi>Anno</hi> 1592. it was not to be thought that ever Bishops or Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy could revive again, though it otherwise happened. It cannot be denied, but that K. <hi>IAMES</hi> did much despise this Covenant, (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Negative Confession) when He came into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> for, taking occasion to speak of it in the Conference of <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Court,</hi> he lets us know, That Mr. <hi>Craige</hi> (the Compiler of it) <hi>with his renouncings and abhorrings, his detestations and abrenouncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did so amaze the simple people, that few of them being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member all the said particulars, some took occasion thereby to fall back to Popery, and others to remain in their former ignorance.</hi> To which he added this short note, <hi>That if he had been bound to that Form of</hi> Craige<hi>'s, the Confession of his Faith must have been in his Table-Book, and not in his Head.</hi> But what a mean opinion soever K. <hi>IAMES</hi> had of it, the <hi>Puritans</hi> or <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of both Kingdoms, made it serve their turns for raising a most dangerous Rebellion against his Son, and altering the whole Frame of Government both in Church and State, which they new-molded at their pleasure: and sure I am, that at the first entring into this Band, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> there grew so high and insolent, that the King could get no Reason of them in his just demands. The King had found by late experience, how much they had encroached upon his Royal Prerogative, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the present Government, and reviled his Person. And thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he had gratified them in confirming their Discipline, so he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them not long after to subscribe these Articles; that is to say, <hi>That the Preacher should yeeld due obedience unto the King's Majesty. That they should not pretend any priviledg in their Allegiance. That they should not meddle in matters of State. That they should not publikely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile His Majesty. That they should not draw the people from their due obedience to the King. That, when they are accused for their Factious Speeches, or for refusing to do any thing, they should not alledg the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of the Spirit, nor feed themselves with colour of Conscience, but confess their faults like Men, and crave pardon like Subjects.</hi> But they were well enough, they thanked him; and were resolved to hold their own Power, let Him look to His.</p>

The <hi>English</hi> Brethren had lost their principal Support, by the death of <hi>Leicester,</hi> though he was thought to have cooled much in his affections towards their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. But what they lost in him, they studied to repair by the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> whose Father's Widow he had married, trained him up for the most part under <hi>Puritan</hi> Tutors, and married him at the last to <hi>Walsingham</hi>'s Daughter. Upon these hopes they made their

And he appeared the rather for them at the first, to cry quits with <hi>Whitgift</hi>; who, when he might have been elected Chancellor of the University of <hi>Oxon,</hi> on the death of <hi>Leicester,</hi> chose rather to commend his dear Friend, the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hatton,</hi> to the place, than to assume it on himself; and after <hi>Hatton</hi>'s death, to nominate the Lord <hi>Buckburst</hi> to them, who was also chosen. The young Earl had an eye upon that great Office, that he might be as powerful amongst men of the Gown, as he was amongst Gentlemen of the Sword; and took it for an high affront, that the Arch-bishop should presume to commend any other to that Honour, which he designed unto himself. But the Queen easily took him off, and made him so far Friends with <hi>Whitgift,</hi> as not to make any open professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of displeasure toward him, by which the opposite Faction might be animated to their former Insolencies, which notwithstanding the Arch-bishop kept a vigilant eye upon all his actions, as one that was not to be told of his private practises, the secret intelligence which he had with the Heads of that Party, and saw that most of his Allies and Kindred were engaged that way. For, though upon the reconciliation which was made between them, the Earl had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him to run a course in Clergy-Causes, according to his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and advice; yet what he did therein, proceeded rather from a fear of the Queen's displeasure, than from any love to <hi>Whitgift,</hi> or the Church it self; as afterwards appeared most evidently in the course of his actions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But that which gave the Brethren their greatest blow, was, the death of <hi>Walsingham,</hi> who dyed on the sixt of <hi>April,</hi> 1590. The Queen had lately been more sensible of those manifold dangers which both the Principles and Practises of the <hi>Disciplinarians</hi> did most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently threaten to her whole Estate; more now than ever, by the coming out of a Pamphlet, called, <hi>The humble Motion:</hi> In which it was affirmed, That thousands did sigh for the Discipline, ten thousands had sought it; and, that the most worthy men of every Shire had consented to it: That the <hi>Eldership</hi> was at hand: That the people were inflamed with a zeal to have it; and, that it was hard, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and impossible, to stand against it. Incensed thereat, and fearing the sad consequences of such pestilent Pamphlets. She resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon some speedy course to prevent the mischief: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave the greater countenance to the Arch-bishops, Bishops, and their subordinate Officers, for proceeding with them. On which encouragement, the seeming-neutrality of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and the sickness of <hi>Walsingham, Snape,</hi> and some others of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Leaders, were called before the High-Commission at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> in the first beginning of <hi>Easter</hi>-Term: which, though it seemed both strange and unwelcome to them, yet there was no remedy. Appear they did, because they must; but were resolved, that their appearance should conduce as little as might be to their disadvantage.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:54836:183"/>
For, being required to take their Oaths, according to the use of the Court, to answer punctually to all such Interrogatories as were to be propounded to them; the Oath is absolutely refused, unless the Interrogatories might be shewed unto them. First, therefore, they were made acquainted with the substance of them, but that would not serve. They were assured in the next place, That they should be required to answer no further unto any of them, than they were bound to do by the Laws of the Land. But that served as little. In fine, it was resolved, That the Interrogatories should be shewed unto them, (here contrary to the practise of all Courts in Criminal Causes) which served least of all: For now <hi>Snape</hi> finding what was like to be charged upon them, gave notice of the same to the rest of the Brethren, and did not only refuse the Oath, as before he did; but put the rest upon a course of premeditation, both whether it were fit to answer upon Oath, or not; and then, what Answer they would make, if they were put to it. But so it hapned, that his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, being intercepted, were produced against him; upon which he was clapped up in Prison, and a great terror thereby struck in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Brethren, who now began to apprehend the dangers they were fallen into by their former Insolencies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may be gathered by those Letters, that no small diligence had been used by such as had employed themselves in it, to search into the bottom of their deepest Counsels, and most secret Purposes; and that so perfect a discovery had been made thereof, as might warrant the High Commissioners to proceed severely, without the least fear of being foyled in their undertakings. For <hi>Snape</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in those Letters, That <hi>they had the knowledg not only of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, but of Specials, and Particulars also</hi>; that is to say, touching the places where they met, <hi>Oxford, London, Cambridg,</hi> &amp;c. the times of their accustomed Meetings, as, <hi>Sturbridg-Faire, Acts, Terms,</hi> &amp;c. the persons which assembled at them, as, <hi>Cartwright, Perkins, Travers, Chark,</hi> &amp;c. and finally, the very matters which they dealt in, and agreed upon. Much troubled the good man seemed to be, in gues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing at that false Brother who had made the discovery: but, that they were discovered, he is sure enough; for he affirmeth, that their Actings neither were, or could be any longer concealed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Lord called upon them to be resolute in the present case. And thereupon it was propounded, <hi>Whether it were better and more safe, that one man (with the consent of the rest) should boldly, freely, and wisely confess, and lay open,</hi> &amp;c or, <hi>that some weak or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man should without consent, and in evil sort, acknowledg,</hi> &amp;c. He tells them, That the matter aimed at by High Commissioners, was, To bring them within danger of Law for holding <hi>Conventicles</hi>: That in Causes of Murther, and the like, it was commonly asked, Whether the Party fled upon it; and therefore, that they should do well to consider of it, in reference to the present case, and so advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, That <hi>T. C.</hi> should be sent to with all speed, he concludes his Letter.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:54836:184"/>4. This Letter coming up so close to the former discoveries, brings <hi>Cartwright</hi> into play in <hi>September</hi> following. But first, a consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be had amongst them, at the House of one <hi>Gardiner,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and if at all, how far it might be fit for him to reveal all or any of the matters which had passed in conference or disputation in any of their former Assemblies. And, as it seems, it was determined in the <hi>Negative,</hi> (according to the Doctrine of the old <hi>Priscilianists</hi>) that he should not do it. For, when the Oath was offered to him, he refused to take it. The High-Commission-Court was at that time held in the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>'s <hi>Consistory,</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> At which were present, amongst others, the Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> the two Chief Justices, Serjeant <hi>Puckering,</hi> afterwards Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Mr. Justice <hi>Gaudie,</hi> and <hi>Popham,</hi> then Attorney-General, but afterwards Chief Justice of the Common-Pleas. All which did severally and distinctly assure him upon their Credits, That by the Laws of the Realm he was bound to take the Oath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, for making a true answer unto the Interrogatories which were to be propounded to him. To which he made no other Answer, but that he could find no such thing in the Law of God; and so continuing in his obstinacy, was committed also. But the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners having spent some time in preparing the matter, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cognizance thereof more fitter for the Star-Chamber, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both the Persons and the Cause to the care of that Court. In which an Information was preferred against them by the Queen's Attorney, for setting forth and putting in practise (without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and authority) a new form of Common-Prayer and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments, together with the Presbyterial Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline not allowed by Law. Upon the news whereof, the Brethren enter into consultation, as well about some course to be presently taken for relief of the Prisoners, as for the putting of their Discipline into further practise: What the result was, may be gathered from a Letter of <hi>Wiggingtons,</hi> (one of the hottest heads amongst them) in which he thus writes to <hi>Porter</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> viz. <hi>Mr.</hi> Cartwright <hi>is in the</hi> Fleet <hi>for refusing the Oath (as I hear); and Mr.</hi> Knewstubs <hi>is sent for, and sundry worthy Ministers are disquieted, who have been spared long: So that we look for some bickering ere long, and then a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, which cannot long endure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. But before any thing could be done upon either side, in order to the proceedings of the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rt, or the release of the Prisoners, there brake out such a dangerous Treason, as took up all the thoughts of the Lords of the Council, and the Brethren too. The Brethren had so fixed their Fancies on the Holy Discipline, and entertained such strange devices to promote the same, beyond the warrant of God's Word, and the Rule of Law; that at the last God gave them up to strong delusions, and suffered them to be transported by their own ill spirits, to most dangerous downfalls. One <hi>Coppinger,</hi> a Gentleman of a very good Family, had been so wrought upon by some of the chief Factors to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that he became a great admirer of their Zeal and Piety: and being acquainted with one
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:54836:184"/>
               <hi>Arthington</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Lay-<hi>Genevian,</hi> but very zealous in the Cause, he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth with him of some means for the good of the Prisoners. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on long deliberation, they could think of no course at all, unless it would please God by some extraordinary Calling to stir up some zealous Brethren to effect their desires: and if God pleased to take that way, why might not one or both of them be chosen, as fit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments in so great a service? than whom, they knew of none more able, and of few more zealous. On these Preparatories they betake themselves to Prayer and Fasting, hold a strict Fast toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> and then began to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind themselves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily exercised, as appears by their Letters writ to <hi>Lancaster,</hi> in whose House they held it. Immediately upon this Fact, <hi>Coppinger</hi> takes a journey into <hi>Kent,</hi> and fancies (by the way) that he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a familiar Conference with God himself, that he received from Him many strange Directions, to be followed by him whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God should please to use his service for the good of His Church; and more particularly, that he was shewed a way to bring the Queen to repentance, and to cause all the Nobles to do the like out of hand; or else to prove them to be Traytors to Almighty God. Another Fast is held by him and <hi>Arthington</hi> at his coming back, in which he finds himself more strongly stirred to a matter of some great importance, than he was before: of which he gives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice unto <hi>Gibson</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by his Letter of the last of <hi>December</hi>; and afterward to <hi>Wiggington</hi> above-mentioned; by them to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the rest of the Brethren. Another Fast follows upon this, at which <hi>Wiggington</hi> and some others did vouchsafe their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, who had before confirmed them in the fancy of some such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Calling as he seemed to drive at. With the intention of this last, <hi>Cartwright</hi> and other of the Prisoners were made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before-hand, to the intent that by the benefit of their secret prayers, the Action might be crowned with an End more glorious. And the same night, <hi>Coppinger</hi> finds himself in Heaven, exceedingly astonished at the Majesty of Almighty God, but very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by the Vision; and every day more and more encouraged to some great Work; which he communicates at several times, and by several Letters, to <hi>Cartwright, Travers, Clark,</hi> &amp;c. amongst the Preachers; and from the Lay-Brethren, unto <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and Sir <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Wentworth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. And now we must make room for another Actor, a greater Zealot than the other, and one that was to rob them of the glory of their Dreams and Dotages; <hi>Hacket,</hi> an inconsiderable Fellow both for Parts and Fortune, pretends to a more near Familiarity with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, than either of the other durst aspire to. A Wretch of such a desperate Malice, that bearing an old grudg to one that had been his School-Master, he bit off his Nose. And when the poor man humbly prayed him to let him have it again, to the end it might be sowed on before it was cold, he most barbarously chewed it with his teeth, and so swallowed it down. After this, having wasted that small Estate which he had by his Wife, he becomes a Proselyte, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:54836:185"/>
at first to more than ordinary zeal for a Reformation, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to extraordinary Revelations for the compassing of it. This brings him into the acquaintance of some zealous Ministers, who were then furiously driving on for the Holy Discipline; but none more than <hi>Wiggington</hi> before remembred, who brings him presently to <hi>Coppinger,</hi> at such time as the poor man was raised to the height of his Follies. <hi>Hacket</hi> had profited so well in the School of Hypocrisie, that by his counterfeit-holiness, his fervent and continual praying <hi>ex tempore,</hi> fasting upon the Lord's Days, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king frequent brags of his Conflicts with <hi>Satan,</hi> and pretending to many personal Conferences with the Lord Himself, that he became of great esteem with the rest of the Brethren; insomuch that some of them did not stick to say, not only that he was one of God's beloved, but greater in His Favour than <hi>Moses</hi> or <hi>Iohn the Baptist.</hi> And he himself made shew, That he was a Prophet, sent to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell God's Judgments, where His Mercies were neglected; prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying, That there should be no more Popes; and, that <hi>England</hi> this present Year should be afflicted with Famine, Warr, and Pestilence, unless the Lord's Discipline and Reformation were forthwith ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. These men, being both governed by the same ill spirit, were mutually over-joyed at this new acquaintance, and forthwith entred into counsel for freeing <hi>Cartwright, Snape,</hi> and the rest of the Ministers, not only from the several Prisons in which they lay, but from the danger of their Censure in the <hi>Starr-Chamber,</hi> which was then at hand.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It was expected that the Censure would have passed upon them on the last day of <hi>Easter</hi>-Term; of which <hi>Coppinger</hi> gives <hi>Hacket</hi> notice, and sends him word withall, That he meant to be at the hearing of it; and that if any Severity should be used towards them, <hi>he should be forced in the Name of the Great and Fearful God of Heaven and Earth, to protest against it.</hi> The like expectation was amongst them in the Term next following, at what time <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi> was resolved on some desperate act to divert the Sentence. For thus he writes to <hi>Lancaster</hi> before-remembred, <hi>That if our Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in Prison do appear to morrow in the Starr-Chamber, and if our great men deal with them so as it is thought they will; and that if then God did not throw some fearful Iudgment amongst them,</hi> &amp;c. that is to say, (for so we must make up the sense) let him give no more credit unto him or his Revelations. But the Hearing being deferred at that time also, and nothing like to be done in it till after <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> the Conspirators perceived they had time enough for new Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And in these Consultations they resolve amongst them to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the two Arch-bishops, of High-Treason, that so they might be made uncapable of proceeding in a Legal way against the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, or otherwise to assassinate both together, with the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hatton,</hi> (whom they deadly hated) if any severe Sentence was pronounced against them. But <hi>Hacket</hi> was for higher matters. The Spirit of Infatuation had so wrought upon him, that he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself to partake of the same Divine Nature with Almighty
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:54836:185"/>
God. That he was appointed by his God to be King of <hi>Europe</hi>; and therefore looked upon all Kings (but the Queen especially) as the Usurpers of the Throne, which belonged unto him. And against her he carried such a bitter hatred, that against her he often cast forth dangerous speeches, That she had lost her Right to the Crown; and spared not to do execution upon her in her Arms and Pictures, by stabbing his Dagger into both, whensoever he saw them. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="8">8. Finding to what an admiration he had raised himself in the esteem of <hi>Coppinger</hi> and his Fellow <hi>Arthington,</hi> he looks upon them as the fittest Instruments to advance his Treasons; perswading them, That they were endued not only with a Prophetical, but an Angelical Spirit. And they, believing what he said, performed all manner of obedience to him, as one that was appointed to reign over them, by God himself; setting themselves, from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to raise some Sedition, in which the people might be moved unto what they pleased. Being thus possest, they intimate to <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gington</hi> fore-mentioned, That Christ appeared to them the night before, not in his own body, as He sits in Heaven; but in that especial Spirit by which he dwelt in <hi>Hacket</hi> more than in any other. They added also, That <hi>Hacket</hi> was the very Angel which should come before the Day of Judgment, with his Fan in the one hand, and his Shepherds Crook in the other, to distinguish the Sheep from the Goats, to tread down <hi>Satan,</hi> and ruine the Kingdom of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> What Counsel they received from <hi>Wiggington,</hi> is not certainly known, though it may be judged by the event. For pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently on their going from him, which was on the sixteenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> they repair to <hi>Hacket,</hi> whom he found lazing in his bed in a private House at <hi>Broken-wharf</hi>; and casting themselves upon their knees, as if they were upon the point of Adoration; <hi>Arthington</hi> sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariseth, and adviseth <hi>Coppinger,</hi> in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to annoint their King. But <hi>Hacket</hi> cunningly declines it, telling them, that he was already annointed by the Holy Ghost, and therefore that they were to do what he should command them: Which said, he ordains <hi>Coppinger</hi> to be his Prophet of Mercy, and <hi>Arthington</hi> to be his Prophet of Justice; and gives them their Mission in this manner:
<q>Go now (saith he), and tell up and down the City, That Jesus Christ is come with his Fan in his hand, to judg the World: if any ask you where he is, direct them to this place: if they will not believe you, let them come and see if they can kill me.</q>
As sure as God is in Heaven, no less assuredly is Christ
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:54836:186"/>
now come to judg the World. With this Commission flye the two new Prophets from one street to another, till they came to <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,</hi> crying out, <hi>Christ is come, Christ is come,</hi> all the way they went; and adding with as loud a voice, <hi>Repent, Repent.</hi> In <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi> they mount into a Cart, (a proper Pulpit for such Preachers) proclaiming thence, that <hi>Hacket</hi> participated of Christ's glorified Body, by his especial Spirit, and was now come with his Fan, to propagate the Gospel, to <hi>settle the Discipline,</hi> (for that was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive to all this madness) and to establish in <hi>England</hi> a new Commonwealth: They added further, That themselves were two Prophets, the one of Mercy, and the other of Justice; the truth whereof they took upon their salvation. That <hi>Hacket</hi> was the only Supreme Monarch of the World; and, That all the Kings of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> held of him as his Vassals: That therefore he only ought to be obeyed, and the Queen deposed; and, That Vengeance should shortly fall from Heaven, not only on the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> but the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hatton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Infinite were the throngs of people which this strange No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty had drawn together to that place; but they found none so mad as themselves, none so besotted as to cry, God save King <hi>Hacket</hi>: so that not able to be heard by reason of the Noise, nor to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in their Mission, because of the Throng; they dismounted their Chariot, and, by the help of some of their Friends, conveyed themselves to <hi>Hacket</hi>'s Lodging. They had not staid there long, when they were all three apprehended, and brought before the Lords of the Council; to whom they showed so little reverence, that they never moved their Hats unto them; and told them, that they were above all Magistrates, of what rank soever. <hi>Hacket</hi> is afterward arraigned, <hi>Iuly</hi> 26. and two days after drawn to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, which was to be done upon him in that part of <hi>Cheapside</hi> in which his two Prophets had proclaimed him. Neither the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence past upon him, nor the fear of death, mitigated any thing of that Spirit of Infatuation with which the Devil had possest him. Insomuch, that he exclaimed most horribly (as he was drawn upon the <hi>Hurdle</hi>) all the way he passed, crying out in these words, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah the Messias, Iehovah the Messias: behold, Heaven is opened; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the Son of the Most High is coming down to deliver me.</hi> With the like ill spirit he was governed when he came to the Gallows; at which he is affirmed to have made this Imprecation, (for I can by no means call it Prayer) viz. <hi>Almighty Everlasting God, Iehovah, Alpha and Omega, Lord of lords, King of kings, the Everlasting God, thou knowest that I am the true Iehovah whom thou hast sent. Shew some Miracle from the Clouds for the conversion of these Infidels, and deliver me from my Enemies.</hi> The rest, too horrid and blasphemous to be imparted to the eyes of a sober Christian, I forbear to add. Let it suffice, that after some strugling with the Hang-man, and many fearful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations against God and man, he was turned off the Ladder, and presently cut down, ript up, and quartered, according unto the Law in that behalf. Unto such dangerous Precipices do men cast
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:54836:186"/>
themselves, when they forsake the Rule of the Church, and will not be content with that sobriety in the things of God, which makes men wise unto salvation. But as for his two Prophets, they found different ends, though they had steered the same course with him. <hi>Coppinger</hi> by a wilful abstinence, starved himself in Prison within few days after. But <hi>Arthington</hi> lived to see his Errors, was pardoned upon his repentance, and published a Retractation of his Follies, as became a Christian.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Many Endeavours have been used for freeing <hi>Cartwright</hi> and the rest of the chief <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> from having any hand in these damnable practises. And it is true enough, that many of them were so wise, as neither to admit them to a personal Conference, nor to return Answer to those Letters which were sent unto them from the Parties. But then it is as true withall, that <hi>Coppinger</hi> had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated his first thoughts touching his Extraordinary Calling, by several Letters writ to <hi>Cartwright, Egerton, Travers, Chark, Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Cooper, Philips,</hi> and others; not to say any thing of <hi>Penry</hi> or <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gington,</hi> who seemed to have been of Counsel with them in the whole Design. And it is also true, that when he descended to particulars in reference to the course which he meant to take in the present Exigent, they would by no means entertain any Messages from him, by which they might be made acquainted with the Plot in hand. But then it cannot be denied, that knowing them to be intent upon some course which they could not justifie, they neither revealed it to the State, nor laboured to disswade them from it, but seemed content to let them run their full career, and then to take such benefit of it as the issue and success thereof should afford unto them. And in this case it may be said too justly in the Orator's language, that there was little difference between the advising of a Fact, and the rejoycing at it when it was once executed: and how they then could take the benefit of such a mischief, with which they had been pre-acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the general notion, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d either not be joyful at it, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be in the same case with such as had advised unto it, let them judg that list.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The dangers growing to the State by these odious practises, may be supposed to hasten the Arraignment of <hi>Vdal,</hi> one of the four which had a hand in those scurrilous Libels which swarmed so numerously in all parts of the Kingdom, <hi>Anno</hi> 1588, and the times since following. But more particularly, he stood charged for being the Author of a Book, called, <hi>The Demonstration of Discipline which Christ hath prescribed in his Word for the Government of his Church, in all times and places, until the Worlds end.</hi> In the Preface where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of occureth these passages: First, He inscribes the same not to the Governours, but <hi>to the supposed Governours of the Church of</hi> England. And then he flyes upon them in these following words, viz. <hi>Who can deny you, without blushing, to be the cause of all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness? seeing your Government is that which giveth leave to a man to be any thing, saving a sound Christian. For certainly, it is more free in these days to be a</hi> Papist, Anabaptist, <hi>of the</hi> Family of Love;
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:54836:187"/>
               <hi>yea, as any most wicked whatsoever, than that which we should be. And I could live these twenty years, as well as any such in</hi> England, <hi>(yea in a Bishop's House, it may be) and never be molested for it: So true is that which you are charged with in a Dialogue lately come forth against you, and since burn'd by you, That you care for nothing but the maintenance of your Dignities, be it to the damnation of your own souls, and infinite millions more.</hi> For which whole Book, but more especially for this passage in the Preface of it, he was indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at an Assizes held in <hi>Croydon,</hi> for the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> on the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Iuly, Anno</hi> 1590; and by sufficient Evidence found guilty of it. The Prisoner pleaded for himself, That his Indictment was upon the Statute of 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Cap. 2. for punishing Seditious words against the Queen; but that the Book for which he stood accused, contained no offensive passages against the Queen, but the Bishops only, and therefore could not come within the compass and intent of that Statute. But it was answered by the Judges, and resolved for Law, <hi>That they who speak against Her Majesty's Government in Cases Ecclesiastical, Her Laws, Proceedings, or Ecclesiastical Officers, which ruled under Her, did defame the Queen.</hi> Which Resolution being given, and the Evidence heard, he had so much favour shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, by consent of the Court, as to be put unto this question, that is to say, Whether he would take it either on his Conscience, or his Credit, that he was not the Author of that Book: Which if he would or could have done, it was conceived that both the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and the Jurors would have rested satisfied. But he not daring to deny it, the Jurors could not otherwise do, than pronounce him <hi>Guilty,</hi> upon such evident Proofs, and so many Witnesses as were brought against him. But the Arch-bishop, being then at his House in <hi>Croydon,</hi> prevailed so far in his behalf, that the Judges did su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spend the Sentence of his Condemnation. This Tryal hapned in the interval, between the several Commitments of <hi>Snape</hi> and <hi>Cartwright,</hi> before-mentioned, when the State had taken up a resolution to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed severely against the Disturbers of Her Peace; which gave some occasion of offence to the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hatton,</hi> that the Arch-bishop, who seemed most concerned in the present case, should show such favour to a man whom the Law condemned, and by whose seasonable Execution, a stop might possibly be made to all further Troubles.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But <hi>Snape</hi> and <hi>Cartwright</hi> still continuing obstinate in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Oath, and the suspition growing strong of some new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, he was brought again unto the Barr at <hi>Southwark,</hi> in the <hi>March</hi> next following, and there received the Sentence of death in due form of Law. But such was the exceeding Lenity of the good Arch-bishop, that he looked more upon the Parts of the man, than upon his Passions, upon his Learning and Abilities, though too much abused, than the ill use that he made of them in those stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-times. And so far he engaged himself with his Royal Mistress, (who used to call him Her Black Husband) that she gave way to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve, though she could not easily be induced to grant a Pardon.
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:54836:187"/>
Which notwithstanding the Arch-bishop could not scape the lash of some virulent Tongues, by whom he stood more accused for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, than he was magnified for the Reprieve of the man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. And therefore it was after pleaded in his justification, That <hi>Vdal</hi>'s Book was clearly within the compass of the Statute 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 2. for punishing <hi>Seditious words against the Queen,</hi> according to the Resolution of the Judges before laid down. That divers Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sermons might have been objected against him, as well as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that Book, which would have rendred him more culpable in the sight of his Judges; and that whereas one <hi>Catsfield</hi> could have spoken more materially against him, than any of the rest of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, he was never called unto the Barr to give in his Evidence, the Jurors being fully satisfied in the former Proofs. So that the whole Indictment being rightly grounded, the Prosecution favourable, and the Evidence full, the man remained a living-Monument of the Arch-bishop's extraordinary Goodness to him, in the preserving of that Life which by the Law he had forfeited. But how long he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained alive, I am not able to say; and therefore shall add only this, That he left a Son behind, called <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who afterwards was Beneficed at the Church of St.<hi>Augustines,</hi> near St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and proved as great a Zealot for Conformity, in the time of King <hi>CHARLES,</hi> as his Father was reputed for his Non-conformity in the times we write of. And he paid almost as deer for it, as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, being sequestred about the year 1643, not submitting to some Oaths and Covenants then required of him; his bed-rid Wife turned out of doors, and left most unmercifully in the open Streets.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Now whilst the State was taken up in these Criminal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, the Learned men and others interessed on each side, were no less busied in defence of their own Concernments. <hi>Adrian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia,</hi> born in the <hi>Lower-Germany,</hi> but better studied in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers than the most of his Rank, had found by search into their Writings, of what Antiquity and Necessity the Calling of Bishops had been reckoned in the Primitive times, even in the days of the Apostles; but finding no encouragement to maintain any such opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in his Native Countrey, where the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> governed all, and Parity of Ministers was received as an Article of their publike Confession; he put himself upon the Favour and Protection of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> He had before fashioned his Reply to <hi>Beza</hi>'s Book, entituled, <hi>De Triplici Episcopatu,</hi> as before was said. But the first Piece published by him on his coming hither,<note place="margin">1590.</note> was a right learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Work, entituled, <hi>De diversis gradibus Ministrorum Evangelii</hi>: In which he proved by undeniable Arguments, That Bishops were a different Order, as well as by Degrees superior to all other <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> This Book he dedicates to the Ministers of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as appears by his Epistle dated <hi>March</hi> 26, <hi>Anno</hi> 1590. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom, though he could not hope for much approbation, yet he received but little or no opposition. But so it prov'd not at <hi>Geneva,</hi> where <hi>Beza</hi> governed, backed by <hi>Danaeus,</hi> and the rest of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:54836:188"/>
the <hi>Consistorians,</hi> who looked upon it as destructive to their whole Contrivements. <hi>Beza</hi> had other Work in hand, and therefore leaves him for the present to the lash of <hi>Danaeus,</hi> who falls upon him with Reproaches instead of Arguments, (as <hi>Saravia</hi> complained in his Reply) reckoning his Corpulency for a Crime, calling him <hi>Swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, Hog,</hi> a man born only for the stuffing of a filthy paunch; with many the like scurrilous strains of <hi>Genevian</hi> Rhetorick. <hi>Beza</hi> comes slowly on, but he comes at last; not publishing his Answer to it, till the third year after: to which <hi>Saravia</hi> replies in the year next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>Anno</hi> 1594. In which he made an exact parallel (amongst other things) betwixt the practises of <hi>Hacket</hi> and the <hi>Puritan</hi> Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on the one side, and those of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> and the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> when they reigned in <hi>Munster.</hi> In the end, <hi>Beza</hi> gave him over; which raised him to such eminent note with the <hi>English</hi> Prelates, that he was made a Prebendary of the Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and otherwise well provided for to his full contentment.</p>
            <p n="14">14. In the mean time, the Minister of the <hi>Italian</hi> Church in the City of <hi>London,</hi> could not rest satisfied with the enjoying the same Priviledges which the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches had before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; but published a Book in maintenance and commendation of the Holy Discipline: which gave a just occasion to Dr. <hi>Matthew Suttliff,</hi>

And though he named <hi>Beza</hi> only, and no more than named him; yet <hi>Beza</hi> thought his Name so sacred, or himself so high, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himself to be much dishonoured; reproaches him by the name of a petulant Railer,<note place="margin">

And more than so, in his Reply to his last Letter, he gives him his due Titles, of the <hi>most Reverend Father in Christ,</hi> and his <hi>honoured Lord</hi>; assuring him, <hi>That in all his writings touching Church-Government, he impugned only the Romish Hierarchy, but never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to touch the Ecclesiastical Polity of this Church of</hi> England, <hi>nor to exact of us to frame our selves or our Church to the pattern of their Presbyterian Discipline.</hi> And thereunto he added this safe Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>That as long as the substance of Doctrine was uniform in the Church of Christ, they may lawfully vary in other matters, as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of time, place, and persons, requires, and as prescription of Antiquity may warrant.</hi> And, <hi>to that end he wished and hoped, that the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:54836:188"/>
Sacred and Holy Colledges of Bishops</hi> (for so he calls them) <hi>would for ever continue and maintain such their Right and Title in the Church's Government, with all Equity and Christian Moderation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. At this time grew the Heats also betwixt <hi>Hooker</hi> and <hi>Travers:</hi> the first being Master of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the other Lecturer: <hi>Hooker</hi> received his Education in <hi>Corpus Christi Colledg</hi> in <hi>Oxon,</hi> from whence he came well stocked in all kind of Learning, but most especially in Fathers, Councils, and other approved Monuments of Ecclesiastical Antiquity. <hi>Travers</hi> was bred in <hi>Trinity Colledg</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg,</hi> well skilled in the Oriental Tongues, and otherwise better studied in Words than Matter, being Cotemporary with <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and of his Affection: He sets up his studies in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints himself with <hi>Beza,</hi> and the rest of that Consistory, of whom and their new Discipline he grew so enamoured, that before his coming into <hi>England</hi> he was made Minister (as well at least as such hands could make him) by the Presbytery of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> as appears by their Certificate, (for I dare not call them Letters of Orders) dated <hi>May</hi> 14, 1578. Thus qualified, he associates himself with <hi>Cartwright,</hi> whom he found there at his coming in preaching to the Factory of <hi>English</hi> Merchants, and follows him not long after into <hi>England</hi> also. By the commendation of some Friends, he was taken into the House of <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> whom he served first in the nature of a Pedagogue to his younger Son, and after as one of his Chaplains. Preferments could not chuse but come in his way, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Greatness of his Master, whose eminent Offices of Lord Treasurer, Chief Secretary, and Master of the Wards, could not but give him many opportunities to prefer a Servant to the best pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Church. But <hi>Travers</hi> knew his incapacity to receive such Favours, as neither lawfully ordained, according to the Form pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor willing to subscribe to such Rites and Ceremonies as he found were used in the same. But being a great Factor for promoting the Holy Discipline, he gets himself into the Lecture of the <hi>Temple</hi>; which could not easily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, when the Chaplain of so great a Councellor was a Suitor for it.</p>
            <p n="16">16. In this place he insinuates himself, by all means imaginable, into the good affections of many young Students, and some great Lawyers of both Houses, on whom he gained exceedingly by his way of Preaching, graced with a comely Gesture, and a Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal manner of Elocution. By which advantages he possest many of the long Robe with a strong affection to the devices of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and with as great a prejudice to the <hi>English Hierarchy</hi>; the fruits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of discovered themselves more or less in all following Parliaments, when any thing concerning the Church came in agitation. And by the opportunity of this Place, he had the chief managing of the Affairs of the <hi>Disciplinarians,</hi> presiding for the most part in their Classical Meetings, and from hence issuing their Directions to the rest of the Churches. And so it stood till <hi>Hooker</hi>'s coming to be Master; who being a man of other Principles, and better able to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:54836:189"/>
defend them in a way of Argument; endeavoured to instruct his Auditors in such Points of Doctrine as might keep them in a right perswasion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well in reference to her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as her Forms of Worship. This troubled <hi>Travers</hi> at the heart, as it could not otherwise, to see that the fine Web which he had been so long in weaving, should be thus unravell'd. Rather than so, <hi>Hooker</hi> shall tell them nothing in the Morning, but what he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to confute in the Afternoon; not doubting but that a great part of the Auditors would pass Sentence for him, though the truth might run most apparently on the other side. <hi>Hooker</hi> endured it for some time; but being weary at the last of the opposition, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains thereof to the Arch-bishop, who had (deservedly) a very great opinion of him; and this Complaint being seasonably made in that point of time when <hi>Cartwright, Snape,</hi> and other Leading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, were brought into the High Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it was no hard matter for him to procure an Order to suppress his Adversary, silenced from preaching in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and all places else. Which Order was issued upon these grounds, that is to say, <hi>That he was no lawfully ordained Minister according to the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: <hi>That he took upon him to preach, without being licensed</hi>: and, <hi>That he had presumed openly to confute such Doctrine as had been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly delivered by another Preacher, without any notice given thereof to the lawful Ordinary, contrary to a Provision made in the Seventh year of the Queen, for avoiding Disturbances in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. But <hi>Travers</hi> was too stiff, and too well supported, to sit down on the first Assault: He makes his supplication therefore to the Lords of the Council, where he conceived himself as strong and as highly favoured as <hi>Hooker</hi> was amongst the Bishops and the High Commissioners. In this Petition he complains of some obliquity in the proceedings had against him, for want of some Legalities in the conduct of it. But when he came to answer to the Charges which were laid upon him, his Defences appeared very weak and flat, and could not much conduce to his justification, when they were seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously examined in the scale of Judgment. His exercising the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry without lawful <hi>Orders,</hi> he justified no otherwise, than that by the Communion of Saints, all Ordinations were of like Authority in a Christian Church. The Bishop of <hi>London</hi> had commended him by two Letters unto that Society, to be chosen Lecturer; and That he took for a sufficient License, as might enable him to preach to that Congregation. And as for his confuting in the Afternoon, what had been preached by Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in the morning before, he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that he had warrant for it from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s example, in withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing St. <hi>Peter</hi> to his face, for fear lest otherwise God's Truth might receive some prejudice. The weakness and insufficiency of which Defences, was presently made known in <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Answer to the Supplication. Which wrought so much upon the Lords, and was so strongly seconded by the Arch-bishop himself, that all the Friends which <hi>Travers</hi> had amongst them, could not do him good; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it was represented to them, how dangerous a thing it was,

that a man of such ill Principles, and of worse Affections, should be permitted to continue in his former Lecture; which, what else were it, in effect, but to <hi>retain</hi> almost half the Lawyers of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>be of Councel</hi> in all Causes which concerned the Church, whensoever those of the <hi>Genevian</hi> or <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction should require it of them. But so it hapned, (and it hapned very well for <hi>Travers</hi>) that the Queen had erected an University at <hi>Dublin,</hi> in the year fore-going, 1591; Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein a Colledg dedicated to the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi>; to the Provost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship whereof he was invited by the Arch-bishop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who had been once a Fellow of the same House with him. Glad of which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to go off with credit, he prepares for <hi>Ireland.</hi> But long he had not dwelt on his new Preferment, when either he proved too hot for the Place, or the Countrey (by reason of the following Warrs) grew too hot for him: Which brought him back again to <hi>England</hi>; where he lived to a very great age in a small Estate, more comfortably than before, because less troublesome to the Church than he had been formerly.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Thus have we seen <hi>Travers</hi> taken off, and <hi>Beza</hi> quieted; nor was it long before <hi>Cartwright</hi> was reduced to a better temper: But first, it was resolved to try all means for his delivery, both at home and abroad. Abroad, they held intelligence with their Brethren in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by means of <hi>Penry</hi> here, and of <hi>Gibson</hi> there; two men as fit for their Designs, as if they had been made of purpose to promote the Mischief. Concerning which, thus <hi>Gibson</hi> writes in one of his Letters to <hi>Coppinger,</hi> before remembred; whereby it seems that he was privy to his practices also. <hi>The best of our Ministers</hi> (saith he) <hi>are most careful of your estate; and had sent for that effect a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of ours the last Summer, of purpose to confer with the best affected of your Church, to lay down a plot how our Church might best travel for your relief. The Lord knows what care we have of you, both in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private Prayers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For, as feeling-members of one body, we reckon the affliction of your Church to be our own.</hi> This showed how great they were with child of some good Affections; but there wanted strength to be delivered of the Burthen. They were not able to raise Factions in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> as Queen <hi>ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH</hi> had done frequently on their occasions in the Realm of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> All they could do, was to engage the King in mediating with the Queen in behalf of <hi>Cartwright, Vdal,</hi> and some others of the principal Brethren then kept in Prison for their contumacy in refusing the Oath. And they prevailed so far upon Him, who was not then in a condition to deny them any thing, as to direct some Lines unto Her in this tenour following.</p>

            <p n="20">20. This Letter was presented to the Queen by the hands of one <hi>Iohnson,</hi> a Merchant of that Nation then remaining in <hi>London.</hi> But it produced not the Effect which the Brethren hoped for: For the Queen looked upon it as extorted rather by the importunity of some which were then about Him, than as proceeding from Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who had no reason to be too indulgent unto those of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. This Project therefore not succeeding, they must try ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the next tryal shall be made on the High Commission, by the Authority whereof, <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and <hi>Snape,</hi> and divers others, were committed Prisoners. If this Commission could be weakned, and the Power thereof reduced to a narrower compass, the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren might proceed securely in the Holy Discipline, the Prisoners be released, and the Cause established. And for the questioning thereof, they took this occasion: One <hi>Caudreys,</hi> Parson of <hi>North-Luffengham,</hi> in the County of <hi>Rutland,</hi> had been informed against, about four years since, in the High Commission, for preaching against the Book of Common-Prayer, and refusing to celebrate Divine Service, according to the Rules and Rubricks therein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. For which, upon sufficient proof, he was deprived of his Benefice by the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and the rest of the Queen's Commissioners for Ecclesiastical Causes. Four years together he lay quiet, without acting any thing against the Sentence of the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:54836:190"/>
Court. But now it was thought by some of those Lawyers, whom <hi>Travers</hi> had gained unto the side, to question the Authority of that Commission, and consequently the illegality of his Deprivation. In <hi>Hillary</hi> Term, <hi>Anno</hi> 1591, the Cause was argued in the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi> Chamber, by all the Judges, according to the usual custom in all cases of the like importance; and it was argued with great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as appears by the sum and substance of their several Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, drawn up by <hi>Coke,</hi> then being the Queen's Sollicitor-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and extant amongst the rest of his Reports, both in <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> inscribed <hi>De Iure Regis Ecclesiastico</hi>; but known most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the name of <hi>Cawdrey</hi>'s <hi>Case.</hi> In the debating of which Point, the Result was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his, That the Statute of 10 of the Queen, for <hi>resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Crown the ancient Iurisdiction,</hi> &amp;c. was not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>introductory</hi> of a new Authority, which was not in the Crown before; but only <hi>declaratory</hi> of an old, which naturally and originally did belong to all Christian Princes, and amongst others also, to the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> For proof whereof, there wanted not sufficient evidence in our <hi>English</hi> Histories, as well as in some old Records of unquestioned Credit, exemplifying the continual practise of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> before and since the <hi>Norman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, in ordering and directing matters which concerned the Church: In which they ruled sometimes absolutely, without any dispute; and sometimes relatively, in reference to such opposition as they were to make against the Pope, and all Authority derived from the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">21. Against this Case, so solidly debated, and so judiciously drawn up, when none of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Professors could make any Reply, <hi>Parsons</hi> the <hi>Iesuit</hi> undertook it; but spent more time in searching out some contrary Evidence, which might make for the Pope, than in disproving that which had been brought in behalf of the Queen. So that the strugling on both sides, much confirmed the Power which they endeavoured to destroy; the Power of that Commission being better fortified both by Law and Argument, than it had been formerly. For, by the over-ruling of <hi>Cawdrey</hi>'s Case, in confirmation of the Sentence which was past against him, and the great pains which <hi>Parsons</hi> took to so little purpose; the Power of that Commission was so well established in the Courts of Judicature, that it was afterwards never troubled with the like Disputes. The Guides of the Faction therefore are resolved on another course, To strike directly at the Root, to question the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power, and the Queen's Authority, the Jurisdiction of their Courts, the exacting of the Oath called the Oath <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> and their other proceedings in the same. And to this purpose it was published in Print by some of their Lawyers, or by their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at the least, That men were heavily oppressed in the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Courts, against the Laws of the Realm: That the Queen could neither delegate that Authority which was vested in it, nor the Commissioners to exercise the same by her delegation: That the said Courts could not compel the taking of the Oath, called
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:54836:191"/>
the Oath <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> since no man could be bound in Reason to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse himself: That the said Oath did either draw men into wilful Perjury, to the destruction of their souls; or to be guilty, in a manner, of their own condemnation, to the loss both of their Fame and Fortunes. And finally, That the ordinary <hi>Episcopal</hi> Courts, were not to meddle in any Causes whatsoever, but only Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary and Matrimonial: by consequence, not in matter of Tythes, all Mis-behaviours in the Church, or punishing of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, or Fornication, Adultery, Incest, or any the like grievous or enormous Crimes: but on the contrary, it was affirmed by the Professors of the Civil Laws, That to impugn the Authority which had been vested in the Queen by Act of Parliament, was nothing in effect but a plain Invasion of the Royal Prerogative, the opening of a way to the violation of the Oath of Allegiance, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to undermine the whole Frame of the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was proved also, That the ordinary <hi>Episcopal</hi> Courts had kept themselves within their bounds; that they might lawfully deal in all such Causes as were then handled in those Courts; that their proceedings in the same by the Oath <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> was neither against Conscience, Reason, nor the Laws of the Land; and therefore, that the Clamours on the other side, were unjust and scandalous. In which, as many both Divines and Civilians, deserved exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well both of the Queen and the Church; so none more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, than Dr. <hi>Richard Cosins,</hi> Dean of the Arches, in a Learned and Laborious Treatise by him writ and published, called, <hi>An A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology for Proceedings in Courts Ecclesiastical,</hi> &amp;c. Printed in the year 1593.</p>
            <p n="22">
               <note place="margin">1592.</note>22. But notwithstanding the Legality of these Proceedings, the punishing of some Ring-leaders of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, and the Imprisonment of others, a Book comes out under the name of <hi>A Petition to Her Majesty:</hi> The scope and drift whereof, was this;
<q>That the Ecclesiastical Government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> was to be changed: That the Eldership, or Presbyterial Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, was to be established, as being the Government which was used in the Primitive Church, and commanded to be used in all Ages. That the Disciplinarian Faction hath not offended against the Statute 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 2. And, That <hi>Iohn Vdal</hi> was unjustly condemned upon it. That the Consistorial Patrons are unjustly slandered with desire of Innovation, and their Doctrine with Disorder and Disloyalty.</q>
And this being said, the Author of the Pamphlet makes it his chief business by certain Questions and Articles therein propounded, to bring the whole Ecclesiastical State into envy and hatred. This gave the Queen a full assurance of the restless Spirit wherewith the Faction was possessed; and that no quiet was to be expected from them, till they were utterly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest. To which end She gives Order for a Parliament to begin in <hi>February,</hi> for the Enacting of some Laws to restrain those Insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with which the Patience of the State had been so long exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. The <hi>Puritans</hi> on the other side are not out of hope, to make
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:54836:191"/>
some good use of it for themselves; presuming more upon the strength of their Party, by reason of the Pragmaticalness of some Lawyers in the House of Commons, than they had any just ground for, as it after proved. To which end they prepared some Bills suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently destructive of the Royal Interest, the Jurisdiction of the Bishops, and the whole Form of their Proceedings in their several Courts. With which the Queen being made acquainted before their meeting, or otherwise suspecting, by their former practises, what they meant to do; She thought it best to strangle those Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the very Womb. And to that purpose She gave Order for the signification of Her Pleasure to the Lords and Commons, at the very first opening of the Parliament, That they should not pass beyond their bounds; That they should keep themselves to the redressing of such Popular Grievances as were complained of to them in their several Countreys: but, that they should leave all Matters of State to Her self and the Council; and all Matters which concerned the Church, unto Her and Her Bishops.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Which Declaration notwithstanding, the Factors for the <hi>Puritans</hi> are resolved to try their Fortune, and to encroach upon the Queen and the Church at once. The Queen was always sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Inconveniences which might arise upon the nominating of the next Successor, and knew particularly how much the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the <hi>Puritans</hi> Compass pointed toward the North: Which made Her more tender in that Point, than She had been formerly. But Mr. <hi>Peter Wentworth,</hi> whom before we spake of, a great Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot in behalf of the Holy Discipline, had brought one <hi>Bromley</hi> to his lure; and they together deliver a Petition to the Lord Keeper <hi>Puckering,</hi> desiring that the Lords would joyn with them of the Lower-House, and become Suppliants to the Queen for entailing of the Succession of the Crown, according to a Bill which they had prepared. At this the Queen was much displeased, as being direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to her strict Command; and charged the Lords of the Council to call the said Gentlemen before them, and to proceed against them for their disobedience. Upon which signification of Her Majesty's Pleasure, Sir <hi>Thomas Hennage,</hi> then Vice-Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and one of the Lords of the Privy-Council, convents the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, reprehends them for their Misdemeanor, commands them to forbear the Parliament, and not to go out of their several Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, until further Order. Being afterwards called before the Lord Treasurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> the Lord <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> and the said Sir <hi>Thomas; Wentworth</hi> is sent unto the Tower, <hi>Bromley</hi> committed unto the Fleet, and with him <hi>Welsh</hi> and <hi>Stevens,</hi> two other Members of that House, were committed also, as being privy to the Projects of the other two. In whose behalf, when it was moved by one Mr. <hi>Wroth,</hi> That the House should be humble Suitors to Her Majesty for the releasing of such of their Members as were under restraint; it was answered by such of the Privy-Councellors as were then Members of the House, <hi>That Her Majesty had committed them for causes best known to Her self; and, that to press Her Highness with this Suit,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:54836:192"/>
would but hinder those whose good it sought. That the House must not call the Queen to an account for what she did of Her Royal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. That the Causes for which they are restrained, may be high and dangerous. That Her Majesty liketh no such Questions, neither did it become the House to deal in such matters.</hi> Upon which words the House desisted from interposing any further in their behalf, but left them wholly to the Queen, by whom <hi>Wentworth</hi> was continued Prisoner for some years after.</p>
            <p n="24">24. In the same Parliament, one <hi>Morrise,</hi> Chancellor of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> proposed unto the House, That some course might be taken by them against the hard courses of Bishops Ordinaries, and other Ecclesiastical Judges, in their several Courts, towards sundry godly Ministers, and painful Preachers, who deserved more encouragement from them. They also spake against <hi>Subscription,</hi> and the Oath <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> and offered a Bill unto the House against the imprisonment of such as refused the same. Of this the Queen had present notice, and thereupon sends for <hi>Coke,</hi> then Speaker of the House of Commons, (but afterwards successively Chief Justice of either Bench) to whom she gave command to deliver this Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the House; that is to say, <hi>That it was wholly in Her Power to call, to determine, to assent, or dissent, to any thing done in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That the calling of this, was only that the Majesty of God might be more Religiously observed, by compelling, with some sharp Laws, such as neglect that Service; and, that the safety of Her Majesty's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the Realm, might be provided for: That it was not meant they should meddle with matters of State, or Causes Ecclesiastical: That She wondered that any should attempt a thing so contrary to Her Commandment: and, that She was highly offended at it: and finally, that it was Her pleasure, That no Bill touching any matters of State, or for the Reformation of Causes Ecclesiastical, should be there exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</hi> On the delivery of which Message, <hi>Morrise</hi> is said to have been seized on in the House by a Serjeant at Arms; but howsoever, seized on and committed Prisoner, kept for some years in <hi>Tutbury</hi> Castle, discharged from his Office in the Dutchy, and disabled from any Practise in his Profession, as a common Lawyer. Some others had prepared a Bill to this effect, That in lieu of Excommunication, there should be given some ordinary Process, with such sute and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion as thereunto might appertain; that so the dignity of so high a Sentence being retained, and the necessity of mean Process sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, the Church might be restored to its ancient splendor. Which Bill, though recommended somewhat incogitantly by one of the Gravest Councellors of State which was then in the House, was also dashed by Her Majesty's express Command, upon a Resolution of not altering any thing (the quality of the times considered) which had been setled in the Church, both by Law and Practise. Which constancy of Hers in the preserving of Her own Prerogative and the Church's Power, kept down that swelling humour of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, which was even then upon the point of overflowing the banks, and bearing down all opposition which was made against them.</p>
            <p n="25">
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:54836:192"/>25. And, that they might be kept the better in their natural Channel, she caused an Act to be prepared and passed in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Parliament, for retaining them, and others of Her Subjects, in their due obedience.
<q>By which it was Enacted, for the preventing and avoiding of such Inconveniencies and Perils as might happen and grow by the wicked and dangerous Practices of Seditious Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries, and Disloyal persons; That if any person or persons above the age of sixteen years, should obstinately refuse to repair to some Church, Chappel, or usual place of Common-Prayer, to hear Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service established, or shall forbear to do the same by the space of a Month, without lawful cause; or should move or perswade any other person whatsoever, to forbear and abstain from coming to the Church to hear Divine Service, or to receive the Communion, according to the Laws and Statutes aforesaid; or to come or be present at any unlawful Assemblies, Conventicles, or Meetings, under pretence of Religious Exercise, contrary to the Laws and Statutes made in that behalf; or should at any time after forty days, from the end of that Session, by Printing, Writing, or express Words or Speeches, advisedly and purposely go about to move or perswade any of Her Majesty's Subjects, or any other within Her Highness Realms and Dominions, to deny, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, or impugn Her Majesty's Power and Authority in causes Ecclesiastical, united and annexed to the Imperial Crown of the Realm; That then every person so offending, and convicted of it, should be committed unto Prison without Bail or Main-prise, till he or they should testifie their Conformity, by coming to some Church, Chappel, or other place of Common-prayer, to hear Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, and to make open submission and declaration of the same in such form and manner, as by the said Statute was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</q>
Now that we may the better see what great care was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as well by the two Houses of Parliament, as by the Queen Her self, for preserving the Honour of the Church, the Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Bishops, and the Royal Prerogative in both; it will not be amiss to represent that Form to the eye of the <hi>Reader,</hi> in which the said Submission was to be delivered. The tenour whereof was as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>26. I <hi>A. B.</hi> do humbly confess and acknowledg, That I have grievously offended God in contemning Her Majesty's godly and lawful Government and Authority, by absenting my self from Church, and from hearing Divine Service, contrary to the godly Laws and Statutes of this Realm; and in using and frequenting disordered and unlawful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles and Assemblies, under pretence and colour of exercise of Religion. And I am heartily sorry for the same, and do acknowledg and testifie in my Conscience, That no person or persons, hath, or ought to have any Power or Authority over Her Majesty. And I do promise and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test without any dissimulation, or any colour of means of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:54836:193"/>
any Dispensation, That from henceforth I will from time to time, obey and perform Her Majesty's Laws and Statutes in repairing to the Church, and hearing Divine Service; and do mine utmost endeavour to maintain and defend the same.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="27">27. This Declaration to be made in some Church or Chappel, before the beginning of Divine Service, within three Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the conviction of the said Offenders, who otherwise were to abjure the Realm, and to depart the same, at such time and place as should be limited and assigned unto them; with this Proviso super-added, That if any of the said persons so abjuring, should either not depart the Realm at the time appointed, or should come back again unto it without leave first granted; that then every such person should suffer death as in case of Felony, without the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his Clergy. And to say the truth, there was no reason why any man should have the benefit of his Clergy, who should so obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuse to conform himself to the Rules and Dictates of the Church. There also was a penalty of ten pounds by the Month, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon all those who harboured any of the said <hi>Puritan Recusants,</hi> if the said <hi>Puritan Recusants</hi> (not being of their near Relations) or any of them, should forbear coming to some Church or Chappel, or other place of Common-prayer, to hear the Divine Service of the Church, for the space of a Month. Which Statute being made to continue no longer than till the end of the next Session of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, was afterwards kept in force from Session to Session, till the death of the Queen; to the great preservation of the Peace of the Kingdom, the safety of Her Majesty's Person, aad the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of the Church, free from thenceforth from any such disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, as had before endangered the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it.</p>
            <p n="28">
               <note place="margin">1593.</note>28. And yet it cannot be denied, but that the seasonable exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the former Statute on <hi>Barrow, Penry,</hi> and some others of these common Barreters, conduced as much to the promoting of this general Calm, as the making of this. It was in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> 1587, that <hi>Henry Barrow,</hi> Gentleman, and <hi>Iohn Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> Clerk, (of whose commitment, with some others, we have spoke before) were publickly convented by the High Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for holding and dispersing many Schismatical Opinions, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Doctrines, of which the principal were these, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Church is no true Church. That the Worship of the <hi>English</hi> Church is flat Idolatry. That we admit into our Church unsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified persons. That our Preachers have no lawful Calling. That our Government is ungodly. That no Bishop or Preacher preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Christ sincerely or truly. That the people of every Parish ought to chuse their Bishop. And, That every Elder, though he be no Doctor or Pastor, is a Bishop.
<q>That all of the Preciser sort, who refuse the Ceremonies of the Church, strain at a Gnat, and swallow a Camel, and are close Hypocrites, and walk in a left-handed
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:54836:193"/>
Policy, as <hi>Cartwright, Wiggington,</hi> &amp;c. That all which make, teach, or expound Printed or Written Catechisms, are idle Shepherds, as <hi>Calvin, Vrsin, Nowell,</hi> &amp;c. That the Children of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Parents ought not to be baptized; as of Usurers, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and finally, that set-prayer is blasphemous.</q>
On their Convention, and some short restraint for so many dotages, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to recant, and were enlarged upon their Bonds. But being set at liberty, they brake out again into further Extremities, and drew some others to the side, almost as mischievous as themselves, and no less Pragmatical: the principal whereof, (not to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Rabble of besotted people who became their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) were <hi>Saxio Billet,</hi> Gentleman; <hi>Daniel Studley,</hi> Girdler; <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Bouler,</hi> Fish-monger; committed Prisoners to the Fleet, with their principal Leaders, in the <hi>Iuly</hi> following.</p>

The times were dangerous, in regard of the great Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the invading of this Kingdom; which rendred the imprisonment of these furious Sectaries, as necessary to the preservation of the publick safety, as the shutting up of so many of the Leading-<hi>Papists,</hi> into <hi>Wisbich</hi> Castle. But so it was, that the State being totally taken up with the prosecution of that Warr on the Coasts of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the quenching of the fire at home, which had been raised by <hi>Cartwright, Vdal,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Disciplinarians,</hi> there was nothing done against them, but that they were kept out of harm's way, as the saying is, by a close Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. During which time, <hi>Cartwright,</hi> who was their fellow-Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, had a Conference with them; the rather, in regard it had been reported from <hi>Barrow</hi>'s mouth, That he had neither acted nor written any thing, but what he was warranted to do by <hi>Cartwright</hi>'s Principles. The Conference was private, and the result thereof not known to many, but left to be conjectured at by this following story. The Reverend <hi>Whitgift</hi> had a great desire to save the men from that destruction in which they had involved themselves by their own pervers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess; and to that end sends Dr. <hi>Thomas Ravis,</hi> then one of his Chaplains, (but afterwards Lord Bishop of <hi>London</hi>) to confer with <hi>Barrow.</hi> At whose request, and some directions from the Arch-bishop, in pursuance of it, <hi>Cartwright</hi> is dealt with to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to another Conference: but no perswasions would prevail with him for a second Meeting. Which being signified to <hi>Barrow,</hi> by the said Dr. <hi>Ravys,</hi> in the presence of divers persons of good account, the poor man fetched a great sigh, saying, <hi>Shall I be thus forsaken by him? Was it not he that brought me first into these bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, and will he now leave me in the same? Was it not from him alone that I took my grounds? Or, did I not out of such Premises as he pleased to give me, infer those Propositions, and deduce those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions for which I am now kept in Bonds?</hi> Which said, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany departed, and left the Prisoners to prepare for their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tryal. By the Imprisonment of <hi>Cartwright,</hi> the Condemnation of <hi>Vdal,</hi> and the Execution of <hi>Hacket,</hi> the times had been reduced to so good a temper, that there could be no danger in proceeding
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:54836:194"/>
to a publick Arraignment. The Parliament was then also sitting; and possible it is, that the Queen might pitch upon that time for their condemnation, to let them see, that neither the sitting of a Parliament, nor any Friends they had in both or either of the Houses, could either stay the course of Justice, or suspend the Laws. Certain it is, that on the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> 1592, they were all indicted at the Sessions-Hall without <hi>Newgate,</hi> before the Lord Mayor, the two Chief Justices, some of the Judges, and divers other Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi>; for writing and publishing sundry Seditious Books, tending to the slander of the Queen and State. For which they were found guilty, and had the Sentence of death pronounced upon them, <hi>March</hi> 23. Till the Execution of which Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, they were sent to <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="30">30. The fatal Sentence being thus passed, Dr. <hi>Lancelot Andrews,</hi> afterwards Lord Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi>; Dr. <hi>Henry Parrey,</hi> afterwards Lord Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi>; Dr. <hi>Philip Bisse,</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Taunton</hi>; and Dr. <hi>Thomas White,</hi> one of the Residentiaries of St. <hi>Pauls</hi>; were sent to <hi>Barrow,</hi> to advise him to recant those Errors, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise might be as dangerous to his soul, as they had proved unto his body. Who having spent some time to this purpose with him, were accosted thus:
<q>You are not (saith he) the men whom I most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in the present differences: For, though you be out of the Way, yet you think you are in the Right, and walk according to that light which God hath given you. But I cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and all others of his opinion, from whom we have received the truth of these things, and by whose Books we have been taught, that your Calling is <hi>Antichristian.</hi> And yet these men, saith he, forsake us in our Sufferings, against their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and rather chuse to save their lives, than go out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>
               </q>
To which, when Dr. <hi>White</hi> objected, That those Callings which he reproached as <hi>Antichristian,</hi> had been embraced by Arch-bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> Bishop <hi>Ridley,</hi> and divers other godly persons, who suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Martyrdom for their Religion in Queen <hi>MARY's</hi> days. <hi>Barrow</hi> thus gloriously replies, <hi>Most true it is,</hi> (quoth he) <hi>that they and others were Martyrs in Queen</hi> MARY's <hi>days; but these holy Bands of mine</hi> (and therewith shook his Fetters) <hi>are much more glorious than any of theirs, because they had the Mark of Antichrist in their hands.</hi> Such was the Fortune of these men, that these Learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors could do as little good upon them, as <hi>Cartwright</hi> and his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows had done before; though, to say the truth, it had not been in <hi>Cartwright</hi>'s power to have changed their minds, unless he had first changed his own.
<q>And thereupon it was very well said by Dr. <hi>Iohn Burges,</hi> (who had been once one of <hi>Cartwright</hi>'s Followers) That he was, and ever had been of that opinion, That no just confutation could be made of the <hi>Separatists,</hi> by any of the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> who had given them their Principles. That though he had seen some endeavours that way, yet did they never satisfie him in point of Conscience. That the Arguments published in his time against Conformity, were pretended for the grounds of the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:54836:194"/>
Separation. That the <hi>Separatists</hi> did pretend their Pedigree from none but the <hi>Puritans</hi>; which no man can deny (saith he) that hath any Modesty. And finally, that therefore the <hi>Puritans</hi> might well call them their <hi>dear Brethren of the Separation,</hi> as <hi>Dighton</hi> and some others had began to do.</q>
To bring this business to an end, <hi>Barrow</hi> and <hi>Greenwood</hi> were brought to <hi>Tiburn,</hi> in a Cart, on the last of <hi>March</hi>; and having been exposed for some time to the sight of the people, were carried back again to <hi>Newgate.</hi> But no repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance following on the sense of so great a mercy, they were both hanged at <hi>Tiburn</hi> on the sixth of <hi>April.</hi> The other three being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieved, with some hope of pardon, as being only accessary to the Crimes of the other.</p>
            <p n="31">31. In <hi>May</hi> next following, <hi>Penry</hi> is brought upon his Tryal; a man of most Seditious Malice, and one of the chief Penners of those scurrilous Libels which had passed under the name of <hi>Martin Mar-Prelate.</hi> But not content with having a hand in those Pestilent Pamphlets, but must needs take upon him to be the <hi>Inter-Nuncio,</hi> or common Agent, between the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>English Puritans.</hi> Having enflamed the <hi>Scots</hi> unto some Seditions, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained Leidger there till the beginning of <hi>Hacket</hi>'s Treasons, and thereupon writes to <hi>Arthington</hi> to this effect, <hi>That Reformation must be shortly erected in</hi> England: And thereupon he makes for <hi>London,</hi> to have play'd his pranks, if their Design had took ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; it being his hope, as possibly it was the hope of all the rest of that Faction, That on the Proclamations which were made by <hi>Hacket</hi>'s Prophets, the people would have been inci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. But when he saw those hopes deluded, and <hi>Hacket</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, his guilty Conscience prompted him to fear the like cruel death, which hurried him again to <hi>Scotland</hi>; where he remained till the beginning of the Parliament before remembred. At what time stealing privately back again towards <hi>London,</hi> we was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at <hi>Stebunheth,</hi> (commonly called <hi>Stepny</hi>) apprehended by the Vicar there, committed Prisoner, tryed at the King's-Bench-Barr, at <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> condemned of Felony on the Statute 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and executed not long after at St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Waterings</hi>; but exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with a very thin company attending on him, for fear the Fellow might have raised some Tumult, either in going to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or upon the Ladder. But what he could not do when he was alive, was put into a way of being effected when the Hang-man had done his office, by publishing one of his Seditious Pamphlets, entituled, <hi>The History of</hi> Corah, Dathan, <hi>and</hi> Abiram, <hi>applied to the Prelacy and Ministry of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>by Mr.</hi> John Penry, <hi>a Martyr of Iesus Christ,</hi> as the Pamphlet calls him. The Work not finished at the time of his Apprehension; but was Printed however by some zealous Brother, that he might poyson the Queen's Subjects as well dead as living.</p>
            <p n="32">32. To which end we are told in the Preface of it, by the zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, or rather Seditious Publisher,
<q>That the Author, Mr. <hi>Iohn Penry,</hi> was a Godly man, Learned, Zealous, and of a most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:54836:195"/>
Carriage and Courage. That he was born and bred in the Mountains of <hi>Wales,</hi> and with all godly care and labour, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to have the Gospel preached amongst his Countrey-men, whose case he greatly seemed to pity, wanting all the ordinary means for their salvation. That being used by God for a special Instrument in the manifestation of his Truth, he was hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, imprisoned, condemned, and executed; and so suffered Martyrdom for the Name of Christ. But more particularly, That he was adjudged at the King's Bench by Sir <hi>Iohn Popham,</hi> Lord Chief Justice, and the rest of the Judges then assembled, on the 25<hi>th</hi> of the fifth Month, and executed at St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Waterings,</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> on the 29<hi>th</hi> of the same, in the year of our God 1593. And finally, That he was not brought to execution the next second or third day, as most men expected; but, that when men did least look for it, he was taken while he was at dinner, carried in a close manner to his Execution, and hastily bereaved of his life, without being suffered (though he much desired) to make a declaration of his Faith towards God, or his Allegiance to the Queen. And in a Postscript to the same, he concludes it thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was apprehended, adjudged, and executed, for writing for the Truth of Christ, whatsoever other things were pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against him.</q>
Let us no longer blame the <hi>Papists</hi> for making Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of such Priests and Jesuits as suffered death according to the Law of the Land, for their several Treasons: the <hi>Puritans,</hi> or <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> have their Martyrs also, <hi>Penry</hi> and <hi>Hacket,</hi> and the rest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the same Laws, for their Treasons and Felonies. And if these men, with <hi>Barrow, Greenwood,</hi> and the rest, who had gone before them, must pass in our account for Martyrs, because they suffered in pursuance of the Holy Discipline. There is no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made, but <hi>Cartwright, Snape,</hi> with such as suffered only by Imprisonment, or the loss of their Benefices, must be marked for <hi>Confessors,</hi> in the next setting out of <hi>Gellibrand</hi>'s Calender, whensoever it be. Which, as it was the highest honour that any of <hi>Cartwright</hi>'s Friends can pretend to for him; so in himself he seemed not very ambitious of those glorious Attributes, which could not otherwise be purchased, than at <hi>Penry</hi>'s Price.</p>
            <p n="33">33. For now perceiving, when too late, to what calamitous and miserable Ends he had brought his Followers, what horrible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions had disturbed the whole Church, by his obstinate Follies; he was contented to knock off, and to give way to those Prudential Considerations which the complexion of Affairs did suggest unto him. He saw too clearly, that there were no more <hi>Walsinghams,</hi> or <hi>Leicesters,</hi> at the Council-Table. That the Arch-bishops little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger moved more powerfully there, than those few Friends which durst speak for him, being put together. That the Chief Justice <hi>Popham</hi> was a man of a ridged nature, not to be trifled with, or took off from the prosecution, if he should come within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the Law: And finally, that though the Statute made in the last Session, seemed chiefly to relate unto the Brethren of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:54836:195"/>
yet there might be some way or other to hook in all the Zealots for the Discipline also, if they did any thing in derogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the present Government. Of these Relentings some intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence had been given to Arch-bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> who thereupon resolved to work some impression on him, when he found him like a piece of <hi>Wax</hi> well warmed, and thereby sitted to receive it. In which Resolution he applies himself unto the Queen, from whose Clemency he not only obtained for him a release from Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but made it the more comfortable by a gracious Pardon for all Errors past. He suffered him moreover to return to <hi>Warwick,</hi> where he was Master of the Hospital founded by the Earl of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> as before is said, and there permitted him to preach; though with this condition, That he should neither Write, nor Preach, nor act in any thing to the disturbance of the Church, either in reference to her Government, or Forms of Worship. And though it be affirmed, That <hi>Cartwright</hi> kept himself within those Restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; yet when the Queen had notice of it, she was much displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and not a little blamed the Arch-bishop for it: But he beheld not <hi>Cartwright,</hi> as he had done <hi>Travers,</hi> though both pretending to the Ordination of a Forreign Presbytery. For <hi>Travers</hi> never had any other Hands imposed on him, than those of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which might stand for nothing. But <hi>Cartwright</hi> was first lawfully ordained in the Church of <hi>England</hi>; the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter whereof could not be obliterated, though it might possibly be defaced, either by the Rescinding of his Letters of Orders, (which some say he did) or by the super-addition of such other Hands as were laid upon him, after the fashion of <hi>Geneva.</hi> Neither was <hi>Cartwright</hi> so insensible of the Obligation, as not to know and to acknowledg by whose Favour he received that Freedom; carrying himself from that time forwards to the Arch-bishop, both in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Addresses, with as much respect as any of the Regular and Conformable Clergy; continuing in that peaceable disposition, till the time of his death; which hapned about ten years after his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, that is to say, on the 27<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>December, Anno</hi> 1603.</p>
            <p n="34">34. But the Arch-bishop stayed not here; he knew right well, that Punishment without Instruction, would not edifie much with men of common understandings; and therefore carefully employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both himself and others, in giving satisfaction to all doubting-judgments: For his own part, he wrote this year his long and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Letter to <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> which before we spake of; and therein calmly laid before him that deplorable Rupture which not without his privity had been made in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Which point he prest upon him with such Christian Modesty, and did withall so clearly justifie this Church in her whole proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that <hi>Beza</hi> could not but confess himself to be conquered, by his future carriage, which from thenceforth breathed nothing else but Peace to the Church it self, and dutiful respects to that Reverend Prelate. And for the satisfaction of all Parties interested amongst
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:54836:196"/>
our selves, a Book was published this year also, by Dr. <hi>Thomas Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> then Warden of the Colledg near <hi>Winchester,</hi> concerning <hi>The perpetual Government of the Church of Christ</hi>; proving therein, That from the time of Christ himself, till these latter days, neither the Universal Church, nor any National or Provincial Church, in what place soever, had been governed otherwise than by Bishops, and their Under-Officers. True, other Books were published at the same time also, by Dr. <hi>Richard Bancroft,</hi> so often mentioned; the one for the undeceiving of the people, (who had been miserably abused by such counterfeit Wares) entituled, <hi>A Survey of the pretended Holy Discipline.</hi> The other to inform them in the <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Positions and Proceedings published and practised in this Island of</hi> Britain, <hi>under pretence of</hi> Reformation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was the Title of the Book. The like course was also taken for the justification of the Bishops Courts, by publishing the <hi>Apology</hi> of Dr. <hi>Cosens</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remembred. And because <hi>Hacket</hi>'s Treasons had been built on no other Foundation, than that the Holy Discipline might be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon them, a Narrative thereof is penned by Dr.— a Doctor of the Civil Laws, collected for the most part out of the Letters and Confessions of some Disciplinarians, which either had been intercepted, or perswaded from them. A course exceeding prosperous to all those whom it most concerned. For the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop by this means went in peace to his Grave; <hi>Beza</hi> was gratified by him with a liberal Pension, <hi>Bilson</hi> within a short while after made Bishop of <hi>Winchester; Bancroft</hi> preferred about the same time to the See of <hi>London; Cosens,</hi> for his encouragement, made Dean of the Arches.</p>
            <p n="35">35. And though we find not any Preferment to be given to <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi>; yet was it a Preferment to him, to enjoy his Ministry; by means whereof, he is affirmed to have grown very wealthy, partly by the Revenues of his Place in the Hospital; and partly by the Bounty and Munificence of his constant Auditors: Only it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him, that towards his end he was afflicted with many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; insomuch, that he could not otherwise apply himself unto his Studies, than upon his knees; which some were willing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute as a judgment on him, for having so bitterly inveighed against all such men as in that reverend and religious posture did receive the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Some also have informed us of him, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all his Clamours, and Tumultuous manner of proceedings against the Church, he could not chuse but confess there was more Discipline exercised in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than in any of those Churches beyond Seas which himself had seen. Which words, as he is said to have spoken to one Mr. <hi>Woods,</hi> then Parson of <hi>Frecken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> during the time of his imprisonment in the Fleet; so the said <hi>Woods</hi> reported them to Dr. <hi>Iohn Burges,</hi> before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and from him I have them. But I had brought the man to his Grave before; and should not have disturbed his rest by these sad remembrances, if the Honour of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were not some way vindicated as well by the one, as by the other. Thus, as
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:54836:196"/>
before we brought the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> to their greatest height, in seeing their Discipline established by Laws, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Leagues: so have we brought the <hi>English Puritans</hi> to their lowest fall, by divers sharp Laws made against them, some severe Executions done upon them for their transgressing of those Laws, their principal Leaders humbled, or cut off by the Sword of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and the whole <hi>Mackina</hi> of their Devices brought to utter ruine: not the less active for all this, to advance the Cause, though after a more peaceful and more cunning way; so much the more dangerous to this Church, because less suspected, but not so closely carried as to scape discovery. And the first practise which they fell upon, was this that followeth.</p>
            <p n="36">36. It hath been an ancient Custom in the City of <hi>London,</hi> to have three solemn Sermons preached on <hi>Monday, Tuesday,</hi> and <hi>Wednesday,</hi> in the <hi>Easter</hi>-week, at the place commonly called the <hi>Spittle</hi>; being a dissolved Hospital not far from <hi>Bishops-Gate</hi>; at which the Lord Mayor and Aldermen used to be present in their Robes, besides a great concourse of Divines, Gentlemen, and other Citizens: For the performance of which Work, a decent Pulpit was erected in an open place, which had been part of the Church-yard; the ordinary Hearers sitting upon Forms before the Pulpit; the Lord Mayor,<note place="margin">1594<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Aldermen, and their Wives, with other Persons of Quality, in two handsome Galleries; to which was added, in the year 1594, a fair large House for the reception of the Governours and Children of the Hospital, founded in the <hi>Grey-Fryers,</hi> who from thenceforth were tyed to attend those Sermons. At what time also the old Pulpit was taken down, and a new set up, with the Preachers face turned toward the South, which had before been towards the West; for so in former times the Pulpits were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed in all Churches of <hi>England,</hi> to the end that the peoples faces, in all acts of Worship, might look toward the East, according to the Custom of the Primitive times. Which alteration seemed to be made upon design, that without noise, or any notice taken of it, they might by little and little change the posture of Adoration from the East to the West, or any other point of the Compass, as their humour served. In which first they were showed the way by Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay,</hi> in his Foundation of the Chappel of <hi>Emmanuel</hi> Colledg, 1585. Who being a great favourer of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gave order for this Chappel to stand North and South, and thereby gave example unto others to affect the like. Which brings into my mind a Project of <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> one of the most Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of the <hi>Roman Tribunes,</hi> for transferring the Supreme Power of the Commonwealth, from the Lords of the Senate, to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: For, whereas formerly all Orators in the Publick Assemblies, used to address their Speeches to the Lords of the Senate, as the Supreme Magistrates, this <hi>Gracchus</hi> turned his face to the common people; and by that Artifice, (saith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) transferred unto them the Supreme Majesty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, without Noise or Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult.</p>
            <p n="37">
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:54836:197"/>37. But it is now time to look back towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> where we left them at their highest, and the poor King so fettered or intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his own Concessions, that he was not able to act any thing in the Kirk, and very little in the State. He had not very well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested their Refusal to subscribe to His Articles, mentioned in the close of the former Book, when he held an Assembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> in the end of <hi>April,</hi> 1593; at what time the King, being well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the low condition of the <hi>English Puritans,</hi> sent Sir <hi>Iames Melvin</hi> to them with these two Articles, amongst many others. In the first of which it was declared,
<q>That He would not suffer the Priviledg and Honour of his Crown to be diminished, and Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to be made when and where they pleased; therefore willed them, before the dissolution of the present Assembly, to send two or three of their number, by whom they should know His mind touching the time and place of the next Meeting. And in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond it was required, That an Act should be made, inhibiting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to declaim in the Pulpit against the proceedings of His Majesty, and the Lords of His Council; which He conceived He had good reason to desire, in regard that His Majesty's good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were well known to themselves, for maintaining Religion and Justice, and of the easie access that divers of the Ministry had unto Him, by whom they might signifie their Complaints and Grievances.</q>
To the first of which two Articles, they returned this Answer,
<q>That in their Meetings they would follow the Act of Parliament made by Him in the year preceding.</q>
And to the second, they replyed,
<q>That they had made an Act, prohibiting all Ministers to utter in the Pulpit any rash or irreverent speeches against His Majesty, or His Council; but to give their Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon just and necessary Causes, in fear, love, and reverence.</q>
Which seeming to the King to serve then rather for a colour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse their Factiousness, than to lay any just restraint upon it, He turned a deaf Ear to their Petitions, as well concerning his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with the Popish Lords, as against the erecting of Tythes into Temporall Lordships. In this Assembly also they passed an Act, prohibiting all such as professed Religion, to traffick in any part of the Dominions of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> where the Inquisition was in force. And this to be observed under the pain of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till His Majesty could obtain a free Trade for them, without fear of any danger to their Goods or Consciences. Which being complained of to the King, and by Him looked upon as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment upon the Royal Prerogative, the Merchants were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to proceed as formerly. In opposition whereunto, the Ministers fulminate their Censures, till the Merchants generally made offer to forbear that Trade, as soon as their Accounts were made, and that their Creditors in those parts had discharged their Debts. They pass'd another Order also in the said Assembly, for putting down the <hi>Monday's</hi> Market in the City of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> under pretence that the Sabbath was thereby prophaned. Which so displeased the Shoo-makers, and other Artificers, that they came

tumultuously to the Ministers Houses, and threatned to turn them out of the City, without more ado, if ever that Act were put into execution. For fear whereof, that Project was dashed for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and thereby an occasion given unto the Court to affirm this of them, <hi>That Rascals and Sowters could obtain that at the Ministers hands, which the King was not able to do in matters far more just and reasonable.</hi> To such audaciousness were they grown upon the filly confidence of their own establishment, as to put limits upon Trade, dispose of Markets, and prostitute both King and Council, to the lust of their Preachers. But we will let them run unto the end of their Line, and then pull them back.</p>
            <p n="38">38. And first, We will begin with the Conspiracies and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of <hi>Francis Steward,</hi> Earl of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> Son of <hi>Iohn,</hi> Prior of <hi>Coldingham,</hi> one of the many Bastards of K. <hi>Iames</hi> the Fifth; who, by the Daughter and Heir of <hi>Iames</hi> Lord <hi>Hepborn,</hi> the late Earl of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> became the Father of this <hi>Francis.</hi> A man he was of a seditious and turbulent nature, principled in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and thereby fitted and disposed to run their courses.<note place="margin">1585.</note> At first he joyned himself to the banished Lords, who seized upon the King at <hi>Sterling</hi>; not because he was any way engaged in their former Practises, for which they had been forced to flye their Countrey; but because he would ingratiate himself with the Lords of that Faction, and gain some credit with the Kirk. But being a man also of a dissolute Life, gave such scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to all Honest and Religious men, that in the end to gain the Reputation of a Convert, he was contented to be brought to the Stool of Repentance, to make Confession of his Sins, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise Reformation for the time to come.<note place="margin">1590.</note> Presuming now upon the Favour of the Kirk, he consults with Witches, enquires into the Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For which notorious Crimes, (and so esteemed by all the Laws both of God and Man) he was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Ward, and breaking Prison, was confiscated, proclaimed Traytor, and all Intelligence and Commerce interdicted with him. After this, he projects a Faction in the Court it self, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of taking down the Power and Pride of the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor then being.<note place="margin">1591.</note> But finding himself too weak to atchieve the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, he departs secretly into <hi>England.</hi> His Faction in the Court being formed with some more Advantage, he is brought privily into the Palace of <hi>Haly-Rood</hi> House, makes himself Master of the Gates, secureth the Fort, and violently attempts to seize the King. But the King hearing of the noise, retired himself to a strong Tower, and caused all the Passages to be locked and barred. Which <hi>Bothwell</hi> not being able to force, he resolves to burn the Palace and the King together. But before Fire could be made ready, the Alarm was taken, the <hi>Edenbourgers</hi> raised, and the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:54836:198"/>
Conspirators compelled, with the loss of some of their Lives, to quit the place.</p>
            <p n="39">
               <note place="margin">1592.</note>39. The next year he attempts the like at <hi>Falkland,</hi> where he showed himself with a Party of six-score Horse; but the rest of the Conspirators not appearing, he retires again, is entertained private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by some eminent Persons; and having much encreased his Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lives concealed in <hi>England.</hi> The Queen negotiates his return; and by the Lord <hi>Burrough</hi> her Ambassador, desires the King to take him into Grace and Favour. Which being denyed, a way is found to bring him into the King's Bed-chamber, together with one of his Confederates, with their Swords in their hands, followed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by many others of the Faction,<note place="margin">1593.</note> by whom the King is kept in a kind of Custody, till he had granted their Desires. At last, upon the Mediation of the <hi>English</hi> Ambassador, and some of the Ministers of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> who were of Counsel in the Plot, the King is brought to condescend to these Conditions; that is to say, <hi>That Pardon should be given to</hi> Bothwell, <hi>and his Accomplices, for all matters past; and that this Pardon should be ratified by Act of Parliament, in</hi> November <hi>following: That, in the mean time, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord</hi> Hume, <hi>the Master of</hi> Glammir, <hi>and Sir</hi> George Hume, (who were all thought to favour the Popish Lords) <hi>should be excluded from the Court.</hi> And finally, <hi>That</hi> Bothwell <hi>and all his Party, should be held good Subjects.</hi> But these Conditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extorted, were not long made good; Agreed on <hi>August</hi> the 14<hi>th,</hi> and declared void by a Convention of Estates at <hi>Sterling,</hi> on the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September.</hi> Some Troubles being raised upon this occasion, and as soon blown over; <hi>Bothwell</hi> is cited to appear at <hi>Edenborough</hi>; and failing of his day, is declared Rebel; which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly served to animate him to some greater Mischief: For, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand assisted by the <hi>English</hi> Ambassador, he prepares new Forces, desires the Lords which were of his Confederacy to do the like, under pretence of banishing to Popish Lords; but in plain truth to make the King of no signification in the Power of Government.<note place="margin">1594.</note> Accompanied with Four hundred Horse, he puts himself into <hi>Leith,</hi> to the great affrightment of the King, who was then at <hi>Edenborough.</hi> But understanding that the rest of his Associates were not drawn together, it was thought good to charge upon him with the Bands of that City, and some Artillery from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, before his Numbers were encreased. Which Counsel sped so well, that he lost the day, and therewith all his hopes in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> too.</p>
            <p n="40">40. For Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being sensible at the last of the great Dishonour which she had drawn upon her self by favouring such an Infamous Rebel, caused Proclamation to be made, That no man should receive or harbour him within her Dominions. And the Kirk, moved by her Example, and the King's Request, when they perceived that he could be no longer serviceable to their Ends and Purposes, gave Order that the Ministers in all Places should disswade their Flocks from concurring with him for the time to
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:54836:198"/>
come, or joyning with any other in the like Insurrections against that Authority which was divested by God in His Majesty's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The Treasons and Seditious practises of which man, I have laid together, the better to express those continual Dangers which were threatned by him to the King; by which He was reduced to the necessity of complying with the desires of the Kirk, setling their Discipline, and in all points conforming to them for His own preservation. But nothing lost the Rebel more, than a new Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise which he had with the Popish Lords, whereby he furnished the King with a just occasion to lay him open to the Ministers, and the rest of the Subjects, in his proper colours, as one that was not acted by a Zeal to Religion, though under that disguise he masked his Ambitious Ends. In fine, being despised by the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Excommunicated by the Kirk for joyning with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Lords, he was reduced to such a miserable condition, that he neither knew whom to trust, nor where to flye. Betrayed by those of his own Party, (by whom his Brother <hi>Hercules</hi> was impeached, discovered, and at last brought to Execution in the Streets at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>) he fled for shelter into <hi>France,</hi> where finding sorry en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, he removed into <hi>Spain,</hi> and afterwards retired to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>; in which he spent the short remainder of his Life in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Beggery.</p>
            <p n="41">41. About this time one of the Ministers, named <hi>Rosse,</hi> uttered divers Treasonable and Irreverent speeches against His Majesty, in a Sermon of his preached at <hi>Perth</hi>; for which the King craved Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of the next Assembly: and he required this also of them, <hi>That to prevent the like for the times ensuing, the Ministers should be inhibited by some Publick Order, from uttering any irreverent speeches in the Pulpit, against His Majesty's Person, Council, or Estate, under the pain of Deprivation.</hi> This had been often moved before, and was now hearkned to with as little care as in former times. All which the King got by it,<note place="margin">1595.</note> was no more but this, that <hi>Rosse</hi> was only admonished to speak so reverently of His Majesty for the time to come, as might give no just cause of complaint against him. As ill success he had in the next Assembly; to which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended some Conditions about the passing of the Sentence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; two of which were to this effect: 1.
<q>That none should be excommunicated for Civil causes, for any Crimes of leight importance, or for particular wrongs offered to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, lest the Censure should fall into contempt. 2. That no summary Excommunication should be thenceforth used, but that lawful citations of the Parties should go before, in all manner of Causes whatsoever.</q>
To both which, he received no other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, but That the Points were of too great weight to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on the sudden, and should be therefore agitated in the next Assembly. In the mean time it was provided, That no Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Excommunication should be used, but in such occasions in which the Safety of the Church seemed to be in danger. Which Exception much displeased the King,<note place="margin">1596.</note> knowing that they would
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:54836:199"/>
serve their turn by it, whensoever they pleased. Nor sped he bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with them, when he treated severally, than when they were in the Assembly. The Queen of <hi>England</hi> was grown old, and he desired to be in good terms with all his Subjects, for bearing down all opposition which might be made against his Title after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease. To which end he deals with <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> a Preacher of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> about the calling home the Popish Lords, men of great Power and Credit in their several Countreys, who had been banished the last year for holding some intelligence with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King: <hi>Bruce</hi> excepts only against <hi>Huntley,</hi> whom the King seemed to favour above all the rest; and positively declared, <hi>That the King must lose him, if he called home</hi> Huntley; <hi>for that it was impossible to keep them both.</hi> And yet this <hi>Bruce</hi> was reckoned for a Moderate man, one of the quietest and best-natur'd of all the Pack. What was the issue of this business, we shall see here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p n="42">42. In the mean time, let us pass over into <hi>France,</hi> and look upon the Actions of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> there, of whose deserting their new King, we have spoke of before: And though they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards afforded him some Supplies both of Men and Money, when they perceived him backed by the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and thereby able to maintain a defensive Warr without their assistance; yet they did it in so poor a manner, as made him utterly despair of getting his desired Peace by an absolute Victory. In which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity he beholds his own sad condition, his Kingdom wasted by a long and tedious Warr; invaded, and in part possessed by the Forces of <hi>Spain</hi>; new Leagues encreasing every day both in strength and number, and all upon the point of a new Election, or otherwise to divide the Provinces amongst themselves. To prevent which, he reconciles himself to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> goes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally to the Mass; and in all other publick Offices which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Religion, conformed himself unto the directions of the Pope. And for so doing, he gives this account to <hi>Wilks,</hi> the Queen's Ambassador, sent purposely to expostulate with him upon this occasion; that is to say, That Eight hundred of the Nobility, and no fewer than Nine Regiments of the Protestant Party, who had put themselves into the Service of his Predecessor, returned unto their several homes, and could not be induced to stay with him upon any perswasions. That such of the Protestants as he had taken at the same time to his Privil-Council, were so intent on their own business, that they seldom vouchsafed their presence at the Council-Table: so that being already forsaken by those on whom he relyed, and fearing to be forsaken by the Papists also, he was forced to run upon that course which unavoidable necessity had compelled him to: and finally, that being thus necessitated to a change of Religion, he rather chose to make it look like his own free Act, that he might thereby free the Doctrine of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants from those Aspersions which he conceived must otherwise needs have fallen upon it, if that Conversion had been wrought
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:54836:199"/>
upon him by Dispute and Argument; for hearkening whereunto, he had bound himself when he first took the Crown upon him. If by this means the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>France</hi> shall fall to as low an ebb as the Fortunes of their Brethren did in <hi>England</hi> at the same time; they can lay the blame on nothing but their own Ingratitude, their Disobedience to their King, and the <hi>Genevian</hi> Principles that were rooted in them, which made them Enemies to the Power and Guidance of all Soveraign Princes. But the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still in heart of his own Religion, or at least exceeding favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all those that professed the same; he willingly passed over all unkindness which had grown between them; and by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance or connivence, gave them such advantages, as made them able to dispute the point with his Son and Successor, whether they would continue Subjects to the Crown, or not.</p>
            <p n="43">43. In the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> all things prospered with the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi> who then thrive best when they involve whole Nations in Blood and Sacriledg. By whose example the <hi>Calvinians</hi> take up Arms in the City of <hi>Embden,</hi> renounce all obedience to their Prince, and put themselves into the Form of a Commonwealth. This <hi>Embden</hi> is the principal City of the Earl of <hi>East-Friesland,</hi> (situate on the mouth of the River <hi>Emns,</hi> called <hi>Amasus</hi> by <hi>Latin</hi> Writers) and from thence denominated. Beautified with a Haven so deep and large, that the greatest Ships with full sail are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into it. The People rich, the Buildings general fair, both private and publick; especially the Town-Hall, and the stately Castle: Which last being situate on a rising-ground, near the mouth of the Haven, and strongly fortified toward the Town, had for long time been the Principal Seat of the Earls of that Province. The second Earl. hereof, called <hi>Ezard,</hi> when he had governed this Countrey for the space of sixty years, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, did first begin to introduce the Doctrines of <hi>Luther</hi> into his Estates, <hi>Anno</hi> 1525. But being old, he left the Work to be accomplished by <hi>Enno</hi> his eldest Son, who first succeeded in that Earldom; and using the assistance of <hi>Hardimbergius,</hi> a Moderate and Learned man, established the <hi>Augustine</hi> Confession in the City of <hi>Embden</hi>; and afterwards, in all places under his command, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the exercise of all Religion, but the <hi>Lutheran</hi> only. Which Prohibition notwithstanding, some <hi>Anabaptists</hi> from the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Westphalia,</hi> found way to plant themselves in <hi>Embden,</hi> where liberty of Trade was freely granted to all comers; which allured thither also many Merchants and Artificers, with their Wives and Families, out of the next-adjoining Provinces of <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and <hi>West-Friesland,</hi> then subject to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally <hi>Calvinians</hi> in point of Doctrine, were notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding suffered to plant there also, in regard of the great benefit which accrued unto it by their Trade and Manufactures. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more encreased the Power and Wealth of that City, than the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> removed from <hi>Antwerp</hi> thither, on occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Troubles, and the great fear they had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:54836:200"/>
of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who seemed to breathe nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction unto their Religion. And though the <hi>English</hi> Trade was removed not long after unto <hi>Hambourgh,</hi> upon the hope of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Priviledges and Immunities than they had at <hi>Embden</hi>; yet still they kept a Factory in it, which added much to the improvement of their Wealth and Power; insomuch that the Inhabitants of this Town only are affirmed to have Sixty Ships of One hundred Tun a-piece; and Six hundred lesser Barks of their own; besides Seven hundred Busses and Fishing Boats; maintained for the most part by their Herring-fishing on the Coast of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="44">44. Having attained unto this Wealth, they grew proud with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; and easily admitting the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines, began to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce also the <hi>Genevian</hi> Discipline; connived at by <hi>Ezardus</hi> the second, the Son of <hi>Enno,</hi> in respect of the profit which redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them to his Exchequer, though they began to pinch upon him to the diminution of his Power. In which condition it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till his marriage with <hi>Catharine</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Gustavus Ericus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi>; who being zealously addicted to the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Forms, and sensible of those great Incroachments which had been made upon the Earl's Temporal Jurisdiction by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistorians,</hi> perswaded him to look better to his own Authority, and to regain what he had lost by that Connivence. Something was done for the recovering of his Power, but it went on slowly, hoping to compass that by time and dissimulation, which he could not easily obtain by force of Arms. After whose death, and the short Government of <hi>Enno</hi> the second, the matter was more stoutly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Catharine</hi>; who did not only curb the <hi>Consistorians</hi> in the exercise of their Discipline, but questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned many of those Priviledges which the unwariness of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors had indulged unto them. The <hi>Calvinians</hi> had by this time made so strong a Party,<note place="margin">1594.</note> that they were able to remonstrate against their Prince; complaining in the same, That the Earl had violated their Priviledges, and infringed their Liberties: That he had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed his Power against Right and Reason, in matters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Church, and belonged to the Consistory. That he assumed unto himself the Power of distributing the Alms or publick Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by which they use to bind the poor to depend upon them. That he prohibited the exercise of all Religions, except only the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Ausberg</hi>: And that he would not stand to the Agreement which was made betwixt them, for interdicting all Appeals to the Chamber of <hi>Spires.</hi> Having prepared the way by this Remonstrance, they take an opportunity when the Earl was absent, arm themselves, and seize by force upon his Castle, demolished part of it which looks toward the Town, and possest themselves of all the Ordnance, Arms, and Ammunition, with an intent hereafter to employ them against him. And this being done, they govern all Affairs in the Name of the Senate, without relation to their Prince; making themselves a Free-Estate, or Commonwealth, like their <hi>Belgick</hi> Neighbours.</p>
            <p n="45">
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:54836:200"/>45. Extreamly moved with this affront, and not being able other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to reduce them to a sense of their duty, he borrows Men and Arms from <hi>Lubeck,</hi> to compel them to it. With which assistance he erects a Fort on the further side of the Haven, to spoil their Trade, and, by impoverishing the people, to regain the Town. The Senate hereupon send abroad their Edicts to the Nobility and Commons of <hi>East-Friesland</hi> it self, requiring them not to aid their own lawful Prince, with Men, Arms, or Money; threatning them, if they did the contrary, to stop the course of all Provisions which they had from their City; and, by breaking down their Dams and Sluces, to let the Ocean in upon them, and drown all their Countrey. Which done, they make their Applications to the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> requiring their assistance in that common Cause, to which they had been most encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by their Example; not doubting of their Favour to a City of their own Religion, united to them by a long intercourse of Trade, and resemblance of Manners; and not to be deserted by them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a manifest betraying of their own Security. All this the States had under their consideration. But they consider this withall, That if they should assist the <hi>Embdeners</hi> in a publick way, the Earl would presently have recourse for some aid from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> which might draw a Warr upon them on that side where they lay most open. Therefore they so contrived the matter, with such Art and Cunning, that carrying themselves no otherwise than as Arbiters and Umpires between the Parties, they discharged some Companies of Soldiers which they had in <hi>West-Friesland,</hi> who presently put themselves into the Pay of the <hi>Embdens,</hi> and thereby caused the Earl to desist from his Intrenchments on the other side of the Haven. After which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed nothing but Warrs and Troubles between the City and the Earl, till the year 1606. At what time, by the Mediation of the <hi>English</hi> Ambassador, and some other Honourable Friends, the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were compromised to this effect: That all the Ordnance, Arms, and Ammunition, which were found in the Castle, should be restored unto the Earl. That he should have to his own use the whole Profit of the Imposts which were laid on Wine; and half the benefit of those Amercements or Fines which should be raised upon Delinquents, together with the sole Royalties both of Fishing and Hunting. And, on the other side, That the <hi>Embdeners</hi> should have free Trade, with all the Profits and Emoluments belonging to it, which should be granted to them by Letters Patents. But for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to any part of the Publick Government, or making resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his House or Castles, the ancient Seat of his abode, as there was nothing yeelded or agreed on then, so could he never get posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of them from that time to this. Which said, we must cross over again into the Isle of <hi>Brittain,</hi> where we shall find the <hi>English Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> climbing up by some new devices, and the <hi>Scottish Presbyterians</hi> tumbling down from their former height, till they were brought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to as low a fall as their <hi>English</hi> Brethren.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>English Puritans</hi> having sped so ill in a course of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, were grown so wise as to endeavour the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of that Fort by an undermining, which they had no hope to take by storm or battery. And the first course they fell upon, besides the Artifices lately mentioned, for altering the posture of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in the <hi>Spittle</hi>-Sermons; and that which was intended as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to it, was the Design of Dr. <hi>Bound,</hi> (though rather carried under his Name, than of his devising) for lessening, by degrees, the Reputation of the ancient Festivals. The Brethren had tryed many ways to suppress them formerly, as having too much in them of the Superstitions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; but they had found no way succesful till they fell on this; which was, To set on foot some new Sabbath-Doctrine; and by advancing the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:54836:202"/>
of the Lord's-Day Sabbath, to cry down the rest. Some had been hammering on this Anvil ten years before; and had procured the Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London</hi> to present a Petition to the Queen for the suppressing of all Plays and Interludes on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, (as they pleased to call it) within the Liberties of their City. The gaining of which point, made them hope for more, and secretly to retail those Speculations which afterward <hi>Bound</hi> sold in gross, by publishing his Treatise of the Sabbath, which came out this year 1595. And as this Book was published for other Reasons, so more particularly for decrying the yearly-Festivals, as appears by this passage in the same, viz. <hi>That he seeth not where the Lord hath given any Authority to his Church, ordinarily and perpetually, to sanctifie any day, except that which he hath sanctified himself:</hi> And makes it an especial Argument Argument against the goodness of Religion in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> That to the Seventh-day they had joyned so many other days, and made them equal with the Seventh, if not superior thereunto, as well in the solemnity of Divine Offices, as restraint from labour. So that we may perceive by this, what their intent was from the very beginning, To cry down the Holy-days as superstitious, Popish Ordinances, that so their new-found Sabbath being left alone, (and Sabbath now it must be called) might become more eminent: Some other Ends they might have in it, as, The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling of all persons of what rank soever, to submit themselves unto the yoak of their Sabbath-rigors, whom they despaired of bringing under their <hi>Presbyteries:</hi> Of which more hereafter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now for the Doctrine, it was marshalled in these Positions; that is to say, That the Commandment of sanctifying every Seventh day, as in the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Decalogue, is Natural, Moral, and Perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. That when all other things in the Jewish Church, were so chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that they were clean taken away, this stands, the observation of the Sabbath. And though Jewish and Rabinical this Doctrine was, it carried a fair shew of Piety, at the least, in the opinion of the common people, and such as did not stand to examine the true grounds thereof, but took it up on the appearance; such as did judg thereof, not by the workmanship of the Stuff, but the gloss and colour.

               </gap> infused into the people of <hi>England</hi>: For what did follow hereupon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but such monstrous Paradoxes, and those delivered in the Pulpit, as would make every good man tremble at the hearing of them? It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preached at a Market-Town, (as my Author tells me) <hi>That to do any servile work or business on the Lord's day, was as great a sin as to kill a man, or commit Adultery.</hi> In <hi>Somersetshire, That to throw a Bowl on the Lord's day, was as great a sin as to kill a man.</hi> In <hi>Norfolk, That to make a Feast, or dress a Wedding-Dinner on the same, was as great a sin as for a Father to take a Knife and cut his Child's throat.</hi> And in <hi>Suffolk, That to ring more Bells than one, on the Lord's day, was as
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:54836:202"/>
great a sin as to commit a Murther.</hi> Some of which Preachers being complained of, occasioned a more strict enquiry into all the rest; and not into their Persons only, but their Books and Pamphlets; insomuch that both Arch-bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and Chief Justice <hi>Popham,</hi> commanded these Books to be called in, and neither to be Printed nor made common for the time to come. Which strict proceedings notwithstanding, this Doctrine became more dispersed than can be imagined, and possibly might encrease the more for the oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; no System of Divinity, no Book of Catechetical Doctrine, from thenceforth published, in which these Sabbath-Speculations were not pressed on the People's Consciences.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Endearing of which Doctrines, as formerly, to advance their Elderships, they spared no place or Text of Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the Word Elder did occurre; and, without going to the Heralds, had framed a Pedigree thereof from <hi>Iethro,</hi> from <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, and from <hi>Adam,</hi> finally. So did these men proceed in their new Devices; publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Holy Writ, both the Antiquity and the Authority of their Sabbath-day. No passage of God's Book unransacked, where there was mention of a Sabbath; whether the Legal Sabbath charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the <hi>Iews,</hi> or the Spiritual Sabbath of the Soul from sin, which was not fitted and applied to the present purpose; though, if examined as it ought, with no lesse reason, than <hi>Paveant illi, &amp; non paveam Ego,</hi> was by an ignorant Priest alledged from Scripture, to prove that his Parishioners ought to <hi>pave</hi> the Chancel. And on the confidence of those Proofs, they did presume exceedingly of their success, by reason of the general entertainment which those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines found with the common people, who looked upon them with as much regard, and no less reverence, than if they had been sent immediately from the Heavens themselves, for encrease of Piety. Possest with which, they greedily swallowed down the Hook which was baited for them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Hook, indeed, which had so fastned them to those men who love to fish in troubled waters, that by this Artifice there was no small hope conceived amongst them, to fortifie their Side, and make good that Cause, which till this trim Device was so thought of, was almost grown desperate. By means whereof, they btought so great a bondage on all sorts of people, that a greater never was imposed on the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves, though they had pinned their Consciences on the Sleeves of the Scribes and Pharises. But then withall, by bringing all sorts of people into such a bondage, they did so much improve their Power, and encrease their Party, that they were able at the last to oppose Edctis of the two next Kings, for tolerating lawful sports upon that Day, and to confirm some of their Sabbata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Rigors, by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From this Design, let us proceed to the next, which was brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this. When the <hi>Genevian-English</hi> resolved to erect their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, it was thought requisite to prepare the way unto it, by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines of <hi>Predestination</hi>n, that so men's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being formed and possessed by the one, they might the more
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:54836:203"/>
easily be enclined to embrace the other, so long connived at by the Supream Governours of the Church and State, to which they were exceeding serviceable against the Pope; that in the end those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which at first were counted <hi>Aliens,</hi> came by degrees to be received as <hi>Denizens,</hi> and at last as <hi>Natives.</hi> For being supposed to contain nothing in them contrary to Faith and Manners, they were first commended to the Church as <hi>probable,</hi> next imposed as <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>; and finally, obtruded on the people as her Natural Doctrines. And possibly they might in time have found a general entertainment beyond all exception, if the <hi>Calvinian</hi>-spirit (being impatient of the least opposition) could have permitted other men to enjoy that liberty which they had took unto themselves, and not compelled them to Apologize in their own defences, and thereby shew the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of dissenting from them. One of the first Examples whereof, (for I pass by the branglings between <hi>Champney</hi> and <hi>Crowley,</hi> as long since forgotten) was the complaint of <hi>Travers</hi> to the Lords of the Council, against incomparable <hi>Hooker.</hi> In whom he faulteth this, amongst other things, <hi>That he had taught another Doctrine of Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, than what was laid down in the Word of God, as it was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by all the Churches which professed the Gospel.</hi> To which it was replyed, by that learned man,
<q>That the matter was not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by him in a blind Alley, where there was none to hear it who either had Judgment or Authority to comptrole the same; or covertly insinuated by some gliding sentence; but, that it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly delivered at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Cross:</hi> not hudled in amongst other matters, to the end it might pass without observation; but, that it was opened, proved, and for some reasonable time insisted on. And therefore, that he could not see how the Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> that was present at it, could either excuse so great a fault, or patiently hear, without rebuke then, and controlement after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that any man should preach doctrine <hi>contrary to the Word of God</hi>; especially if the word of God be so understood, not by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interpretation of some, as two or three men, or by a special construction received in some few Books; but as it is understood <hi>by all Churches professing the Gospel,</hi> and therefore even by our own Church amongst the rest.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. This hapned in the year 1591, or thereabouts, somewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the breakings out of the stirrs at <hi>Cambridg,</hi> occasioned by a a Treatise published by <hi>William Perkins,</hi> a well-known Divine, (but withall, a professed <hi>Presbyterian</hi>) entituled, <hi>Armilla Aurea,</hi> or, <hi>The Golden Chain; containing the Order of the Causes of Salvation and Damnation, according to the Word of God.</hi> Maintaining, in this Book, the Dostrine of the <hi>Supra-lapsarians,</hi> and countenanced therein by Dr. <hi>Whitacres,</hi> the Queen's Professor; some opposition was soon made by Dr. <hi>Baroe,</hi> Professor for the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> in the same U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity. Which <hi>Baroe</hi> being by birth a <hi>French</hi>-man, but being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well studied in the Writings of the Ancient Fathers, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, for the space of more than twenty years,<note place="margin">1595.</note> maintained a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Doctrine of Predestination, from that which had been taught
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:54836:203"/>
by <hi>Calvin</hi> and his Disciples; but he was never quarrelled for it till the year 1595, and then not quarrelled for it, but in the person of one <hi>Barret,</hi> who in a Sermon at St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church, had preached such Doctrines as were not pleasing unto <hi>Perkins, Whitacre,</hi> and the rest of that Party. For which being questioned and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Recantation, he rather chose to quit his place in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, than to betray his own Judgment, and the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by a Retractation. The rest of <hi>Baroe</hi>'s Followers, not well pleased with these Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh proceedings, begin to show themselves more publickly than before they did; which made <hi>Baroe</hi> think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self obliged to appear more visibly in the head of his Company, and to encounter openly with Dr. <hi>Whitacre,</hi> whom he beheld as the Chief Leader of the opposite Forces. And the Heats grew so high at last, that the <hi>Calvinians</hi> thought it necessary, in point of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to effect that by Power and Favour, which they could not obtain by force of Argument. To which end they first addressed themselves to the Lord Treasurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> then being their Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, with the disturbances made by <hi>Barret,</hi> thereby preparing him to hearken to such further motions as should be made by them in pursuit of that Quarrel.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But finding little comfort there, they resolved to steer their course by another Compass. And having pre-possest the most Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end Arch-bishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> with the turbulent carriage of those men, the Affionts given to Dr. <hi>Whitacre,</hi> whom (for his learned and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Writings against Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) he most highly favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the great Inconveniences like to grow by that publick Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; they gave themselves good hope of composing those differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, not by way of an Accommodation, but an absolute Conquest. And to this end they dispatched to him certain of their number, in the name of the rest, such as were interested in the Quarrels, (Dr. <hi>Whitacre</hi> himself for one, and therefore like to stirr hard for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Ends). The Articles to which they had reduced the whole state of the business, being ready drawn, and there wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them but the Face of Authority, wherewith, as with <hi>Medu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>'s Head, to confound their Enemies, and turn their Adversaries into stones. And that they might be sent back with the Face of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the most Reverend Arch-bishop, calling unto him Dr. <hi>Flecher,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bristol,</hi> then newly elected unto <hi>London</hi>; and Dr. <hi>Richard Vaughan,</hi> Lord Elect of <hi>Bangor</hi>; together with Dr. <hi>Trindal,</hi> Dean of <hi>Ely</hi>; Dr. <hi>Whitacre,</hi> and the rest of the Divines which came from <hi>Cambridg</hi>; proposed the said Articles to their consideration, at his House in <hi>Lambeth,</hi> on the tenth of <hi>November</hi>; by whom these Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (from thenceforth called the <hi>Nine Articles of Lambeth</hi>) were presently agreed upon, and sent down to <hi>Cambridg,</hi> not as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Church, but as a necessary Expedient to compose those differences which had been raised amongst the Students of that University. And so much was acknowledged by the Arch-bishop himself, when he was questioned by the Queen for his actings in it. For so it was, that the Queen being made acquainted with all that
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:54836:204"/>
passed, became exceedingly offended at the Innovation; and was upon the point of causing all of them to be attainted in a <hi>Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire</hi>; but by the mediation of some Friends of <hi>Whitgift</hi>'s, and the high opinion which she had of his Parts and Person, she was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to admit him to his defence. And he accordingly declared, in all humble manner,
<q>That he and his Associates had not made any Canons, Articles, or Decrees, with an intent that they should serve hereafter for a standing-Rule to direct the Church; but only had resolved on some Propositions to be sent to <hi>Cambridg,</hi> for quieting some unhappy differences in that University.</q>
With which Answer Her Majesty being somewhat pacified, commanded notwithstanding, That he should speedily recall and suppress those Articles: Which was performed with such Care and Diligence, that a Copy of them was not to be found for a long time after.</p>
            <p n="8">8. As for the Articles themselves, they were so contrived, that both the <hi>Sabbatarians,</hi> and the <hi>Supra-lapsarians,</hi> (very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at odds amongst themselves) might be sheltred under them, to the intent that both may be secured from the common Adversary. Which Articles I find translated in these following words, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>I. <hi>God from Eternity hath predestinated certain men unto life; certain men he hath reprobated.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>The moving or efficient Cause of Predestination unto life, is not the fore-sight of Faith, or of Perseverance, or of Good Works, or of any thing that is in the person predestinated; but only the Good Will and Pleasure of God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. <hi>There is predetermined a certain number of the Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, which can neither be augmented nor diminished.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IV. <hi>Those who are not predestinate to salvation, shall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily damned for their sins.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>V. <hi>A true, living, and justifying-faith, and the Spirit of God justifying, is not extinguished, falleth not away, it vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not away in the Elect, either totally, or finally.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>VI. <hi>A man truly faithful; that is, such an one who is endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a justifying-faith; is certain, with the full assurance of Faith, of the remission of his sins, and of his everlasting salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Christ.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>VII. <hi>Saving-Grace is not given, is not granted, is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to all men, by which they may be saved if they will.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>VIII. <hi>No man can come unto Christ, unless it be given unto him, and unless the Father shall draw him; and all men are not drawn by the Father, that they may come to the Son.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IX. <hi>It is not in the will or power of every one, to be saved.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Such were the Articles of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> so much insisted on by those of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Faction, in succeeding times, as comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them the chief Heads of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Doctrine, in reference to the points of the Divine Election and Reprobation; of Universal
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:54836:204"/>
Grace, and the impossibility of a total or a final falling from the true justifying-faith; which were the subject of the Controversies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Baroe</hi> and <hi>Whitacre.</hi> Some have adventured hereupon to rank this most Reverend Arch-bishop in the List of these <hi>Calvinists</hi>; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that he could not otherwise have agreed to those Articles, if he had not been himself of the same Opinion. And possible it is, that he might not look so far into them, as to consider the ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which might follow on them; or that he might prefer the pacifying of some present Dissenters, before the apprehension of such Inconveniences as were more remote; or else, according to the custom of all such as be in Authority, he thought it necessary to preserve <hi>Whitacre</hi> in power and credit, against all such as did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him; the Merit and Abilities of the man being very eminent. For if this Argument were good, it might as logically be inferred, That he was a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> or a <hi>Melancthonian</hi> at the least, in these points of Doctrine, because he countenanced those men who openly and professedly had opposed the <hi>Calvinian.</hi> In which respect, as he took part with <hi>Hooker</hi> at the Council-Table, against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Informations of <hi>Travers,</hi> as before is said; so he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into his service Mr. <hi>Samuel Harsnet,</hi> then being one of the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of <hi>Pembroke</hi>-Hall; who in a Sermon preached at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Cross,</hi> the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1584, had so dissected the whole <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glian</hi> Doctrine of Reprobation, as made it seem most ugly in the ears of his Auditors, as afterwards in the eyes of all Spectators, when it came to be Printed. Which man he did not only entertain as his Chaplain at large, but used his Service in his House, as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in ordinary, employed him in many of his Affairs; and finally, commended him to the care of King <hi>IAMES</hi>; by whom he was first made Master of <hi>Pembroke</hi>-Hall, and afterwards preferred to the See of <hi>Chichester,</hi> from thence translated to <hi>Norwich,</hi> and at last to <hi>York.</hi>

            <p n="10">10. No less remarkable was this year for the repairing of the Cross in <hi>Cheap-side</hi>; which having been defaced in the year 1581, and so continued ever since, was now thought fit to be restored to its former beauty. A Cross it was of high esteem, and of good Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, erected by K. <hi>Edward</hi> the first, <hi>Anno</hi> 1290, in honour of Queen <hi>Elienor</hi> his beloved Wife, whose Body had there rested, as it was removed to the place of her Burial. But this Cross being much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, <hi>Iohn Hatherly,</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1441, procured leave of K. <hi>HENRY</hi> the 6<hi>th,</hi> to take it down, and to re-edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the same in more beautiful manner, for the greater honour of the City. Which leave being granted, and 200 hundred Fodder of Lead allowed him toward the beginning of the Work, it was then curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously wrought at the charge of divers wealthy Citizens, adorned with many large and massie Images; but more especially advanced by the Munificence of <hi>Iohn Fisher,</hi> Mercer, who gave Six hundred Marks for the finishing of it. The whole Structure being reared in the second year of K. <hi>HENRY</hi> the 7<hi>th, Anno</hi> 1486; was after gilded over in the year 1522, for the entertainment of the Emperor
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:54836:205"/>
               <hi>CHARLES</hi> the fifth; new burnished against the Coronation of Queen <hi>Anne Bullen, Anno</hi> 1533; as afterwards at the Coronation of King <hi>EDWARD</hi> the sixth: and finally, at the Magnificent Reception of King <hi>PHILIP,</hi> 1554. And having for so long time continued an undefaced Monument of Christian Piety, was quarrelled by the <hi>Puritans</hi> of the present Reign; who being emulous of the Zeal of the <hi>French Calvinians,</hi> whom they found to have demolished all Crosses wheresoever they came; they caused this Cross to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the Jurors in several <hi>Ward-Motes,</hi> for standing in the High-way, to the hindering of Carts, and other Carriages: but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no remedy in that course, they resolved to apply themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another. In pursuance whereof, they first set upon it in the night, <hi>Iune</hi> 21, <hi>Anno</hi> 1581, violently, breaking and defacing all the lowest Images, which were placed round about the same; that is to say, the Images of Christ's Resurrection, of the Virgin <hi>MARY,</hi> K. <hi>EDWARD</hi> the Confessor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But more particularly, the Image of the blessed Virgin was at that time robbed of her Son, and her Arms broke by which she held Him in her Lap, and her whole Body haled with Ropes, and left likely to fall. Proclamation presently was made, with promise of Reward to any one that could or would discover the chief Actors in it. But without effect.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In which condition it remained till this present year, when the said Image was again fastned and repaired; the Images of Christ's Resurrection, and the rest, continuing broken, as before. And on the East side of the said Cross where the steps had been, was then set up a curious wrought Tabernacle of gray Marble, and in the same an Alablaster Image of <hi>Diana,</hi> from whose naked Breasts there trilled continually some streams of Water, conveyed unto it from the <hi>Thames.</hi> But the madness of this Faction could not so be stayed; for the next year (that I may lay all things together which concern this Cross) a new mishapen Son, as born out of time, all naked, was put into the Arms of the Virgin's Image, to serve for matter of derision to the common people. And in the year 1599, the figure of the Cross, erected on the top of the Pile, was taken down by Publick Order, under pretence that otherwise it might have fallen, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered many; with an intent to raise a <hi>Pyramis</hi> or Spire in the place thereof: which coming to the knowledg of the Lords of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>uncil, they directed their Letters to the Lord Mayor then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whom they required in the Queen's Name to cause the said Cross to be repaired and advanced as formerly. But the Cross still remaining headless for a year and more, and the Lords not enduring any longer such a gross Contempt, they re-inforced their Letters to the next Lord Mayor, dated <hi>December</hi> 24, in the year 1600. In which they willed and commanded him, in pursuance of her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's former Directions, to cause the said Cross, without more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, to be re-advanced; respecting, in the same, the great Antiquity and continuance of that stately Monument, erected for an Ensign of our Christianity. In obedience unto which Commands, a Cross was forthwith framed of timber, cover'd with lead, and set up and gilded;
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:54836:205"/>
and the whole body of the Pile new cleansed from filth and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish: Which gave such fresh displeasure to some zealous Brethren, that within twelve nights after, the Image of the blessed Virgin was again defaced, by plucking off her Crown, and almost her Head; dispossessing her of her naked Child, and stabbing her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the breast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Most ridiculous Follies!</p>
            <p n="12">12. In the beginning of the year,<note place="margin">1596.</note> we find Sir <hi>Thomas Egerton</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Custody of the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor in effect, under the Title of Lord Keeper; to which Place he was admitted on the sixth of <hi>May,</hi> to the great joy of the Arch-bishop, who always looked upon him as a lover of Learning, a constant fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of the Clergy, zealous for the established Government, and a faithful Friend unto himself upon all occasions. Who being now Peered with the Lord Chancellor, and the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> assured of the good-will of the Lord Treasurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> and strengthned with the Friendship of Sir <hi>Robert Cicil,</hi> Principal Secretary of State, was better fortified than ever. And at this time Her Majesty laying on his shoulders the burden of all Church-Concernments, told him, It should fall on his Soul and Conscience, if any thing fell out amiss; in that by reason of her age she had thought good to ease her self of that part of her Cares, and looked that he should yeeld an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof to Almighty God. So that, upon the matter, he was all in all, for all Church-Affairs, and more especially in the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Bishopricks, and other Ecclesiastical Promotions. For his first entrance on which Trust, he preferrs Dr. <hi>Thomas Bilson</hi> to the See of <hi>Worcester,</hi> who received his Episcopal Consecration on the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iune, Anno</hi> 1596. and by his Favour was translated within two years after to the Church of <hi>Winchester.</hi> He advanced also his old Friend, Dr. <hi>Richard Bancroft,</hi> to the See of <hi>London</hi>; whom he consecrated on the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1597, that he might always have him near him for Advice and Counsel. Which Famous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late (that I may note this by the way) was born at <hi>Farnworth,</hi> in the County of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> Baptized <hi>September</hi> 1544. His Father was <hi>Iohn Bancroft,</hi> Gentleman; his Mother, <hi>Mary Curwin,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Iohn,</hi> Brother of <hi>Hugh Curwin,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Oxon,</hi> whose eldest Son was <hi>Christopher,</hi> the Father of Dr. <hi>Iohn Bancroft,</hi> who after dyed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of that See, <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. But this <hi>Richard,</hi> of whom now we speak, being placed by his Unkle, Dr. <hi>Curwin,</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Colledg</hi> in <hi>Cambridg</hi>; from thence removed to <hi>Iesus Colledg,</hi> in the same Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, because the other was suspected to incline to <hi>Novelism.</hi> His Unkle, Dr. <hi>Curwin,</hi> being preferred to the Arch-bishoprick of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> made him a Prebend of that Church: after whose death, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Chaplain to <hi>Cox,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> who gave him the Rectory of <hi>Teversham,</hi> not far from <hi>Cambridg.</hi> Being thus put into the Road of Preferment, he proceeded Batchellor of Divinity, <hi>Anno</hi> 1580, and Doctor, in the year 1585: About which time he put himself into the Service of Sir <hi>Christopher Hatton,</hi> by whose recommendation he was made a Prebend of St. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi> 1592. From whence he had the earlier passage to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in <hi>London.</hi>

Trade of Lecturing in the Town of <hi>Nottingham:</hi> and, to advance some Reputation to his Person, pretends an extraordinary Power in casting out Devils. He practised first on one <hi>Catharine Wright, An.</hi> 1586. But finding some more powerful Practises to be then on foot, in favour of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Discipline, he laid that Project by till all others failed him. But in the year 1592, he resumes the Practise, hoping to compass that by Wit and <hi>Legerdemain,</hi> which neither <hi>Carthwright</hi> by his Learning, nor <hi>Snape</hi> by his Diligence, <hi>Penry</hi> by his Seditions, or <hi>Hacket</hi> by his damnable Treasons, had the good fortune to effect. He first begins with <hi>William Summers,</hi> an unhappy Boy, whom he first met at <hi>Ashby de la Zouch,</hi> in the Country of —Him he instructs to do such Tricks, as might make him seem to be possest; acquaints him with the manner of the Fits which were observed by <hi>Catharine Wright,</hi> delivers them in writing to him, for his better remembrance, wished him to put the same in practise, and told him, that in so doing he should not want. But either finding no great forwardness in the Boy to learn his Lesson, or being otherwise discouraged from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with him; he applies himself to one <hi>Thomas Darling,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called, The Boy of <hi>Burton, Anno</hi> 1596, whom he found far more dextrous in his Dissimulations; the History of whose Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and Dispossessings, was writ at large by <hi>Iesse Bee,</hi> a Religious sad Lyar; contracted by one <hi>Denison,</hi> a Countrey-Minister; Seen and Allowed by <hi>Hildersham,</hi> (one of the principal sticklers in the Cause of <hi>Presbytery</hi>) and Printed with the good leave and liking of <hi>Darrel</hi> himself; who growing famous by this means, remembers <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> his first Scholar; to whom he gives a second meeting at the Park of <hi>Ashby</hi> teacheth him to act them better than before he did; sends him to see the Boy and <hi>Burton,</hi> that he might learn him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself on the like occasions. And finding him at last grown perfect, sends him to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> with intimation that he should make mention of him in his Fits. <hi>Darrel</hi> is hereupon made Lecturer of the Town of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> (that being the Fish for which he ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) as being thought a marvellous Bug to scare the Devil. And though he had no lawful Calling in that behalf; yet was this given out to be so comfortable a Vocation, and so warrantable in the sight of God, that very few Ministers have had the like; there being no Preacher setled there (as he gave it out) since her Majesty's Reign; as if neither Parsons, nor Vicars, nor any that bear such Popish Names, might pass for Preachers.</p>
            <p n="14">14. After this, he pretends occasion for a journey to <hi>Lancashire</hi>; where he finds seven women possest with Devils, and out of every one of them was affirmed to have cast as many as had entred into <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> Of this he published a Book, <hi>Anno</hi> 1600, though the Exploit was done in this present year, <hi>Anno</hi> 1597. These things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noised abroad by his Consederates, this extraordinary Faculty of casting out Devils, was most highly magnified and cryed up both in Sermons and Printed Pamphlets, as a Candle lighted by God
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:54836:206"/>
upon a Candlestick in the heart and Center of the Land. And no small hopes were built upon it, that it would prove a matter of as great consequence as ever did any such Work that the Lord gave ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, since the time that he restored the Gospel, and as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to all that profess the knowledg of Jesus Christ. Now what this Plot was, may appear by this which is deposed by Mr. <hi>More,</hi> one of Mr. <hi>Darrel</hi>'s great Admirers and Companions, viz. <hi>That when a Prayer was read out of the Common-Prayer-Book, in the hearing of those which were possessed in</hi> Lancashire, <hi>the Devils in them were little moved with it: but afterwards, when Mr.</hi> Darrel, <hi>and one Mr.</hi> Dicon, <hi>did severally use such Prayers as for the present occasion they had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then</hi> (saith he) <hi>the wicked Spirits were much more troubled</hi> (or rather, the wicked Spirits did much more torment the Parties): <hi>So lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle do premeditated Prayers which are read out of a Book; and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly do</hi> extemporary <hi>and conceived Prayers torment the Devil.</hi>

            <p n="15">15. But <hi>Summers,</hi> at the last grown weary of his frequent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeitings, tired out with his possessings, dispossessings, and reposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings; and in that Fit discovers all to be but Forgeries, and to have been acted by Confederacy. <hi>Darrell</hi> deals with him to revoke his said Confession, seeks to avoid it by some shifts, discredits it by false Reports; and finally, procures a Commission from the Arch-bishop of <hi>York,</hi> (to whose Province <hi>Nottingham</hi> belongeth) to examine the business. A Commission is thereupon directed to <hi>Iohn Thorald,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> Sheriff of the County; Sir <hi>Iohn Byron,</hi> Knight; <hi>Iohn Stanhop,</hi> &amp;c. (most of them being <hi>Darrell</hi>'s Friends) the Commission exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, <hi>March</hi> 20: no fewer than seventeen Witnesses examined by it, and the Return is made, That he was no Counterfeit. But the Boy stands to it for all that; and on the last of the same Month con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth before the Mayor of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and certain Justices of the Peace, the whole contrivement of the Plot; and within three days after, acts all his Tricks before the Lord Chief Justice, at the publick Assizes. Upon this news the Boy of <hi>Burton</hi> also makes the like Confession: <hi>Darrell</hi> thereupon is convented by the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and by them committed; his Friends and Partizens upon that Commitment are in no small Fury; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he and one of his Associates receive their Censure, little or nothing eased by the Exclamations of his Friends and Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who bitterly inveighed against the Judgment, and the Judges too.

In the same year brake out the Controversie touching <hi>Christ's Descent,</hi> maintained by the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the litteral sense; that is to say, That the Soul of Christ being separated from his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, did <hi>locally</hi> descend into the nethermost Hell, to the end that he might manifest the clear light of his Power and Glory, to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Darkness, triumphing over Satan, as before he did over
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54836:207"/>
Death and Sin. For which, consult the Book of <hi>Articles, Art.</hi> 4. the Homily of the Resurrection, <hi>fol.</hi> 195. and <hi>Nowel</hi>'s Paraphrase on that Article, as it stands in the <hi>Creed,</hi> published in his Authorized Catechism, <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. But <hi>Calvin</hi> puts another sense upon that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and the <hi>Genevian-English</hi> must do the same: For <hi>Calvin</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands by Christ's descending into Hell, that he suffered in his Soul (both in the Garden of <hi>Gethsemanie,</hi> and upon the Cross) all the Torments of Hell, even to abjection from God's Presence, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair it self. Which horrid Blasphemy, though balked by many of his Followers in the Forreign Churches, was taken up, and very zealously promoted by the <hi>English Puritans.</hi> By these men general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was taught in Catechisms, and preached in Pulpits, That true it was, that the death of Christ Jesus on the Cross, and his bloodshed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the remission of our sins, were the first cause of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. But then it was as true withall, That he must and did suffer the death of the Soul, and those very pains which the damned do in Hell, before we could be ransomed from the Wrath of God: and that this only was the descent of Christ into Hell, which we are taught by Christ to believe. But more particularly, it was taught by <hi>Banister,</hi> That Christ being dead, descended into the place of everlasting Torments, where in his Soul he endured for a time the very Torments which the damned Spirits without intermission did abide. By <hi>Paget,</hi> in his <hi>Latin</hi> Catechism, That Christ alive upon the Cross, humbled himself, <hi>usque ad Inferni tremenda tormenta,</hi> even to the most dreadful Torments of Hell. By <hi>Gifford</hi> and the <hi>Houshold-Catechism,</hi> That Christ suffered the Torments of Hell, the second death, abjection from God, and was made a Curse, <hi>i. e.</hi> had the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anguish of God's Wrath in his Soul and Body, which is the fire that shall never be quenched. <hi>Carlisle</hi> more honestly, not daring to avouch this Doctrine, nor to run cross against the Dictates of his Master; affirmed, That Christ descended not into Hell at all; and therefore, that this Article might be thought no otherwise than as an Error and a Fable.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The Doctrine of the Church being thus openly rejected; upon some Conference that passed between Arch-bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Thomas Bilson,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi>; it was resolved, That Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> in some Sermons at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Cross,</hi> and other places, should publickly deliver what the Scriptures teach touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Redemption by the death and blood-shedding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus the Son of God, and his descending into Hell. This he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly performed in several Sermons upon the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, viz. <hi>God forbid that I should glory in any thing but in the Cross of our Lord Iesus Christ, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world,</hi> Gal. 6.14. In prosecuting of which Text, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed at large as well concerning the <hi>contents,</hi> as the <hi>effects</hi> of Christ's Cross; and brought the point unto this issue, that is to say, <hi>That no Scripture did teach the death of</hi> Christ's Soul, <hi>or</hi> the Pains of the damned, <hi>to be requisite in the Person of Christ before he could be our Ransomer, and the Saviour of the World.</hi> And because the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:54836:207"/>
proofs pretended for this point, might be three; <hi>Predictions,</hi> that Christ should suffer those pains; <hi>Causes</hi> why he must suffer them; and <hi>Signs</hi> that he did suffer them: He likewise insisted on all three, and shewed, there were no such <hi>Predictions, Causes,</hi> or <hi>Signs,</hi> of the true pains of Hell to be suffered in the Soul of Christ before he could save us. And next, as touching Christ's descent into Hell, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>That by the course of the Creed it ought not to be referred to</hi> Christ living, <hi>but to</hi> Christ <hi>being</hi> dead: <hi>showing thereby, the Conquest which Christ's Manhood had after death over all the powers of darkness; declared by his Resurrection, when he arose Lord over all his Enemies, in his own Person, Death, Hell, and Satan, not excepted; and had the keys</hi> (that is, all Power) <hi>of</hi> Death <hi>and</hi> Hell; <hi>delivered to him by God, that those in Heaven, Earth, and Hell, should stoop unto him, and be subject to the Strength and Glory of his Kingdom.</hi> And this he proved to be the true and genuine meaning of that Article, both from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the Fathers; and justified it for the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by the Book of Homilies.</p>
            <p n="18">18. But let the Scriptures, and the Fathers, and the Book of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, teach us what they please, <hi>Calvin</hi> was otherwise resolved, and his Determination must be valued above all the rest. For, no sooner were these Sermons Printed, but they were presently impugn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Humorous Treatise, the Author whereof is said to have writ so loosly, as if he neither had remembred what the Bishop uttered, or cared much what he was to prove. In answer whereunto, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop adds a short Conclusion to his Sermons, and so lets him pass. The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Brethren take a new Alarum, Muster their Forces, compare their Notes, and send them to the Author of the former Treatise, that he might publish his <hi>Defence.</hi> Which he did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; the Author being named <hi>Henry Iacob,</hi> a well-known Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist. Which Controversie coming to the Queen's knowledg, being then at <hi>Farnham,</hi> (a Castle belonging to the Bishop) she signified Her Pleasure to him, That he should neither desert the Doctrine, nor suffer the Function which he exercised in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to be trodden and trampled under-foot by unquiet men, who both abhorred the Truth, and despised Authority. On which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Bishop sets himself upon the writing of that Learned Treatise, entituled, <hi>A Survey of Christ's Sufferings,</hi> &amp;c. although by reason of a sickness of two years continuance, it was not published till the year 1604. The Controversie after this was plyed more hotly in both Universities, where the Bishop's Doctrine was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but publickly opposed by many of our Zealots both at home and abroad. At home, opposed by <hi>Gabriel Powel,</hi> a stiff <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> Abroad, by <hi>Broughton, Parker,</hi> and some other Brethren of the Separation. After this, justified and defended by Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> whom <hi>Aumes</hi> replyed unto in his Rejoynder; as also, by another <hi>Parker,</hi> and many more; till in the end the Brethren willingly surceased from the prosecution of their former Doctrines, which they were not able to maintain. And though the Church received some trouble upon this occasion, yet by this means the Article of Christ's Descent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:54836:208"/>
more rightly understood, and more truly stated, according to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than either by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any of the Protestant or Reformed Churches, of what Name soever.</p>
            <p n="19">19. But while the Prelates of the Church were busied upon these and the like Disputes, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> found themselves some better work, in making Friends, and fastning on some eminent Patron to support their Cause. None fitter for their purpose than the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> gracious amongst the Military men, popular beyond measure, and as ambitious of Command, as he was of Applause. He had his Education in the House of the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and took to Wife a Daughter of Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> as before is said, who fitted and prepared him for those Applications which hitherto he had neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon a just fear of incurring the Queen's Displeasure. But the Queen being now grown old, the King of <hi>Scots</hi> not much regarded by the <hi>English,</hi> and very ill obeyed by his natural Subjects; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look up towards the Crown, to which a Title was drawn for him, as the direct Heir of <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Woodstock,</hi> Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> one of the younger Sons of K. <hi>EDWARD</hi> the third. This man the <hi>Puritans</hi> cry up with most infinite Praises, both in their Pulpits, and in their Pamphlets; telling him, That he was not only great in Honour, and the love of the people; but <hi>temporis expectation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And he accordingly applies himself to those of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, admits them to Places of most Trust and Credit about his Person, keeps open House for men of those Opinions to resort unto, under pretence of hearing Sermons; and hearing no Sermons with more zeal and edification, than those which seemed to attribute a Power to Inferior Magistrates for curbing and controlling their undoubted Soveraigns. Which questionless must needs have ended in great disturbance to the Church and State, if he had not been outwitted by Sir <hi>Robert Cicil,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> and the rest of their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Court; by whom he was first shifted over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and at last brought upon the Scaffold, not to receive a Crown, but to lose his Head. Which hapned very opportunely for K. <hi>IAMES</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whose Entrance might have been opposed, and his Title que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, if this Ambitious man had prospered in his undertakings, which he conducted generally with more Heat than Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

This brings me back again to <hi>Scotland.</hi> In which we left the King intent upon the expectation of a better Crown; and to that end resolved upon the Restitution of the banished Lords; who being advertised of his purpose, returned as secretly as might be, offering to give good Security to live conformable to the Laws in all peace and quietness. The King seems willing to accept it, and is confirmed by a Convention of Estates, in those good Intentions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The News whereof gave such offence to those of the Kirk, that present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they assembled themselves at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> gave notice to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ministers, of the present Dangers, and advised them to excite
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:54836:208"/>
their Flocks to be in readiness, to the end they might oppose these Resolutions of the King and Council, as far as lawfully they might. A day was also set apart for Humiliation, and Order given to the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> to excommunicate all such as either harboured any of the Popish Lords, or kept company with them; and this Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication to be passed summarily on the first Citation, because the safety of the Church seemed to be in danger; which was the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief by the King suspected under that Reserve. They appointed also, that sixteen of their Company should remain at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> (according to the number of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi>) who together with some of the Presbytery of that City, should be called, <hi>The Council of the Kirk</hi>: That four or five of the said sixteen, should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Monthly on the Service, in their turns and courses; and, that they should convene every day with some of that Presbytery, to receive such Advertisements as should be sent from other places, and thereupon take counsel of the best Expedients that could be offered in the case. And for the first Essay of their new Authority, the Lord <hi>Seaton,</hi> President of the Sessions, appears before them; transmitted unto their Tribunal, by the Synod of <hi>Lothian,</hi> for keeping intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the Earl of <hi>Huntley.</hi> From which, with many affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons having purged himself, he was most graciously dismist.

King and Queen; as also against the Council, and the Lords of the Session: but more particularly, that <hi>as all Kings were the Devils Barns</hi>; so the heart of K. <hi>IAMES</hi> was full of Treachery: That the Queen was not to be prayed for but for fashion-sake, because they knew that she would never do them good: That the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil were corrupt, and takers of Bribes: and, that the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was an <hi>Atheist,</hi> one of no Religion. Notice whereof being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>English</hi> Ambassador, he complains of it to the King, and <hi>Blake</hi> is cited to appear before the Lords of the Council. <hi>Melvin</hi> makes this a common Cause, and gives it out, That this was only done upon design against the Ministers, to bring their Doctrine under the censure and controlment of the King and Council; or at the least, a meer device to divert the Ministers from prosecuting their just Suit against the coming and reception of the Popish Lords; and that if <hi>Blake</hi> or any other should submit their Doctrines to the tryal of the King and Council, the Liberties of the Kirk would be quite subverted. By which means he prevailed so far on the rest of the Council, (I mean <hi>the Council of the Kirk</hi>) that they sent certain of their number to intercede in the business, and to declare how ill it might be taken with all sorts of people, if the Ministers should now be called in question for such trifling matters, when the Enemies of the Truth were both spared and countenanced. But not being able by this means to delay the Censure, it was advised, that <hi>Blake</hi> should make his <hi>Declinatour,</hi> renounce the King and Council as incompetent Judges, and wholly put himself upon tryal of his own <hi>Presbytery.</hi> Which though it seemed a dangerous course, by most sober men; yet was it carryed by the major part of the Voices, as <hi>the Cause of God.</hi>

He answered, That supposing he had spoken Treason, yet could he not be first judged by the King and Council, till the Kirk had taken cognizance of it. In maintenance of which proceeding, the Commissioners of the Kirk direct their Letters to all the Presbyteries of the kingdom, requiring them to subscribe the said <hi>Declinatour,</hi> to recommend the Cause in their Prayers to God, and to stir up their several Flocks in defence thereof. This puts the King to the necessity of publishing his Proclamation of the Month of <hi>November.</hi> In which he first lays down the great and manifold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of this new Tribunal, to the overthrow of his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: The sending of the <hi>Declinatour</hi> to be subscribed generally by all the Ministers: The convocating of the Subjects to assist their proceedings, as if they had no Lord or Superior over them; and in the mean time, that the Ministers forsake their Flocks, to wait on these Commissioners, and attend their service: which being said, he doth thereby charge the said Commissioners from acting any thing according to that deputation; commanding them to leave <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:54836:209"/>
to repair to their several Flocks, and to return no more for keeping such unlawful Meetings under pain of Rebellion. He pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished another Proclamation at the same time also, by which all Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, Gentlemen, and other Subjects, were commanded not to joyn with any of the Ministry, either in their Presbyteries, Synods, or other Ecclesiastical Assemblies, without his License. Which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he was willing to revoke those Edicts, and remit his Action against <hi>Blake,</hi> if the Church would either wave the <hi>Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour,</hi> or if they would declare, at the least, That it was not a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but a particular <hi>Declinatour</hi>; used in the case of Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> as being in a case of <hi>Slander</hi>; and therefore appertaining to the Church's Cognizance. But these proud men, either upon some confidence of another <hi>Bothwell,</hi> or else presuming that the King was not of a Spirit to hold out against them; or otherwise infatuated to their own destruction, resolved, That both their Pulpits, and their Preachers too, should be exempted totally from the King's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In which brave humour, they return this Answer to his Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That they resolved to stand to their <hi>Declinatour,</hi> unless the King would pass from the Summons, and remitting the pursuit to the Ecclesiastical Judg, That no Minister should be charged for his Preaching; at least before the meeting of the next general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, which should be in their Power to call, as they saw occasion. Which Answer so displeased the King, that he charged the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners of the Kirk to depart the Town, and by a new Summons ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Blake</hi> to appear on the last of <hi>November.</hi> This fills the Pulpit with Invectives against the King, and that too on the day of the Princess's Christning, at what time many Noble men were called to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> to attend that Solemnity. With whose consent it was declared at <hi>Blake</hi>'s next appearance, That the Crimes and Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons charged in the Bill, were Treasonable and Seditious; and that his Majesty, his Council, and all other Judges substitute by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, were competent Judges in all matters, either Criminal, or Civil, as well to Ministers, as to other Subjects. Yet still the King was willing to give over the Chase, makes them another gracious Offer, treats privately with some Chiefs amongst them, and seems contented to revoke his two Proclamations, if <hi>Blake</hi> would only come before the Lords of the Council, and there acknowledg his offence against the Queen. But when this would not be accepted, the Court proceeds unto the Examination of Witnesses. And upon proof of all the Articles objected, Sentence was given against him to this effect: <hi>That he should be confined beyond the North water, enter into Ward within six days, and there remain till his Majesty's pleasure should be further signified.</hi> Some Overtures were made after this, for an Accommodation. But the King not being able to gain any reason from them, sends their Commissioners out of the Town, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently commands, That Twenty four of the most Seditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> should forsake the City; hoping to find the rest more cool and tractable, when these Incendiaries were dismissed.</p>
            <p n="23">
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:54836:210"/>23. The Preachers of the City notwithstanding, take fire up on it, and the next day excite the Noble-men, assembled at the Sermon upon Sunday the fifteenth of <hi>December,</hi> to joyn with them in a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the King, To preserve Religion. Which being presented in a rude and disorderly manner, the King demands by what Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they durst convene together without his leave: <hi>We dare do more than this,</hi> (said the Lord of <hi>Lindsey</hi>) <hi>and will not suffer our Religion to be overthrown.</hi> Which said, he returns unto the Church, stirrs up the people to a tumult, and makes himself the Head of a Factious Rabble, who crying out, <hi>The Sword of the Lord, and</hi> Gideon, throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in great numbers to the place, in which the King had locked himself for his greater safety; the doors whereof they questionless had forced open, and done some out-rage to his Person, if a few ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men had not stopt their Fury: The Lord-Provost of the City, notwithstanding he was then sick, and kept his Bed, applied his best endeavours to appease the Tumult, and with some difficulty brought the people to lay down their Arms; which gave the King an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to retire to his Palace, where with great fear he passed over all the rest of that day. The next morning he removes with his Court and Council, to the Town of <hi>Lintithgoe,</hi> and from thence publisheth a Proclamation to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Lords of the Session, the Sheriffs, Commissioners, and Justices, with their several Members and Deputies, should remove themselves forth of the Town of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and be in readiness to go to any such place as should be appointed; and, that all Noble-men and Barons should return unto their Houses, and not presume to convene in that or in any other place, without License, under pain of his Majesty's Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The Preachers, on the contrary, are resolved to keep up the Cause, to call their Friends together, and unite their Party; and were upon the point of Excommunicating certain Lords of the Council, if some more sober than the rest, had not held their hands.</p>
            <p n="24">24. In which confusion of Affairs, they indict a Fast: For a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory whereunto, a Sermon is preached by one <hi>Welch,</hi> in the chief Church of that City: Who taking for his Theam the Epistle sent to the Angel o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> did pitifully rail against the King, saying, That <hi>he was possessed with a Devil; and that one Devil being put out, seven worse were entred in the place: and, that the Subjects might lawfully rise and take the Sword out of his hands.</hi> Which last he confirmed by the Example of a Father that falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Phrensie,</hi> might be taken by the Children and Servants of the Family, and tyed hand and foot from doing violence. Which brings into my mind an usual saying of that King, to this effect, viz. <hi>That for the twelve last years of his living in</hi> Scotland, <hi>he used to pray upon his knees, before every Sermon, That he might hear nothing from the Preacher which might justly grieve him; and that the case was so well altered when he was in</hi> England, <hi>that he was used to pray, that he might profit by what he heard.</hi> But all exorbitancy of Power is of short continuance, especially if abused to Pride and Arrogance. The mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54836:210"/>
of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> was now come to the height, and therefore in the course of Nature was to have a fall; and this the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to give them, or to lose his Crown. He had before been so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with continual Baffles, that he was many times upon the point of leaving <hi>Scotland,</hi> putting himself into the Seignury of <hi>Venice,</hi> and living there in the capacity of a Gentleman (so they call the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> of that Noble City). And questionless he had put that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in execution, if the hopes of coming one day to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> had not been some temptation to him to ride out the storm. But now a Sword is put into his hands by the Preachers themselves, wherewith he is enabled to cut the <hi>Gordian</hi>-knot of their Plots and Practises, which he was not able to untye. For, not contented to have raised the former Tumults, they keep the Noble-men together, invite the people to their aid, and write their Letters to the Lord of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> to repair unto them, and make himself the Head of their Association. A Copy of which Letter being showed unto the King by that Noble Lord, command is given unto the Provost of <hi>Edenbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> To attach the Ministers. But they had notice of his purpose, and escape into <hi>England,</hi> making <hi>Newcastle</hi> their retreat, as in former times.</p>
            <p n="25">25. It is a true saying of the wise Historian, That every Insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people, when it is suppressed, doth make the Prince stronger, and the Subject weaker. And this the King found true in his own particular. The Citizens of <hi>Edenborough</hi> being pinched with the Proclamation, and the removal of the Court and the Courts of Justice, offered to purge themselves of the late Sedition, and tendred their obedience unto any thing whatsoever which his Majesty and the Council should be pleased to enjoyn, whereby they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the huge Indignity which was done to his Majesty; provided that they should not be thought guilty of so great a Crime, which from their hearts they had detested. But the King answers, That he would admit of no purgation; that he would make them know, that he was their King: And the next day proclaims the Tumult to be Treason, and proclaims all for Traytors who were guilty of it. This made them fear their utter ruine to be near at hand. The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Judicatories were removed to <hi>Leith,</hi> the Sessions ordained to be held at <hi>Perth</hi>; their Ministers were fled, their Magistrates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard; and none about the King, but their deadly Enemies. And to make up the full measure of their disconsolation, Counsel is given unto the King to raze the Town, and to erect a Pillar in the place thereof, for a perpetual Monument of so great an Insolence. But he resolves to travel none but Legal ways; and being somewhat sweetned by a Letter from the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> he gives command unto the <hi>Provost,</hi> and the rest of the Magistrates, to enter their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at <hi>Perth</hi> on the first of <hi>February,</hi> there to keep ward until they either were acquitted or condemned of the former uproar. Whilst things remained in this perplexity and suspence, he is advised to make his best use of the conjuncture, for setling matters of the Church, and to establish in it such a decent Order as was agreeable to God's
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:54836:211"/>
Word. To which end he appoints a National-Assembly to be held at <hi>Perth</hi>; and prepares certain Queries, fifty five in number, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered and debated in the said Assembly, all of them tending to the rectifying of such Abuses which were either crept into the Discipline, or occasioned by it. Nothing so much perplexed the principal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, who had the leading of the rest, as, that the Discipline should be brought under a dispute, which they had taught to be a part of the Word of God. But they must sing another Tune before all be ended.</p>
            <p n="26">26. For, the King having gained a considerable Party amongst the Ministers of the North, and treated with many of the rest in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, whom he thought most tractable; prevailed so far on the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, that they condescend at the last upon many particulars which in the pride of their prosperity had not been required. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of which were these, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That it should be lawful to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty by himself or his Commissioners, or to the Pastors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to propone in a general Assembly, whatsoever point he or they desired to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in, or reformed in matters of External Government, altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble according to Circumstances; providing it be done in right time and place, <hi>Animo aedificandi non tentandi.</hi> 2. That no Minister should reprove his Majesty's Laws and Statutes, Acts or Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, until such time as he hath first by the advice of his Presbytery, or Synodal, or General Assemblies, complained and sought remedy of the same from his Majesty, and made report of his Majesty's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, before any further proceedings. 3. That no man's Name should be expressed in the Pulpit, except the Fault be notorious and publick, and so declared by an Assize, Excommunication, Contumace, and lawful Admonition; nor should he be described so plainly by any other Circumstances, than publick Vices, always damnable. 4. That in all great Towns the Ministers shall not be chosen without his Majesty's consent, and the consent of the Flock. 5. That no matter of Slander should be called before them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Majesty's Authority is pre-judged, Causes Ecclesiastical only excepted. 6. And finally, That no Conventions shall be amongst Pastors, without his Majesty's knowledg, except their Sessions, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, and Synods, the Meetings at the Visitation of Churches, admission or deprivation of Ministers, taking up of deadly Feuds, and the like, which had not already been found fault with by his Majesty.</q>
According to which last Artiele, the King consents unto another general Assembly to be held at <hi>Dundee,</hi> and nominates the tenth of <hi>May</hi> for the opening of it.</p>
            <p n="27">27. It was about this time that Dr. <hi>Richard Bancroft,</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> began to run a constant course of Correspondence with the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> whom he beheld as the undoubted Heir and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of the Queen then Reigning. And well considering how condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible it was to the Peace of both Kingdoms, that they should both be governed in one Form of Ecclesiastical Policy; he chalked him out a ready way, by which he might restore Episcopacy to the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> To which end, as the King had gained the liberty in
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:54836:211"/>
the last Assembly to question and dispute the Government then by Law established; and gained a power of nominating Ministers in the principal Cities; so in the next, they gratified him in this point, That no man should from thenceforth exercise a Minister, without having a particular Flock; nor be admitted to that Flock, without Ordination, by the Imposition of hands. He required also in the same, That before the conclusion of any weighty matter, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Advice and Approbation should be first obtained. And so far they consented to the Proposition, as to express how glad they were to have his Majesty's Authority interposed to all Acts of importance which concerned the Church, so as matters formerly concluded, might not be drawn in question. He gained some other points also in the same Assembly, no less important than the other towards his Design; as namely, 1. <hi>That no Minister shall exercise any Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, either by making of Constitutions, or leading of Processes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out advice and concurrence of his Session, Presbytery, Synod, or General Assembly.</hi> 2. <hi>That Presbyteries shall not meddle with any thing that is not known without all controversie to belong to the Ecclesiastical Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; and that therein Vniformity should be observed throughout the Countrey.</hi> And, 3. <hi>That where any Presbyteries shall be desired by his Majesty's Missive to stay their proceedings, as being prejudicial to the Civil Iurisdiction, or private men's Rights, they should desist until his Majesty did receive satisfaction.</hi> But that which made most toward his purpose, was, the appointing of Thirteen of their number to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Majesty, as the Commissioners of the Kirk, whom we may call the High Commissioners of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the King's Ecclesiastical Council, the Seminary of the future Bishops, to whom they gave Authority for the planting of Churches in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> St. <hi>Andrews, Dundee,</hi> &amp;c. as also, to present the Petitions and Grievances of the Kirk, to his Majesty; and to advise with him in all such matters as conduced unto the peace and welfare of it.</p>
            <p n="28">28. It was no hard matter for the King, by Rewards and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to gain these men unto himself; or at the least, to raise amongst them such a Party as should be ready at all times to serve his turn. And such a general compliance he found amongst them, that they not only served him in the punishment of <hi>David Blake,</hi> in whose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half they had stood out so long against him; but in the sentencing of <hi>Wallace,</hi> who in a Sermon at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> had abused his Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: both which, upon the cognizance of their several Causes, they deprived of their Churches, and decreed others of more moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be placed therein. They served him also in the reformation of that University where <hi>Andrew Melvin</hi> for some years had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Rector; and thereby gained an excellent opportunity for training up young Students in the Arts of Sedition. To which end he had so contrived it, that instead of Lecturing in Divinity, they should read the Politicks, as namely, <hi>Whether Election or Succession of Kings were the best Form of Government? How far the Royal Power extended? And, Whether Kings were to be Censured and Deposed by the Estates of the Kingdom, in case their Power should be abused?</hi> For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:54836:212"/>
whereof, the King not only ordered by the Advice of his Commissioners, That no man from thenceforth should continue Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of that University above the space of a year; but appointed also on what Books, and after what manner every Professor for the time to come, was to read his Lectures. He next proceeds unto a Reformation of the Churches of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> but had first brought the Town to submit to mercy. Failing of their attendance at <hi>Perth,</hi> in so full a number as were appointed to appear, the whole Town was denounced Rebel, and all the Lands, Rents, and other Goods, which formerly belonged to the Corporation, confiscate to the use of the King: the news whereof, brought such a general disconsolation in that Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous City, that the Magistrates renounced their Charges, the Ministers forsook their Flocks, and all things seemed to tend to a dissolution. But at the end of fifteen days, his Majesty was graciously inclined, upon the mediation of some Noble-men who took pity on them, to re-admit them to his Favour. Upon Advertisement whereof the Provost, Bailiffs, and Deacons of Crafts, being brought unto his presence the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> and falilng upon their knees, did with tears beg pardon for their negligence, in not timely preventing that Tumult; beseeching his Majesty to take pity of the Town, which did simply submit it self to his Majesty's Mercy.</p>
            <p n="29">29. The King had formerly considered of all Advantages which he might raise unto himself out of that Submission; but aimed at nothing more than the reduction of the people to a sense of their duty; the curbing of the City-Preachers, and setling some good Order in the Churches of it. In these last times, the Ministers had lived together in one common House, situate in the great Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and of old belonging to the Town; which gave them an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to consult in private, to hatch Seditions, and put their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons into form. This House the King required to be given up to him, to the end that the Ministers might be disposed of in several Houses, far from one another, so as they might not meet together without observation. The Ministers of late had preached in common, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consideration of particular Charges; and were reduced also to a less number than in former times, which made them of the greater Power amongst the people. But now the King resolves upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of the Town into several Parishes, and fixing every Minister in his proper Church, according to the Acts of the last Assembly. This had been thought of two years since; but the Town opposed it. Now they are glad to yeeld to any thing which the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and to this point amongst the rest. And hereupon the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Fine of Twenty thousand pounds to the King, and entring into a Recognizance (as our Lawyers call it) of Forty thousand Marks more, for the indempnifying of the Lords of the Session in the time of their sitting; the City is restored to the good Grace of the King, and the Courts of Justice to the City. His Majesty was also pleased, that the Fugitive Preachers of the City should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored unto their Ministry, upon these conditions, that is to say, That each of them should take the Charge of a several Flock: That four
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:54836:212"/>
new Preachers should be added to the former number, and each of them assigned to his proper Charge: That they should use more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in their Preachings, for the time to come, and not refuse to render an account thereof to the King and Council. And finally, That such as had not formerly received Ordination by the imposition of hands, should receive it now. In which last, <hi>Bruce</hi> created no small trouble to the King's Commissioners (who laboured very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously to advance that Service); but he submitted in the end.</p>
            <p n="30">30. After these preparations, comes a Parliament, which was to take beginning in the Month of <hi>December.</hi> Against which time the King had dealt so dextrously with <hi>Patrick Galloway,</hi> and he so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely had applied himself to his Associates, that the Commissioners were drawn to joyn in a Request to the Lords and Commons, <hi>That the Ministers, as representing the Church, and Third Estate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, might be admitted to give voice in Parliament, according to the ancient Rites and Priviledges of the Kirk of</hi> Scotland. The King was also humbly moved to be-friend them in it. And he so managed the Affair to his own advantage, that he obtained an Act to pass to this effect, viz. <hi>That such Pastors and Ministers as his Majesty should please to provide to the Place, Dignity, and Title of a Bishop, Abbot, or other Prelate, at any time should have voice in Parliament, as freely as any other Ecclesiastical Prelate had in the times fore-going; provided, that such persons as should be nominated to any Arch-bishoprick or Bishoprick within the Realm, should either actually be Preachers at the time of their nomination; or else assume and take upon them to be actual Preachers; and according thereunto should practise and perform that duty; and that neither this Act, nor any thing in the same contained, should prejudice the Iurisdiction of the Kirk, established by Acts of Parliament; nor any of the Presbyteries, Assemblies, or other Sessions of the Church.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, followed another General Assembly, appointed to be held at <hi>Dundee,</hi> in the <hi>March</hi> ensuing, the King himself being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at it. In which it was concluded, after some debate, <hi>That Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters lawfully might give voice in Parliament, and other publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Estates; and that it was expedient to have some always of that number present, to give voice in the name of the Church.</hi> It was agreed also, <hi>That so many should be appointed to have voice in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as there had been Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Abbots, and Priors, in the times of Popery:</hi> Which coming to the number of Fifty, or thereabouts, gave every Minister some hopes to be one of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. It was resolved also, That the Election of the Persons, should belong partly to the King, and in part to the Church. But as for the manner of the Election, the Rents to be assigned unto them, and their continuance in that Trust, for life, or otherwise; these points were left to be considered of at better leisure.</p>
            <p n="31">31. For the dispatch whereof,<note place="margin">1589.</note> with the more conveniency, it was appointed, That the matter should be first debated in each Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, and afterwards in Provincial Synods, to be holden all upon one day, that to be the first <hi>Tuesday</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> three men to be selected out of every Synod, to attend the King; and they, together with
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:54836:213"/>
the Doctors of the Universities, to conclude the business, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, notwithstanding, to the approbation of the next Assembly. Accordingly they meet in Synods, and appoint their Delegates; who being called to <hi>Falkland</hi> in the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> did then and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude upon these particulars; first, for the manner of Elections; That for each Prelacy that was void, the Church should nominate six per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and the King chuse one; and that if his Majesty should like none of that number, six others should be named by the Church, of which his Majesty was to chuse one without more refusal. Next, for the Rents; That the Churches being sufficiently planted, and no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice done to Schools, Colledges, and Universities, already erected, he should be put into possession of the rest of that Prelacy, to which he was to be preferred. As to the term of his continuance in that trust, there was nothing done, that point being left unto the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the next Assembly. And for the naming of the Child, the God-fathers agreed, that he should be called the <hi>Commissaire,</hi> or <hi>Commissioner</hi> of such a place, if the Parliament could be induced by his Majesty to accept that Title, or else the General Assembly to devise some other. But fearing lest this <hi>Commissaire</hi> might in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Bishop,</hi> it was resolved to tye him up to such Conditions as should disable him from aspiring above the rest of his Brethren. But more particularly, it was cautioned and agreed upon, That he should propound nothing in the Name of the Church, without express war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the same; nor give consent to any thing proposed in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which tended to the diminution of the Liberties of it. That he should be bound to give an account of his proceedings, to the next General Assembly, and to submit himself to their judgment in it, without any Appeal. That he should faithfully attend his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Flock, and be as subject to the Censure of his own Presbytery, or Provincial Synod, as any other Minister which had no Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That in the Administration of Discipline, Collation of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Visitation, and other points of Ecclesiastical Government, he should neither usurp, nor claim to himself any more Power and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction than the rest of his Brethren. That if he shall usurp any part of Ecclesiastical Government, the Presbytery, Synod, or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly, protesting against it, whatsoever he should do therein, shall be null and void. That if he chance to be deposed from the Ministry, by the Presbytery, Synod, or Assembly, he should not only lose his Place and Vote in Parliament, but the Prelacy should be also voided for another man. And finally, That he should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to all these Cautions, before he was admitted to his Place and Trust.</p>
            <p n="32">
               <note place="margin">1599.</note>32. In the Assembly of <hi>Montross,</hi> which began on the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March, Anno</hi> 1599, these Cautions were approved, and two new ones added: 1. <hi>That they who had voice in Parliament, should not have place in the General Assembly, unless they were authorised by a Commission from the Presbyteries whereof they were Members.</hi> 2. <hi>That</hi> Crimen Ambitur. <hi>or any sinister endeavours to procure the Place, should be a sufficient reason to deprive him of it.</hi> As for the term of their
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:54836:213"/>
continuance in this Trust, the Leading-members were resolved not to make it certain, and much less to endure for term of life: all they would yeeld unto, was this, That he who was admitted unto that Commission, should yearly render an account of his Employment to the next General Assembly. That he should lay down his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the feet thereof, to be continued if they pleased, or otherwise to give place unto any other whom his Majesty and the said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To all which Cautions and Restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the King was willing to consent, that so the business might proceed without interruption; not doubting but to find a way, at some time or other, in which these Rigors might be moderated, and these Chains knocked off. Nothing now rested, but the nominating of some able persons to possess those Prelacies which either were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant at that time, or actually in the King's disposing. The Bishopricks of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and <hi>Glascow,</hi> had been given or sold to the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi>; the Bishoprick of <hi>Murray,</hi> to the Lord of <hi>Spinie</hi>; and that of <hi>Orkney,</hi> to the Earl; which must be first compounded with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King would nominate any man to either of them. The Sands of <hi>Galloway</hi> and the <hi>Isles,</hi> were so delapidated, that there was nothing left to maintain a Prelate, and therefore must be first endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Sees of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> and <hi>Argile,</hi> had their Bishops living, both of them being actual Preachers; and those of <hi>Brechen, Dunkeld,</hi> and <hi>Dumblane,</hi> had their Titulars also, but no Preaching-Ministers. So as there were but two Churches to be filled at the present, that is to say, the Bishopricks of <hi>Rothes,</hi> and <hi>Cathness</hi>; to which the King presents Mr. <hi>David Lindesay,</hi> Minister of <hi>Leith</hi>; and Mr. <hi>George Gladstaves,</hi> one of the Ministers of St. <hi>Andrews</hi>; of whose sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and moderation, he had good experience. Which two enjoyed their places in the following Parliament, and rode together with the rest in the Pomps thereof.</p>
            <p n="33">33. Thus far the business went on smoothly in the outward shew; but inwardly were great thoughts of heart; which first appeared in words of Danger and Discontent, and afterwards in acts of the highest Treason. The Leading-members of the Kirk, which had so long enjoyed an Arbitrary Power in all parts of the Realm, could with no patience brook the Limitations which were put upon them in the Assembly at <hi>Dundee</hi>; and much less able to endure that such a fair Foundation should be laid for <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> which must needs put a final end to their Pride and Tyranny; of which sort was a Letter writ by <hi>Davidson,</hi> to the next Assembly: In which he thus expostulates with the rest of his Brethren; <hi>How long shall we fear or favour Flesh and Blood, and follow the Counsel and Command thereof? Should our Meetings be in the Name of Man? Are we not to take up our selves, and to acknowledg our former errors and feebleness in the Work of the Lord? It is time for us now, when so many of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Brethren are thrust out of their Callings, without all order of just proceedings; and</hi> Jesuits, Atheists, <hi>and</hi> Papists, <hi>are suffered, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, and advanced to great Rooms in the Realm, for the bringing in Idolatry, and Captivity more than</hi> Babylonical, <hi>with an high hand, and
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:54836:214"/>
that in our chief City: Is it time for us, I say, of the Ministry, to be inveigled and blind-folded with pretence of the preferment of some small number of our Brethren to have voice in Parliament, and have Titles of Prelacy? Shall we, with</hi> Sampson, <hi>sleep still on</hi> Dalilah's <hi>knees, till she say, The</hi> Philistines <hi>be upon thee,</hi> Sampson? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Letter speaks the words of <hi>Davidson,</hi> but the sense of others, who having the like discontentments, privately whispered them in the ears of those who either seemed zealous for Religion, or Factiously enclined to make new Disturbances in this unsetledness of Affairs: In which conjuncture, it was no hard matter for them so to work upon men's Affections, as to assure them to themselves, and to be ready to flye out upon all occasions, especially when any powerful Head should be offered to them.</p>
            <p n="34">
               <note place="margin">1600.</note>34. Of the last sort was the Conspiracy and Treason of the Earl of <hi>Goury,</hi> Son of that <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Goury</hi> who had been execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for surprizing the King's Person at <hi>Ruthen</hi>-Castle, <hi>Anno</hi> 1584. And though this Son of his had been restored by the King to his Blood and Hononrs, one of his Sisters married to the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> another placed in the Attendance of the Queen, and that his Brother <hi>Alexander</hi> was advanced to a Place in the Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; yet all these Favours were not able to obliterate the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Execution so justly done upon their Father. By na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he was Proud, Aspiring, and of a Mind greater than his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Ill principled in the course of his Education; which made him passionately affected to the <hi>Disciplinarians,</hi> of whom he was ambitious to be thought a Patron. To this man they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; who by the loss of their Authority, or Tyranny rather, measured the Fortunes of the Church; as though Religion could not stand, if their Empire fell. To him they frequently insinuated their Fears and Jealousies, the King's aversness from the Gospel, his extraordinary Favour to the Popish Lords, his present Practises and Designs to subvert the Discipline, the only Pillar and Support of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi>; not without some Reflections on the death of his Father, whose Zeal to God was testified by the loss of his Life, which cryed aloud for vengeance, both to God and Man. By which insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations they so wrought upon him, that he began to study nothing but Revenge; and to that end engaged his Brother <hi>Alexander</hi> (a fierce young man, and of a very daring Spirit) in the practise with him. He also held intelligence with such of the Ministers as were supposed to be most discontented at the present Transactions; but most especially, with the Preachers of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> who could not easily forget the Injuries (so they must be called) which they had suffered from the King for some years last past. The like intelligence he kept with many <hi>Male-contents</hi> amongst the Laicks; preparing all, but opening his Design to few; but opening it howsoever to <hi>Logen</hi> of <hi>Restalrig,</hi> in whom he had more confidence than all the rest.</p>
            <p n="35">35. Concerning which, it was averred by one <hi>Sprot</hi> a Notary, as well upon Examination before the Lords of the Session, as his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:54836:214"/>
at the Gallows, <hi>Anno</hi> 1608, That he had seen a Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by this <hi>Logan</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Goury,</hi> in which was signified, <hi>That he would take part with him in revenge of his Father's death. That to effect it, he must find some way or other to bring the King to</hi> Fast-Castle. <hi>That it was easier to be done by Sea, than Land: and, that they might safely keep him there, till they had given advertisement of it to the other Conspirators.</hi> For proof of which Confession, (being free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary) he told the people on the Ladder, that he would give them a Sign; which he performed by clapping his hands three times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his turning off by the Executioner. It was affirmed also by Mr. <hi>William Cowper,</hi> a right godly man, then being Minister at <hi>Perth,</hi> and afterwards made Bishop of <hi>Galloway</hi>; That going to the House of the Earl, (the Hereditary Provost of that Town) not many days before the intended Treason, he found him reading a Book entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>De Conjurationibus adversus Principes,</hi> containing a Discourse of Treasons and Conspiracies against several Princes; of which he was pleased to give this Censure, <hi>That most of them were very foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived, and faulty in some point or other, which was the reason that they found not the desired effect.</hi> By which it seems that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to out-go all former Conspirators in the contrivance of his Treason; though in the end he fell upon a Plot which was most ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, not to be parallel'd by any in that Book which he so much vilified. The Design was, To draw the King to his House in the Town of <hi>Perth,</hi> under pretence of coming secretly to see a man whom he had lately intercepted with Letters, and some quantity of Gold, from <hi>Rome</hi>; and having brought him to some remote part of the House, to make sure work of him. The King was then at <hi>Falkland-Castle</hi>; and going out betimes on <hi>Tuesday</hi> the fifth of <hi>August,</hi> to take his pleasure in the Park, he is met by <hi>Alexander,</hi> who tells him of the News of <hi>Perth,</hi> and that a speedy posting thither, would be worth his travel. The King comes thither before Dinner, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Marre, Evesking</hi> the Captain of his Guard, and some other Gentlemen, all of them in their Hunting-Coats, as minding nothing but a Visit to the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Thus is he brought into the toyl; but they shall only hunt him to the view, and not pull him down.</p>
            <p n="36">36. The King's own Dinner being ended, the Lords fall to theirs, which <hi>Alexander</hi> takes to be the fittest time to effect the Enterprise; and therefore takes the King along with him to an upper Chamber. But seeing <hi>Eveskin</hi> at his heels, he willed him to stay behind, and made fast the doors. Being brought into a Chamber on the top of the House, the King perceived a man in a secret corner, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently asked <hi>Alexander,</hi> if he were the Party who had brought the Letters and the Gold. But <hi>Alexander</hi> then changed his countenance, upbraided him with the death of his Father, for which he was now brought to make satisfaction; and therewith left him to the mercy of the Executioner. I shall not stand on all particulars of the story; the sum whereof, is briefly this: That the King having having by much strugling gained a Window, a corner whereof looked toward
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:54836:215"/>
the Street, cryed out so loud, that he was heard by all the Lords and Gentlemen of his Retinue, who thereupon prepared themselves for his assistance. In the pursuit whereof, the Earl himself is killed by <hi>Eveskin</hi> as he was making haste to help his Brother; and <hi>Alexander</hi> is dispatched by <hi>Ramsey,</hi> one of the King's Pages; who being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the House, came by the back-stairs time enough to preserve his Master. Of this great Danger and Deliverance, the King gives notice to all his Subjects, desiring them to joyn with him in thanks to Almighty God for so great a Mercy; which was accordingly performed by all honest men; but the whole Story dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed, discredited, mis-reported by the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> whom it concerned to wash their hands of so foul a Treason. And how far they were Parties in it, or at least well-wishers to it, may appear by this, That when the Ministers of <hi>Edenborough</hi> were desired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene their people, and give God thanks for this deliverance of the King, they excused themselves, as not being well acquainted with all particulars. And when it was replyed unto them, <hi>That they were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required to make known to the people, That the King had escaped a great Danger, and to excite them to Thansgiving for his deliverance:</hi> They answered, <hi>That they were not very well satisfied in the truth of the matter: That nothing was to be delivered in the Pulpit, the truth whereof was not certainly known: and, that they were to utter nothing in that place, but that which migh be</hi> spoke in Faith. On which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal it was ordered by the Lords of the Council, That the people should be drawn together into the Market-place, That the Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> should make a Declaration of the whole Design, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall conceive a Prayer of Thanksgiving for the King's Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Which was performed on his part with a true affection, and entertained by the people with great joy and gladness.</p>
            <p n="37">37. But the whole Nation was not so besotted by the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as either to dispute the Story, or despise the Mercy. Which wrought so far upon the Consciences of all honest men, that in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament held at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> in <hi>November</hi> following, the Estate of <hi>Goury</hi> was confiscate, his Sons disherited, the Name of <hi>Ruthen</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abolished, (but the last dispenced with) the bodies of the two Brothers brought to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> there hanged and quartered, the Heads of both being fixed upon the top of the Common Prison: and finally, The Fifth of <hi>August</hi> ordained by Act of Parliament for a Day of Thanksgiving in all times succeeding. The like done also two years after, at a General Assembly of the Ministers of the Church,<note place="margin">1602.</note> held in <hi>Haly-Rood-House,</hi> as to the Day of Thanksgiving, which they decreed to be kept solemnly from thenceforth, in all the Churches of that Kingdom. And it was well they did it then, the King not venturing the Proposal to them in the year fore-going, when they assembled at <hi>Burnt-Island,</hi> whether in reference to some indisposition of Body which he found in himself; or rather of some greater indisposition of Mind which he found in them. But now it went clearly for him without contradiction, as did some other things propounded to their consideration. His Ey now looks unto the Crown
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:54836:215"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> and he resolved to bring the Churches of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to an Uniformity: but so to do it as might make neither noise nor trouble. The solemnizing of Marriage had been prohibited on <hi>Sundays</hi> by the Rules of the Discipline: but by an Order made in the present Assembly, it was indifferently permitted on all days alike, <hi>Sundays</hi> as well as other days, at the will of the Parties. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time the Sacrament of Baptism was not administred but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the times of Preaching, on some opinion which they had of the indifferency, or at the least the non-necessity thereof. But now it was ordained with a joynt consent, <hi>That the Ministers should not refuse the Sacrament of Baptism to Infants, nor delay the same upon whatsoever pretext, the same being required by the Parents, or others in their name</hi> Which brought them two steps nearer to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than before they were.</p>
            <p n="38">38. It was not long after the end of this Assembly, when the King received Intelligence of Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> death, and of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral acknowledgment of his Succession, both by Peers and People. This puts him on a preparation for a Journey to <hi>England,</hi> where he is joyfully received, and found no small contentment in the change of his Fortunes; here sitting <hi>amongst Grave, Learned, and Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end men; not as before, a King without State, without Honour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Order, where Beardless Boys would every day brave him to his face; where</hi> Jack, <hi>and</hi> Tom, <hi>and</hi> Will, <hi>and</hi> Dick, <hi>did at their pleasures cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

So leaves he <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Puritans</hi> there, with this Character of them, recorded in the Preface of his Book, called <hi>Basilicon Doron</hi>; in which he paints them out, as people which <hi>refusing to be called</hi> Anabaptists, <hi>too much participated of their Humours, not only agreeing with them in their General Rule, the contempt of the Civil Magistrate, and in leaning to their own Dreams, Imaginations, and Revelations; but particularly, in accounting all men prophane that agree not to their Fancies; in making, for every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Question of the</hi> Polity <hi>of the Church, as much Commotion as if the Article of the Trinity was called in question; in making the Scripture to be ruled by their Conscience, and not their Conscience by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; in accounting every body</hi> Ethnicus &amp; Publicanus, <hi>not worthy to enjoy the benefit of breathing, much less to participate with them in the Sacraments, that denies the least jot of their Grounds: and in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King, People, Law, and all, to be trod under foot, before the least jot of their Grounds be impugned; in preferring such Holy Warrs to an Vngodly Peace; not only in resisting Christian Princes, but denying to pray for them; for Prayer must come by Faith, and it is not revealed that God will bear their Prayers for such a Prince.</hi> To which He adds this Clause in the Book it self, <hi>viz.</hi> That they used common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tell the people in their Sermons, <hi>That all Kings and Princes were naturally Enemies to the Liberty of the Church, and could never patiently bear the Yoak of Christ.</hi> And thereupon he gives this
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:54836:216"/>
Counsel to the Prince, To take heed all of such <hi>Puritans,</hi> whom he calls the <hi>very Pests of the Church and Commonwealth; whom no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts can oblige, neither Oaths nor Promises bind; breathing nothing but Sedition and Calumnies; aspiring without measure, railing without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and making their own imaginations the square of their Conscience: protesting before the Great God, That he should never find in any</hi> High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander, <hi>baser Thieves, greater Ingratitude, and more Lyes and vile Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, than amongst those</hi> Fanatical <hi>spirits he should meet withall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="39">39. But on the contrary, he tells us of the Church of <hi>England</hi> at his first coming thither,
<q>That he found that Form of Religion which was established under Queen <hi>ELIZABETH</hi> of famous memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by the Laws of the Land, to have been blessed with a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Peace, and of long continuance; which he beheld as a strong evidence of God's being very well pleased with it.</q>
He tells us also,
<q>That he could find no cause at all, on a full debate, for any Alteration to be made in the Common-Prayer-Book, though that most impugned; that the Doctrines seemed to be sincere, the Forms and Rites to have been justified out of the Practise of the Primitive Church. And finally, he tells us, That there was nothing in the same which might not very well have been born withall, if either the Adversaries would have made a reasonable construction of them; or that his Majesty had not been so nice, or rather jealous, (as himself confesseth) for having all publick Forms in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, not only to be free from all blame, but from any su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>spition.</q>
For which, consult his Proclamation of the fifth of <hi>March,</hi> before the Book of Common-Prayer. And herewith he declared himself so highly pleased, that in the <hi>Conference</hi> at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> he entred into a gratulation to Almighty God, for <hi>bringing him into the Promised Land,</hi> (so he pleased to call it) where Religion was purely profest, the Government Ecclesiastical approved by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold blessings from God himself, as well in the encrease of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, as in a glorious and happy Peace; and where he had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to sit amongst Grave and Learned men, and not to be a King (as elsewhere he had been) without State, without Honour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Order, as before was said. And this being said, we shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed unto the rest of our Story, casting into the following Book, all the Successes of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> in his own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, during the whole time of his Peaceful Government; and so much also of their Fortunes in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Belgium,</hi> as shall be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the knowledg of their future Actings.</p>

But having been kept to such hard meats when he lived in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he was so taken with the Delicacies of the <hi>English</hi> Court, that he abandoned the Severities and Cares of Government, to enjoy the Pleasures of a Crown.

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:54836:217"/>
resolved to husband all occasions which the times should give them, to their best advantage. But none conceived more hopes of him, than some <hi>Puritan</hi> Zealots; who either presuming on his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or venturing on the easiness of his Disposition, began to intermit the use of the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> to lay aside the Surplice, and neglect the Ceremonies; and more than so, to hold some Classical and Synodical Meetings, as if the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had dyed, when the Queen expired. But these Disorders he repressed by his Proclamation, wherein he commanded all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, of what sort soever, not to innovate any thing either in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Discipline, till he upon mature deliberation should take order in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But some more wary than the rest, refused to joyn themselves to such forward Brethren, whose Actions were interpreted to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour stronger of Sedition, than they did of Zeal. And by these men it was thought better to address themselves by a Petition to His Sacred Majesty, which was to be presented to him in the name of certain Ministers of the Church of <hi>England, desiring Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sundry Ceremonies and Abuses</hi>: Given out to be subscribed by a thousand hands, and therefore called the <hi>Millenary Petition</hi>; though there wanted some hundreds of that number to make up the sum. In which Petition deprecating first the imputation of Schism and Faction, they rank their whole Complaints under these four heads; that is to say, <hi>The Service of the Church, Church-Ministers, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and Maintenance of the Church,</hi> and <hi>the Discipline of it.</hi> In reference to the first, the Publick Service of the Church, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
<q>That the Cross in Baptism, Interrogatories ministred to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and Confirmations, (as superfluous) might be taken away. That Baptism might not be administred by Women. That the Cap and Surplice might not be urged. That Examination might go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Communion; and, that it be not administred without a Sermon. That the terms of <hi>Priest,</hi> and <hi>Absolution,</hi> with the Ring in Marriage, and some others, might be corrected. That the length of Service might be abridged. Church-Songs and Musick, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. And, that the Lord's Day be not prophaned, nor Holy-days so strictly urged. That there might be an Uniformity of Doctrine prescribed. That no Popish Opinion be any more taught or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. That Ministers might not be charged to teach their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to bow at the Name of <hi>Iesus.</hi> And, that the Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be only read in the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3.
In reference to Church-Ministers, it was propounded, <q>That none hereafter be admitted into the Ministry, but Able and Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent men; and those to preach diligently, especially upon the Lord's Day: but such as be already entred, and cannot preach, may either be removed, and some charitable course taken with them for their Relief; or else to be forced, according to the value of their Livings, to maintain Preachers. That <hi>Non-residency</hi> be not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. That K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Statute for the lawfulness of Ministers mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, might be revived. That Ministers might not be urged to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:54836:217"/>
(but according to the Law) the Articles of Religion, and the King's Supremacy. It was desired also, in relation to the Church's Maintenance, That Bishops might leave their <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams,</hi> some holding Prebends, some Parsonages, some Vicaridges, with their Bishopricks. That double-beneficed men might not be suffered to hold some two, some three Benefices, and as many Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. That Impropriations annexed to Bishopricks and Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, be demised only to the Preachers Incumbents for the old Rent. That the Impropriations of Lay-men's Fee, may be charged with a sixth or seventh part of the worth, to the maintenance of a Preaching-Minister. And finally, in reference to the execution of the Church's Discipline, it was humbly craved, That the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Excommunication, might be administred according to Christ's own Institution; or at the least, that Enormities might be redressed: as namely, That Excommunication might not come forth under the name of Lay-persons, Chancellors, Officials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That men be not excommunicated for Trifles, and Twelve-penny matters. That none be excommunicated without consent of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors. That the Officers be not suffered to extort unreasonable Fees. That none having Jurisdiction, or a Register's Place, put the same to Farm. That divers Popish Canons as for restraint of Marriage at certain times, be reversed. That the length of Suits in Ecclesiastical Courts, (which hung sometimes two, three, four, five, six, seven years) may be restrained. That the Oath <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> whereby men are forced to accuse themselves, be more sparingly used. That Licenses for Marriages, without being Asked, may be more sparingly granted.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And here it is to be observed, that though there was not one word in this Petition either against <hi>Episcopal</hi> Government, or Set-forms of Prayer, yet the design thereof was against them both. For if so many of the Branches had been lopped at once, the Body of the Tree must needs have rotted and consumed in a short time after. The two Universities, on the contrary, were no less zealous for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Discipline and Liturgy of the Church, then by Law esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. And to that end it was proposed, and passed at <hi>Cambridg,</hi> on the ninth of <hi>Iune,</hi> That whosoever should oppose by word or writing, either the Doctrine or the Discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or any part thereof whatsoever, within the Verge and Limits of the same University (otherwise than in the way of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation) he should be actually suspended from all Degrees alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy taken, and utterly disabled for taking any in the time to come. They resolved also to return an Answer to the said Petition; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that the University of <hi>Oxon</hi> was in hand therewith, and had made a good progress in the same, they laid by that purpose, congratulating with their Sister-University for her forwardness in it, as appears plainly by their Letter of the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October.</hi> All this was known unto the King, but he resolved to answer them in another way; and to that end designed a Conference between the Parties: A Conference much desired by those of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:54836:218"/>
in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time, who could not be induced to grant it; knowing full well, how much it tended to the ruin of all publick Government, that matters once established in due form of Law, should be made subject to Disputes. But K. <hi>IAMES,</hi> either out of a desire of his own satisfaction, or to shew his great Abilities in Judgment, Oratory, and Discourse, resolved upon it, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly gave Order for it. To which end, certain Delegates of each Party were appointed to attend upon Him at His Royal Palace of <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> on the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> then next following, there to debate the Heads of the said Petition, and to abide his Majesty's Pleasure and Determination. At what time there attended on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Church, the Lord Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Durham, Winchester, Worcester,</hi> St. <hi>Davids, Chichester, Carlisle,</hi> and <hi>Peterborough.</hi> The Dean of the Chappel, <hi>Westminster, Christ-Church, Pauls, Worcester, Salisbury, Chester,</hi> and <hi>Windsor</hi>: together with Dr. <hi>King,</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Feild,</hi> who afterwards was Dean of <hi>Glocester.</hi> Apparelled all of them in their Robes and Habits, peculiar to their several Orders.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There appeared also in the behalf of the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> Dr. <hi>Iohn Reynolds,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Thomas Spark,</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi>; Mr. <hi>Chatterton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Knewstubs,</hi> of <hi>Cambridg</hi>: Apparelld neither in Priest's Gowns, or Canonical Coats; but in such Gowns as were then commonly worn (in reference to the form and fashion of them) by the <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchants; as if they had subscribed to the Opinion of old <hi>T. C.</hi> That we ought rather to conform in all outward Ceremonies to the <hi>Turks,</hi> than the <hi>Papists.</hi> Great hopes they gave themselves for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering so much in the Polity and Forms of Worship, as might bring it nearer by some steps to the Church of <hi>Geneva.</hi> In reference to the first, it was much prest by Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> in the name of the rest, That the Nine Articles of <hi>Lambeth</hi> (which he entituled by the name of <hi>Orthodoxal Assertions</hi>) might be received amongst the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Church. But this Request, (upon a true account of the state of that business) was by that prudent King rejected, with as great a constancy as formerly the Articles themselves had been sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed under Queen <hi>ELIZABETH.</hi> It was moved also, That these words, [<hi>neither totally nor finally</hi>] might be inserted in the Sixteenth Article of the publick Confession, to the intent that the Article so explained, might speak in favour of the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> or <hi>Calvinian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, concerning the impossibility of falling from the state of Grace, and Justification. Which Proposition gave a just occasion to Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> to speak his sense of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination,</hi> which he called in plain terms, a <hi>desperate Doctrine.</hi> Upon whose interposings in that particular, and a short Declaration made by the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> touching some Heats which had been raised in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> in pursuit thereof, this second Motion proved as fruitless as the first had done.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:54836:218"/>6. Nor sped they better in relation to the Forms of Worship, than they had done in reference unto points of Doctrine: some pains they took in crying down the Surplice and the Cross in Baptism, the Ring in Marriage, and the Interrogatories proposed to Infants. And somewhat also was observed touching some Errors in the old Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>English Psalter,</hi> as also in the Gospels and Epistles, as they stood in the Liturgy: But their Objections were so stale, and so often answered, that the Bishops and Conformable Party went away with an easie Victory; not only the King's Majesty, but the Lords of his Council, being abundantly well satisfied in such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer scruples as had been raised against the Church and the Orders of it. The sum and substance of which Conference, collected by the hand of Dr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> then Dean of <hi>Chester,</hi> can hardly be abbrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a lesser compass, without great injury to the King and the Conferrees. Let it suffice, that this great Mountain which had raised so much expectation, was delivered only of a Mouse: The <hi>Millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Plaintifs</hi> have gained nothing by their fruitless travel, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of the word <hi>Absolution,</hi> by <hi>Remission of sins</hi>; the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> about private Baptism; the adding of some Thanksgivings at the end of the Letany, and of some Questions and Answers in the close of the Catechism. But on the other side, the Brethren lost so much in their Reputation, that the King was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well satisfied in the weakness of their Objections, and the Injustice of their Cavils; insomuch, that turning his head towards some of the Lords, <hi>If this be all</hi> (quoth he) <hi>which they have to say, I will either make them conform themselves, or hurry them out of the Land, or do somewhat which is worse,</hi> p. 85. Which notwithstanding they gave out,
<q>That all was theirs; and that they had obtained an absolute Victory: but more particularly, that the King gratified Dr. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> in every thing which he proposed; and that Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> obtained and prevailed in every thing they did desire. That if any man report the contrary, he doth lye; and, that they could give him the lye from Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> his mouth: that these things now obtained by the Reformers, were but the beginning of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the greater matters being yet to come. That my Lord of <hi>Winton</hi> stood mute, and said little or nothing. That my Lord of <hi>London</hi> called Dr. <hi>Reynolds, Schismatick</hi>; (he thanks him for it) but otherwise said little to the purpose. That the King's Majesty used the Bishops with very hard words; but embraced Dr. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi> and used most kind speeches to him. That my Lord of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> falling on their knees, besought his Majesty to take their Cause into his own Hands, and to make some good end of it, such as might stand with their Credit.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. All this, and more, they scattered up and down in their scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Papers, to keep up the spirits of their Party; two of which, coming to the hands of Dr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> before-mentioned, he caused them to be published at the end of the Conference: The Truth and Honesty of whose Collections, having been universally approved above fifty years, hath been impugned of late by some sorry Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:54836:219"/>
of the Puritan Faction; and a report raised of some Retractati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he is fabled to have made at the time of his death, of the great wrong which he had done to Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Millenaries.</hi> The silliness of which Fiction hath been elsewhere canvased, and therefore not to be repeated in this time and place. But for the clearing of that Reverend person from so soul a Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, we shall not make use of any other Argument, than the words of K. <hi>IAMES,</hi> who tells us in his Proclamation of the fifth of <hi>March,</hi> that he could not conceal, <hi>That the success of that Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was such as hapneth to many other things, which moving great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations before they be entred into, in their issue produce small effects: That he found mighty and vehement Informations supported with so weak and slender Proofs, as it appeared unto him and his Council, that there was no cause why any change should be in that which was most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, namely, the Book of Common-Prayer, containing the publick Service of God here established; nor in the Doctrine, which appeared to be sincere; nor in the Forms and Rites, which were justified out of the practise of the primitive Churrh: And finally, that though with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Bishops and other Learned men then and there assembled, some passages therein were rather explained than altered; yet, that the same might very well have been born amongst such men who would have made a reasonable construction of them.</hi> Which I conceive to be sufficient for the vindication of that Learned Prelate, for clearing him from doing any injury to Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> in the repeating of his words, as is suggested by some <hi>Puritan</hi> Scriblers of these present times.</p>
            <p n="8">8.
<q>But to proceed, this Conference was followed with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of the fifth of <hi>March</hi>; in which his Majesty having first declared the occasion and success thereof, in the words formerly laid down, proceeds to signifie the present course which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for causing the Book of Common-Prayer to be so explained; and being so explained, to be forthwith Printed; not doubting but that all his Subjects, both Ministers and others, would receive the same with due reverence, and conform themselves to it. Which notwithstanding he conceived it necessary to make known his Authorizing of the same by his Proclamation, and by that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to require and enjoyn all men, as well Ecclesiastical as Temporal, to conform themselves thereunto, as to the only pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Form of serving God, established and allowed in this Realm. Which said, he lays a strict Command on all Arch-bishops, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and all other publick Ministers, as well Ecclesiastical as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, for causing the same to be observed, and punishing all Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the contrary, according to the Laws of the Realm made in that behalf. Finally, He admonisheth all his Subjects of what sort soever, not to expect hereafter any Alteration in the publick Form of God's Service, from that which he had then established. And this he signified (as afterward it followeth in the said Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) because that he neither would give way to any to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, that his Judgment having determined in a matter of such weight, should be swayed to any Alteration by the Frivolous Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:54836:219"/>
of any leight head; nor could be ignorant of the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies that do arise in Government, by admitting <hi>Innovation</hi> in things once setled by mature deliberation; and how necessary it was to use constancy in the publick Determinations of all States: for that (saith he) such is the unquietness and unsteadfastness of some dispositions, affecting every year new Forms of things, as if they should be followed in their unconstancy, would make all Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of State ridiculous and contemptible; whereas the steadfast maintaining of things by good Advice established, is the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Weal of all publick Governments.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. The main Concernments of the Church being thus secured, his Majesty proceeds to his first Parliament; accompanied, as the custom is, with a Convocation; which took beginning on the twentieth day of <hi>March</hi> then next ensuing. In the Parliament there passed some Acts which concerned the Church; as namely, one for making void all Grants and Leases which should be made of any of the Lands of Arch-bishops and Bishops, to the King's Majesty, or any of his Heirs and Successors, for more than One and twenty years, or Three Lives. Which Act was seasonably procured by Bishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> to prevent the begging of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who otherwise would have picked the Church to the very bone. There also past an Act for the repealing of a Statute in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> by means whereof the Statute of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, touching the Lawfulness of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters Marriages, were revived again, as in the <hi>Millenary Petition</hi> was before desired. And either by the Practise of some <hi>Puritan</hi> Zealots, who had their Agents in all corners, or by the carelesness and conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence of his Majesty's Council, learned in the Laws of this Realm, who should have had an eye upon them, that Statute of K. <hi>EDWARD</hi> was revived also, by which it was enacted, That all Processes, Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Judgments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in any of the Ecclesiastical Courts, should be issued in the King's Name, and under the King's Seal of Arms; which afterwards gave some colour to the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, for creating trouble to the Bishops in their Jurisdiction. The Convocation was more active; some days before the sitting whereof, the most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Arch-bishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> departs this life, and leaves it to the managing of Dr. <hi>Richard Bancroft,</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> as the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of it. By whose great industry, and indefatigable pains, a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Canons was collected, to the number of One hundred forty one, out of the Articles, Injunctions, and Synodical Acts, during the Reigns of Queen <hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> and K. <hi>EDWARD</hi> the sixth. Which being methodically digested, approved of in the Convocation, and ratified by his Majesty's Letters Patents in due form of Law, were stoutly put in execution by the said Dr. <hi>Bancroft,</hi> translated to the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the Month of <hi>December, Anno</hi> 1604.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And to say truth, it did concern him to be resolute in that prosecution, considering how strict a Bond was made by many of the Brethren, when they agreed unto the drawing of the former Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by which they bound themselves not only to seek redress of those Particulars which are comprehended in the same; <hi>but that the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:54836:220"/>
state of the Church might be reformed in all things needful, according to the Rule of God's holy Word, and agreeable to the example of other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, which had restored both their Doctrine and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as it was delivered by our Saviour Christ and his holy Apostles.</hi> And how far that might reach, none knew better than he; who in his Note of <hi>Dangerous Positions and Proceedings,</hi> and his <hi>Survey of the pretended Holy Discipline,</hi> had founded the depth of their Designs, and found that nothing could ensue upon their Positions, but a most unavoidable ruin to the Church and State. He had observed with what a peevish malice they had libelled against Arch-bishop <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift,</hi> (a Prelate of a meek and moderate spirit) after his decease; and could not but expect a worse dealing from them; which he after found, by how much he had handled them more coarsly than his Predecessor. For, though the Lords had showed their Zeal unto the memory of that famous Prelate, by the severe punishment of <hi>Picker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> who made the Libel; yet well he knew, that the terror of that Punishment would be quickly over, if a hard hand were not also kept upon all the rest: And for keeping a hard hand upon all the rest, he was encouraged by the words of K. <hi>IAMES</hi> at the end of the Conference, when he affirmed, That <hi>he would either make the</hi> Puritans <hi>conform themselves, or else would hurry them out of the Land, or do that which was worse.</hi> Upon which grounds he sets himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Work, requires a strict Conformity to the Rules of the Church, according to the Laws and Canons in that behalf; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sparing Non-conformists, or Half-Conformists, at last reduced them to that point, That they must either leave their Churches, or obey the Church. The <hi>Aultar</hi> of <hi>Damascus</hi> tells us, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, That no fewer than Three hundred Preaching-Ministers, were either silenced or deprived upon that account. But the Authors of that Book, whosoever they were, who use sometimes to <hi>strain at Gnats, and swallow a Camel</hi>; at other times can make a Mountain of a Mole-hill, if it stand in their way: For it appears upon the Rolls brought in by Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> before his death, that there had been but Forty nine deprived upon all occasions; which in a Realm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Nine thousand Parishes, could be no great matter. But so it was, that by the punishment of some few of the Principals, he struck such a general terror into all the rest, that Inconformity grew out of fashion in a lesse time than could be easily imagined.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Hereupon followed a great alteration in the Face of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; more Churches beautified and repaired in this short time of his Government, than had been in many years before: The Liturgy more solemnly officiated by the Priests, and more religiously attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the common people; the Fasts and Festivals more punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed by both, than of later times. Coaps brought again in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to the Service of the Church, the Surplice generally worn without doubt or haesitancy; and all things in a manner are reduced to the same estate in which they had been first setled under Queen <hi>ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH:</hi> which, though it much redounded to the Honour of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; yet gave it no small trouble to some sticklers
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:54836:220"/>
for the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, exprest in many scandalous Libels, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious railings; in which this Reverend Prelate suffered both alive and dead. Some who had formerly subscribed, but not without some secret evasion, or mental reservation which they kept to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, are now required to testifie their Conformity by a new sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, in which it was to be declared, that they did <hi>willingly</hi> &amp; ex animo <hi>subscribe to the three Articles,</hi> (formerly tendred to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy under Arch-bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> but now incorporated into the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty six Canons) <hi>and to all things in the same contained.</hi> Which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them no starting-hole either for practising those Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies which they did not approve, or for approving that which they meant not to practise, as they had done formerly; occasioned many of them to forsake their Benefices, rather than to subscribe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true intention of the Church in the said three Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: Amongst which, none more eminent than Dr. <hi>Iohn Burges,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficed at that time in <hi>Lincoln</hi> Diocess, who for some passages in a Sermon preached before the King, on the 19<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1604, was committed Prisoner: and being then required by the Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to subscribe those Articles, he absolutely made refusal of it; and presently thereupon resigned his Benefice; the reasons whereof, he gives in a long Letter to Dr. <hi>William Chatterton,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> He applied himself also, both by Letter and Petition, to his Sacred Majesty, clearing himself from all intention of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing in that Sermon which might give any just offence; and humbly praying for a restitution, not to his Church, but only to his Majesty's Favour. Which gained so far upon the King, that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him not long after to a personal Conference, recovered him unto his station in the Church, from which he was fallen: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, occasioned his preferring to the Rectory of <hi>Colshill,</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Warwick.</hi> After which, he became a profest Champion of the Government and Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; both which he justified against all the Cavils of the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> as appears by a Learned Book of his, entituled, <hi>An Answer rejoyned to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded Pamphlet,</hi> &amp;c. published in the year 1631.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But the gaining of this man did not still the rest: For present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the neck of this,<note place="margin">1605</note> comes out a Factious Pamphlet, published by the <hi>Lincoln-shire</hi>-Ministers, which they call <hi>The Abridgment</hi>; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the sum and substance of all those Objections which either then were, or formerly had been made against the Church, in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Doctrine, Government, or Forms of Worship: Concerning which, it is observed by the said Dr. <hi>Burges,</hi> That he found the state of the Questions to be very much altered in the same; that <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> and the rest, in the times fore-going, though they had sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both their Wits and Pens against the Ceremonies, opposed them as inconvenient only, but not unlawful: That therefore they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to perswade the Ministers rather to conform themselves, than to leave their Flocks; the people, rather to receive the Communion kneeling, than not to receive the same at all: but, that the Authors of that Book, and some other Pamphlets, pronounced them to be
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:54836:221"/>
simply unlawful, neither to be imposed nor used; some of them thinking it a great part of godliness to cast off the Surplice, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their Children so to do. This made the Bishops far more earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to reduce them to a present Conformity, than otherwise they might have been, though by so doing they encreased those discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, the seeds whereof were sown at the end of the Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. All this the <hi>Papists</hi> well observed, and rejoyced at it, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the carrying on of the Gun-powder Treason, to lay the guilt thereof on the <hi>Puritans</hi> only. But the King and his Council mined with them, and undermined them, and by so doing blew them up in their own Invention; the Traytors being discovered, condemned, and executed, as they most justly had deserved. But this Design which was intended for a ruin of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, proved in conclusion very advantagious to their Ends and Purposes: For, the King being throughly terrified with the apprehension of so great a danger, turned all his thoughts upon the <hi>Papists,</hi> and was content to let the <hi>Puritans</hi> take breath, and regain some strength, that they might serve him for a counterpoise against the other: as afterwards he gave some countenance to the <hi>Popish</hi> Party, when he perceived the opposite Faction to be grown too head-strong. Nor were the <hi>Puritans</hi> wanting to themselves upon this occasion, but entertained the Court and Countrey with continual fears of some new dangers from the <hi>Papists</hi>; and by appearance of much zeal for the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and no less care for the preserving of their common Liberty against the encroachments of the Court, came by degrees to make a Party in the House of Commons. And hereunto K. <hi>IAMES</hi> unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly contributed his assistance also; who being intent upon uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the two Kingdoms by Act of Parliament, suffered the Commons to expatiate in Rhetorical Speeches, to call in question the extent of his Royal Prerogative, to embrue many Church-concernments, and to dispute the Power of the High-Commission: By means whereof they came at last to such an height, that the King was able in the end to do nothing in Parliament, but as he courted and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to this popular Faction.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Worse fared it with the Brethren of the Separation, who had retired themselves unto <hi>Amsterdam</hi> in the former Reign, than with their first Founders and Fore-fathers in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> For having broken in sunder the <hi>bond of peace,</hi> they found no possibility of preserving the <hi>spirit of unity</hi>; one Separation growing continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the neck of another, till they were crumbled into nothing. The Brethren of the first Separation had found fault with the Church of <hi>England</hi> for reading Prayers and Homilies as they lay in the Book, and not admitting the <hi>Presbytery</hi> to take place amongst them. But the Brethren of the second Separation take as much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staste against retaining all set-forms of Hymns and Psalms, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Conceptions, both in Praying and Prophesying, to the help of Memory; and did as much abominate Presbytery, as the other liked it: For first, They pre-suppose for granted, as they safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might, that there be three kinds of Spiritual Worship, <hi>Praying,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:54836:221"/>
Prophesying,</hi> and <hi>Singing of Psalms</hi>; and then subjoyn this Maxim, in which all agreed, that is to say, That there is the same reason of Helps in all the parts of Spiritual Worship, as is to be admitted in any one, during the performing of that Worship. Upon which ground they charge it home on their fellow-Separatists, That, <hi>as in Prayer, the Book is to be laid aside, by the confession of the ancient Brethren of the Separation, so must it also be in Prophesying, and Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Psalms: and therefore, whether we pray, or sing, or prophesie, it is not to be from the Book, but out of the heart.</hi> For <hi>Prophesying,</hi> next, they tell us, that the Spirit is quenched two manner of ways, by Memory, as well as Reading. And to make known how little use there is of Memory in the Act of Prophesying or Preaching, they tell us, That the citing of Chapter and Verse (as not being used by Christ and his Apostles in their Sermons or Writings), is a mark of Antichrist. And as for <hi>Psalms,</hi> which make the Third part of Spiritual Worship, they propose these Queries: 1. <hi>Whether in a Psalm a man must be tyed to</hi> Meeter, Rythme, <hi>and</hi> Tune? <hi>and, Whether</hi> Voluntary <hi>be not as necessary in</hi> Tune <hi>and Words, as well as Matter?</hi> And, 2. <hi>Whether</hi> Meeter, Rythme, <hi>and</hi> Tune, <hi>be not</hi> quenching the Spirit?</p>

According to which Resolution of the <hi>New Separation,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, when the Congregation shall be met together, may first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his own Matter in the Act of Praising; deliver it in Prose or Meeter, as he lists himself; and in the same instant chant out in what Tune soever, that which comes first into his own head: Which would be such a horrible confusion of Tongues and Voices, that hardly any howling or gnashing of teeth, can be like unto it. And yet it follows so directly on the former Principles, that if we banish all set-forms of Common-Prayer, (which is but only one part of God's Publick Worship) from the use of the Church, we cannot but in Justice and in Reason both, banish all <hi>studied</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated</hi> Sermons, from the House of God, and utterly cast out all King <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms, (whether in Prose or Meeter, that comes all to one) and all Divine Hymns also into the bargain. Finally, as to Forms of Government, they declared thus, (or to this purpose, at the least, if my memory fail not) That as they which live under the Tyranny of the Pope and Cardinals, worship the <hi>very Beast</hi> it self; and they which live under the Government of Arch-bishops and Bishops, do worship the <hi>Image of the Beast</hi>; so they which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly obey the Reformed Presbytery of Pastors, Elders, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, worship the <hi>shadow of that Image.</hi> To such ridiculous Follies are men commonly brought, when once presuming on some <hi>New Light</hi> to direct their Actions, they suffer themselves to be mis-gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> of their own Inventions. And in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture stood the <hi>Brethren of the Separation,</hi> Anno 1606, when <hi>Smith</hi> first published his Book of the present differences between the Churches of the <hi>Separation,</hi> as he honestly calls them. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards there grew another great dispute between <hi>Ainsworth</hi> and <hi>Broughton,</hi> Whether the colour of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Linnen <hi>Ephod</hi> were of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:54836:222"/>
               <hi>Blew,</hi> or a <hi>Sea-water Green</hi>: Which did not only trouble all the <hi>Dyers</hi> in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> but drew their several Followers into Sides and Factions, and made good sport to all the World, but themselves alone. By reason of which Divisions and Sub-divisions, they fell at last into so many Fractions, that one of them in the end became a Church of himself, and having none to joyn in Opinion with him, baptized himself, and thereby got the name of a <hi>Se-baptist</hi>; which never any Sectary or Heretick had obtained before.</p>
            <p n="15">15. It fell not out much otherwise in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces, with those of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Judgment, who then began to find some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of that Power and Credit wherewith they carried all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in the times preceding. <hi>Iunius,</hi> a very moderate and learned man, and one of the Professors for Divinity in the Schools of <hi>Leyden,</hi> departed out of this life in the same year also; into whose Place the Overseers, or <hi>Curators,</hi> as they call them, of that University, made choice of <hi>Iacob Van Harmine,</hi> a man of equal Learning, and no less Piety. He had for fifteen years before, been Pastor (as they love to phrase it) to the great Church of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Holland</hi>; during which time he published his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course against the Doctrine of <hi>Predestination,</hi> as laid down by <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> who at that time had printed his <hi>Armilla Aurea,</hi> and therein justified all the Rigours of the <hi>Supra-lapsarians.</hi> Encouraged with his good success in this Adventure, he undertakes a Conference on the same Argument, with the Learned <hi>Iunius,</hi> one of the <hi>Sub-lapsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Judgment; the sum whereof being spread abroad in several Papers, was afterward set forth by the name of <hi>Amica Collatio.</hi> By means whereof, as he attained a great esteem with all moderate men, so he exceedingly exasperated most of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Ministers, who thereupon opposed his coming to <hi>Leyden</hi> with their utmost power, accusing him of Heterodoxies and unsound Opinions, to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Holland.</hi> But the <hi>Curators</hi> being constant in their Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and <hi>Harmin</hi> having purged himself from all Crimes objected, before his Judges at the <hi>Hague</hi>; he is dispatched for <hi>Leyden,</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the University, and confirmed by the Estate: Towards which, the Testimonial-Letters sent from <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> did not help a little; in which he stands commended for a man of an <note n="*" place="margin">

By which Attractives he prevailed as much amongst the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of <hi>Leyden,</hi> as he had done amongst the Merchants at <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> For during the short time of his sitting in the Chair of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> he drew unto him a great part of that University; who by the Piety of the man, his powerful Arguments, his extream diligence in that place, and the clear light of Reason which appeared in all his Discourses, became so wedded at the last unto his Opinions, that no time or trouble could divorce them from <hi>Harmin</hi>: Dying in the year 1609, the Heats betwixt his Scholars, and those of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perswasion, were rather encreased than abated; the more
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:54836:222"/>
encreased for want of such prudent Moderators as had before preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Churches from a publick Rupture. The breach between them growing wider and wider, each side thought fit to seek the countenance of the State; and they did accordingly. For in the year 1610, the Followers of <hi>Arminius</hi> address their <hi>Remonstrance</hi> (containing the Antiquity of their Doctrines, and the substance of them) to the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> which was encountred presently by a <hi>Contra-Remonstrance,</hi> exhibited by those of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Party: from hence the Name of <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> and <hi>Contra-Remonstrants,</hi> so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in their Books and Writings. Which though it brought some trouble for the present on the Churches of <hi>Holland,</hi> conduced much more to the advantage of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whose Doctrine in those points had been so over-born, if not quite suppressed, by those of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Party, that it was almost reckoned for a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie to be sound and Orthodox, according to the tenour of the Book of Articles, and other publick Monuments of the Religion here by Law established. For being awakened by the noise of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Troubles, most men began to look about them, to search more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into the Doctrines of the Church, and by degrees to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, maintain, and teach them against all Opposers, as shall appear more largely and particularly in another place.</p>
            <p n="17">17. At the same time more troubles were projected in the Realm of <hi>Sweden</hi>; Prince <hi>Sigismund,</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Grand-child of <hi>Gustavus Ericus,</hi> the first King of that Family, was in his Father's life-time chosen King of <hi>Poland,</hi> in reference to his Mother, the Lady <hi>Catherine,</hi> Sister to <hi>SIGISMVND</hi> the Second. But either being better pleased with the Court of <hi>Poland,</hi> or not permitted by that people to go out of the Kingdom, he left the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Sweden</hi> to his Unkle <hi>CHARLES</hi>; a Prince of no small Courage, but of more Ambition. At first he governed all Affairs as Lord Deputy only, but practised by degrees the exercise of a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Power than was belonging to a Vice-Roy. Finding the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> not so favourable unto his Designs, as he conceived that he had merited by his Favours to them, he raised up a <hi>Calvinian</hi> Party within the Realm, according to whose Principles he began first to withdraw his obedience from his Natural Prince, and after to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the Government to himself. But first, he suffers all Affairs to fall into great Disorders, the Realm to be invaded by the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> on the one side, by the <hi>Danes</hi> on the other, that so the people might be cast on some necessity of putting themselves absolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his protection. In which distractions he is earnestly solicited by all sorts of people, except only those of his own Party, to accept the Crown; which he consents to at the last, as if forced unto it by the necessities of his Countrey. But he so play'd his Game withall, that he would neither take the same, nor protect the Subjects, till a Law was made for entailing the Crown for ever unto his Posterity, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Male</hi> or <hi>Female,</hi> as an Hereditary Kingdom. In all which Plots and Purposes, he thrived so luckily, (if to usurp another Prince's Realm may be called <hi>Good luck</hi>) that after a long Warr, and some
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:54836:223"/>
Bloody Victories, he forced his Nephew to desist from all further Enterprises, and was Crowned King at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> in the year 1607, But as he got this Kingdom by no better Title than of Force and Fraud; so by the same, the Daughter of his Son <hi>Gustavus Adolphus,</hi> was divested of it, partly compelled, and partly cheated out of her Estate. So soon expired the Race of this great Politician, that many thousands of that people who saw the first beginning of it, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to see the end.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Such Fortune also had the <hi>French Calvinians</hi> in their glorious Projects, though afterwards it turned to their destruction. For in the year 1603, they held a general Synod at <hi>Gappe</hi> in <hi>Daulphine,</hi> anciently the chief City of the <hi>Apencenses,</hi> and at this time a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's-See. Nothing more memorable in this Synod (as to points of Doctrine) than, that it was determined for an Article of their Faith, That <hi>the Pope was Antichrist.</hi> But far more memorable was it for their Usurpations on the Civil Power. For at this Meeting they gave Audience to the Ambassadors of some Forreign States, as if they had been a Common-wealth distinct from the Realm of <hi>France.</hi> More than which, they audaciously importuned the King (of whose affection to them they presumed too far) by their several Agents, for liberty of going wheresoever they listed, or sending whomsoever they pleased, to the Councils and Assemblies of all Neighbouring-Estates and Nations which profest the same Religion with them. This, though it had not been the first, was looked on as their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est encroachment on the Royal Authority, which in conclusion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ruin of their Cause and Party. For what else could this aim at, (as was well observed by the King then reigning) but to make themselves a State distinct and independent, to raise up a new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in the midst of a Kingdom, and to make the Schism as great in Civil, as in Sacred matters: Which wrought so far upoa the Councils of his next Successor, who had not been trained up amongst them as his Father was, that he resolved to call them to a sober reckoning on the next occasion, and to deprive them all at once of those Powers and Priviledges which they so wantonly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto his disturbance. Of which we shall speak more hereafter in its proper place.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1605.</note>In the mean time let us cross over into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where all Assairs moved retrograde, and seemed to threaten a relapse to their old Confusions. A general Assembly had been intimated to be held at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> in the Month of <hi>Iuly, Anno</hi> 1604: which by reason that the King was wholly taken up with effecting the Union, was adjourned to the same Month, in the year next following. In the mean season, some of the more Factious Ministers, hoping to raise no small advantage to themselves and their Party, by the absence of so many persons of most Power and Credit, began to entertain new Counsels for the unravelling of that Web which the King had lately wrought with such care and cunning. The King hears of it, and gives Order to suspend the Meeting till his further Pleasure were declared. Wherein he was so far obeyed by the major part, that of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:54836:223"/>
the fifty Presbyteries, into which the whole Kingdom was divided, <hi>Anno</hi> 1592, nine only sent Commissioners to attend at <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> When the day came, the Meeting was so thin and slender, that there appeared not above one and twenty, when they were at the fullest. But they were such as were resolved to stand stoutly to it, each man conceiving himself able, in the Cause of God, to make resistance to an Army. The Laird of <hi>Lowreston</hi> commands them in the King's Name to return to their Houses, to discontinue that unlawful Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and not to meet on any publick occasion which concerned the Church, but by his Majesty's Appointment. They answer, That they were assembled at that time and place, according to the word of God, and the Laws of the Land; and, that they would not betray the Liberties of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by obeying such unlawful Prohibitions. Which said, and having desired him to withdraw a while, they made choice of one <hi>Forbes</hi> for their Moderator, and so adjourned themselves to <hi>September</hi> following. <hi>Lowreston</hi> thereupon denounced them Rebels; and fearing that some new affront might be put upon him, and consequently on the King, in whose Name he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he seeks for Remedy and Prevention, to the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: <hi>Forbes</hi> and <hi>Welch,</hi> the two chief sticklers in the Cause, are by them convented; and not abating any thing of their former obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, are both sent Prisoners unto <hi>Blackness:</hi> A day is given for the appearance of the rest, which was the third day of <hi>October</hi>; at what time thirteen of the number made acknowledgment of their offence, and humbly supplicated, that their Lordships would endeavour to procure their Pardon: the rest remaining in their disobedience, are by the Lords disposed of into several Prisons.</p>
            <p n="19">19. But these proceedings did so little edifie with that stubborn Faction, that the Lords of the Council were condemned for their just severity, and all their Actings made to aim at no other end, but by degrees to introduce the Rights and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The King endeavours by a Declaration to undeceive his good people, and reclaim these obstinate persons from the ways of ruin; and intimates withall, that a new Assembly should be held at <hi>Dundee</hi> in the <hi>Iuly</hi> following. But this prevails as little as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer course. Which puts the business on so far, that either the King must be conformable to their present humour, or they submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the King's just Power. The Lords resolve upon the last, command them to appear at the Council-Table, to receive their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and nominated the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> for the Day of Doom. Accordingly they came, but they came prepared, having subscribed a publick Instrument under all their hands, by which they absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decline the Judgment of the King and Council, as altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent, and put themselves upon the tryal of the next Assembly, as their lawful Judg. Before they were convented only for their Disobedience; but by this Declinator, they have made themselves Traytors. The King is certified of all this; and being resolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the maintenance of his own Authority, gave order, That the Law should pass upon them, according to the Statute made in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:54836:224"/>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1584. Hereupon <hi>Forbes, Welch, Duncam, Sharp, Davie, Straghan,</hi> are removed from <hi>Blackness,</hi> arraigned at an Assize held in <hi>Linlithgoe,</hi> found guilty by the Jury, and condemned to death; but all of them returned to their several Prisons, till the King's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure should be known for their Execution. The <hi>Melvins,</hi> and some other of the principal Zealots, caused Prayers and Supplications to be made in behalf of the Traytors though they had generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to perform that office when the King's Mother was upon the point of losing her life, upon a more unwarrantable Sentence of Condemnation. This brought forth first a Proclamation, inhibiting all Ministers to recommend the condemned persons unto God in their Prayers or Sermons; and afterwards, a Letter to some Chiefs amongst them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for waiting on His Majesty at the Court in <hi>England,</hi> where they should be admitted to a publick Conference, and have the King to be their Judg.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Upon this Summons there appear in behalf of the Church, the Arch-bishops of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Glasgow,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Galloway</hi>; together with <hi>Nicolson,</hi> the designed Bishop of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeden</hi>: And for the Kirk, the two <hi>Melvins, Colt, Carmichall, Scot, Balfour,</hi> and <hi>Watson.</hi> The place appointed for the Conference, was <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> at which they all attended on <hi>Septemb.</hi> 20. But the Kirk-Party came resolved neither to satisfie the King, nor be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, though he endeavoured all fit ways for their information. To which end he appointed four Eminent and Learned Prelates to preach before them in their turns: the first of which, was Dr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> who learnedly asserted the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Power, out of those words to the Elders at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> recorded <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 28. The second was Dr. <hi>Buckeridg,</hi> then Master of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Colledg in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and afterwards preferred to the See of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi>; who no less learnedly evinced the King's Supremacy in all Concernments of the Church; selecting for his Text, the words of same Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 1. Next followed Dr. <hi>Andrews,</hi> then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Chichester</hi>; who taking for his Text those words of <hi>Moses,</hi> viz. <hi>Make thee two Trumpets of silver,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 2. convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly demonstrated out of all Antiquity, That the calling of all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and National Councils, had appertained unto the Supreme Christian Magistrate. Dr. <hi>King,</hi> then Dean of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> brings up the Rear; and taking for his Text those words of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> Cap. 8. v. 11. disproved the calling of Lay-Elders, as men that had no Power in governing the Church of Christ; nor were so much as heard of in the Primitive times. But neither the Learned Discourses of these Four Prelates, nor the Arguments of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Bishops, nor the Authority and Elocution of the King, could gain at all on these deaf Adders, who came resolved not to hear the voice of those Charmers, <hi>charmed they never so wisely.</hi> Thus have we seen them in their Crimes, and now we are to look upon them in their several Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishments. And first, the Ministers which had been summoned into <hi>England,</hi> were there commanded to remain until further. The six which were condemned for Treason, were sentenced by the King
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:54836:224"/>
to perpetual banishment, and never to return to their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey upon pain of death. And as for those which had acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their offence, and submitted to mercy, they were confined unto the Isles, and out-parts of the Kingdom, where they may possibly work some good, but could do no harm. After which, <hi>Andrew Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> having made a Seditious Libel against the Altar, and the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, in His Majesty's Chappel, was brought into the Starr-Chamber by an <hi>Ore tenus,</hi> where he behaved himself so malepertly toward all the Lords, and more particularly towards the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that he was sentenced to imprisonment in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and there remained till he was begged by the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and by him made Professor of Divinity in the School of <hi>Sedan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">21. During the time that all men's Eyes were fastned on the issue of this great Dispute, the King thought fit to call a Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which he managed by Sir <hi>George Hume,</hi> his right trusty Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, not long before created Earl of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and made Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer of that Kingdom. His chief Work was to settle the Authority of the King, and the Calling of Bishops, that they might mutually support each other in the Government of the Church and State<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>punc; It was supposed, that no small opposition would be made against him by some <hi>Puritan</hi> Ministers, who repaired in great numbers to the Town, as on their parts it was resolved on. But he applyed himself unto them with such Art and Prudence, that having taken off their edg, the Acts passed easily enough with the Lords and Commons. By the first Act, the King's Prerogative was confirmed over all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in all Causes whatsoever: Which made Him much more Absolute in all Affairs which had relation to the Church, than he had been formerly. And by the next, entituled, <hi>An Act for Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Estate of Bishops</hi>; the Name of <hi>Bishops</hi> was conferred upon such of the Ministers, as by the King were nominated unto any of the Bishop-Sees, and thereby authorized to have place in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: A course was also taken by it, to repossess the Bishops of the Lands of their several Churches, as well as their Titles and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: not that a Plenary re-possession of their Lands was then gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto them; but, that by a Repeal of the late Act of Annexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the King was put into a capacity of restoring so much of the Rents as remained in the Crown,<note place="margin">1606.</note> and otherwise providing for them out of his Revenues. And, that the like distraction might not be made of their Estates for the time to come, an Act was passed for restraining such Dilapidations as had impoverish'd all the Bishopricks since the Reformation. After which, and the dooming of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Zealots to their several Punishments, he indicts a general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> in <hi>December</hi> following: at which convened One hundred thirty six Ministers, and about Thirty three of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and principal Gentry. In this Assembly it was offered in behalf of his Majesty, That all Presbyteries should have their constant Moderators; for whose encouragement his Majesty would assign to each of them a yearly stipend, amounting to One hundred pounds,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:54836:225"/>
or Two hundred Marks in the <hi>Scots</hi> account: That the Bishops should be Moderators of all Presbyteries in the Towns and Cities where they made their residence; as also, in Provincial and Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san Synods: and that the Bishops should assume upon themselves the charge of prosecuting <hi>Papists,</hi> till they returned to their obedience to the King and the Church. In the obtaining of which Acts, there was no small difficulty; but he obtained them at the last, though not without some limitations and restrictions super-added to them, under pretence of keeping the Commissioners (hereafter to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bishops</hi>) within their bounds.</p>
            <p n="22">22. The <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> notwithstanding, were not willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go their Power; but strugling, like half-dying men betwixt life and death, laid hold on all advantages which were offered to them, in opposition to the Acts before agreed on. <hi>Gladstanes,</hi> Arch-bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> taking upon him to preside as Moderator in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Fife,</hi> being within his proper Diocese and Jurisdiction, was for a while opposed by some of the Ministers, who would have gone to an Election as at other times. The Presbyteries also in some places, refused to admit the Bishops for their Moderators, according to the Acts and Constitutions of the said Assembly. Which though it put the Church into some disorder, yet the Bishops carried it at the last, the stoutest of the Ministers su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mitting in the end unto that Authority which they were not able to contend with. In which conjuncture the King gives order for a Parliament to be held in <hi>Iune</hi>;<note place="margin">1609.</note> in which He passed some severe Laws against the <hi>Papists,</hi> prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sending of their Children to be educated beyond the Seas, and giving order for the choice of Pedagogues or Tutors to instruct them there; as also, against Jesuits, and the Sayers and Hearers of Mass. The cognizance of several Causes which anciently belonged to the Bishops Courts, had of late times been setled in the Sessions or Colledg of Justice: But by an Act of this Parliament, they are severed from it, and the Episcopal Jurisdiction restored as formerly; the Lords of the Session being, in lieu thereof, rewarded with Ten thousand pounds yearly, (which must be understood according to the <hi>Scottish</hi> account) out of the Customs of that Kingdom. It was enacted also, That the King from thenceforth might appoint such Habit as to him seemed best, to Judges, Magistrates, and Church-men. Which Acts being past, Patterns were sent from <hi>London,</hi> in a short time after, for the Apparel of the Lords of the Session, the Justice, and other inferior Judges; for the Advocates, the Lawyers, the Commissairs, and all that lived by practise of the Law; with a command given to every one whom the Statutes concerned, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themselves of the Habits prescribed, within a certain space, under the pain of Rebellion. But for the habit of the Bishops, and other Church-men, it was thought fit to respite the like appointment of them, till the new Bishops had received their Consecration; to which now we hasten.</p>
            <p n="23">23. But by the way, we must take notice of such preparations as were made towards it in the next General Assembly held at <hi>Glasgow,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:54836:225"/>
Anno</hi> 1610, and managed by the Earl of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> as the former was: in which it was concluded, <hi>That the King should have the indiction of all General Assemblies. That the Bishops, or their Deputies, should be perpetual Moderators of the Diocesan Synods. That no Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Absolution, should be pronounced without their approbation. That all presentations of Benefices should be made by them</hi>; and, <hi>that the deprivation or suspension of Ministers, should belong to them. That every Minister, at his admission to a Benefice, should take the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and Canonical Obedience: That the Visitation of the Diocese shall be performed by the Bishop or his Deputy only.</hi> And finally, <hi>That the Bishop should be Moderator of all Conventions, for Exercisings, or Prophesyings,</hi> (call them which you will) <hi>which should be held within their bounds.</hi> All which Conclusions were confirmed by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in the year 1612: in which the Earl of <hi>Dumferling,</hi> then being Lord Chancellor of that Kingdom, sate as chief Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; who in the same Session, also, procured a Repeal of all such former Acts (more patticularly, of that which passed in favour of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, 1592.) as were supposed to be derogatory to the said Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. In the mean time, the King being advertised of all which had been done at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> calls to the Court by special Letters under his Sign-Manual, Mr. <hi>Iohn Spotswood,</hi> the designed Arch-bishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi>: Mr. <hi>Gawen Hamilton,</hi> nominated to the See of <hi>Galloway:</hi> and Mr. <hi>Andrew Lamb,</hi> appointed to the Church of <hi>Brechin</hi>; to the intent that being consecrated Bishops in due Form and Order, they might at their return give consecration to the rest of their Brethren. They had before been authorized to vote in Parliament, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the King unto their several Sees, made the perpetual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators of Presbyteries and Diocesan Synods: and finally, by the Conclusions made at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> they were restored to all considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Acts of their Jurisdiction. The Character was only wanting to compleat the Work, which could not be imprinted but by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration according to the Rules and Canons of the Primitive times.</p>
            <p n="24">24. And that this Character might be indelibly imprinted on them, His Majesty issues a Commission under the Great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to the Bishops of <hi>London, Ely, Wells,</hi> and <hi>Rochester,</hi> whereby they were required to proceed to the Consecration of the said three Bishops, according to the Rules of the <hi>English</hi> Ordination; which was by them performed with all due solemnity, in the Chappel of the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>'s House, near the Church of St. <hi>Pauls, Octob.</hi> 21, 1610. But first, a scruple had been moved by the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> concerning the capacity of the persons nominated, for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Episcopal Consecration, in regard that none of them had formally been ordained Priests: which scruple was removed by Arch-bishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> alledging, that there was no such necessity of receiving the Order of Priesthood, but that Episcopal Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations might be given without it; as might have been exemplified in the Cases of <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Nectarius</hi>; of which<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the first was made Arch-bishop of <hi>Millain</hi>; and the other, Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:54836:226"/>
without receiving any intermediate Orders, whether of Priest, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, or any other (if there were any other) at that time in the Church. And on the other side, the Prelates of <hi>Scotland</hi> also had their Doubts and Scruples, fearing lest by receiving Consecration of the <hi>English</hi> Bishops, they might be brought to an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Superiority which had been exercised and enjoyed by the <hi>Primates</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> before the first breaking out of the Civil Warrs betwixt <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster.</hi> Against which fear, the King sufficiently provided, by excluding the two Arch-bishops of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi> (who only could pretend to that Superiority) out of His Commission; which <hi>Bancroft</hi> very cheerfully condescended to, though he had chiefly laid the plot, and brought on the work; not caring who participated in the Honour of it, as long as the Churches of both Kingdoms might receive the Benefit.</p>
            <p n="25">25. This great Work being thus past over, the King erects a Court of <hi>High Commission</hi> in the Realm of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for ordering all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which concerned that Church, and could not safely be redressed in the Bishops Courts. He also gave them some Directions for the better exercise of their Authority, by them to be communicated to the Bishops, and some principal Church-men, whom he appointed to be called to <hi>Edenborough</hi> in the following <hi>February</hi>; where they were generally well approved. But as all general Rules have some Exceptions; so some Exceptions were found out against these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, and the proceedings thereupon. Not very pleasing to those great Persons who then sate at the Helm, and looked upon it as a diminution to their own Authority, and could not brook that any of the Clergy should be raised to so great a Power; much more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to the principal sticklers in the Cause of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> who now beheld the downfall of their glorious Throne, which they had erected for themselves in the Name of Christ. One thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might comfort them in the midst of their sorrows, that is to say, the death of the most Reverend Arch-bishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> who left this life upon the second of <hi>November,</hi> not living above thirteen days after the <hi>Scottish</hi> Bishops had received Consecration. For which great blessing to the Church, he had scarce time to render his just ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments unto God and the King, when he is called on to prepare for his <hi>Nunc Dimittis.</hi> And having seen so great a work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished for the glory of God, the honour of his Majesty, and the good of both Kingdoms, beseecheth God to give him leave to depart in peace, that with his eyes he might behold that great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was ordained to be a Light unto the Gentiles, and to be the Glory of his people <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="26">26. <hi>Bancroft</hi> being dead, some Bishops of the Court held a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation touching the fittest Person to succeed him in that eminent Dignity: The great Abilities and most exemplary Piety of Dr. <hi>Lancelot Andrews,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> pointed him out to be the man, as one sufficiently able to discharge a Trust of such main im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; and rather looked on as a Preferment to that See, than preferred unto it. Him they commended to King <hi>IAMES,</hi> who had
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:54836:226"/>
him in a high esteem for his Parts and Piety; and setled all things, as they thought, in so good a posture, that some of them retired to their Countrey-houses, and others slackned their attendance about the Court. Which opportunity being taken by the Earl of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> he puts in for <hi>Abbot,</hi> who had attended him in some of his Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Upon the merits of which Service, he was preferred first to the See of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> to which he received his Episcopal Consecration on the third of <hi>December,</hi> 1609; and within the compass of the year, was removed to <hi>London.</hi> But <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> was resolved to advance him higher. And he put in so powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his behalf, that at last he carried it to the great detriment of the Church, as it after proved. For, as one very well observeth of him, he seemed to be <hi>better qualified with merit to attain the Dignity, than with a spirit answerable to so great a Function.</hi> Which made him slack and negligent in the course of his Government, and too indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to that Party, which <hi>Bancroft</hi> had kept under with such just se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity. But take his Character in the words of the said Historian, and we shall find that he was a man <hi>too facil and yeelding</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of that great Office: that by his <hi>extraordinary remisness in not exacting strict conformity to the prescribed Orders of the Church in point of Ceremony, he seemed to resolve those Legal determinations to their first indifferency:</hi> and finally, That he brought in <hi>such a habi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of Nonconformity,</hi> that the future reduction of <hi>those tender Conscienced-men to a long discontinued obedience,</hi> was at the last <hi>interpreted</hi> for an <hi>Innovation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="27">27. But to go forwards where we left, <hi>Bancroft</hi> being dead, the <hi>English Puritans</hi> began to put forth again, not pushing at the Liturgy and Episcopal Government (as in former times); but in pursuance of the <hi>Sabbatarian</hi> and <hi>Calvinian</hi> Rigors: Which having been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in the year 1595, as is there declared, and afterward laid aside till a fitter season, were now thought fit to be resumed as the most proper Mediums for inferring the desired Conclusion. In both which, they received some countenance from K. <hi>IAMES</hi> himself; but more from the connivence (if I may not call it, the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) of the new Arch-bishop. In reference to the first, the King had published a Proclamation in the first year of his Reign, prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some rude and disorderly Pastimes, (as namely, Ball, Baitings, Bear-baitings, and common Interludes) from being followed on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> because they drew away much people from God's publick Service. And he had caused the Morality of the Lord's-day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, to be conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ed amongst the rest of the <hi>Irish</hi> Articles, <hi>Anno</hi> 1615, of which more anon. Which Condescentions were so hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded by the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, that by the raising of the Sabbath, they depressed the Festivals; and with the Festivals, all those anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Annual Fasts which had been kept upon the Eves. And fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing close upon the Doctrines of <hi>Aerius,</hi> before remembred, they introduced, by little and little, a general neglect of the Weekly Fasts, the holy time of <hi>Lent,</hi> and the Embring-days; reducing all the Acts of Humiliation, to solemn and occasional Fasts, as amongst the <hi>Scots</hi>;
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:54836:227"/>
and yet this was not all the mischief which ensued on their Sabbath-Doctrines. By which, and by the temper of the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they gave occasion to some Preachers, and not a few publick Ministers of Justice, in their several Countreys, to interdict all lawful sports upon that Day. By means whereof, the people were perswaded by some Priests and Jesuits, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and some others of the Northern Counties, that the Reformed Religion, was incompetible with that Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which God and Nature had indulged to the sons of men. And having brought them to that point, it was no hard matter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to fall off to Popery, as a Religion more agreeable to human Society, and such as would permit them all such lawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures as by the <hi>Stoicism</hi> of the other had been interdicted. Which brought the King to a necessity of publishing his Declaration about lawful sports, dated at <hi>Greenwich</hi> on the 24<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1620. Which as it put some Water into the Wine of the <hi>Sabbata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>; so shewed he, within few years after, how little he affected the <hi>Calvinian Rigors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="28">28. In reference to which last, some of the Zealots in the Cause had took encouragement from his Declaration against <hi>Vorstus,</hi> a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> in which he had bestowed some unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Epethetes upon the Followers of <hi>Van Harmine,</hi> in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces. This seemed sufficient to expose all those of the same Perswasions, unto scorn and hatred; and on the other side, to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate all those who favoured <hi>Calvinism,</hi> to act such things as drew upon them at the last the King's high displeasure. <hi>Calvin</hi> had publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a blasphemous Fancy touching Christ's suffering of Hell-torments in the time of his Passion, even to the horrors of Despair. Which being touched upon by <hi>Corbet,</hi> one of the Students of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> in a Passion-Sermon, 1613, he was most sharply reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Repetitioner,</hi> for so great a sauciness. Dr. <hi>Iohn Houson,</hi> one of the Canons of that Church, who had most worthily discharged the Office of Vice-Chancellor twelve years before, declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self somewhat to the prejudice of the <hi>Annotations</hi> which were made on the <hi>Genevian</hi> Bibles; and for so doing, is condemned to a Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation much about that time; though the said <hi>Annotations</hi> had been censured for their partiality and seditiousness, by the Tongue of K. <hi>IAMES.</hi> And finally, Dr. <hi>William Laud,</hi> being then President of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Colledg, had showed himself no Friend to <hi>Calvinism,</hi> in Doctrine or Discipline; and must be therefore branded for a <hi>Papist,</hi> in a publick Sermon preached upon <hi>Easter Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ay,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Robert Abbot,</hi> then Vice-Chancellor and Doctor of the Chair in that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity: Which passages so closely following upon one another, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned (as most conceived) the publishing of some Directions by His Majesty, in the year next following: In which it was injoyned, among other things, <hi>That young Students in Divinity should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to study such Books as were most agreeable in Doctrine and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline to the Church of</hi> England; <hi>and be excited to bestow their time in the Fathers and Councils; School-men, Histories, and Controversies;
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:54836:227"/>
and not to insist too long upon Compendiums and Abbreviators, making them the grounds of those Sacred Studies.</hi> Which as it was the first great blow which was given to <hi>Calvinism,</hi> so was it followed not long after, by the King's <hi>Instructions touching Preaching and Preachers.</hi> In which it was precisely cautioned amongst other things, <hi>That no Preacher, of what Title<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> soever, under the Degree of a Bishop, or Dean at the least, should from thenceforth presume to preach in any popular Auditory, the deep points of Predestination, Election, Reprobation, or of the Vniversality, Efficacity, Resistibility, or Irresistibility, of God's Grace; but should rather leave those Theams to be handled by Learned men; as being fitter for Schools and Vniversities, than for simple Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditories.</hi> Which said Instructions bearing date at <hi>Windsor,</hi> on the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> 1622, opened the way to the suppression of that heat and fierceness by which the <hi>Calvinists</hi> had been acted in some years fore-going.</p>
            <p n="29">29. During which Heats and Agitations between the Parties, a Plot was set on foot to subvert the Church, in the undoing of the Clergy; and there could be no readier way to undo the Clergy, than to reduce them unto such a Beggerly Competency (for by that name they love to call it) as they had brought them to in all the rest of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> or <hi>Genevian</hi> Churches. This the design of many hands, by whom all passages had been scored in <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Library, which either did relate to the point of Tythes, or the manner of payment. But the Collections being brought together, and the Work compleated, there appeared no other Name before it, than that of <hi>Selden,</hi> then of great Credit in the World for his known Abilities in the retired Walks of Learning. <hi>The History of Tythes</hi> writ by such an Author, could not but raise much expectation amongst some of the Laity, who for a long time had gaped after the Church's Patrimony, and now conceived and hoped to swallow it down without any chewing. The Author highly magnified, the Book held unanswerable, and all the Clergy looked on but as Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to that great <hi>Goliah,</hi> who in his Preface had reproached them with <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Laziness</hi>; upbraided them with having nothing to keep up their Credit, but <hi>Beard, Title,</hi> and <hi>Habit</hi>; and that their studies reached no further than the <hi>Breviary,</hi> the <hi>Postills,</hi> and the <hi>Polyanthea.</hi> Provoked wherewith, he was so galled by <hi>Tillesly,</hi> so gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Mountague,</hi> and stung by <hi>Netles</hi>; that he never came off in any of his Undertakings, with more loss of Credit. By which he found, that some of the <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Lazy</hi> Clergy, were of as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired Studies as himself; and could not only match, but over-match him too, in his own Philology. But the chief Governours of the Church went a shorter way, and not expecting till the Book was answered by particular men, resolved to seek for reparation of the wrong, from the Author himself, upon an Information to be brought against him in the High Commission. Fearing the issue of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and understanding what displeasures were conceived against him by the King and the Bishops, he made his personal appearance in the open Court at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> on the 28<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1618;

But it is now high time for us to cross over St. <hi>George</hi>'s Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and take a short view of the poor and weak Estate of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where these Designs were carried on with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fortune. A Church which for the most part had been modelled by the Reformation which was made in <hi>England.</hi> But lying at a greater distance, and more out of sight, it was more easily made a prey to all Invaders; the <hi>Papists</hi> prevailing on the one side, and the <hi>Puritans</hi> on the other, getting so much ground, that the poor <hi>Protestants</hi> seemed to be crucified in the midst between them. Some Order had been taken for establishing the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy, together with the Bible in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, in all the Churches of that Kingdom: which not being understood by the natural <hi>Irish,</hi> left them as much in Ignorance and Superstition, as in the darkest times of the Papal Tyranny. And for the Churches of the Pale, which very well understood the <hi>English</hi> Language, they suffered themselves to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the Rules of the Church, and yeelded to the prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of those zealous Ministers who carried on the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Project with their utmost power. In order whereunto, it was held necessary to expose the Patrimony of the Bishops and Cathedral Churches, to a publick Port-sale; that being as much weakned in their Power as they were in Estate, they might be rendred inconsiderable in the eyes of the people. Hence-forward such a general devastation of the Lands of the Church, that some Episcopal-Sees were never since able to maintain a Bishop, but have been added to some others; two or three, for failing, to make up somewhat like a Competency for an <hi>Irish</hi> Prelate. The Bishoprick of <hi>Ardagh</hi> was thereupon united unto that of <hi>Kill more</hi>; but the Cathedral of the one, together with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's House adjoyning to it, had been levelled with the very ground:
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:54836:228"/>
the other in some better repair; but neither furnished with Bell, Font, or Chalice. The like union had been also made between the Bishopricks of <hi>Clonfert</hi> and <hi>Killmare, Ossery</hi> and <hi>Kilkenny, Down</hi> and <hi>Connour, Waterford</hi> and <hi>Lismore, Cork</hi> and <hi>Rosse,</hi> &amp;c. and was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the late Lord Primate, between the See of <hi>Kilfanore,</hi> and that of <hi>Killallow</hi>: not to descend any more particulars of the like Conjunctions.</p>
            <p n="31">31. Such also were the Fortunes of the Rural Clergy, whose Churches in some places lay unrooted, in others unrepaired, and much out of order. The Tythes annexed, for the most part, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions Houses, fell (by the ruin of those Houses) to the Power of the Crown, and by the Kings and Queens of <hi>England,</hi> were alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the Church, and by them became Lay-Fees. The Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridges generally so ill provided, that in the whole Province of <hi>Connaught,</hi> most of the Vicars Pensions came but to forty shillings <hi>per annum,</hi> and in some places but sixteen only. And of such Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridges as appeared to be better endowed, three, four, or five, were many times ingrossed into one man's hands, who neither understood the Language, nor performed the Service. In which respect it was no marvel if the people took up that Religion which came next to hand, such as did either serve most fitly to continue them in their former Errors, or to secure them in the quiet enjoyment of those Estates which they had ravished from the Church, and still possessed by the Title of the first Usurpers. In which estate we find the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at the death of the Queen, not much improved, in case it were not made more miserable. In the time of K. <hi>IAMES,</hi> some Propositions had been offered by Him in the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> about sending Preachers into <hi>Ireland,</hi> of which he was but half King, as himself complained, their Bodies being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto his Authority, but their Souls and Consciences to the Pope. But I find nothing done in pursuance of it, till after the year 1607, where the Earl of <hi>Ter-ownen, Ter-connel,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Odaghartie,</hi> and other great Lords of the North, together with their Wives and Families, took their flight from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and left their whole Estates to the King's disposing. Hereupon followed the Plantation of <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> first undertaken by the City of <hi>London,</hi> who fortified <hi>Colraine,</hi> and built <hi>London-Derrie,</hi> and purchased many thousand Acres of Lands in the parts adjoyning. But it was carried on more vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as more unfortunately withall, by some Adventurers of the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Nation, who poured themselves into this Countrey as the richer Soil: And though they were sufficiently industrious in improving their own Fortunes there, and set up Preaching in all Churches wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they fixed; yet, whether it happened for the better, or for the worse, the event hath showed: For they brought with them hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such a stock of <hi>Puritanism,</hi> such a contempt of Bishops, such a neglect of the publick Liturgy, and other Divine Offices of this Church, that there was nothing less to be found amongst them, than the Government and Forms of Worship established in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

Nor did the Doctrine speed much better, if it sped not worse: For <hi>Calvinism</hi> by degrees had taken such deep root amongst them, that at the last it was received and countenanced as the only Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which was to be defended in the Church of <hi>Ireland.</hi> For, not contented with the <hi>Articles</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they were resolved to frame a <hi>Confession</hi> of their own; the drawing up where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was referred to Dr. <hi>Iames Vsher,</hi> then Provost of the Colledg of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and afterwards Arce-bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of <hi>Ireland.</hi> By whom the Book was so contrived, that all the <hi>Sabbatarian</hi> and <hi>Calvinian</hi> Rigors were declared therein to be the Doctrines of that Church. For first, the Articles of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected at the <hi>Conference</hi> at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> must be inserted into this <hi>Confession,</hi> as the chief parts of it. And secondly, An Article must be made of purpose to justifie the Morality of the Lord's-day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and to require the spending of it wholly in Religious Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Besides which deviations from the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> most grievous Torments immediately in His Soul, are there affirmed to be endured by Christ our Saviour, which <hi>Calvin</hi> makes to be the same with his descent into Hell. The Abstinencies from eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flesh upon certain days, declared not to be Religious Fasts, but to be grounded upon Politick Ends and Considerations: All Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters adjudged to be lawfully called, who are called unto the work of the Ministry by those that have publick Authority given them in the Church (but whether they be Bishops, or not, it makes no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so they be authorized unto it by their several Churches). The Sacerdotal Power of Absolution, made <hi>declarative</hi> only; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, quite subverted. No Power ascribed to the Church in making Canons, or Censuring any of those who either carelesly or maliciously do infringe the same. The Pope made Antichrist, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the like determination of the <hi>French Hugonots</hi> at <hi>Gappe</hi> in <hi>Daulphine.</hi> And finally, Such a silence concerning the Consecration of Arch-bishops and Bishops (expresly justified and avowed in the <hi>English</hi> Book), as if they were not a distinct Order from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Presbyters. All which, being <hi>Vsher</hi>'s own private Opinions, were dispersed in several places of the Articles for the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi>; approved of in the Convocation of the year 1615: and finally, confirmed by the Lord Deputy <hi>Chichester,</hi> in the Name of King <hi>IAMES.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="33">33. What might induce King <hi>IAMES</hi> to confirm these Articles, differing in so many points from his own Opinion, is not clearly known: but it is probable, that he might be drawn to it on these following grounds: For first, He was much governed at that time, in all Church-concernments, by Dr. <hi>George Abbot,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; and Dr. <hi>Iames Mountague,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi>: who having formerly engaged in maintenance of some or most of those Opinions, as before is said, might find it no hard matter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the King to a like approbation of them. And secondly, The King had so far declared himself in the Cause against <hi>Vorstius,</hi> and so affectionately had espoused the Quarrel of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:54836:229"/>
against those of the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> Party in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, that he could not handsomely refuse to confirm those Doctrines in the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which he had countenanced in <hi>Holland.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The <hi>Irish</hi> Nation at that time were most tenaciously addicted to the Errors and Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore must be bended to the other Extream, before they could be straight and Orthodox in these points of Doctrine. Fourthly, and finally, It was an usual practise with that King, in the whole course of His Government, to balance one Extream by the other; countenancing the <hi>Papists</hi> against the <hi>Puritans,</hi> and the <hi>Puritans</hi> against the <hi>Papists</hi>; that betwixt both, the true Religion, and Professors of it, might be kept in safety. But whether I hit right, or not, certain it is, that it proved a matter of sad consequence to the Church of <hi>England</hi>; there being nothing more ordinary amongst those of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Party, when they were pressed in any of the points aforesaid, then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal unto the Articles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the infallible Judgment of K. <hi>IAMES,</hi> who confirmed the same. And so it stood until the year 1634, when by the Power of the Lord Deputy <hi>Wentworth,</hi> and the Dexterity of Dr. <hi>Iohn Bramhall,</hi> then Lord Bishop of <hi>Derry,</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> Articles were repealed in a full Convocation, and those of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> authorised in the place thereof.</p>

Pass we next over to the Isles of <hi>Iersey</hi> and <hi>Guernsey,</hi> where the <hi>Genevian</hi> Discipline had been setled under Queen <hi>ELIZABETH</hi>; and being so setled by that Queen, was confirmed by K. <hi>IAMES</hi> at his first coming to this Crown; though at the same time he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured a subversion of it in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But being to do it by degrees, and so to practise the restoring of the old <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> as not to threaten a destruction to their new <hi>Presbyteries</hi>; it was thought fit to tolerate that Form of Government in those petit Islands, which could have no great influence upon either Kingdom.

But long they were not suffered to enjoy the benefit of this Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For sir <hi>Iohn Peiton,</hi> who succeeded Governour of <hi>Iersey</hi> in the place of <hi>Raleigh,</hi> had of himself no good affections to that Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and possibly might be furnished with some secret Instructions for altering it in the Island on the first conveniency.<note place="margin">1603.</note> The ground whereof was laid upon this occasion: The Curate of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s being lately dead, it pleased the <hi>Colloquie</hi> of that Island, according to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer method, to appoint one <hi>Brevin</hi> to succeed him. Against this course, the Governour, the King's Attorney, and other the Officers of the Crown, protested publickly, as being prejudicial to the Rights and Profits of the King. Howbeit, the Case was over-ruled, and the <hi>Colloquie</hi> for that time carried it. Hereupon a Bill of Articles was exhibited to the Lords of the Council, against the Ministers of that Island, by <hi>Peiton</hi> the Governour, <hi>Marret</hi> the Attorney, and the rest; as, viz. <hi>That they had usurped the Patronage of all Benefices in the Island: That thereby they admitted men to Livings without any Form or Presentation; and by that means deprived his Majesty of Vacancies and First-fruits. That by the connivance</hi> (to say no worse of it) <hi>of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Governours, they exercised a kind of Arbitrary Iurisdiction, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and disannulling Laws at their own most uncertain pleasure.</hi> In consideration whereof, they humbly pray His Sacred Majesty to grant them such a Discipline as might be fittest to the nature of the Place, and less derogatory to the Royal Prerogative.</p>
            <p n="37">37. In the pursuance of this Project, Sir <hi>Robert Gardiner,</hi> once Chief Justice of <hi>Ireland</hi>; and <hi>Iames Husley,</hi> Dr. of the Laws, are sent Commissioners unto that Island, though not without the colour of some other business. To these Commissioners the Ministers give in their Answer, which may be generally reduced to these two heads: First, That their appointment of men into the Ministry, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Jurisdiction, being principal parts of the Church-Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, had been confirmed unto them by His Sacred Majesty. And secondly, That the payment of First-fruits and Tenths, had never been exacted from them since they were freed from their subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Bishops <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> giving no just satisfaction unto the Council of <hi>England,</hi> and nothing being done in order to a present Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a foul deformity both of Confusion and Distraction, did sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly overgrow the face of those wretched Churches. For in the former times, all such as took upon them any publick Charge either in Church or Common-wealth, had bound themselves by Oath to cherish and maintain the Discipline: That Oath is now disclaimed as dangerous and unwarrantable. Before, it was their custom to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act subscription to their Plat-form, of all such as purposed to receive
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:54836:230"/>
the Sacrament: but now the King's Attorney, and others of that Party, chose rather to abstain from the Communion, than to yeeld Subscription. Nay, even the very <hi>Elders,</hi> silly souls, that thought themselves as <hi>sacro sancti</hi> as a <hi>Roman Tribune,</hi> were drawn with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess into the Civil Courts, and there reputed with the Vulgar. Nor was the Case much better in the <hi>Sacred Consistory</hi>; the Jurates in their <hi>Cohu,</hi> or Town-Hall, relieving such by their Authority, whom that (once <hi>paramount</hi>) Tribunal had condemned or censured. And yet this was not all the Mischief which befel them neither: Those of the lower rank seeing the Ministers begin to stagger in their Chairs, refused to set out their Tythes; and if the Curates mean to exact their Dues, the Law is open to all comers, to try their Title. Their Benefices, which before were accounted as exempt and priviledged, are now brought to reckon for First-fruits and Tenths; and that not according to the Book of <hi>Constance</hi> (as they had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly), but by the will and pleasure of the present Governour. And, to make up the total sum of their Mis-fortunes, one of the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles preferrs a Bill against them in the common <hi>Cohu,</hi> in which they were accused of Hypocrisie in their Conversation, and Tyranny in the Exercise of their Jurisdiction: and finally, of holding some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret practises against the Governour, which consequentially did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the King Himself.</p>
            <p n="38">38. In this Confusion they address themselves to the Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1612.</note> then being Lord Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> and in great credit with King <hi>IAMES</hi>; who seeming very much pleased with their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, advised them to invite their Brethren of the Isle of <hi>Guern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,</hi> to joyn with them in a Petition to the King, for a redress of those Grievances which they then complained of. A Counsel which then seemed rational, and of great respect; but in it self of greater cunning than it seemed in the first appearance. For by this means (as certainly he was a man of a subtile Wit) he gave the King more time to compass his Designs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> before he should declare himself in the present business; and, by engaging those of <hi>Guernsey</hi> in the same desires, intended to subject them also to the same conclusion. But this Counsel taking no effect by reason of the death of the Councellor,<note place="margin">1615.</note> they fall into another trouble of their own creating. The Parish of St. <hi>Peters</hi> falling void by the death of the Minister, the Governour presents unto it one <hi>Aaron Messering,</hi> one that had spent his time in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and had received the Order of Priesthood from the Right Reverend Dr. <hi>Bridges,</hi> then Bishop of that Diocess, but of himself a Native of the Isle of <hi>Iersey.</hi> A thing so infinitely stomacked by those of the <hi>Colloquy,</hi> that they would by no means yeeld unto his admission; not so much in regard of his presentation by the Power of the Governour, as because he had taken Orders from the hands of a Bishop: For now they thought that Popery began to break in upon them, and therefore that it did concern them to oppose it to the very last. A new Complaint is hereupon preferred against them to the Lords of the Council; in which their Lordships were informed, That the Inhabitants generally of the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:54836:231"/>
Isle were discontented with the present Discipline and guidance of the Church, that most of them would be easily perswaded to submit to the <hi>English</hi> Goverment, and that many of them did desire it.</p>
            <p n="39">
               <note place="margin">1618.</note>39. This brings both Parties to the Court; the Governour and his Adherents, to prosecute the Suit, and make good their Intelligence; the Ministers to answer to the Complaint, and stand to the Pleasure of His Majesty in the final Judgment. And at the first, the Ministers stood fast together: but as it always happeneth, that there is no Confederacy so well jointed, but one Member of it may be severed from the rest, and thereby the whole Practise overthrown: so was it also in this business. For those who there sollicited some private business of the Governour's, had kindly wrought upon the weakness and ambition of <hi>De la Place,</hi> (one of the Ministers appointed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Service) perswading him, That if the Government were altered, and the Dean restored, he was infallibly resolved on to be the man. Being fashioned into this hope, he speedily betrayed the Counsels of his Fellows, and furnished their Opponents at all their Interviews, with such Intelligence as might make most for their advantage. At last the Ministers not well agreeing in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and having little to say in defence of their proper Cause, whereunto their Answers were not provided before-hand; my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> at the Council Table, thus declared unto them the Pleasure of the King and Council, <hi>viz. That for the speedy redress of their disorders, it was reputed most convenient to establish amongst them the Authority and Office of the Dean. That the Book of Common-Prayer being again Printed in the</hi> French, <hi>should be received into their Churches; but the Ministers not tyed to the strict observance of it in all particulars. That</hi> Messervy <hi>should be admitted to his Benefice, and that so they might return to their several Charges.</hi> This said, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to depart, and to signifie to those from whom they came, the full scope of His Majesty's Resolution, and so they did. But being somewhat backward in obeying this Decree, the Council intimated to them by Sir <hi>Philip de Carteret,</hi> chief Agent for the Governour and Estates of the Island. That the Ministers from among themselves should make choice of three Learned and Grave persons, whose Names they should return unto the Board, out of which His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty should resolve on one to be their Dean.</p>
            <p n="40">
               <note place="margin">1619.</note>40. But this Proposal little edified amongst the Brethren; not so much out of any dislike of the alteration, with which they seemed all well enough contented; but because every one of them gave himself some hopes of being the man: And being that all of them could not be elected, they were not willing to destroy their particular hopes, by the appointment of another. In the mean time, Mr. <hi>David Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinell,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> born, then being Minister of St. <hi>Mary's,</hi> under pretence of other business of his own, is dispatched for <hi>England,</hi> and recommended by the Governour as the fittest person for that Place and Dignity. And being well approved of by the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who found him answerable in all points to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's Character, he was established in the Place by his Majesty's
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:54836:231"/>
Letters Patents bearing date <hi>Anno</hi> 1619, and was accordingly invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all such Rights as formerly had been inherent in that Office, whether it were in point of Profit, or of Jurisdiction. And for the executing of this Office, some Articles were drawn and ratified by His Sacred Majesty, to be in force until a certain Body of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Canons should be digested and confirmed: Which Articles he was pleased to call the <hi>Interim,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1620.</note> (a Name devised by <hi>CHARLES</hi> the fifth, on the like occasion) as appears by His Majesty's Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents, for confirmation of the Canons, not long after made. And by this <hi>Interim</hi> it was permitted for the present, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters should not be obliged to bid the Holy-days, to use the Cross in Baptism, or to wear the Surplice, or not to give the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper unto any others but such as did receive it kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but in all other things, it little differed from the Book of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; which being first drawn up by the Dean and Ministers, was afterwards carefully perused, corrected, and accommodated for the use of that Island, by the Right Reverend Fathers in God, <hi>George,</hi> Lord Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury; Iohn,</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi>; and <hi>Lancelot,</hi> Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> whose Diocess or Jurisdiction did extend over both the Islands. In which respect it was appointed in the Letters Patents (by which His Majesty confirmed these Canons,<note place="margin">1623.</note> 
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1623), That the said Reverend Father in God, the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> should forthwith by his Commission under his Episcopal Seal, as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary of the place, give Authority unto the said Dean to exercise Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in the said Isle, according to the Canons and Constitutions thus made and established. Such were the Means, and such the Counsels, by which this Island was reduced to a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

During which time, the Ministers were much heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their Inconformity, by the Practises of <hi>De la Place,</hi> before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred: Who stomacking his disappointment in the loss of the Deanry, abandoned his Native Countrey, and retired unto <hi>Guernsey,</hi> where he breathed nothing but disgrace to the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy, the Person of the new Dean, and the change of the Government. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the first, so perversly opposite, that when some Forces were sent over by King <hi>CHARLES</hi> for defence of the Island, he would not suffer them to have the use of the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy in the Church of St. <hi>Peter's,</hi> being the principal of that Island, but upon these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; that is to say, <hi>That they should neither use the Liturgy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, nor receive the Sacrament.</hi> And secondly, <hi>Whereas there was a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture weekly, every</hi> Thursday, <hi>in the said Church of St.</hi> Peters, <hi>when once the Feast of</hi> Christ's Nativity <hi>fell upon that day, he rather chose to disappoint the Hearers, and put off the Sermon, than that the least ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour should reflect on that ancient Festival.</hi> An Opposition far more superstitious, than any observation of a day, though meerly <hi>Iewish.</hi>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:54836:232"/>
By his Example others were encouraged to the like perversness, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that they refused to baptize any Child or Children, though weak, and in apparent danger of present death, but such as were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto them on the day of Preaching: And when some of them were compelled by the Civil Magistrate to perform their duty in this kind, a great Complaint thereof was made to the Earl of <hi>Darby,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then Governour of that Island, as if the Magistrate had intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Minister's Office, and took upon them the administration of the blessed Sacraments. Of these particulars, and many others of that nature, intelligence was given to the late Arch-bishop, Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> who had proceeded thereupon to a Reformation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1637, if the Distraction then arising in the <hi>Realm</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had not enforced him to a discontinuance of that Resolution.</p>

This forced the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> Party to put themselves under the protection of <hi>Iohn Olden Barnevelt,</hi> an <hi>Hollander</hi> by birth, and one of the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men of all that Nation; who fearing that the Prince of <hi>Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nge</hi> had some secret purpose to make Himself absolute Lord of those Estates, received them very cheerfully into his protection, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of raising a strong Party by them to oppose the Prince. This draws K. <hi>IAMES</hi> into the Quarrel; who being displeased with the Election of <hi>Conradus Vorstius,</hi> to a Divinity-Reader's Place in the Schools of <hi>Leiden,</hi> and not so readily gratified by the Estates in the choice of another; published a Declaration against this <hi>Vorstius,</hi> and therein falls exceeding foul upon <hi>Iames Van Harmine,</hi> and all that followed his Opinions in the present Controversies. Which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, <hi>Barnevelt</hi> gains an Edict from the States of <hi>Holland, Anno</hi> 1613,<note place="margin">1613.</note> by which a mutual Toleration was indulged to either Party, more to the benefit of the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> than the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the others. An Edict highly magnified by the Learned <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> in his <hi>Pietas Ordinum,</hi> &amp;c. Against which, some Answers were returned by <hi>Bogerman, Sibrandus,</hi> and some others, not without some reflections on the Magistrates for their actings in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This made the breach much wider than it was before; King <hi>IAMES</hi> appearing openly in favour of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; the <hi>Spaniard</hi> secretly fomenting the Designs of <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> as it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards suggested, with what truth I know not. But sure it is, that as K. <hi>IAMES</hi> had formerly aspersed the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> Party, in His Declaration against<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Vorstius,</hi> before remembred; so He continued a most bitter Enemy unto them, till he had brought them at the last to an extermination. But what induced him thereunto, hath been made a question. Some think that he was drawn unto it by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful perswasions of Arch-bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Mountague,</hi> who then much governed his Counsels in all Church-concernments. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers impute it to his Education in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where all the <hi>Heterodoxies</hi> of <hi>Calvin</hi> were received as Gospel; which might incline him the more strongly to those Opinions, which he had suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, as it were, with his Nurse's Milk. Some say, that he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in this business, not so much by the clear light of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, as by a transport of affection to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to whom he had a dear regard, and a secret sympathy. Others more rationally ascribe it unto Reason of State, for the preventing of a dangerous and uncurable Rupture, which otherwise was like to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the State of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> He had then a great Stock go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongst them, in regard of the two Towns of <hi>Brill</hi> and <hi>Vlush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> together with the Fort of <hi>Ramekins,</hi> which had been put into the hands of Queen <hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> for great sums of money. In which regard, the Governour of the Town of <hi>Vlushing,</hi> and the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:54836:233"/>
Ambassador resident for the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> were to have place in all publick Councils which concerned those Provinces; on whose Tranquillity and Power, he placed a great part of the peace and happiness of his own Dominions. He knew that Concord was the strongest Ligament of their Confederation; and looked on the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants</hi> as the breakers of that Bond of Unity which formerly had held them so close together.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Upon this reason he exhorts them in his said Declaration, <hi>To take heed of such infected persons; their own Countrey-men being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready divided into Factions upon this occasion; which was a matter so opposite to Vnity, (the only prop and safety of their State, next under God) as must of necessity, by little and little, bring them to utter ruin, if wisely and in time they did not provide against it.</hi> And on the same reason he concurred in Counsel and Design, with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for the suppressing of that Party which he conceived to be so dangerous to the common Peace; and sending such of his Divines to the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> as were most like to be sufficiently active in their condemnation. For so it hapned, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> being animated by so great a Monarch, suddenly puts himself into the head of his Forces, marches from one strong Town to another, changeth the Garrisons in some, the chief Commanders in the rest, and many of the principal Magistrates in most Towns of <hi>Holland, Vtrecht,</hi> and the rest of those Provinces. Which done, he seizeth on the person of <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> as also on <hi>Grotius,</hi> and <hi>Leidebrogius</hi>; and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims a National Synod to be held at <hi>Dort,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1618.</note> in <hi>November</hi> following; to which the <hi>Calvinists</hi> were invited from all parts of Christendom. And yet not thinking themselves strong enough to suppress their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, they first disabled some of them by Ecclesiastical Censures, from being chosen Members of it. Others who had been lawfully chosen, were not permitted to give suffrage with the rest of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodists, unless they would renounce their Party. And finally, They took such Order with the rest, that they would not suffer them to sit as Judges in the present Controversies, but only to appear before them as Parties Criminal. All which being condescended to, though against all reason, they were restrained to such a method in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation, as carried with it a betraying of their Cause and Interest; and for not yeelding hereunto, they were dismist by <hi>Bogerman</hi> in a most bitter Oration, uttered with fiery eys, and most virulent language.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It might be rationally conceived, that they who did conspire with such unanimity, to condemn their opposites, should not fall out amongst themselves: but so it was, that there was scarce a point in difference between the Parties, wherein they had not very frequent and most fearful bickerings with one another; the Provincials ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times enterfering with the Forreign Divines, and sometimes fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling foul on those of different Judgment, though of the same Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity with them. The <hi>Brittish</hi> Divines, together with one of those that came from <hi>Breme,</hi> maintained an Universality of Redemption of Mankind by the death of Christ. But this by no means would be granted by the rest of the Synod, for fear of yeelding any thing in
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:54836:234"/>
the least degree to the opposite Party. <hi>Martinius,</hi> another of the Divines of <hi>Breme,</hi> declared his dissent from the common Opinion, touching the manner of Christ's being <hi>Fundamentum Electionis</hi>; and that he thought Christ not only to be the Effector of our Election, but also the Author and Procurer of it. But hereupon <hi>Gomarus</hi> flings down his Glove, and openly defies <hi>Martinius</hi> to a Duel, telling the Synod, that he knew <hi>Martinius</hi> was able to say nothing at all in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of that Doctrine. The said <hi>Martinius</hi> had affirmed, That God was <hi>Causa Physica Conversionis</hi>; and for the truth thereof, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed unto <hi>Goclenius,</hi> a Renowned Philosopher, who was then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Synod, and confirmed the same. But presently <hi>Sibrandus Lubbertus</hi> takes fire at this, and falls expresly upon both. And though the Controversie for the present was stilled by <hi>Bogerman</hi>; yet was it revived by <hi>Gomarus</hi> within few days after; who being back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by some of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Divines, behaved himself so rudely and uncivilly against <hi>Martinius,</hi> that he had almost driven him to a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of forsaking their company.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The General Body of the Synod not being able to avoid the Inconveniences which the <hi>Supra-lapsarian</hi> way brought with it, were generally intent on the <hi>Sub-lapsarian.</hi> But on the other side, the Commissioners of the Churches of <hi>South-Holland</hi> thought it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to determine whether God considered man fallen, or not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, while he passed the degrees of Election and Reprobation. But far more positive was <hi>Gomarus,</hi> one of the Four Professors of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> who stood as strongly to the Absolute, Irrespective, and Irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Decree, (exclusive of man's sin, and our Saviour's sufferings) as he could have done for the Holy Trinity. And not being able to draw the rest unto his Opinion, nor willing to conform to theirs, he delivered his own Judgment in writing, apart by it self, not joyning in subscription with the rest of his Brethren, for Conformity sake, as is accustomed in such cases. But <hi>Macrovius,</hi> one of the Professors of <hi>Franekar,</hi> in <hi>West-Friesland,</hi> went beyond them all, contending with great heat and violence, against all the rest, <hi>That God propounds his Word to Reprobates, to no other purpose, but to leave them wholly inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable. That if the Gospel is considered in respect of God's intention, the proper end thereof, and not the accidental<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in regard of Reprobates, is to deprive them totally of all excuse. And finally, That Christ knows all the hearts of men; and therefore only knocketh at the hearts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, not with a mind of entring in (because he knows they cannot open to him if they would); but partly, that he might upbraid them for their impotency; and partly, that he might encrease their damnation by it.</hi> Nor rested the Blasphemer here, but publickly maintained against <hi>Sibrandus Lubbertus,</hi> his Collegue (in the open Synod), <hi>That God wills Sin: That he ordains Sin, as it is Sin.</hi> And, <hi>That by no means he would have all men to be saved.</hi> And more than so, he publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared at all adventures, <hi>That if those points were not maintained, they must forsake the chief Doctors of the Reformation.</hi> Which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were more unseasonably, or more truly spoken, I regard not now. In the agitation of which Points, they suffered themselves to
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:54836:234"/>
be transported into such extremities, that greater noise and tumult hath been seldom heard of in a sober Meeting. Insomuch, that when the Bishop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> to avoid the scandal, put them in mind of Moderation, and to endeavour to retain the Spirit of Unity in the Bond of Peace;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Non agendum hic est in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodo. Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate sed Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Gomarus</hi> snapt him up, and told him, <hi>That matters were not to be carried in Synodicol Meetings, by the Authority of the Person, but the strength of the Argument.</hi> For further proof of which particulars, if more proof be necessary, I shall refer the <hi>English</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to two Books only; that is to say, the <hi>Golden Remains</hi> of Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>; and the <hi>Arcana Anti-Remonstrantium,</hi> by <hi>Tilenus Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior.</hi>

            <p n="6">6. From Consultation and Debate, let us proceed in the next place to Execution, which we find full of Cruelty and accursed Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. The Acts hereof first ratified in the Blood of <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> for whose dispatch they violated all the Fundamental Laws of the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> Liberty; in maintenance whereof, they first pretended to take Arms against the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> their most Rightful Prince. The Party being thus beheaded, it was no hard matter to disperse the whole Trunk or Body: For presently upon the ending of the Synod, the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> are required to subscribe to their own condemnation; and for refusing so to do, they were all banished by a Decree of the States-General, with their Wives and Children, (to the number of Seven hundred Families, or thereabout) and forced to beg their bread, even in desolate places. But yet this was no end of their sorrows neither; they must come under a new <hi>Cross,</hi> and be calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated for holding many horrid Blasphemies, and gross Impieties, which they most abhorred. For in the Continuation of the History of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> writ by one <hi>Crosse,</hi> a Fellow of neither Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor Learning, and so more apt to be abused with a false report; it is there affirmed. (whether with greater Ignorance, or Malice, it is hard to say) <hi>That there was a Synod called at</hi> Dort, <hi>to suppress the</hi> Arminians; <hi>and that the said</hi> Arminians <hi>held, amongst other Heresies, first, That God was the Author of sin. Secondly, That he created the far greater part of Mankind, for no other purpose but only to find cause to damn them.</hi> And to say truth, it had been well for them in respect of their Temporal Fortunes, had they taught those Heresies, for then they might have sped no worse than <hi>Macrovius</hi> did, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all his Heterodoxies, and most horrid Blasphemies, was only looked upon as one of their <hi>Erring-Brethren</hi>; subjected to no other Censure, but an Admonition to forbear all such Forms of Speech as might give any just offence <hi>to tender Ears,</hi> and could not be <hi>digested by persons ignorant and uncapable of so great Mysteries.</hi> As on the other side it is reported of <hi>Franciscus Auratus,</hi> a right Learned man, and one of the Professors for Divinity in the Schools of <hi>Sedan,</hi> (a Town and Seignury belonging to the Dukes of <hi>Bouil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But possibly it may be said, That these Oppressions, Tyrannies, and Partialities, are not to be ascribed to the Sect of <hi>Calvin,</hi> in the capacity of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> but of <hi>Predestinarians</hi>; and therefore we will now see what they acted in behalf of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> which was as dear to all the Members of that Synod, but the <hi>English</hi> only, as any of the Five Points, whatsoever it was: For in the Hundred forty fifth Session, being held on the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> the <hi>Belgick</hi> Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was brought in to be subscribed by the Provincials, and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved by the Forreign Divines: In which Confession there occurred one Article which tended plainly to the derogation and dishonour of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For in the Thirty one Article, it is said expresly, <hi>That forasmuch as doth concern the Ministers of the Church of Christ, in what place soever, they are all of equal</hi>

               <hi>Power and Authority with one another, as being all of them the Ministers of Iesus Christ, who is the only Vniversal Bishop, and sole Head of His Church.</hi> Which Article being as agreeable to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgment in point of Discipline, as their Determinations were to his Opinion in point of Doctrine; was very cheerfully entertained by the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Divines, though found in few of the Confessions of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Churches. But being found directly opposite to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church by Arch-bishops and Bishops, with which a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Ministers can have no consistence, was cordially opposed by the Divines of the <hi>British</hi> Colledg, but most especially by Dr. <hi>George Carlton,</hi> then Lord Bishop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> and afterwards tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated to the See of <hi>Chichester</hi>; who having too much debased him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self beneath his Calling, in being present in a Synod or Synodical Meeting, in which an ordinary Presbyter was to take the Chair, and have precedency before him, thought it high time to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and the Church of <hi>England</hi>; to enter a Legal Protestation against those proceedings. Which though it was admitted, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps recorded, received no other Answer but neglect, if not scorn withall. Concerning which, he published a Declaration after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, in these words ensuing.</p>

I showed, that by Christ a Parity was never instituted in the Church: that he ordained Twelve Apostles, as also Seventy Disciples: that the Authority of the Twelve was above the other: that the Church preserved this Order left by our Saviour. And therefore, when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Power of the Apostles ceased; yet this ordinary Authority continued in Bishops, who succeeded them, who were by the Apostles left in the Government of the Church, to ordain Ministers, and to see that they who were so ordained, should preach no other Doctrine: that in an inferior degree, the Ministers were governed by Bishops, who succeeded the Seventy Disciples: that this Order hath been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Church from the times of the Apostles; and herein I

            <p n="9">9. His Lordship adds, that in a Conference which he had with some Divines of that Synod, he told them, <hi>That the cause of all their troubles, was because they had no Bishops amongst them, who by their Authority might repress turbulent spirits, that broached Novelty, every man having liberty to speak or write what they list; and that as long as there were no Ecclesiastical men in Authority to repress and censure such contentious Spirits, their Church could never be without trouble.</hi> To which they answered, That they did much honour and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the good Order and Discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and with all their hearts would be glad to have it established amongst them; but that could not be hoped for in their State: that their hope was, That seeing they could not do what they desired, God would be merciful to them, if they did what they could. This was, saith he, the sum and substance of their Answer, which he conceived to be enough to free that people from aiming at an <hi>Anarchy,</hi> and open-Confusion; adding withall, that they groaned under the weight of that burden, and would be eased of it if they could. But by his Lordship's leave, I take this to be nothing but a piece of dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such a sanctified Hypocrisie as some of the <hi>Calvinians</hi> do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to be in Almighty God: For certainly they might have Bishops if they would, as well as the Popish Cantons of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> or the State of <hi>Venice</hi>; of which, the one is subject to an <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> the other to a Government no less popular than that of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</hi> In which respect it was conceived more lawful, by the late Lord Primate, for any <hi>English</hi> Protestant to communicate with the Reformed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> who cannot have Bishops if they would; than with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who will not have Bishops, though they may; there still remaining in their hands Seven Episcopal Sees, with all the Honours and Revenues belonging to them; that is to say, the Bishoprick of <hi>Harlem</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> of <hi>Middlebourgh</hi> in <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of <hi>Lewarden</hi> in <hi>Friesland,</hi> of <hi>Groining</hi> in the Province so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, of <hi>Deventer</hi> in the County of <hi>Overyssell,</hi> and of <hi>Ruremond</hi> in the Dutchy of <hi>Gueldress</hi>; all of them, but the last, subordinate to the Church of <hi>Vtrect,</hi> which they keep also in their Power.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Somewhat was also done in the present Synod, in order to the better keeping of the Lord's Day, than it had been formerly: For till this time they had their Faires and Markets upon this day, their <hi>Kirk-masses,</hi> as they commonly called them: Which, as they constantly kept in most of the great Towns of <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> &amp;c. even in <hi>Dort</hi> it self; so by the constant keeping of them, they must needs draw away much people from the Morning-Service, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:54836:236"/>
the business of their Trades. And in the Afternoon (as before was noted) all Divine Offices were interdicted by a Constitution, which received life here, <hi>Anno</hi> 1574, that time being wholly left to be disposed of as the people pleased, either upon their profit, or their recreation. But their acquaintance with the <hi>English,</hi> brought them to more sense of Piety. And now they took the opportunity to train the people to the Church in the Afternoon by the Authority and Reputation of the present Synod: For, having entertained the <hi>Palatine Catechism</hi> in their publick Schools, it was resolved that it should be taught in all their Churches on <hi>Sunday</hi> in the After-noon: That the Ministers should be bound to read and expound that Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, though none were present at the Exercises, but those of their own Families, only in hope that others might be drawn after their example; and that the Civil Magistrate should be employed by the Synod to restrain all Servile Works, and other Prophanations of that day, wherewith the Afternoons had commonly been spent, that so the people might repair to the Catechisings. And though some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation did ensue upon it in the greater Towns; yet in their lesser Villages (where men are more intent on their Worldly businesses) it remains as formerly.</p>
            <p n="11">11. As little of the <hi>Sabbatarian,</hi> had the <hi>Palatine</hi> Churches, which in all points adhered tenaciously unto <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Doctrine: For in those Churches it was ordinary for the Gentlemen to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the After-noon of the Lord's Day, unto <hi>Hawking</hi> and <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as the season of the year was fit for either; or otherwise, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Air, visiting their Friends, or whatsoever else shall seem pleasing unto them. As usual it was also with the Husband-man, to spend the greatest part of the After-noon in looking over his Grounds, ordering his Cattel, and following of such Recreations as are most agreeable to his Nature and Education: no publick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Offices being prescribed for any part of that Day, but the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only. And so it stood in the year 1612:<note place="margin">1612.</note> At what time the Lady <hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> Daughter to K. <hi>Iames,</hi> and Wife to <hi>Frederick</hi> the fifth, Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> came first into that Countrey; whose having Divine Service every After-noon in her Chappel, or Closet, officiated by her own Chaplains, according to the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> gave the first hint unto that Prince to cause the like Religious Offices to be celebrated in his part of the Family; afterwards, by degrees, in all the Churches of <hi>Heldenbourgh</hi>; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, in most other Cities and Towns of his Dominions. Had he adventured no further on the confidence of that Power and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which accrued to him by contracting an Alliance with so great a Monarch, it had been happy for himself and the Peace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom. But being tempted by <hi>Scultetus,</hi> and some other of the Divines about him, Not to neglect the opportunity of advancing the Gospel, and making himself the principal Patton of it, he fell on some Designs destructive to himself and his. Who, though he were a Prince of a Flegmatick nature, and of small Activity; yet being prest by the continual sollicitation of some eager Spirits, he
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:54836:236"/>
drew all the Provinces and Princes which profest the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, to enter into a strict League or Union amongst themselves, under pretence of looking to the Peace and Happiness of the true Religion.</p>
            <p n="12">12. It much advantaged the Design, that the <hi>Calvinians</hi> in all parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> had began to stir, as men resolved to keep the Saddle, or to lose the Horse. In <hi>Aix,</hi> (the <hi>Latins</hi> call it <hi>Aquisgranum</hi>) an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial City, they first appeared considerable for their Power and Numbers, <hi>Anno</hi> 1605, at what time they shrewdly shaked the Estate thereof. But being thereupon debarred the exercise of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and punished for the Misdemeanor, they kept themselves qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et till the year 1614; when in a popular Tumult they surprise the City, secure the principal Magistrates of it, and eject the Jesuits. And though by the Mediation of the <hi>French</hi> Agents, and those of <hi>Iulier</hi>'s, a Peace was for the present clapt up between them; yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party was resolved to stand longer to it, than might serve their turns. But whosoever made the reckoning, the <hi>Calvinists</hi> were at last compelled to pay the shot: For the Town being proscribed by <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> the Emperor, and the execution of the <hi>Ban</hi> committed to Arch-Duke <hi>Albert</hi>; he sends the Marquess of <hi>Spinola</hi> with an Army thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by whom the Town is brought to a surrender, the ancient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates restored, and the <hi>Calvinians</hi> either forced to forsake the place, or to submit themselves unto Fine and Ransome, if they kept their dwellings. Nor did they speed much better in the City of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> where their Party was not strong enough to suppress the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; and therefore they forsook the City, and retired to <hi>Mulleime,</hi> which they began to build and fortifie for their habitation. But those of <hi>Colen</hi> fearing that this new Town might in short time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top that City both in Wealth and Power, addrest themselves unto the Emperor <hi>Matthias</hi>: By whose Command the Duke of <hi>Newbourgh</hi> falls upon it, destroys the greatest part thereof, and leaves the finishing of that Work to the Marquess <hi>Spinola.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. In <hi>Hassia</hi> their Affairs succeeded with more prosperous For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, where <hi>Lodowick,</hi> of the second House of the <hi>Lantgraves,</hi> who had the City of <hi>Marperge</hi> for his Seat and Residence, declared himself in favour of their Forms and Doctrines, at such time as the <hi>Calvinists</hi> of <hi>Aix</hi> (before remembred) first began to stirr, followed therein by <hi>George</hi> his Brother, commonly called the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Darmstad,</hi> from the place of his dwelling; half of which Town belonging to the Patrimony of the Prince Elector, had easily made way for <hi>Calvinism</hi> into all the rest. And though this <hi>Lodowick</hi> was disturbed in his Government or Possession, by his Cousin <hi>Maurice,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Cassells,</hi> from his principal City; who seized upon the Town of <hi>Marperge, Anno</hi> 1612; yet was he shortly after restored to his whole Estate, by the <hi>Palatine</hi>-League, which for the time carried a great sway in those parts of <hi>Germany.</hi> But, of greater consequence were the agitations about <hi>Cleve</hi> and <hi>Gulick,</hi> occasioned by a difference between the Marquess of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourgh,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Newbourgh,</hi> about the partage of the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:54836:237"/>
Patrimony and Estates of the Duke of <hi>Cleve</hi>: For <hi>Iohn-William,</hi> the last Duke of <hi>Cleve,</hi> deceasing without Issue, in the year 1610, left his Estates between the Children of his Sisters; of which the eldest, called <hi>Maria Leonora,</hi> was married to <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi> Duke of <hi>Prussia</hi>; whose Daughter <hi>Ann</hi> being married to <hi>Iohn Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Brandenbough,</hi> was Mother of <hi>George-William,</hi> the young Marquess of <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi> who in her Right pretended to the whole Estate. The like pretence was made by <hi>Wolfgangus Guilielmus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Newbourgh,</hi> descended from the Electoral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the Princes <hi>Palatine,</hi> whose Mother <hi>Magdalen</hi> was the second Sister of the said <hi>Iohn-William.</hi> The first of these Pretenders was wholly of a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Stock; and the other as inclinable to the Sect of <hi>Calvin</hi>; though afterwards, for the better carrying on of their Affairs, they forsook their Parties.</p>
            <p n="14">14. For so it hapned, that the Duke of <hi>Newbourgh</hi> finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self too weak for the House of <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi> put himself under the protection of the Catholick King; who having concluded a Truce of Twelve years with the States United, wanted Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his Army; and, that he might engage that King with the greater confidence, he reconciles himself to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and marries the Lady <hi>Magdalen,</hi> Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the most potent of the <hi>German</hi> Princes of that Religion; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so he established in his own Dominions on the death of his Father. This puts the young Marquess to new Counsels; who thereupon calls in the Forces of the <hi>States Vnited</hi>; the Warr continuing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occasion betwixt them and <hi>Spain,</hi> though the Scene was shifted. And that they might more cordially espouse his Quarrel, he took to Wife the Sister of <hi>Frederick</hi> the fifth, Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> and Neece of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by his youngest Daughter; and consequently, Cousin-German, once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to Count <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> Commander-General of the Forces of the <hi>Sates Vnited,</hi> both by Sea and Land. This kept the Balance eeven between them; the one possessing the Estates of <hi>Cleve</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi>; and the other, the greatest part of <hi>Berge</hi> and <hi>Gulick.</hi> But so it was, that the old Marquess of <hi>Brandenbourgh</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving setled his abode in the Dukedom of <hi>Prussia,</hi> and left the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Marquissate to the Prince his Son; left him withall unto the Plots and Practises of a subtil Lady: Who being throughly instructed in all points of <hi>Calvinism,</hi> and having gotten a great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in her Husband's Affections, prevailed so far upon him in the first year of their Marriage, <hi>Anno</hi> 1614, that he renounced his own Religion, and declared for Her's; which he more cheerfully embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, in hope to arm all the <hi>Calvinians</hi> both of the Higher and the Lower <hi>Germany,</hi> in defence of his Cause, as his Competitor of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh</hi> had armed the <hi>Catholicks</hi> to preserve his Interest.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Being thus resolved, he publisheth an Edict in the Month of <hi>February, Anno</hi> 1615; published in his Father's Name, but only in his own Authority and sole Command, under pretence of pacifying some distempers about Religion; but tending, in good earnest, to
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:54836:237"/>
the plain suppression of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> forms: for, having spent a tedious and impertinent Preamble touching the Animosities fomented in the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches, between the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and those of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Party, he first requires that all unnecessary Disputes be laid aside, that so all grounds of strife and disaffection might be also buried. Which said, he next commands all Ministers within the Marquissate, to preach the Word purely and sincerely, according to the Writings of the holy Prophets and Apostles, the Four Creeds commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived (amongst which the <hi>Te Deum</hi> is to go for one), and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of <hi>Ausberg,</hi> of the last Correction; and that omitting all new glosses and interpretations of idle and ambitious men, affecting a Primacy in the Church, and a Power in the State, they aim at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their Preachings, but the Glory of God, and the Salvation of Mankind. He commands also, That they should abstain from all calumniating of those Churches which either were not subject to their Jurisdiction, nor were not lawfully convicted of the Crime of Heresie; which he resolved not to connive at for the time to come, but to proceed unto the punishment of all those who wilfully should refuse to conform themselves to his Will and Pleasure. After which, giving them some good Counsel for following a more moderate course in their Preachings and Writings, than they had been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to in the times fore-going, and in all points to be obedient to their principal Magistrate; he pulls off the Disguise, and speaks plainly thus.</p>

That ordinary Cups should be made use of for the future, instead of the old Popish Chalice. That the Vestments used in the Mass, should be forborn; no Candles lighted in any of their Churches at noon-day.

Such was the tenour of this Edict; on which I have insisted the more at large, to show the difference between the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Genevian</hi> Churches; and the great correspondence of the first, with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But this <hi>Calvinian</hi> Pill did not work so kindly, as not to stirr more Humours than it could remove. For the <hi>Lutherans</hi> being in possession, would not deliver up their Churches, or desert those Usages to which they had been trained up, and in which they were principled, according to the Rules of their first Reformation. And hereupon some Rupture was like to grow betwixt the young Marquess and his Subjects, if by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of some honest Patriots it had not been closed up in this manner, or to this effect: That the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Forms only should be used in all the Churches of the <hi>Marquissate,</hi> for the contentation of the people; and, that the Marquess should have the exercise of his new Religion, for Himself, his Lady, and those of his Opinion, in their private Chappels.</p>
            <p n="17">17. But the main business of these times, were the Commotions raised in <hi>Transylvania, Hungary, Austria,</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> by those of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Party; which drew all the Provinces of the Empire into such confusions, as have disturbed the Peace thereof to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. For, laying down the true Original thereof, we may please to know, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the younger, Brother of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, succeeding on the death of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, in the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Austria,</hi> and afterwards attaining, by Marriage, to the Crown of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which he was not born to, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to oblige his Subjects in all those Dominions, by a conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance at such Deviations from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by those who adhered to <hi>Luther,</hi> and held themselves to the Confession of <hi>Ausberg</hi>; which afterwards was ratified by Imperial Edict. Followed therein by <hi>Maximilian</hi> the second, who succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in his Estates; and being a mild and gracious Prince, not only showed himself unwilling to challenge any Power over Souls and Consciences, but was pleased to mediate in behalf of his <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Subjects, with the Fathers at <hi>Trent,</hi> amongst whom he incurred the suspition of being a <hi>Lutheran.</hi> But <hi>Rodolphus</hi> the eldest of his Sons, and his next Successor, was of a different temper from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Grandfather, a profest Enemy to all that held not a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he endeavoured to promote
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:54836:238"/>
with such terrible Edicts, as threatned nothing but destruction unto all gain-sayers. He had five Brethren at that time, but none of them the Father of any children; which made him cast his eyes on <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Gratts,</hi> Son of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Gratts,</hi> and Nephew of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperor, before remembred. Who going to <hi>Rome</hi> in the Year of <hi>Iubile, Anno</hi> 1600, obliged himself by Oath to the Pope then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to extirpate all the Protestants out of his Dominions; which upon the instigation of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> he did accordingly, by pillaging and banishing all of the <hi>Augustan Confession,</hi> thorough <hi>Styria, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthia,</hi> and <hi>Carniola,</hi> though they had paid for the Freedom of their Conscience, a great sum of Money.</p>
            <p n="18">18. This so endeared him to <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> that he resolved upon him for his next Successor, and at the present to estate him in the Realm of <hi>Hungary,</hi> as a step unto it. In which Design, as he was seconded by the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> so questionless it had been effected, if <hi>Matthias</hi> the Emperor's Brother, and next Heir, had not countermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, by countenancing those of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> or Reformed Religion, who then began to seem considerable in the eye of that Kingdom. To carry on which <hi>Spanish</hi> Plot to the End desired, the Prelates of <hi>Hungary,</hi> in an Assembly held at <hi>Presburgh, Anno</hi> 1604,<note place="margin">1604.</note> published a Decree without the consent of the Nobility and Estates of the Kingdom, for the burning or perpetual banishment of all such as were of the Reformed Religion. Which having been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Realm of <hi>Poland,</hi> found no great difficulty in crossing the <hi>Carpathian</hi> Mountains, and gaining the like favourable admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in this Kingdom also. Against which Edict of the Bishops, a <hi>Protest</hi> is presently made by the Estates of the Realm, under the Seal of the <hi>Palatine,</hi> the chief Officer of it: By whom it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly affirmed, <hi>That they would with just Arms defend themselves, if they should be questioned for the Cause of Religion.</hi> Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, <hi>Beliojosa</hi> (one of the Emperor's chief Commanders in the Realm of <hi>Hungary</hi>) first got into his hands the strong Town of <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sovia,</hi> standing upon the borders of <hi>Transylvania.</hi> And that being done, he did not only interdict all those of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> from making any uses of them as they had done formerly; but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits them from having Sermons in their private Houses, from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the holy Bible, and from the burying of their dead in hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed places.</p>

Enemy's Ensigns, to the <hi>Visier Bassa,</hi> as a sign of his Victory.

Strengthned wherewith, he makes himself Master of <hi>Cassovia</hi>; in which he changed not only the Religion, but the Civil Government: insomuch that many of those which were addicted to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were presently slain upon the place, and most of the rest turned out of the City, together with the greatest part of the Church-men, the Bishops, and the Emperor's Treasurer. Upon which fortunate Success, a great Party in the <hi>Vpper Hungary</hi> declare in favour of his Cause, violently break open the Religious Houses, compel the Fryers to put themselves into fortified places; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to abandon <hi>Presburgh,</hi> the chief Town of that Kingdom, and to flye for shelter to <hi>Vienna,</hi> as their surest Refuge.</p>

After this, <hi>Basta,</hi> the Lord-General of the Emperor's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, obtained the better of them in some Fortunate Skirmishes, which rather served to prolong, than to end the Warr. For <hi>Botscay</hi> was grown to so great strength, and made such spoil in all places wherever he came, that <hi>Pallas Lippa</hi> his Lieutenant, was found to be possessed at the time of his death, of no fewer than Seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Chains of Gold, and One hundred thousand Ducats in ready money, which he had raked together within less than a year. This Treasure coming into <hi>Botscay</hi>'s hands by the death of <hi>Lippa,</hi> he migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily encreased his Army, with which he took in many strong Towns, and brought in some of the Nobility of the <hi>Vpper Hungary,</hi> sending his Forces into <hi>Styria, Austria,</hi> and <hi>Moravia,</hi> which he spoiled and wasted. Insomuch that the Emperor, being forced to send Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners to him to accord the Differences, could obtain no better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions from him, but, <hi>That Liberty of Conscience, and the free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the Reformed Religion, should be permitted to all those who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the same; and that himself should be estated in the Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of</hi> Transylvania, <hi>for the term of his life.</hi> And though the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror at first refused to yeeld to these hard Conditions; yet in the next year, <hi>Anno</hi> 1606,<note place="margin">1606.</note> upon a second Treaty with the Estates of that Kingdom, it was agreed upon by the Commissioners on both sides, That the free exercise as well of the <hi>Reformed,</hi> as of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi> Religion, should be permitted to all men in the Realm of <hi>Hungary,</hi> as in the time of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Father, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Grandfather, of the present Emperor. Which Articles were more fully ratified in the Pacification made at <hi>Vienna,</hi> on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>September</hi> then next following. In which it was expresly cautioned and capitulated, <hi>That the</hi> Calvinian <hi>Religion should from thenceforth be exercised as freely as either the</hi> Lutheran <hi>or the</hi> Romish.
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:54836:239"/>
In managing which Negation between the Parties, <hi>Matthias</hi> the Arch-Duke, who hitherto had secretly encouraged the <hi>Hungarian Gospellers,</hi> was not only present, but openly gave both countenance and consent unto it.</p>
            <p n="21">21. The gaining of this point, put them upon a hope of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greater, even to the abrogating of all Laws and Ordinances for the burning of Hereticks, and whatsoever else were contrary to their Religion; as also, to the nominating of the <hi>Palatine,</hi> or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officers, and to the making of Confederacies with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Nation. During the agitating of which matters, <hi>Botscay</hi> dyes in <hi>Cassovia</hi>; but leaves his Faction so well formed, that they are able to go on without their Leader. An Assembly of the States of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> is called, by the Emperor, at <hi>Presburgh,</hi> in the middle of <hi>August, Anno</hi> 1607; but nothing done, for want of the presence of Arch-Duke <hi>Matthias,</hi> who was appointed by the Emperor to preside therein. Which hapned also to the like Assembly of Estates of the Dukedom of <hi>Austria,</hi> and of the whole Empire, the next year, at the City of <hi>Ratisbone. Matthias,</hi> in the mean season, had his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs apart: For, at such time as the Assembly of the Estates was held at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> he makes a journey unto <hi>Presburgh,</hi> convocates thither the Estates of <hi>Hungary,</hi> confirms the Pacification made before at <hi>Vienna,</hi> suffers them to confederate with their Neighbours of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi> and makes himself the Head of that Confederation. By vertue whereof, he commands the people of both Countreys to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into Arms,<note place="margin">1608.</note> pretending an Expedition into <hi>Moravia,</hi> but aiming directly against <hi>Prague,</hi> the chief Town of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where the Emperor <hi>RODOLPHVS</hi> then resided: Whom he so terrified with his coming with an Army of Eighteen thousand, that he consented to deliver the Crown of <hi>Hungary</hi> into the hands of <hi>Matthias,</hi> to yeeld unto him the possession of all that Kingdom, and to discharge his Subjects from their former Allegiance; upon condition that the Estates of that Realm should chuse no other King but the said Arch-Duke. Which Agreement being made the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1608, <hi>Matthias</hi> is accordingly Crowned King of <hi>Hungary</hi>; and <hi>Illisachius,</hi> a profest <hi>Calvinian,</hi> and one of the principal Sticklers in these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, is made <hi>Palatine</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="22">22. By this Transaction, the whole Dukedom of <hi>Austria,</hi> and so many of the Provinces subordinate to it, as were not actually posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Arch-Duke <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> are consigned over to <hi>Matthias.</hi> Many Inhabitants whereof, professing the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Forms and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, (which only must be called the Reformed Religion) and building on the late Confederation with the Realm of <hi>Hungary,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed so far upon the patience of their Prince, as to invade some publick Churches for the exercise of it. But they soon found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves deceived: For <hi>Matthias</hi> having somewhat of the States-man in him, and being withall exasperated by the Pope's <hi>Nuncio,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts all such publick Meetings. He had now served his turn in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the possession of the Crown of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and was not willing to connive at those Exorbitances in his <hi>Austrian</hi> Subjects, (over
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:54836:240"/>
whom he challenged a more absolute <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> than over any of the rest) which he had cherished for self-ends in the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary.</hi> The <hi>Austrians,</hi> on the other side, who professed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, refuse to take the Oath of Allegiance to him, if they might not exercise their Religion in as free a manner as the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians</hi> were permitted to do by the Pacification. And thereupon they presently give Order to their Tenants and Vassals, to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into Arms, appoint a general Assembly of the <hi>Protestant</hi> and Reformed States, to be held at <hi>Horn,</hi> and there resolve to extort that by way of Force, which they could not hope to gain by Favour. Some pains was took by <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Arch-Duke, another of the Emperor's Brothers, to accord the difference; who offered them, in the name of the King, to tolerate the free exercise of their Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Cities; and that in the bestowing of the publick Offices, there should be no exception taken at them in regard of their difference in Religion; and withall, gave them many Reasons why such a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Liberty as they desired, could not be granted by the King, with reference to his Honour, Conscience, or particular safety.</p>
            <p n="23">23. But this reasonable Offer did not satisfie the Reformed Party, (for so the <hi>Calvinians</hi> must be called) by whom the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Moravians</hi> are sollicited to associate with them, till they had compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their desires: And upon confidence thereof, refused more obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to take the Oath, than before they did; levying new Forces for the Warr, and quartering them in great numbers round about the City of <hi>Crema,</hi> the chief City of the <hi>Vpper Austria.</hi> But in the end, upon the intervention of the <hi>Moravian</hi> Ambassadors,<note place="margin">1609.</note> the new King was content to yeeld to these Conditions following, viz. <hi>That the Nobility in their Castles or Towns, as also in their City-Houses, should for themselves and their people, have the free exercise of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That the free exercise of Preaching might be used in the three Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of</hi> Iserdorf, Trihelcuincel, <hi>and</hi> Horn. <hi>That the like freedom of Religion might be also exercised in all those Churches in which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the same till the King's late Edict: and, that the Councellors of State, and other publick Officers, should from thenceforth chose promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously out of both Religions.</hi> Upon the granting of which Articles, but not before, they did not only take the Oath of Allegiance, but gave him a Magnificent Reception in the Town of <hi>Lintz</hi>; which hapned on the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1609.</p>
            <p n="24">24. No sooner were the <hi>Austrians</hi> gratified in the point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but the <hi>Bohemians</hi> take their turn to require the like; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which, we are to look a little backward, as far as to the year 1400. About which time, we find a strong Party to be raised amongst them, against some Superstitions and Corruptions in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; occasioned, as some say, by reading the Works of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and by the Diligence of <hi>Piccardus,</hi> a <hi>Flemming</hi> born, as is affirmed by some others, from whom they had the Name of <hi>Piccards</hi>; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly persecuted by their own Kings, and publickly condemned in the Council of <hi>Constance</hi>; they continued constant, notwithstanding, to their own Perswasions: Distinguished also from the rest of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians,</hi>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:54836:240"/>
by the Name of <hi>Calixtins,</hi> from the use of the Chalice; and <hi>Subutraque,</hi> from communicating in <hi>both kinds,</hi> against all opposers. Their Adversaries in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> reproached them by the Name of <hi>Adamites,</hi> and sometimes of <hi>Piccards</hi>; imputing to them many Heterodoxies, and some filthy Obscenities, of which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proved them guilty. In this condition they remained till the preaching of <hi>Luther,</hi> and the receiving of the <hi>Augustin</hi> Confession in most parts of the Empire; which gave them so much confidence, as to purge themselves from all former Calumnies, by publishing a Declaration of their Faith and Doctrine: Which they presented at <hi>Vienna</hi> to the Arch-Duke <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> about ten years before chosen King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> together with a large Apology prefixt before it. By which Confession it appears, that they ascribe no Power to the Civil Magistrate in the Concernments of the Church. That they had fallen upon a way of Ordaining Ministers amongst themselves, without recourse unto the Bishop, or any such Superior Officer, as a Super-intendent. And finally, That they retained the use of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and other Ecclesiastical Censures, for the chastising of irregular and scandalous persons. In which last Point, and almost all the other Branches of the said Confession, though they appeared as sound and Orthodox as any others which had separated from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; yet by their symbolizing with <hi>Geneva</hi> in so many particulars, it was no hard matter for the whole Body of <hi>Calvinianism</hi> to creep in amongst them; the growth whereof inflamed them to such desperate courses as they now pursued.</p>
            <p n="25">25. For this, they laid a good Foundation in the former year,<note place="margin">1609.</note> 1609: when <hi>Matthias</hi> with his great Army was preparing for <hi>Prague,</hi> they found the Emperor in some fear, from which he could not be secured, but by their assistance; and they resolved to husband the conjuncture for their best advantage. In confidence whereof, they propose unto him these Conditions, viz. <hi>That the free exercise of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as well according to the</hi> Bohemian, <hi>as the</hi> Augustin <hi>Confession, might be kept inviolable; and that they which professed the one, should neither scoff or despise the other. That all Arch-bishopricks, Bishopricks, Abbotships, and other Spiritual Preferments, should be given to the</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians <hi>only; and that Ecclesiastical Offices should be permitted to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Ministers as in former times. That it should be lawful for all men in their own Bounds and Territories, to build Churches for their own Religion: and that the Professors and Patrons of the Vniversity of</hi> Prague, <hi>should be joyned to the Consistory as in former times. That all Political Offices should be indifferently permitted unto men of both Religions.</hi> With many other things of like weight and moment, in their Civil Concernments. But the Emperor was not yet reduced to that necessity, as to consent to all at once. He gratified them at the present with a Conformation of their Civil Rights; but put off the Demands which concerned Religion, to the next Assembly of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states; conniving, in the mean time, at the exercise of that Religion which he could not tolerate.</p>
            <p n="26">
               <pb n="418" facs="tcp:54836:241"/>26. But the <hi>Calvinian Calixtins,</hi> or <hi>Confessionists,</hi> call them which you will, perceiving a strong Party of the Catholicks to be made against them, appointed a General Assembly to be holden in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>New Prague,</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> to consult of all such Matters as concerned their Cause, protesting publickly (according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Custom of that kind), That this Assembly, though not called by the Emperor's Authority, aimed at no other End than his <hi>Service</hi> only, and the prosperity of that Kingdom; that both the Emperor and the Kingdom too, might not through the <hi>Perswasions</hi> of his <hi>Evil Councellors,</hi> be brought to extream peril and danger. This done, they send their Letters to the new King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the Prince Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Palatine</hi>; the Dukes of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brunswick,</hi> and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Empire; beseeching them, That by their powerful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession with His Imperial Majesty, they might be suffered to enjoy the exercise of their own Religion, which they affirmed to differ in no material Point from the Confession of <hi>Ausberg.</hi> Following their blow, they first Remonstrate to the Emperor how much they had been disappointed of their hopes and expectations, from one time to another; and, in fine, tells him in plain terms, That they will do their best endeavour for the raising of Arms, to the end they might be able with their utmost power, <hi>to defend him their Soveraign,</hi> together with themselves and the whole Kingdom, against the Practises of their Forreign and Domestick Enemies. According to which Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, they forthwith raised a great number both of Horse and Foot, whom they ranged under good Commanders, and brought them openly into <hi>Prague.</hi> They procured also, that Ambassadors were sent from the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the Estates of <hi>Silesia,</hi> (a Province many years since incorporated with the Realm of <hi>Bohemia</hi>) to intercede in their behalf. This gave the Emperor a fair colour to consent to that, which nothing but extream necessity could have wrested from him.</p>
            <p n="27">27. For thereupon he published his Letters of the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1610, by which it was declared, That all his Subjects communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting under one or both kinds, should live together peaceably and freely, and without wronging or reviling one another, under the pain and penalty of the Law to be inflicted upon them who should do the contrary. That as they who communicated under one kind, enjoyed the exercise of their Religion in all points, throughout the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia</hi>; so they which did communicate under both kinds, should enjoy the field, without the lett or interruption of any; and that they should enjoy the same till a general union in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and an end of all Controversies, should be fully made: That they should have the lower Consistory in the City of <hi>Prague,</hi> with Power to conform the same according to their own Confession. That they might lawfully make their Priests as well of the <hi>Bohemian,</hi> as of the <hi>German</hi> Nation; and settle them in their several Parishes, without lett or molestation of the Arch-bishop of <hi>Prague</hi>: and, that besides the Schools and Churches which they had already, it might be lawful for them to erect more of either sort, as well in
<pb facs="tcp:54836:241"/>
Cities, as in Towns and Countrey Villages. He declared also, that all Edicts formerly published against the free exercise of Religion, should be void, frustrate, and of none effect: and that no contrary Edict against the States of the Religion, should either be publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Himself, or any of his Heirs and Successors; or if any were, should be esteemed of any force or effect in Law: and finally, That all such of His Majesty's Subjects that should do any thing contrary to these His Letters, whether they were Ecclesiastical or Temporal persons, should be severely punished as the Troublers of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peace.</p>
            <p n="28">28. The passing of this Gracious Edict (which the <hi>Confessionists</hi> were not slow of putting into execution), exceedingly exasperated all those of the Catholick Party; who thereupon called in the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Passaw,</hi> and one of the Emperor's younger Brothers: Which Invitation he obeyed, entred the Countrey with an Army of Twelve thousand men, makes himself Master of <hi>New Prague,</hi> and attempts the <hi>Old.</hi> But he found such resistance there, that K. <hi>Matthias,</hi> with a powerful Army, came time enough to their relief, and dislodged the Besiegers. Which Aid he brought them at that time, not out of love to their Religion, or their Persons either, but only upon some Advertisement which had been given him of Duke <hi>Leopold</hi>'s purposes, of getting that Kingdom to himself, as formerly <hi>Matthias</hi> had extorted the Realm of <hi>Hungary,</hi> in despight of the Emperor. But meaning to make sure work of it, he prevailed so far, that the Emperor resigned unto him that Kingdom also, to which he was cheerfully elected by the Estates of the Countrey, before the end of this year, <hi>Anno</hi> 1610. And within two years after, was raised to the Imperial Dignity on the death of his Brother. Advanced unto which Power and Height, he governed his Dominions with great Moderation, till the year 1617. When being Himself, and all his Brothers, without hope of Children, he cast his eyes upon his Cousin <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> then Duke of <hi>Gratzi,</hi> (a Prince wholly acted by the Jesuits) whom he adopted for his Son, declared him for his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor in all the Patrimony and Estates belonging to the House of <hi>Austria</hi>; and in the year 1618, put him into the actual possession of the Realms of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi>; but not with any such forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Election unto either of them, as in his own case had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            <p n="29">29. This gave encouragement to some of the Catholick Party, to take offence at some Churches lately erected by those of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d either totally to deface them, or to shut them up. Complaint hereof is made unto the Emperor, but without any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. So that being doubly injured, as they gave it out, they called an Assembly of the States, that order might be taken for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion, and their Civil Rights, both equally endangered by these new encroachments. The Emperor disallows the Meeting, commanding them by Proclamation to dissolve the same. Which so exasperated some hot spirits, that the Emperor's Secretary, and two of his principal Councellors, were cast headlong out of the Castle-Windows.
<pb facs="tcp:54836:242"/>
And though all three miraculously escaped with life, yet the Conspirators conceived the Fact to be so unpardonable, that they could find no means of doing better, but by doing worse. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they set a Guard of Soldiers on the Baron of <hi>Sternberge,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Castle and Kingdom; they secure <hi>Prague,</hi> displace all the Emperor's old Councellors, and totally clear the Kingdom of all the Jesuits; and presently, as well by Letters to <hi>Matthias</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as by a publick Declaration scattered in all parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they justifie themselves and their actings in it. Which done, they nominate Two and thirty persons of their own Perswasion, to have a superintendency over all Affairs which concerned that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whom they called by the name of <hi>Directors</hi>; and enter into a Solemn League or Covenant, to defend each other against all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoever, without excepting either King or Emperor. For punishing these Insolencies, on the one side; and preserving the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, on the other, from the hands of Justice; a terrible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion first, and afterwards a more terrible Warr, breaks out amongst them. In the first heats whereof, the Emperor <hi>Matthias</hi> dyes, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> is lawfully elected to succeed in the Empire. To stop the course of whose good Fortunes, the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Confederates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all Allegiance to him, proclaim him for no King of theirs, nor so to be acknowledged by the Princes and Estates of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="30">30. But their new Governours (or <hi>Directors,</hi> as they called them) being generally worsted in the Warr, and fearing to be called to a strict account for these multiplyed Injuries, resolve upon the choice of some Potent Prince, to take that unfortunate Crown upon him. And who more like to carry it with success and honour, than <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> the fifth, Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> the Head of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Party, Son-in-law to the King of <hi>England,</hi> descended from a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and by his Wife allyed to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Holstein</hi> and <hi>Brunswick,</hi> three great <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> Princes. These were the Motives on their part to invite him to it; and they prevailed as much with him to accept the offer, to which he was pushed forward by the secret instigation of the States United, whose Truce with <hi>Spain</hi> was now upon the point of exspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and they thought fit, in point of State-craft, that he should exercise his Army further off, than in their Dominions. And unto these it may be added, He had before incurred the Emperor's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure on a double account; first, for projecting the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the Chiefs of the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> (whom they called the <hi>Princes of the Vnion</hi>) for defence of themselves and their Religion. And secondly, for demolishing the Fortifications which were raised at <hi>Vdenhaine,</hi> though authorized by the <hi>Placart</hi> of <hi>Matthias</hi> himself, for which he was impleaded in the Chamber of <hi>Spires.</hi> Upon which Motives and Temptations, he first sends forth his Letters to the Estates of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in which he signified his acceptance of the Honour conferred upon him, and then acquaints K. <hi>IAMES</hi> with the Proposition, whose Counsel he desired therein for his better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:54836:242"/>
But King <hi>IAMES</hi> was not pleased in the precipitancy of this rash adventure, and thought himself unhandsomely handled, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Advice asked upon the post-fact, when all his Counsels to the contrary must have come too late. Besides, he had a strong Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Calvinists</hi> in his own Dominions, who were not to be trusted with a Power of disposing Kingdoms, for fear they might be brought to practise that against Himself, which he had countenanced in others. He knew no Prince could reign in safety, or be established on his Throne with Peace and Honour, if once Religion should be made a Cloak to disguise Rebellions.</p>
            <p n="31">31. Upon these grounds of Christian Prudence, he did not only disallow the Action in his own particular, but gave command that none of his Subjects should from thenceforth own his Son-in-law for the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> or pray for him in the Liturgy, or before their Sermons, by any other Title than <hi>the Prince Elector.</hi> At which the <hi>English Calvinists</hi> were extreamly vexed, who had already fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied to themselves upon this occasion the raising of a <hi>Fifth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> in these parts of Christendom, even to the dethroning of the Pope. the setting up of <hi>Calvin</hi> in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, and carrying on the Warr to the Walls of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> No man more zealous in the Cause, than Arch-bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> who pressed to have the News re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with Bells and Bonfires, the King to be engaged in a Warr for the defence of such a <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Religious Cause,</hi> and the Jewels of the Crown to be pawned in pursuance of it, as appears plainly by his Letters to Sir <hi>Robert Naunton,</hi> principal Secretary of Estate. Which Letters bearing date on the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December, Anno</hi> 1619, are to be found at large in the Printed <hi>Cabala,</hi> p. 169, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I refer the <hi>Reader</hi> for his satisfaction. But neither the Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of so great a Prelate, nor the sollicitations of the Princess and her publick Ministers, nor the troublesome interposings of the House of Commons in a following Parliament, were able to remove that King from his first Resolution. By which, though he incurred the high displeasure of the <hi>English Puritans,</hi> and those of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Party in other places; yet he acquired the Reputation of a Just and and Religious Prince, with most men besides, and those not only of the <hi>Romish,</hi> but the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches. And it is hard to say which of the two were most offended with the Prince Elector, for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of that Crown; which of them had more ground to fear the ruin of their Cause and Party, if he had prevailed; and which of them were more impertinently provoked to make Head against him, after he had declared his acceptance of it.</p>
            <p n="32">32. For when he was to be Inaugurated in the Church of <hi>Prague,</hi> he neither would be crowned in the usual Form, nor by the hands of the Arch-bishop, to whom the performing of that Ceremony did of Right belong; but after such a form and manner as was digested by <hi>Scultetus,</hi> his Domestick Chaplain, who chiefly governed his Affairs in all Sacred matters. Nor would <hi>Scultetus</hi> undertake the Ceremony of the Coronation, though very ambitious of that Honour, till he had cleared the Church of all Carved Images, and defaced all the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:54836:243"/>
Painted also. In both respects a-like offensive to the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy, who found themselves dis-priviledged, their Churches Sacrilegiously invaded, and further ruin threatned by these Innovations. A Massie Crucifix had bin erected on the bridg of <hi>Prague,</hi> which had stood there for many hundred years before; neither affronted by the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> nor defaced by the <hi>Iews,</hi> though more averse from Images than all people else: <hi>Scultetus</hi> takes offence at the sight thereof, as if the Brazen Serpent were set up and worshipped; perswades the King to cause it presently to be demolished, or else he never would be reckoned for an <hi>Hezekiah</hi>; in which he found Conformity to his Humour also. And thereby did as much offend all sober <hi>Lutherans,</hi> (who retain Images in their Churches, and other places) as he had done the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy by his former Follies. This gave some new encrease to those former Jealousies which had been given them by that Prince; first, by endeavouring to suppress the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Forms in the Churches of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> by the Arts and Practises of his Sister. And secondly, By condemning their Doctrine at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> (in which his Ministers were more active than the rest of the Forreigners) though in the persons of those men whom they called <hi>Arminians.</hi> But that which gave them greatest cause of offence and fear, was his determinarion in a Cause depending between two Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, at his first coming to the Crown; of which, the youngest had been married to a <hi>Calvinian,</hi> the eldest to a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Lord. The place in difference, was the Castle and Seignury of <hi>Gutscin,</hi> of which the eldest Sister had took possession, as the Seat of her Ancestors. But the King passing Sentence for the younger Sister, and sending certain Judges and other Officers, to put the place into her actual possession, they were all blown up with Gun-Powder, by the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Lady, not able to concoct the Indignity offered, nor to submit unto Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which appeared so partial.</p>
            <p n="33">33. In the mean time, whilst the Elector was preparing for his Journey to <hi>Prague,</hi> the Faction of <hi>Bohemia</hi> not being able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand such Forces as the Emperor had poured in upon them, invited <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> (not long before made Prince of <hi>Transylvania,</hi> by the help of the <hi>Turks</hi>) to repair speedily to their success. Which invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he accepts, raiseth an Army of Eighteen thousand men, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacks all Monasteries and Religious Houses, wheresoever he came; and in short time becomes the Master of the <hi>Vpper Hungary,</hi> and the City of <hi>Presburgh</hi>; the Protestants in all places, but most especially the <hi>Calvinians,</hi> submitting readily unto him, whom they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as their Deliverer from some present servitude. From thence he sends his Forces to the Gates of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and impudently craves that the Provinces of <hi>Styria, Carinthia,</hi> and <hi>Carniola,</hi> should be united from thenceforth to the Realm of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the better to enable the <hi>Hungarians</hi> to resist the <hi>Turk.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1620.</note> And having a design for ruining the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> he doth not only crave protection from the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperor, but requires the new King and Estates of <hi>Bohemia</hi>; with the Provinces incorporate to it, to send their Ambassadors to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for entring into a Confederacy with the common
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:54836:243"/>

Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged wherewith, the <hi>Transylvanian</hi> is proclaimed King of <hi>Hungary</hi>; who to make good a Title so unjustly gotten, provides an Army of no fewer than Thirty thousand (others say Fifty thousand) men. With which if he had entred into any part of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> before the new King had lost himself in the Battel of <hi>Prague,</hi> it is most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he might have absolutely assured that Kingdom to the Prince Elector, acquired the other for himself, and parted the Estates of <hi>Austria</hi> amongst their Confederates.</p>
            <p n="34">34. But so it hapned, that some <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Popish</hi> Princes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both equally jealous of their own Estates, and careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Interest of their several Parties, entred into League with the Emperor <hi>FERDINAND,</hi> for the defence of one another, and the recovery of that Kingdom to the House of <hi>Austria.</hi> In prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which League, <hi>Iohn-George,</hi> the Duke Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> invades <hi>Lusatia</hi> (another of the incorporate Provinces) with a puissant Army, and in short time reduceth it under his Command. And with like puissance, <hi>Maximilian</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the most potent of the Catholick Princes, falleth into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and openeth all the way before him, to the Walls of <hi>Prague.</hi> Joyning with the Imperial Forces under Count <hi>Bucquoy,</hi> they are said to have made up an Army of Fifty thousand.

Such was the miserable end of the Warr of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> raised chiefly by the Pride and Pragmaticalness of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Followers, out of a hope to propagate their Doctrines, and advance their Discipline in all parts of the Empire. Nor sped the <hi>Hugonots</hi> much better in the Realm of <hi>France</hi>; where, by the countenance and connivance of King <hi>HENRY</hi> the 4<hi>th,</hi> who would not see it; and during the mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>LEWIS</hi> the 13<hi>th,</hi> who could not help it; they possessed themselves of some whole Countreys, and near Two hundred strong Towns, and fortified places. Proud of which Strength, they took upon them as a Commonwealth, in the midst of a Kingdom; sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned Assemblies for the managing of their own Affairs, when, and as often as they pleased. Gave Audience to the Ministers of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Churches; and impowred Agents of their own to negotiate with them. At the same Meetings they consulted about Religion, made new Laws for Government, displaced some of their old Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and elected new ones; the King's consent being never asked to the Alterations. In which licentious calling of their own Assemblies, they abused their Power to a neglect of the King's Authority; and not dissolving those Assemblies when they were commanded, they improved that Neglect to a Disobedience. Nay, sometimes they run cross therein to those very Edicts which they had gained by the effusion of much Christian Blood, and the expence of many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Crowns. For by the last Edict of Pacification, the King had granted the free exercise of both Religions, even in such Towns as were assigned for Caution to the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party. Which liberty being enjoyed for many years, was at last interrupted by those very men who with so much difficulty had procured it. For in an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of theirs which they held at <hi>Loudun, Anno</hi> 1619, they strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded all their Governours, Mayors, and Sheriffs, not to suffer any Jesuit, nor those of any other Order, to preach in any of the Towns assigned to them, though licensed by the Bishop of the Diocess, in due Form of Law. And when, upon a dislike of their proceedings, the King had declared their Meetings to be unlawful, and contrary to the Publick Peace; and had procured the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be verified in the Court of Parliament; they did not only refuse to separate themselves, as they were required, but still insisted upon terms of Capitulation, even to a plain justifying of their actings in it.</p>
            <p n="36">36.

Which Liberty they made such use of, in the said Assembly, that they approved all the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations which were made at <hi>Dort,</hi> commanded them to be subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and bound themselves and their Successors in the Ministry, by a solemn Oath, <note n="*" place="margin">

Instead whereof, they published a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in defence of their former Actions, and signified a Resolution not to separate or break up that Meeting, until their Grievances were redressed.</p>
            <p n="37">37. It hapned at the same time, that the Lord of <hi>Privas</hi> (a Town in which the <hi>Hugonots</hi> made the strongest Party) married his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Heir to the Viscount of <hi>Cheylane</hi>; and dying, left the same wholly unto his disposal. Who being of different perswasions from the greatest part of his Vassals, altered the Garrison, and placed his own Servants and Dependents in it, as by Law he might. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of the Town, and the Neighbouring Villages, to put themselves into a posture of Warr, to seize upon the places ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining, and thereby to compel the young Noble-man to forsake his Inheritance. Which being signified to the King, he presently scored this insolence on the account of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> who standing in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Authority, was thought to have given some animation unto the Town of <hi>Privas,</hi> to commit those out-rages. Doubly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted and provoked, the King resolves to right Himself in the way of Arms. But at the instant request of <hi>Des Diguiers,</hi> before remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, (who had been hitherto a true Zealot to the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Cause) he was content to give them Four and twenty days of deliberation before he drew into the Field. He offered them also very fair and
<pb facs="tcp:54836:245"/>
reasonable Canditions; not altogether such as their Commissioners had desired for them; but far better than those which they were glad to accept at the end of the Warr, when all their strengths were taken from them. But the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were not to be told, that all the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Princes and Estates of the Empire, had put themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a posture of Warr; some for defence of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and others in pursuance of the Warr of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> Of which they gave themselves more hopes than they had just cause for. In which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, some hot spirits then assembled at <hi>Rochel,</hi> blinded with pride, or hurried on by the <hi>fatality</hi> of those <hi>Decrees</hi> which they maintained to be resolved upon by God before all Eternity, reject all offers tending to a Pacification, and wilfully run on to their own destruction. For presently upon the tendry of the King's Proposals, they publish certain Orders for the regulating of their Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; as namely, <hi>That no Agreement should be made with the King, but by the consent of a General Convocation of the Chiefs of their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; about the payment of their Soldiers Wages, and intercepting the Revenues of the King and Clergie, toward the maintenance of the Warr.</hi> They also Cantoned the whole Kingdom into seven Divisions; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to each of those Divisions, a Commander in Chief; and unto each Commander, their particular Lieutenants, Deputy-Lieutenants, and other Officers, with several Limitations and Directions prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to each of them for their proceeding in this service.</p>
            <p n="38">
               <note place="margin">1621.</note>38. This makes it evident, that the King did not take up Arms, but on great necessities. He saw his Regal Authority neglected, his especial Edicts wilfully violated, his Gracious Offers scornfully slighted, his Revenues Feloniously intercepted, his whole Realm Cantoned before his face, and put into the power of such Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as he could not trust: So that the Warr being just on his part, he had the more reason to expect such an issue of it, as was agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Equity of so good a Cause. He had besides, all those Advantages both at home and abroad, which in all probability might assure him of the End desired. The Prince Elector Palatine had been worsted in the Warr of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and all the Princes of the Union scattered to their several Homes, which they were hardly able to defend against so many Enemies; so that there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be feared from them. And on the other side, the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> whom he had most cause to be afraid of, had denied assistance to his own Children in the Warr of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have more Justice in it than the Warr of the <hi>Hugonots</hi>; and therefore was not like to engage in behalf of strangers, who rather out of wantonness, than any unavoidable necessity, had took up Arms against their Lawful and Undoubted Soveraign. At home the <hi>Rochellers</hi> were worse befriended than they were abroad; I mean <hi>the Common-wealth of Rochel,</hi> as King <hi>LEWIS</hi> called it. The whole Confederacy of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> there contrived and sworn to; they had Cantoned the whole Realm into seven Divisions, which they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to the Command of the Earl of <hi>Chastillon,</hi> the Marquess <hi>De la Force,</hi> the Duke of <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Trimoville,</hi> the Duke <hi>Des Diguer,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> whom they designed to be the Generalissimo over all their Forces. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, nor <hi>Des Diguers,</hi> nor the Duke of <hi>Trimoville,</hi> nor <hi>Chastil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> would act any thing in it, or accept any such Commissions as were sent unto them: Whether it were that they were terrified with the ill success of the Warr of <hi>Bohemia</hi>; or that the Conscience of their duty did direct them in it, I dispute not now. So that the <hi>Rochellers</hi> being deserted both at home and abroad, were forced to rely upon the Power and Prudence of the other three; and to supply all other wants, out of the Magazine of Obstinacy and Perversness; with which they were plentifully stored. Two instances I shall only touch at, and pass over the rest. The town of <hi>Clerack</hi> being summoned the 21 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1621, returned this Answer to the King, viz. <hi>That if he would permit them to enjoy their Liberties, withdraw his Armies, and leave their Fortifications in the same estate in which he found them, they would remain his faithful and obedient Subjects.</hi> More fully, those of <hi>Mount Albon</hi> on the like occasion, <hi>That they resolve to live and dye</hi> (not in obedience to the King, as they should have said, but) <hi>in the Vnion of the Churches.</hi> Most Religious Rebels!</p>
            <p n="39">39. Next, let us look upon the King; who being brought to a necessity of taking Arms, first made his way unto it by his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the second of <hi>April,</hi> published in favour of all those of that Religion who would contain themselves in their due obedience. In pursuance whereof, he caused five persons to be executed in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Tours,</hi> who had tumultuously disturbed the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> whom they found busied at the burial of one of their dead. He also signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> the Princes of the Empire, and the States of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> That he had not undertook this Warr to suppress the Religion, but to chastise the Insolencies of Rebellious Subjects. And what he signified in words, he made good by his deeds: For when the Warr was at the hottest, all those of the Religion in the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> lived as securely as before, and had their accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Meetings at <hi>Charenton,</hi> as in times of peace. Which safety and security was enjoyed in all other places, even where the King's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies lodged and quartered. Nay, such a care was taken of their preservation, that when some of the Rascality in the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> upon the first tydings of the death of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> (who had been slain at the Siege of <hi>Mont-albon,</hi> amongst many others) breathed nothing but slaughter and revenge to the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party; the Duke of <hi>Mounbazon,</hi> being then Governour of the City, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their Houses and the Streets to be safely guarded, so that no hurt was done to their Goods or Persons. And when the Rabble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disappointed of their Ends in <hi>Paris,</hi> had run tumultuously the next day to <hi>Charenton,</hi> and burned down their Temple, an Order was presently made by the Court of Parliament, for the re-edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at the King's sole Charges, and that too in a far more beautiful Fabrick than before it had. But in the conduct of the Warr, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned not his Counsels with like moderation, suffering the Sword too often to range at liberty; as if he meant to be as terrible in his
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:54836:246"/>
Executions, as he desired to be accounted just in his Undertakings. But possibly this may be excused, though not defended, as being done in hot blood, when the spirits of the Soldiers were enflamed with anger, by reason of the loss of so many of their Chief Commanders, occasioned by the holding out of the obstinate Party; or the loss of their Fellows; and could not easily be quenched but by the blood of their Enemies.</p>
            <p n="40">
               <note place="margin">1622.</note>40. I shall not touch upon the particulars of this Warr, which was quick and violent; and as succesful on the King's part, as he could desire. Let it suffice, that within the compass of Eighteen Months, or thereabouts, he stript them of no fewer than One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of their strongest places: so that their whole strength was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in a manner to two Towns only; that is to say, the strong Town of <hi>Montalbon,</hi> and the Port of <hi>Rochel</hi>; the rest submitting one by one, at the first demand. A Peace is thereupon concluded before <hi>Montpellier,</hi> agreeable enough to the Will of the Victor, and with security enough to the vanquished Party, if all Conclusions had been kept with as great a constancy, as they had been agreed upon with a seeming alacrity. By which Accord, the said two Towns were to be held in caution for three years only; and the last seemed much over-awed by the Fort of K. <hi>Lewis,</hi> erected by the Count of <hi>Soi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scons,</hi> when he lay before it. For the demolishing of which Fort, the King was earnestly sollicited by their Commissioners; and for the not granting whereof, when it was desired, he was accused for violating the Pacification which he had made with them before <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and solemnly confirmed in the Courts of Parliament. And on the other side, the King complained as sensibly against the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> in regard they had not setled the <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> in their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Possessions, nor admitted those of the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unto Civil Offices, in any of their Towns and Territories, as by the Articles of that Pacification they were bound to do. So that the Wound seemed rather to be skinned, than healed; and suddenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more dangerous than at first it was. For those of <hi>Rochel</hi> being somewhat blocked up by Fort <hi>Lewis,</hi> toward the Land, practised with the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> to grow strong by Sea, and make up a Fleet consisting of Eleven men of Warr, besides lesser Vessels, enter the large Haven of <hi>Blavet</hi> in <hi>Bretagne,</hi> seize upon all the Ships which they found therein; and amongst others, six of great strength and beauty, belonging to the Duke of <hi>Nevers.</hi> By the accession of this Strength, they seize upon the Isles of <hi>Rhe</hi> and <hi>Oleron,</hi> with all the Shipping in the same; and having gathered together a Navy of no fewer than Seventy Sail, they infest the Seas, and interrupt the course of Traffick.</p>

For the repressing of these Pyrates, (for they were no better) the King sends out the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> with a Naval Power; hires Twenty men of Warr of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and borrows Eight tall Ships of the King of <hi>England</hi>: With which he gives bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel to <hi>Soubize,</hi> beats him at Sea, and forceth him to flye dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from the Isle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> presently possess, and
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:54836:246"/>
begin to fortifie. For the removal of whose Forces from that Island, which blockt up their Haven, the <hi>Rochellers</hi> mediate, by <hi>Soubize,</hi> with K. <hi>CHARLES</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; betwixt whom, and his Brother of <hi>France,</hi> some disgust had hapned, for sending back the <hi>French</hi> of both Sexes, whom the Queen brought with her. For hereupon the <hi>French</hi> King seizeth upon all the <hi>English</hi> Ships which traded on the River of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi>; and the <hi>English,</hi> to revenge the wrong, sets out a Fleet of Thirty sail,<note place="margin">1626.</note> all Men of Warr, commanded by the Earls of <hi>Denbigh</hi> and <hi>Lindsey,</hi> with an intent to steer for <hi>Rochel,</hi> and relieve that Town. But being encountred with cross winds, they came back again, and leave the prosecuting of the Action to the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham.</hi> Who,<note place="margin">1627.</note> the next year, sets forward with a puissant Army, consisting of Ten thousand men, and wafted over in One hundred and fifty Sail of Ships, all fit for Service. His Design was for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of the Isle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> and relieving <hi>Rochel.</hi> Both which he might have compassed without any great difficulty, if he had not lost the opportunities which he gained at his landing; passed by the Fort of <hi>La Pre,</hi> as not worth the taking, and suffering himself to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented out of the storming of <hi>St. Martins,</hi> when it was at his mercy. For the <hi>French</hi> Forces entring by the Fort of <hi>La Pre,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him to an unsafe Retreat, but of a great part of his Army; and sent him back with far less Honour than he brought a-long with him.</p>

But the Relief of <hi>Rochel</hi> is not so given over.<note place="margin">1628.</note> A strong Fleet is prepared for the year next following, to be commanded by the Duke, who gave himself more hopes of good Fortune in it, than his Fates assigned him. For being villanously slain at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> when he was almost ready to embark his Soldiers, the Conduct of the Action is committed to the Earl of <hi>Lindsey</hi>; who very cheerfully and couragiously undertook the Service. But the <hi>French</hi> had blockt up the Haven of <hi>Rochel,</hi> with Piles and Ramparts, and other most stupendious Works in the midst of the Ocean, that it was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impossible for the Earl to force his passage, though he did most gallantly attempt it. Which being observed by those of <hi>Rochel,</hi> who were then besieged to Landward, by the King in Person, and even reduced unto the last extremity, by Plagues and Famine; they presently set open their Gates, and without making any Conditions for their preservation, submitted absolutely to that Mercy which they had scorned so often in their prosperous Fortunes. The King thus Master of the Town, dismantleth all their Fortifications, leaves it quite open both to Sea and Land, commands them to renounce the Name of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and to take unto the Town the Name of <hi>Mary Ville,</hi> or <hi>Bourg de</hi> St. <hi>Mary.</hi> But herein his Command found but small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance; the Name of <hi>Rochel</hi> still remaining, and that of <hi>Mary Ville,</hi> or <hi>Bourg de</hi> St. <hi>Mary,</hi> almost as soon forgotten as it had been given. After which followed the surrendry of <hi>Nismess,</hi> and <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>albon,</hi> two impregnable places; the first of which had been re-forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in these last Commotions.

See now to what a low condition these hot <hi>Calvinian</hi> spirits have reduced themselves by their frequent Insolencies; how differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent their Affairs were at the end of this Warr, from that Felicity which they enjoyed when they first began it. Before the beginning of the Warr, <hi>Anno</hi> 1620, they were possessed of well-near Two hundred strong Towns and Castles, well fortified for their personal safety, besides many fair Houses, and large Territories, which they had in the Villages, in which their Pleasures and their Profits were a-like consulted; they slept all of them under their own Vines, and their own Fig-trees, neither fearing, nor having cause to fear the least disturbance. With those of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Party they were grown so intimate, by reason of their frequent inter-marriages with one another, that in few years they might have been incorporated with them, and made of the same Family, though of different Faiths. The exercise of their Religion had been permitted to them since the passing of the Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> 1598, without interruption. And that they might have satisfaction also in the Courts of Justice, some Courts were purposely erected for their ease and benefit, which they called <hi>Les Chambres d' l' Edict,</hi> wherein there were as many Judges and other Officers of their own Perswasions, as there were of the contrary. In a word, they lived so secure and happy, that they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing to perpetuate their Felicities to succeeding Ages, but Moderation in themselves, Gratitude to Almighty God, and good Affections towards their King.</p>
            <p n="44">44. Such were the Fortunes and Successes of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the rest of Christendom, during the last ten years of the Reign of K. <hi>IAMES,</hi> and the beginnings of K. <hi>CHARLES.</hi> By which both Kings might see how unsafe they were, if men of such Pragmatical Spirits, and Seditious Principles, should get ground upon them. But K. <hi>IAMES</hi> had so far supported them in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces, that his own <hi>Calvinists</hi> presumed on the like Indulgence; which prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to set nought by his Proclamations, to vilifie his <hi>Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and despise his Messages. Finally, they made tryal of his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence also, by setting up one <hi>Knight,</hi> of <hi>Broadgates</hi> (now called <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi> Colledg) to preach upon the Power of such popular Officers as <hi>Calvin</hi> thinks to be ordained by Almighty God, for curbing and restraining the Power of Kings. In which, though <hi>Knight</hi> himself was censured, the Doctrines solemnly condemned, &amp; execution done upon a Book of <hi>Pareus,</hi> which had misguided the unfortunate and ignorant man; yet the <hi>Calvinians</hi> most tenaciously adhered to their Master's tendries, with an intent to bring them into use and practise, when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion served. So that K. <hi>IAMES</hi> with all his King-craft, could find no better way to suppress their Insolencies, than by turning <hi>Mountague</hi> upon them; a man of mighty Parts, and an undaunted Spirit; and one who knew, as well as any, how to discriminate the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from those which were peculiar to the Sect of <hi>Calvin.</hi> By which he galled and gagged them more than his Popish Adversary; but raised thereby so many Pens against himself, that he might seem to have succeeded in the state of <hi>Ismael.</hi>

               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:54836:247"/>45. In this conjuncture of Affairs, K. <hi>IAMES</hi> departs this life, and K. <hi>CHARLES</hi> succeeds; who to ingratiate himself with this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Faction, had plunged his Father in a Warr with the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> by which he was brought under the necessity of calling Parliaments, and gave those Parliaments the courage to dispute his Actions. For though they promised to stand to him with their Lives and Fortunes, in prosecution of that Warr; yet when they had engaged him in it, they would not part with any money to defray that Charge, till they had stripped him of the Richest Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els in the Regal Diadem. But he was much more punished in the consequence of his own Example in aiding those of <hi>Rochel</hi> against their King, whereby he trained up his own Subjects in the School of Rebellion, and taught them to confederate themselves with the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> to seize upon his Forts and Castles, invade the Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Church, and to make use of his Revenue against himself. To such Misfortunes many Princes do reduce themselves, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they engage themselves to maintain a Party, or govern not their Actions by the Rules of Justice; but are directed by self-ends, or swayed by the corrupt Affections of untrusty Ministers. These things I only touch at here, which I reserve for the Materials of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther History, as I do also all the intermediate passages in the Reign of K. <hi>CHARLES,</hi> before the breaking out of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Tumults, and most of the preparatives to the Warr of <hi>England.</hi>

To whose Felicities, if those in <hi>England</hi> did aspire, they were to entertain those Counsels, and pursue those courses, by which the others had attained them; that is to say, They were by
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:54836:249"/>
secret practises to diminish the King's Power and Greatness, to draw the people to depend upon their Directions, to dissolve all the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the former Government; and either call in Forreign Forces, or form an Army of their own to maintain their doings. And this had been the business of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, since the death of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft</hi>; when by the retirements of K. <hi>IAMES</hi> from all cares of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the connivance or remisness of Arch-bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> the Reins were put into their hands. Which gave them time and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to grow strong in Parliaments, under pretence of stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Subjects Property, against the encroachments of the Court, and for the preservation of the true Religion, against the practises of the <hi>Papists.</hi> By which two Artifices, they first weakned the Prerogative Royal, to advance their own; and by the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King's Authority, endeavoured to erect the People's, whom they represented. And then they practised to asperse with the Name of <hi>Papist,</hi> all those who either join not with them in their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Doctrines, or would not captivate their Judgments unto <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>'s Dictates. Their actings in all which particulars, either as Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots for the Gospel, in maintaining <hi>Calvinism</hi>; or Patriots for the Common-wealth, in bringing down the Power and Reputation of the two last Kings; shall be at large delivered in the Life of the late Arch-bishop, and consequently may be thought unnecessary to be here related. And therefore, pretermitting all their former practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, by which their Party was prepared, and the Design made ready to appear in publick; we will proceed to a Relation of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing passages, when they had pulled off their Disguise, and openly declared themselves to be ripe for Action.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Party in both Kingdoms being grown so strong that they were able to proceed from Counsel unto Execution; there wanted nothing but a fair occasion for putting themselves into a posture of defence; and from that posture, breaking out into open Warr. But finding no occasion, they resolve to make one; and to begin their first Embroilments upon the sending of the new Liturgy and Book of Canons to the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> For though the <hi>Scots</hi> in a general Assembly held at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1617.</note> had given consent unto the making of a Liturgy for the use of that Kirk, and for drawing up a Book of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons out of the Acts of their Assemblies, and some Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when those Books were finished by the Care of King <hi>CHARLES,</hi> and by his Piety recommended unto use and practise, it must be looked on as a violation of their Rights and Liberties. And though in another of their Assemblies which was held at <hi>Perth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1618.</note> they had past five Articles for introducing private Baptism, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the sick, kneeling at the Communion, Episcopal Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the observing of such ancient Festivals as belonged imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately unto Christ: yet when those Articles were incorporated in the Common-prayer-Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were beheld as Innovations in the Worship of God, and therefore not to be admitted in so pure and Reformed a Church as that of <hi>Scotland.</hi> These were the Hooks by which they drew the people to them, who never look on their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:54836:249"/>
with a greater reverence, than when they see them active in the Cause of Religion; and willing, in appearance, to lose all which was dear unto them, whereby they might preserve the Gospel in its native purity. But it was rather Gain than Godliness, which brought the great men of the Realm to espouse this Quarrel; who by the Commission of <hi>Surrendries</hi> (of which more elsewhere), began to fear the losing of their Tithes and Superiorities,<note place="margin">1630.</note> to which they could pretend no other title, than plain Usurpation. And on the other side, it was Ambition, and not Zeal, which enflamed the <hi>Presbyters</hi>; who had no other way to invade that Power which was conferred upon the Bishops by Divine Institution, and countenanced by many Acts of Parliament in the Reign of K. <hi>IAMES,</hi> than by embracing that occasion to incense the people, to put the whole Nation into tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, and thereby to compel the Bishops and the Regular Clergy to forsake the Kingdom. So the <hi>Genevians</hi> dealt before with their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and Clergy, when the Reforming-Humour came first upon them: And what could they do less in <hi>Scotland,</hi> than follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their Mother-City?</p>
            <p n="3">3. These breakings-out in <hi>Scotland,</hi> smoothed the way to the like in <hi>England,</hi> from which they had received encouragement, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed on Succours. The <hi>English Puritaus</hi> had begun with Libelling against the Bishops, as the <hi>Scots</hi> did against the King: For which, the Authors and Abettors had received some punishment; but such, as did rather reserve them for ensuing Mischiefs, than make them sensible of their Crimes, or reclaim them from it. So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coming of the Liturgy and Book of Canons,<note place="margin">1637.</note> the <hi>Scots</hi> were put into such heat, that they disturbed the execution of the one by an open Tumult, and refused obedience to the other by a wilful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy. The King had then a Fleet at Sea, sufficiently powerful to have blockt up all the Havens of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and, by destroying that small Trade which they had amongst them, to have reduced them absolutely to His Will and Pleasure. But they had so many of their Party in the Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had so great a confidence in the Marquess of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and many Friends of both Nations in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> that they feared nothing less than the Power of the King, or to be enforced to their obedience in the way of Arms. In confidence whereof, they despise all His Proclamations, with which Weapons only He encountred them in their first Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and publickly protested against all Declarations which He sent unto them, in the Streets of <hi>Edenborough.</hi> Nothing else being done against them in the first year of their Tumults, they cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into four Tables for dispatch of business; but chiefly, for the cementing of their Combination. For which, they could not easily bethink themselves of a speedier course, than to unite the people to them by a League or Covenant. Which to effect, it was thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to renew the old Confession, excogitated in the year 1580, for the abjuring of the Tyranny and Superstitions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; subscribed first by the King and His Houshold-Servants; and the next year by all the Natives of the Kingdom, as was said before.
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:54836:250"/>
And it was also said before, that unto this Confession they adjoined a Band, <hi>Anno</hi> 1592, for standing unto one another in defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, against all <hi>Papists,</hi> and other professed Adversaries of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. This is now made to serve their turn against the King: For by a strange interpretation which was put upon it, it was declared, That both the Government of the Church by Bishops, and the Five Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> the Liturgy, and the Book of Canons, were all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by that Confession, and the Band annexed; though the three last had no existency or being in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when that Confession was first formed, or the Band subjoined.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">1638.</note>4. These Insolencies might have given the King a just cause to arm, when they were utterly unprovided of all such necessaries as might enable them to make the least show of a weak resistance. But the King deals more gently with them, negotiates for some fair ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the present differences, and sends the Marquess of <hi>Hamilton</hi> as his chief Commissioner for the transacting of the same. By whose sollicitation he revokes the Liturgy and the Book of Canons, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spends the Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> and then rescinds all Acts of Parliament which confirmed the same; submits the Bishops to the next General Assembly, as their competent Judges; and thereupon gives intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a General Assembly to be held at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> in which the point of Church-Government was to be debated, and all his Condescenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons enrolled and registred. And, which made most to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, he caused the <hi>Solemn League or Covenant</hi> to he imposed on all the Subjects, and subscribed by them. Which in effect was to legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate the Rebellion, and countenance the Combination with the face of Authority. But all this would not do his business, though it might do theirs. For they had so contrived the matter, that none were chosen to have voices in that Assembly, but such as were sure unto the side, such as had formerly been under the Censures of the Church for their Inconformity, and had refused to acknowledg the King's Supremacy, or had declared their disaffections to Episcopal Government. And that the Bishops might have no encouragement to sit amongst them, they cite them to appear as Criminal persons, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel against them in a scandalous and unchristian manner; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, make choice of <hi>Henderson,</hi> a Seditious <hi>Presbyter,</hi> to sit as Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor or chief President in it. And though upon the sense of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, the Assembly was again dissolved by the King's Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; yet they continued, as before, in contempt thereof. In which Session they condemned the Calling of Bishops, the Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> the Liturgy, and the Book of Canons, as inconsistent with the Scripture, and the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> They proceed next to the rejecting of the five controverted points, which they called <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism:</hi> and finally, decreed a general subscription to be made to these Constitutions. For not conforming whereunto, the Bishops, and a great part of the Regular Clergy, are expelled the Countrey, although they had been animated unto that Refusal, as well by the Conscience of their duty, as by his Majesty's Proclamation which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it of them.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="437" facs="tcp:54836:250"/>5. They could not hope that the King's Lenity so abused, might not turn to Fury; and therefore thought it was high time to put themselves into Arms, to call back most of their old Soldiers from the Warrs in <hi>Germany</hi>; and almost all their Officers from such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in the <hi>Netherlands</hi>; whom to maintain, they intercept the King's <hi>Revenue,</hi> and the Rents of the Bishops, and lay great Taxes on the people, taking up Arms and Ammunition from the <hi>States Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> with whom they went on Ticket, and long days of payment, for want of ready money for their satisfaction. But all this had not served their turn, if the King could have been perswaded to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them battel, or suffered any part of that great Army which he brought against them, to lay waste their Countrey. Whose tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness when they once perceived, and knew withall how many friends they had about him, they thought it would be no hard matter to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain such a Pacification as might secure them for the present from an absolute Conquest, and give them opportunity to provide better for themselves in the time to come, upon the reputation of being able to divert or break such a puissant Army. And so it proved in the event. For the King had no sooner retired his Forces both by Sea and Land, and given his Soldiers a License to return to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Houses, but the <hi>Scots</hi> presently protest against all the Articles of the Pacification, put harder pressures on the King's Party, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they suffered, keep all their Officers in pay; by their Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Letters, apply themselves to the <hi>French</hi> King for support and succours. By whom encouraged under-hand, and openly counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by some Agents of the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who then govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Affairs in <hi>France,</hi> they enter into <hi>England</hi> with a puissant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, making their way to that Invasion, by some Printed Pamphlets, which they dispersed into all parts, thereby to colour their Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and bewitch the people.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And now the <hi>English Presbyterians</hi> take the courage to appear more publickly in the defence of the <hi>Scots</hi> and their proceedings,<note place="margin">1640.</note> than they had done hitherto. A Parliament had been called on the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> for granting Moneys to maintain the Warr against the <hi>Scots.</hi> But the Commons were so backward in complying with the King's Desires, that he found himself under the necessity of dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Parliament, which else had blasted his Design, and openly declared in favour of the publick Enemies. This puts the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Rabble into such a fury, that they violently assaulted <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth-House,</hi> but were as valiantly repulsed; and the next day break open all the Prisons in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and release all the Prisoners whom they found committed for their Inconformities. <hi>Benstead,</hi> the Ring-leader in these Tumults, is apprehended and arraigned, condemned and executed; the whole proceeding being grounded on the Statute of the 25<hi>th</hi> of K. <hi>EDWARD</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> for punishing all Treasons and Rebellions against the King. But that which threatned greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the King and the Church, than either the Arms of the <hi>Scots,</hi> or the Tumults in <hi>Southwark</hi>; was a Petition sent unto the King, who was then at <hi>York,</hi> subscribed by sundry Noble-men of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:54836:251"/>
Faction; concluded on the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August</hi>; carried by the Lord <hi>Mandevil,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Escrigg:</hi> and finally, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented on the third of <hi>September.</hi> In which it was petitioned, amongst other things, <hi>That the present War might be composed without loss of blood. That a Parliament should be forthwith called for redress of Grievances,</hi> (amongst which, some pretended <hi>Innovations</hi> in Religion must be none of the least) <hi>and that the Authors and Counsellors of such Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances as are there complained of, might be there brought to such a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Tryal, and receive such condign punishment as their Crimes requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> This hastned the assembling of the great Council of the Peers at <hi>York,</hi> and put the King upon the calling of a Parliament of His own accord, which otherwise might be thought extorted by their importunity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>Scots,</hi> in the mean time, had put by such <hi>English</hi> Forces as lay on the South-side of the <hi>Tine,</hi> at the passage of <hi>Newborn,</hi> make themselves Masters of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> deface the goodly Church of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> bring all the Countreys on the North-side of the <hi>Tees,</hi> under contribution, and tax the people to all payments at their only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The Council of Peers, and a Petition from the <hi>Scots,</hi> prepare the King to entertain a Treaty with them; the managing whereof was chiefly left unto those Lords who had subscribed the Petition before remembred. But the third day of <hi>November</hi> coming on a-pace, and the Commissioners seeming desirous to attend in Parliament, which was to begin on that day, the Treaty is adjourned to <hi>London</hi>; which gave the <hi>Scots</hi> a more dangerous opportunity to infect that City, than all their Emissaries had obtained in the times fore-going. Nor was it long before it openly appeared what great power they had upon their Party in that City; which animated <hi>Pennington,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with some hundreds of inferior note, to tender a Petition to the House of Commons, against the Government of Bishops here by Law established. It was affirmed, that this Petition was subscribed by many thousands; and it was probable enough to be so indeed. But whether it were so or not, he gave thereby such an occasion to the House of Commons, that they voted down the Canons which had passed in the late Convocation, condemned the Bishops and Clergy in great sums of Money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which had subscribed to the same: decry the Power of all Provincial or National Synods, for making any Canons or Constitutions which could bind the Subject, until they were confirmed by an Act of Parliament. And having brought this general terror on the Bishops and Clergy, they impeach the Arch-bishop of High Treason, cause him to be committed to the Black Rod, and from thence to the Tower. Which being done, some other of the Bishops and Clergy must be singled out, informed against by scandalous Articles, and those Articles print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without any consideration either true or false.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <note place="margin">1641.</note>8. And though a Convocation were at that time sitting; yet to encrease the Miseries of a falling-Church, it is permitted, that a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Meeting should be held in the Deanry of <hi>Westminster,</hi> to which some Orthodox and Conformable Divines were called, as a foil to
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:54836:251"/>
the rest, which generally were of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Puritan</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. By them it was proposed, That many passages in the Liturgy should be expunged, and others altered to the worse. That Decency and Reverence in officiating God's publick Service, should be brought within the compass of Innovations. That Doctrinal <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi> should be entertained in all parts of the Church; and all their Sabbath-Speculations, though contrary to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgment, super-added to it. But before any thing could be concluded in those weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matters, the Commons set their Bill on foot against <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branch,</hi> for putting down all Bishops and Cathedral Churches; which put a period to that Meeting without doing any thing. And though the Bill, upon a full debate thereon amongst the Peers, was cast out of that House, and was not by the course of Parliaments to be offered again; yet, contrary to all former Custom, it was prest from one time to another, till in the end they gained the point which they so much aimed at. Hereupon followed some Petitions from the Universities, in favour of Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, Learning must be destitute of its chief encouragements; and some Petitions from whole Counties, in behalf of Episcopacy, without which there was like to be no preservative against Sects and Heresies. But nothing was more memorable than the inter-pleadings in the House of Commons, between Dr. <hi>Iohn H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cket,</hi> one of the Prebendaries of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and Arch-Deacon of <hi>Bedford</hi>; and Dr. <hi>Cornelius Burges,</hi> a right doubty Disputant; but better skilled in drawing down his Myrmidons, than in mustering Arguments: the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue of whose Plea was this, <hi>That though Cathedrals were unnecessary, and the Quire-men scandalous; yet, that their Lands could not be alienated unto private persons, without guilt of Sacriledg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. But little did this edifie with the Leading-part in the House of Commons, who were resolved to practise on the Church by little and little, and at the last to play at sweep-stake, and take all together. First therefore, they began with taking down the Starr-Chamber, and the High Commission, without which Courts the Subjects could not easily be kept in order, nor the Church from Faction. And in the Act for taking down the Court of the High Commission, a clause is cunningly inserted, which plainly took away all Coercive Power which had been vested in the Bishops and their Under-Officers, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling them from imposing any pain or penalty; and consequently, from inflicting all Church-Censures on notorious sinners. Their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction being thus gone, it was not likely that their Lands should stay long behind; though in good manners it was thought conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to strip them first from having any place or suffrage in the House of Peers. And when they once were rendred useless to the Church and State, the Lands would follow of themselves without any great trouble. And that they might attain the end which they so much aimed at, <hi>Burges</hi> draws down his <hi>Myrmidons</hi> to the Doors of he Parliament, and teacheth them to cry, <hi>No Bishops, No Bishops,</hi> with their wonted violence. By which confused Rabble, some indignities and affronts are very frequently put upon them, either in keeping
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:54836:252"/>
them off from landing, if they came by water; or offer violence to their persons, if they came by Land. Which multiplied Injuries gave such just cause of fear and trouble, that they withdrew themselves from the House of Peers, but sent withall a <hi>Protestation</hi> to preserve their Rights: In which it was declared, <hi>That all Acts made, or to be made, in the time of their absence, considering their absen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, not voluntary, should be reputed void and null to all intents and purposes in the Law whatsoever.</hi> This <hi>Protestation</hi> being tendred in the House of Peers, communicated to the House of Commons, and the supposed offence extreamly aggravated by the Lord Keeper <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton,</hi> the Bishops are impeached of Treason, nine of them sent Prisoners to the Tower, and two committed to the custody of the Gentleman-Usher.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And there we leave them for a while, to look into the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of the publick Liturgy; not like to stand, when both the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English Presbyterians</hi> did conspire against it. The Fame whereof had either caused it totally to be laid aside, or performed by halfs in all the Counties where the <hi>Scots</hi> were of strength and power; and not much better executed in some Churches of <hi>London,</hi> wherein that Faction did as much predominate, as if it had been under the protection of a <hi>Scottish</hi> Army. But the first great inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which was made at the officiating of the publick Liturgy, was made upon a Day of Humiliation, when all the Members of the House of Commons were assembled together at St. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s in <hi>Westminster.</hi> At what time, as the Priest began the second Service at the Holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, some of the <hi>Puritans</hi> or <hi>Presbyterians</hi> began a Psalm; and were therein followed by the rest in so loud a Tune, that the Minister was thereby forced to desist from his duty, and leave the Preacher to perform the rest of that day's Solemnity. This gave encouragement enough to the rest of that Party to set as little by the Liturgy in the Countrey, as they did in the City; especially in all such usages and rights thereof, as they were pleased to bring within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of <hi>Innovations.</hi> But they were more encouraged to it, by an Order of the Lower-House, bearing date on the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September, Anno</hi> 1641. By which all Church-Wardens were required in their several Parishes to remove the Holy Table from the East-end of the Chancel, to any other part of the Church; to take away the Ralis before it, and not to suffer any Tapers, Candlesticks, or Basons, to be placed upon it. It was required also by the same, That there should be no bowing at the Name of Jesus, nor adoration toward the East, nor any reverence used in men's approaches to the Holy Table. And by the same, all Dancing, and other lawful Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were prohibited on their Lord's-day-Sabbath, after the duties of the Day; and Catechising turned into After-noon-Sermons, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to His Majesty's Declarations and Instructions given in that behalf. And though the Lords refused to join with them in that Vote, and sent them back unto an Order of the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> by which they had confirmed and enjoined the use of the Liturgy; yet <hi>Pym</hi> commands the Order to be put in execution by a Warrant
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:54836:252"/>
under his own hand only, and that too during the <hi>Recess,</hi> when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the Lords and Commons had retired themselves to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral dwellings.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Hereupon followed such an alteration in all Churches and Chappels, that the Church-Wardens pulled down more in a Week or two, than all the Bishops and Clergy had been able to raise in two Weeks of years. And hereupon there followed such irreverences ni God's publick Service, and such a discontinuance of it in too many places, that His Majesty was compelled to give new life to it by His Proclamation of the tenth of <hi>December</hi>; and taking order in the same for <hi>punishing all the wilful Contemners and Disburbers of it.</hi> But this Proclamation being published in that point of time in which the Commons were intent on the Warr of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Puritans</hi> as much busied in blowing the Trumpet of Sedition in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi>; it only showed the King's good meaning, with his want of Power. In which conjuncture hapned the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Imprisonment of Eleven of the Bishops: Which made that Bench so thin, and the King so weak, that on the 6<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Lords consented to the taking away of their Votes in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The News whereof was solemnized in most places of <hi>London,</hi> with Bells and Bou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>res. Nothing remained, but that the King should pass it into Act by his Royal Assent; by some unhappy Instrument extorted from Him when he was at <hi>Canterbury</hi>; and signified by His Message to the Houses on the fourteenth of that Month. Which Condescention wrought so much unquietness to His Mind and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and so much unsecureness to His Person, for the rest of His Life, that He could scarce truly boast of one day's Felicity, till God was pleased to put a final period to His Grie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and Sorrows. For in relation to the last, we find that the next Vote which passed in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, deprived Him of His <hi>Negative Voice,</hi> and put the whole <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi> of the Kingdom into the hands of the Houses. Which was the first beginning of His following Miseries. And looking on Him in the first, He will not spare to let us know in one of his Prayers, <hi>That the injury which he had done to the Bishops of</hi> England, <hi>did as much grate upon his Conscience, as either the permitting of a wrong way of Worship to be set up in</hi> Scotland; <hi>or suffering innocent blood to be shed under colour of Iustice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. For so it was, that some of the prevailing-Members in the House of Commons, considering how faithfully and effectually the <hi>Scots</hi> had served them, not only voted a Gratuity of Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pounds of good <hi>English</hi> Money, to be freely given them; but kept their Army in a constant and continual Pay, for Nine Months together. And by the terror of that Army, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the King to pass the Bill for Trienial Parliaments, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate the present Session at the will of the Houses; to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent for Murthering the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> with the Sword of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; and suffering the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to be banished from him; to fling away the Starr-Chamber, and the High-Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and the Coercive Power of Bishops; to part with all his right
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:54836:253"/>
to Tonnage and Poundage, to Ship-money, and the Act for Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and by retrenching the Perambulation of His Forests and Chases, to leave his Game to the destruction of each Bore or Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant. And by the terror of this Army, they took upon them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage all the Subjects of the Kingdom in a <hi>Protestation,</hi> first hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the third of <hi>May,</hi> in order to the condemnation of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> for maintenance of the Priviledges and Rights of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, standing to one another in pursuance of it, and bringing all persons to condign punishment who were suspected to oppose them. Encouraged also by the same, they took upon them an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of voting down the Church's Power in making of Canons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning all the Members of the late Convocation, calumniating ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Bishops and Clergy, in most odious manner, and vexing some of them to the Grave. And they would have done the like to the Church it self, in pulling down the Bishops and Cathedral Churches, and taking to themselves all their Lands and Houses, if by the Constancy and Courage of the House of Peers, they had not failed of their Design. But at the last, the King prevailed so far with the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissioners, that they were willing to retire and withdraw their Forces, upon His Promise to confirm the Acts of the Assembly at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and reach out such a Hand of Favour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that Nation, as might estate them in a happiness above their hopes. On this assurance they march homewards, and He followeth after. Where he consents to the abolishing of Bishops, and aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all their Lands by Act of Parliament; suppresseth, by like Acts, the Liturgy, and the Book of Canons, and the five Articles of <hi>Perth</hi>; rewards the chief Actors in the late Rebellion, with Titles, Offices, and Honours; and parts with so much of His Royal Prerogative to content the Subjects, that He left Himself nothing of a King, but the empty Name. And to sum up the whole in brief, In one hour He unravelled all that excellent Web, the weaving whereof had took up more than Forty years; and cost His Father and Himself so much Pains and Treasure.</p>
            <p n="13">13. By this Indulgence to the <hi>Scots,</hi> the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> are invited to expect the like, and to expect it in the same way which the <hi>Scots</hi> had travelled; that is to say, by seizing on His Forts and Castles, putting themselves into the Body of an Army, and forcing many of His good Protestant-Subjects to forsake the Kingdom. The Motives which induced them to it, their opportunities for putting it in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and the miscarriage of the Plot, I might here relate, but that I am to keep my self to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as dangerous Enemies to the King and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>Irish Papists.</hi> For so it hapned, that His Majesty was informed at His being in <hi>Scotland,</hi> That the <hi>Scots</hi> had neither took up Arms, nor invaded <hi>England,</hi> but that they were encouraged to it by some Members of the Houses of Parliament, on a design to change the Government both of Church and State. In which he was confirmed by the <hi>Remonstrance of the state of the Kingdom,</hi> presented to Him by the Commons at His first coming back; the forcible attempt for breaking into the
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:54836:253"/>
Abby of <hi>Westminster</hi>; the concourse of seditious people to the Dores of the Parliament, crying out, that they would have <hi>no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops nor Popish Lords</hi>; and their tumultuating in a fearful manner, even at <hi>White-Hall</hi> Gates, where they cryed out with far more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to the Hearers, <hi>That the King was not worthy to live; that they would have no Porter's Lodg between Him and them</hi>; and, <hi>That the Prince would govern better.</hi> Hereupon certain Members of both Houses; that is to say, the Lord <hi>Kimbolton</hi> of the Upper; <hi>Hollis</hi> and <hi>Haslerig, Hampden, Pym,</hi> and <hi>Stroud,</hi> of the Lower-House, are impeached of Treason, a Serjeant sent to apprehend them, and command given for sealing up their Trunks and Closets.</p>
            <p n="14">14. But on the contrary, the Commons did pretend and declared ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, That no Member of theirs was to be impeached, arrested, or brought unto a Legal Trial, but by the Order of that House; and, that the sealing up of their Trunks or Closets, was a breach of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. And thereupon it was resolved on <hi>Monday, Ian.</hi> 3. being the day of the Impeachment, <hi>That if any persons whatsoever, should come to the Lodgings of any Member of the House, or seize upon their persons, that then such Members should require the aid of the Constable to keep such persons in safe custody till the House gave further Order.</hi> And it was then resolved also, <hi>That if any person whatsoever, should offer to arrest or detain the person of any Member of their House, without first acquainting the House therewith, and receiving further Order from the House; that then it should be lawful for such Member, or any person, to resist him, and to stand upon his or their guard of defence; and to make resistance, according to the Protestation taken to defend the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of Parliament.</hi> This brings the King on <hi>Tuesday</hi> morning to the Commons House, attended only by His Guard, and some few Gentlemen, no otherwise weaponed than with Swords; where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving placed Himself in the Speaker's Chair, He required them to deliver the Impeached Members to the hands of Justice. But they had notice of His Purpose, and had retired into <hi>London</hi> as their safest Sanctuary; to which the whole House is adjourned also, and sits in the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> as a Grand Committee. The next day brings the King to the City also; where in a Speech to the Lord Mayor and Common-Council, He signified the Reasons of His going to the House of Commons; <hi>That He had no intent of proceeding other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise against the Members, than in a way of Legal Tryal; and thereupon desired, That they might not be harboured and protected in despite of Law.</hi> For answer whereunto, He is encountred with an insolent and sawcy Speech, made by one <hi>Fowk,</hi> a Member of the Common-Council, concerning the Impeached Members, and the King's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; and followed in the Streets by the Rascal-Rabble; by some of which, a Virulent and Seditious Pamphlet, entituled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Every man to his Tents, O Israel</hi>; is cast into His Coach; and nothing sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in His Ears, but <hi>Priviledges of Parliament, Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> with most horrible out-cries. The same night puts them into Arms, with great fear and tumult, upon a rumour that the King and the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> (for so they called such Officers of the late Army as
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:54836:254"/>
attended on him for their Pay) had a design to sack the City, who were then sleeping in their beds, and little dreamed of any such Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious practises as were then on foot for the enflaming of the people.</p>
            <p n="15">15. And now comes <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Doctrine for restraining the Power of Kings, to be put in practise. His Majesty's going to the House of Commons on the fourth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> is voted for so high a breach of their Rights and Priviledges, as was not to be salved by any <hi>Retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,</hi> or <hi>Disclaimer,</hi> or any thing by Him alledged in excuse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The Members are brought down in triumph both by Land and Water, guarded with Pikes and Protestations, to their several Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and the forsaken King necessitated to retire to <hi>Windsor,</hi> that he might not be an eye-witness of his own disgraces. The Lord <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> goes to <hi>Kingston</hi> in a Coach with six Horses, to bestow a visit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Collonel <hi>Lundsford,</hi> and some other Gentlemen; each Horse is reckoned for a Troop, and these Troops said to have appeared in a warlike manner. Which was enough to cause the prevailing-party of the Lords and Commons to declare against it; and by their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> to give command, <hi>That all the Sheriffs of the Kingdom, assisted by the Iustices and Trained-Bands of the Countrey, should take care to suppress all unlawful Assemblies, and to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Magazines of their several Counties.</hi> The King's Attorney must be called in question, examined, and endangered, for doing his duty in the impeachment of their Members, that no man might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after dare to obey the King. And though His Majesty had sent them a most Gracious Message of the twentieth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in which He promised them <hi>to equal or exceed all Acts of Favour which any of His Predecessors had extended to the People of</hi> England; yet nothing could secure them from their fears and jealousies, unless the Trained-bands, and the Royal Navy, the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and the rest of the Forts and Castles, were put into such hands as they might confide in. On this the King demurrs a while; but having shipped the Queen for <hi>Holland,</hi> with the Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> and got the Prince into his power, he denies it utterly. And this denial is reputed a sufficient reason to take the Militia to themselves, and execute the Powers thereof, without His consent.</p>
            <p n="16">

But leaving them to their own Councils, he removes to <hi>York,</hi> assembleth the Gentry of that County, acquaints them with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of His coming thither, and desires them not to be seduced by such false reports as had been raised to the dishonour of His Person, and disgrace of His Government. By their Advice he makes a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney unto <hi>Hull,</hi> in which he had laid up a considerable Magazine of Cannon, Arms, and Ammunition; intended first against the <hi>Scots,</hi> and afterwards designed for the Warr of <hi>Ireland</hi>; but now to be made use of in his own defence. And possibly He might have got it into His possession, if He had kept His own Counsel, and had not let some words fall from Him in a Declaration, which betrayed His purpose. For hereupon <hi>Hotham,</hi> a Member of their House, and one of the two Knights for the County of <hi>York,</hi> is sent to Garrison the
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:54836:254"/>
Town; who most audaciously refused to give him entrance, (though he was then accompanied with no more than his private Guards) and for so doing, is applauded and indempnified by the rest of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. This sends him back again to <hi>York,</hi> and there he meets as great a Baffle as he did at <hi>Hull.</hi> For there he is encountred with a new Committee from the House of Commons, consisting of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Cholmnly,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmnly,</hi> and Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton</hi>; sent thither on purpose to serve as Spies upon his actions, to undermine all his proceedings, and to insinuate into the people, that all their hopes of peace and happiness, depended on their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the present Parliament. And they applied themselves to their Instructions with such open Confidence, that the King had not more meetings with the Gentry of that County, in his Palace cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Mannor-house, than they had with the Yeomanry and Free-holders, in the great Hall of the Deanry. All which the King suffered very strangely, and thereby robbed himself of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of raising an Army in that County, with which he might have marched to <hi>London,</hi> took the Hen sitting on her Nest before she had hatched; and possibly, prevented all those Calamities which after followed.</p>
            <p n="17">17. But to proceed, during these counter-workings betwixt them and the King, the Lords and Commons plied him with continual Messages for his return unto the Houses; and did as frequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to possess the people with their Remonstrances and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to his disadvantage. To each of which, his Majesty return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a significant Answer, so handsomely apparelled, and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in them such a strength of Reason, as gave great satisfaction to all equal and unbyassed men. None of these Messages more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than that which brought the Nineteen Propositions to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's hands. In which it was desired, <hi>That all the Lords of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Council, all the great Officers both of Court and State, the two Chief Iustices, and the Chief Barons of the Exchequer, should be from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth nominated and approved by both Houses of Parliament. That all the great Affairs of the Kingdom, should be managed by them, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the naming of a Governour for his Majesty's Children, and for dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them in Marriage, at the will of the Houses.

But as for their Demand about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, he had answered it in part, before they made it, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering a Collection of sundry Petitions presented to himself and both Houses of Parliament, in behalf of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and for the preservation of the Liturgy, to be printed and published. By which Petitions it appeared, that there was no such general disaffection in
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:54836:255"/>
the Subjects, unto either of them, (whether they were within the power of the Houses, or beyond their reach) as by the Faction was pretended; the total number of Subscribers unto seven of them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (the rest not being calculated in the said Collection) amounting to Four hundred eighty two Lords and Knights, One thousand se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred and forty Esquires and Gentlemen of note, Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty one Doctors and Divines, and no fewer than Forty four thousand five hundred fifty nine Free-holders of good name and note.</p>
            <p n="18">18. And now the Warr begins to open. The Gentlemen of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> being sensible of that great affront which had been offered to his Majesty at the Gates of <hi>Hull</hi>; and no less sensible of those dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which were threatned to him by so ill a Neighbourhood, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves to be a Guard unto his person. The Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament upon the apprehension of some fears and jealousies, had took a Guard unto themselves in <hi>December</hi> last; but they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King had so much innocence, that he needed none: and therefore his accepting of this Guard of Gentlemen, is voted for a levying of Warr against the Parliament, and Forces must be raised in defence thereof. It hapned also, that some Members of the House of Commons, many of his Domestick Servants, and not a few of the Nobility and great men of the Realm, repaired from several places to the King at <hi>York</hi>; so far from being willing to involve themselves in other mens sins, that they declared the constancy of their adhaesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Majesty's service. These men they branded first by the Name of <hi>Malignants,</hi> and after looked upon them in the notion of evil Councellors; for whose removing from the King, they pretend to arm, (but now the stale device must be taken up) as well as in their own defence: Towards the raising of which Army, the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Preachers so bestir themselves, that the wealthy Citizens send in their Plate, the zealous Sisters rob'd themselves of their Bodkins and Thimbles, and some poor Wives cast in their Wedding-Rings, like the Widow's Mite, to advance the Service. Besides which, they set forth Instructions, dispersed into all parts of the Realm, for bringing in of Horses, Arms, Plate, Money, Jewels, to be repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in on the <hi>Publick Faith</hi>; appoint their Treasurers for the Warr; and nominate the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> for their chief Commander, whom some Disgraces from the Court had made wholly theirs. Him they commissionate to bring the King from his <hi>Evil Councellors,</hi> with power to kill and slay all such as opposed them in it. And that he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Service with a better Conscience, they laid fast hold on an Advantage which the King had given them, who in his Declaration of the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> either by some incogitancy, or the slip of his Pen, had put himself into the number of the Three Estates; for thereupon it was inferred, That the Two Houses were co-ordinate with him in the Publick Government; and being co-ordinate, might act any thing without his consent, especially in case of his refusal to co-operate with them, or to conform to their desires. Upon which ground, both to encrease their Party, and abuse the people, (who
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:54836:255"/>
still had held the Name of King in some veneration) the Warr is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged in the Name of <hi>King and Parliament,</hi> as if both equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Fortunes of it. It was also Preached and Printed by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to the same effect, (as <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Knox, Calvin</hi> and some others of the Sect had before delivered) <hi>That all Power was originally in the people of a State or Nation; in Kings no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than by Delegation, or by way of Trust; which Trust might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called when the People pleased. That when the underived Majesty</hi> (as they loved to phrase it) <hi>of the Common People, was by their volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary act transferred on the Supreme Magistrate, it rested on that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate no otherwise than</hi> cumulativè; <hi>but</hi> privativè <hi>by no means, in reference unto them that gave it. That though the King was</hi> Major sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis, <hi>yet he was</hi> Minor universis; <hi>Superior only unto any one; but far inferior to the whole Body of the People That the King had no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar property in his Lands, Rents, Ships, Arms, Towers, or Castles; which being of a publike nature, belonged as much to the people, as they did to him. That it was lawful for the Subjects to resist their Princes, even by force of Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to raise Armies also, if need required, for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Religion, and the common Liberties.</hi> And finally, (for what else can follow such dangerous premises?) <hi>That Kings being only the sworn Officers of the Commonwealth, they might be called to an account, and punished in case of Male-administration, even to Imprisonment, Deposition, and to Death it self, if lawfully convicted of it.</hi> But that which served their turns best, was a new distinction which they had coined between the <hi>Personal</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> capacity of the Supreme Magistrate; alledging, that the King was present with the Houses of Parliament, in his <hi>Political</hi> capacity, though in his <hi>Personal</hi> at <hi>York.</hi> That they might fight against the King in his <hi>Personal</hi> capacity, though not in his <hi>Politick</hi>; and consequently, might destroy <hi>CHARLES STVART,</hi> without hurting the King. This was good <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Doctrine; but not so edifying at <hi>York,</hi> as it was at <hi>Westminster.</hi> For his Majesty finding a necessity to defend <hi>CHARLES STVART,</hi> if he desired to save the <hi>King,</hi> began to entertain such Forces as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired unto him, and put himself into a posture of defence against all his Adversaries.</p>

Passing thorough <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some small encrease to his little Party; but never could attain unto the reputation of an Army, till he came to <hi>Shrewsbury</hi>; to which great multitudes flocked unto him out of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Cheshire,</hi> and some of the adjoining Countreys.

Anno</hi> 1642, being a just Twelve-month from the breaking out of the <hi>Irish Rebellion</hi>; this being more dangerous than that, because the King's Person was here aimed at more than any other. For so it was, that by corrupting one <hi>Blake,</hi> (once an <hi>English</hi> Factor, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards employed as an Agent from the King of <hi>Morocco</hi>) they were informed from time to time of the King's proceedings; and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, in what part of the Army he resolved to be; which made them aim with the greater diligence and fury, at so fair a Mark. But the King being Master of the Field, possest of the dead Bodies, and withall of the Spoil of some of the Carriages, discovered by some Letters this most dangerous practise. For which, that wretched Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low was condemned by a Court of Warr, and afterwards hanged upon the Bough of an Oak, not far from <hi>Abington.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="20">20. In the mean time the King goes forward, takes <hi>Banbury</hi> both Town and Castle, in the sight of the Enemy, and enters triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into <hi>Oxon,</hi> (which they had deserted to his hands) with no fewer than Six-score Colours of the vanquished Party. But either he stayed there too long, or made so many halts in his way, that <hi>Essex</hi> with his flying-Army had recovered <hi>London,</hi> before the King was come to <hi>Colebrook.</hi> There he received a Message for an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; made ineffectual by the Fight at <hi>Brentford</hi> on the next day after. Out of which Town he beat two of their choicest Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, sunk many pieces of Cannon, and much Ammunition, put many of them to Sword in the heat of the Fight, and took about Five hundred Prisoners for a taste of his Mercy. For knowing well how miserably they had been mis-guided, he spared their Lives, and gave them liberty on no other Conditions, but only the taking of their Oaths not to serve against him. But the Houses of Parliament being loath to lose so many good men, appointed Mr. <hi>Stephen Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall,</hi> (a principal Zealot at that time in the Cause of <hi>Presbytery</hi>) to call them together, and to absolve them from that Oath: Which he performed with so much Confidence and Authority, that the Pope himself could scarce have done it with the like. The next day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sunday,</hi> and the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> he prepares for <hi>London</hi>; but is advertised of a stop at <hi>Turnham-Green,</hi> two miles from <hi>Brentford</hi>; where both the remainders of the Army under the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and the Auxiliaries of <hi>London,</hi> under the Conduct of the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> were in a readiness to receive him. On this Intelligence it was resolved on mature deliberation, in the Council of Warr, That he should not hazzard that Victorious Army by a fresh encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which if he should lose the day, it would be utterly impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for him to repair that Ruin. Accordingly he leads his Army over <hi>Kingston</hi>-Bridg, leaves a third part of it in the Town of <hi>Reading,</hi> and with the rest takes up his Winter-Quarters in the City of <hi>Oxon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">21. But long he had not been at <hi>Oxon,</hi> when he received some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions from the Houses of Parliament, which by the temper and complexion of them, might rather seem to have proceeded from a conquering, than a losing-side. One to be sure must be in favour of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or else <hi>Stephen Marshal</hi>'s zeal had been ill regarded. And
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:54836:256"/>
in relation to <hi>Presbytery</hi> it was thus desired; that is to say, <hi>That his Majesty would give consent to a Bill for the utter abolishing and taking away of all Arch-bishops, Bishops, their Chancellors and Commissaries, Deans, Sub-deans, Deans and Chapters, Arch-deacons, Canons, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaries, and all Chaunters, Chancellors, Treasurers, Sub-treasurers, Succentors, and Sacrists, and all Vicars, Choral, and Choristers, old Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars and new Vicars, of any Cathedral or Collegiate Church, and all other their Vnder-officers, out of the Church of</hi> England. And that being done, that he would consent to another Bill for consultation to be had with Godly, Religious, and Learned Divines, and then to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Church-Government in such a way, as upon consultation with the said Divines should be concluded and agreed on by both Houses of Parliament. A Treaty howsoever did ensue upon these Propositions; but it came to nothing: the Commissioners for the Houses being so straitned in point of time, and tyed up so precisely to the Instructions of their Masters, that they could yeeld to nothing which conduced to the Publick peace. Nor was the North or South more quiet than the rest of the Kingdom: For in the North, the Faction of the Houses was grown strong and prevalent, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who had possest himself of some strong Towns and Castles; for maintenance whereof, he had supplies from <hi>Hull</hi> upon all occasions. The care of <hi>York</hi> had been committed by the King to the Earl of <hi>Cumberland</hi>; and <hi>Newcastle</hi> was then newly Garrisoned by the Ecrl thereof; whose Forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined to those of the Earl of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> gave <hi>Fairfax</hi> so much work, and came off so gallantly, that in the end both Parties came to an accord, and were resolved to stand as Neutrals in the Quarrel. Which coming to the knowledg of the Houses of Parliament, they found some <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Trick to dissolve that Contract, though ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by all the Obligations both of Honour and Conscience.</p>
            <p n="22">22. But in the South, the King's Affairs went generally from bad to worse; <hi>Portsmouth</hi> in <hi>Hampshire</hi> declared for him when he was at <hi>York:</hi> but being besieged, and not supplied either with Men, Arms, or Victuals, as had been promised and agreed on, it was surrendred by Col. <hi>Goring,</hi> the then Governour of it, upon Capitulation. <hi>Norton,</hi> a Neighbouring Gentleman of a fair Estate, was one of the first that shewed himself in Arms against it for the Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and one that held it out to the very last. For which good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he was afterward made a Collonel of Horse, Governour of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and one of the Committee for <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> after the Government of that Town had been taken from Sir <hi>William Lewis,</hi> on whom it was conferred at the first surrendry. A Party of the King's, commanded by the Lord Viscount <hi>Grandison,</hi> was followed so close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the heels by <hi>Brown</hi> and <hi>Hurrey,</hi> too mercenary <hi>Scots</hi> in the pay of the Houses, that he was forced to put himself into <hi>Winchester</hi>-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle; where having neither Victuals for a day, nor Ammunition for an hour, it was some favour to his Soldiers to be taken to Mercy. But whatsoever Mercy was exprest to them, the poor Town found but little, and the Church much less: the Town being miserably
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:54836:257"/>
plundered for no other reason, but that they were not able to keep <hi>Grandison</hi> out, had they been so minded. Which though it was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to impoverish a more Wealthy City; yet <hi>Waller</hi> had two pulls more at it in the course of the Warr, to the undoing of some Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and the spoil of others. But it was more defaced by <hi>Ogle</hi> about three years after, in burning down some Houses about the Castle; but most of all, by pulling down the Bishop's Palace, the Deanry, and no fewer than eight Prebends Houses, sold by the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> to make money of the Lead and Timber, the Iron, Glass, and Stones, which made up those Edifices.</p>
            <p n="23">23. But for the Church, though it was not the first Example of their Reformation, according to the practise of the <hi>Hugonot-French,</hi> the <hi>Scottish</hi> and the <hi>Belgick</hi> Zealots; yet fared it worse in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects than the other Cathedrals, because it fell unto the <hi>Scots</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding some <hi>Scotizing English</hi>) to do execution. For they not only broke the Organs in pieces, and defaced the Carved Work of the Quire, containing the story of the Old and New Testament, in most excellent Imagery; but threw down the Communion-Table, and broke down the Rails (which they burnt afterwards in an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house), and strewed the Pavements of the Quire, with the torn leaves and Fragments of the Common-prayer-Books. Next, they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the spoiling of the Tombs and Monuments, erected to the memory of some eminent Prelates, which had been formerly both an Ornament and an Honour to it; as namely, that of Cardinal <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> a principal Benefactor to the Church and Hospital of St. <hi>Cross,</hi> neighbouring near unto the City; and that of <hi>William Wainflet,</hi> the Magnificent and sole Founder of <hi>Magdalen</hi>-Colledg in <hi>Oxon.</hi> And whereas the Remainders of the Bodies of some <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, and many Bishops of those times, had been gathered into several Leaden Chests, by Bishop <hi>Fox,</hi> who lived and flourished in the last times of K. <hi>HENRY</hi> the 7th; the barbarous Soldiers Sacrilegiously threw down those Chests, scattered the dust remaining of their Bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wind, and threw their bones about the Pavements of the Church. They break down as many of the Glass Windows as they could reach with Swords and Pikes; and at the rest they threw the Bones of the dead Kings, or shot them down with their Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; the spoil of which Windows could not be repaired for one thousand pounds. After all this, they seize upon the Communion-Plate, the Surplices of the Priests and Quire-men, all the rich Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and large Cushions of Velvet, and the costly Pulpit-clothes, somes of which were of Cloath of Silver, and others of Gold. And finding two Brazen Statua's of K. <hi>IAMES,</hi> and K. <hi>CHARLES,</hi> at the first entrance of the Quire, they brake off the two Swords which were placed by their sides; and with their own, mangled the Crown upon the head of K. <hi>CHARLES,</hi> swearing in scorn, <hi>That they would bring him back again to his Houses of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="24">24. This hapned upon <hi>Thursday</hi> the fifteenth of <hi>December</hi>; and the same Month proved as calamitous to the Church of <hi>Chichester</hi>; which City had received some Soldiers of His Majesty's Party, who
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:54836:257"/>
either were too few to keep it, or found it not tenable enough to make any resistance. <hi>Waller</hi> presents himself before it, and without any great dispute, becomes Master of it; by which the Town got little, and the Church lost more. For upon <hi>Innocents-day,</hi> the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers forcibly break into it, where they seize upon the Vestments and Ornaments of the Church, together with the Consecrated Plate serving for the Altar, not leaving so much as a Cushion for the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, or a Chalice for the blessed Sacrament. But this rich spoil being committed by the Marshal and other Officers, the rest was left unto the hands and weapons of the common Soldiers, who with their Pole-axes did not only break down the Organs, but cut in pieces the Communion-Table, with the Rail before it. They defaced the two Tables of the Law at the East end of the Quire, for fear they should rise up against them in the Day of Judgment; most miserably made havock of the History of that Churches Foundation, which they found on the one side of the South-cross Isle, pourtrayed in Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner, with the Statues of the Kings of <hi>England</hi>; and coming to the Portraiture of K. <hi>EDWARD</hi> the sixth, they picked out his eyes, saying in scorn, <hi>That all this Mischief came from him, in establishing the Book of Common-prayer.</hi> Which that it might not be officiated as in former times, they break open all the Chests and Cupboards in which the Quire-men had laid up their Singing-Books, Common-Prayer-Books, Gowns, and Surplices; strewing the Pavements of the Church with the Leaves of the Books, but turning the Gowns and Surplices into ready money. To all which Acts of Sacrilegious Spoil and Rapine, as <hi>Waller</hi> gave some countenance by his personal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; and in that, somewhat worse than <hi>Nero</hi>

And when it was desired, that they would leave one Chalice only for the use of the Sacrament; answer was most prophanely made by one of the <hi>Scots,</hi> (of which Nation the two Houses had employed too many) <hi>That they might serve the turn with a Wooden Dish.</hi> Nor were some <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Zealots in the City of <hi>Exeter,</hi> more favourable to their own Cathedrals, than the rude Soldiers were to this; where being incensed by some of their Sedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="452" facs="tcp:54836:258"/>
the Communion-Table, tore the Velvet Cloath which they found about it; defaced the goodly Screen or Tabernacle-work, violated the Monuments of the dead, spoiled the Organs, brake down the ancient Rails and Seats, with the brazen Eagle which did support the Bible, forced open the Cupboards of the Singing-men, rent some of their Surplices, Gowns, and Bibles, and carried away others; mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the Service-Books, and Books of Common-Prayer, bestrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Pavement with the Leaves thereof. They also exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised their madness on the Arras Hangings which adorned the Quire, representing the whole story of our Saviour. And meeting with some of his Figures amongst the rest, some of them swore that they would stab him; and others, that they would rip up his bowels; which they did accordingly, so far forth at the least as those figures in the Arras Hanging could be capable of it. And finding another <hi>Statua</hi> of Christ placed in the Frontispiece of the South-Gate there, they discharged Forty Muskets at it, exceedingly triumphing when they hit him in the Head or Face. And it is thought they would have fallen upon the Fabrick, if at the humble suit of the Mayor and Citizens, they had not been restrained by their principal Officers. Less spoil was made at <hi>Rochester,</hi> though too much in that; their Follies being chiefly exercised in tearing the Book of Common-Prayer, and breaking down the Rails before the Altar. <hi>Seaton</hi> a <hi>Scot,</hi> and one of some command in the Army afterwards, took some displeasure at the Organs, but his hands were tyed; whether it were that <hi>Sandys</hi> repented of the Outrages which were done at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> or else afraid of giving more scandal and offence to the <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Gentry, I am not able to determine. But sure it is, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed but little eomfort in these first beginnings, receiving his death's wound about three Weeks after, in the fight near <hi>Powick</hi>; of which, within few Weeks more, he dyed at <hi>Worcester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="26">26. But I am weary of reciting such Spoils and Ravages as were not acted by the <hi>Goths</hi> in the sack of <hi>Rome.</hi> And on that score I shall not take upon me to relate the Fortunes of the present Warr, which changed and varied in the West, as in other places, till the Battel of <hi>Stratton</hi>; in which Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> with an handful of his gallant <hi>Cornish,</hi> raised by the reputation of Sir <hi>Bevil Greenvile,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Slaining,</hi> gave such a general defeat to the Western Rebels, as opened him the way towards <hi>Oxon</hi> with small opposition. Twice troubled in his March, by <hi>Waller,</hi> grown famous by his taking of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> and relieving <hi>Glocester</hi>; but so defeated in a fight at <hi>Roundway-Down,</hi> (<hi>Run-away Down,</hi> the Soldiers called it) that he was forced to flye to <hi>London</hi> for a new Recruit. Let it suffice, that the King lost <hi>Reading</hi> in the Spring, received the Queen trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly into <hi>Oxon</hi> within a few Weeks after, by whom he was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with such a considerable stock of Arms aud other Necessaries, as put him into a condition to pursue the Warr. This Summer makes him Master of the North and West; the North being wholly clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Enemy's Forces, but such as seemed to be imprisoned in the Town of <hi>Hull.</hi> And having lost the Cities of <hi>Bristol</hi> and <hi>Exon,</hi> no
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:54836:258"/>
Towns of consequence in the West remained firm unto them, but <hi>Pool, Lime,</hi> and <hi>Plymouth</hi>: so that the leading-members were upon the point of forsaking the Kingdom, and had so done (as it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reported, and averred for certain) if the King had not been diverted from his march to <hi>London,</hi> upon a confidence of bringing the strong City of <hi>Glocester</hi> to the like submission. This gave them time to breathe a little, and to advise upon some course for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; and no course was found fitter for them, than to invite the <hi>Scots</hi> to their aid and succour, whose amity they had lately purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at so deer a rate. Hereupon <hi>Armin</hi> and some others are dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Scotland</hi>; where they applied themselves so dextrously to that proud and rebellious people, that they consented at the last to all things which had been desired. But they consented on such terms as gave them an assurance of One hundred thousand pound in ready money; the Army to be kept both with Pay and Plunder; the chief Promoters of the Service to be rewarded with the Lands and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the <hi>English</hi> Bishops, and their Commissioners; to have as great an influence in all Counsels both of Peace and Warr, as the Lords and Commons.</p>
            <p n="27">27. But that which proved the strongest temptation to engage them in it, was an assurance of reducing the Church of <hi>England</hi> to an exact conformity, in Government and Forms of Worship, to the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and gratifying their Revenge and Malice, by prosecuting the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to the end of his Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For compassing which Ends, a Solemn League and Covenant is agreed between them; first taken and subscribed to, by the <hi>Scots</hi> themselves; and afterwards by all the Members in both Houses of Parliament; as also, by the principal Officers of the Army, all the Divines of the Assembly, almost all those which lived within the Lines of Communication, and in the end by all the Subjects which either were within their power, or made subject to it. Now by this Covenant the Party was to bind himself, amongst other things, first, <hi>That he would endeavour in his place and calling, to preserve the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion in</hi> Scotland, <hi>in Doctrine, Discipline, and Government: That he would endeavour, in like manner, the Reformation of Religion in the Kingdoms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>according to the Word of God, and the example of the best Reformed Churches; but more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, to bring the Churches of God in all the three Kingdoms, to the nearest conjunction and uniformity in Religion, Confession of Faith, Form of Church-Government, and</hi> Directory <hi>for Worship, and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That without respect of persons they would endeavour to extirpate Popery and Prelacy; that is to say, Church-Government by Arch-bishops, Bishops, their Chancellors &amp; Commissairs, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Arch-deacons, and all other Ecclesiastical Officers depending on it.</hi> And thirdly, <hi>That he would endeavour the discovery of such as have been, or shall be Incendiaries, Malignants, and evil Instruments, either in hindering the Reformation of Religion, or in dividing between the King and his people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whom they should bring to condign punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the Supream Iudicatories of either Kingdom, as their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:54836:259"/>
should deserve.</hi> Of which three Articles, the two first tended to the setting up of their dear Presbyteries; the last, unto the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the late Arch-bishop, whom they considered as their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most mortal Enemy.</p>
            <p n="28">28. The terror of this Covenant, and the severe penalty imposed on those which did refuse it, compelled great numbers of the Clergy to forsake their Benefices, and to betake themselves to such Towns and Garrisons as were kept under the command of his Majesty's Forces; whose vacant places were in part supplied by such <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> who formerly had lived as Lecturers or Trencer-Chaplains: or else bestowed upon such Zealots as flocked from <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> like <hi>Vultures</hi> and other Birds of Rapine, to seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the prey. But finding the deserted Benefices not proportionable to so great a multitude, they compelled many of the Clergy to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their Houses, that so they might avoid imprisonment or some worse Calamity. Others they sent to several Gaols, or shut them up in Ships whom they exposed to storms and tempests, and all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series which a wild Sea could give to a languishing stomack. And some again they sequestred under colour of scandal, imputing to them such notorious and enormous Crimes, as would have rendered them uncapable of Life, as well as Livings, if they had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But that which added the most weight to these Oppressions, was the publishing of a malicious and unchristian Pamphlet, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The first Century of Scandalous and Malignant Priests</hi>: which, whether it were more odious in the sight of God, or more disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Church, or offensive to all sober and religious men, it is hard to say. And as it seems, the scandal of it was so great, that the Publisher thereof, though otherwise of a fiery and implacable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, desisted from the putting forth of a <hi>Second Century,</hi> though he had promised it in the <hi>First,</hi> and was inclinable enough to have kept his word. Instructions had been sent before to all Counties in <hi>England,</hi> for bringing in such Informations against their Ministers as might subject them to the danger of a Deprivation. But the times were not then so apt for mischief, as to serve their turns; which made them fall upon these wretched and unchristian courses to effect their purpose. By means whereof, they purged the Church of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Canonical and Orthodox men. The greatness of which desolation in all the parts of the Kingdom, may be computed by the havock which they made in <hi>London,</hi> and the Parishes thereunto adjoining, according as it is presented in the Bill of Mortality here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto subjoined.</p>

               <pb n="459" facs="tcp:54836:261"/>30. By this sad Bill confined within the <hi>Lines of Commuuication,</hi> and some Villages adjoining, we may conjecture at the greatness of that <hi>Mortality</hi> which fell amongst the Regular Clergy in all parts of the Kingdom, by <hi>Plundring, Sequestring,</hi> and <hi>Ejecting</hi>; or finally, by vexing them into their Graves, by so many Miseries as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on them in the Ships, or their several Prisons. In all which ways, more men were outed of their Livings by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the space of Three years, than were deprived by the <hi>Papists</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; or had been <hi>silenced, suspended,</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived,</hi> by all the Bishops, from the first year of Queen <hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> to these very times. And that it might be done with some colour of Justice, they instituted a <hi>Committee for Plundred Ministers,</hi> under pretence of making some provision for such godly Preachers as had either suffered loss of Goods by His Majesty's Soldiers, or loss of Livings for adhering to the Houses of Parliament. Under which stiles they brought in a confused Rabble of their own perswasions, or such at least as were most likely to be serviceable to their ends and purposes; some of which had no Goods, and most of them no Livings at all to lose. But the truth was, they durst not trust the Pulpits to the Regular Clergy; who if they had offended against the Laws, by the same Laws they ought to have been tryed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and deprived accordingly; that so the Patrons might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent more deserving persons to the vacant Churches. But then this could not stand with the main Design: For possibly the Patrons might present such Clarks as would go on in the old way, and could not be admitted but by taking the Oaths of Supremacy and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to our Lord the King; and by subscribing to the Discipline and Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which they were then resolved to alter. Or, could they have prevailed so far with the several Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, as to present those very men whom they had designed unto the Profits of the Sequestred Benefices; yet then they were to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed them for <hi>term of life,</hi> and might pretend a Legal Right and Title to them, which would have cut off that dependance on the Houses of Parliament, which this Design did chiefly aim at. So that the best of this new Clergy were but <hi>Tenants at will</hi>; and therefore must be servile and obsequious to their mighty Landlords, upon whose pleasure they depended for their present Livelihood.</p>
            <p n="31">31. Such were the Mischiefs of this year. For remedy whereof, His Majesty most graciously published two Proclamations, one of them bearing date the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi>; and the other, on the 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October.</hi> In the first of which, His Majesty takes especial notice, <hi>That many of the Clergy, no less eminent for their Learning, than their Zeal and Piety, were either driven or forced from their habitations, or silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or discharged from attending on their Cures: That they suffered these oppressions for no other reasons, but because they published his legal and just Commands, or had refused to pray against Him, or to submit, against their Consciences, to illegal Taxes for the continuance of the Warr; or were comformable to the Book of Common-Prayer, or preacht God's Word according to the purity of it, without any mixture of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:54836:262"/>
That being for these Crimes discharged of their several Cures, others were put into their Places to sow Sedition, and seduce His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's good Subjects from their due obedience, contrary to the Word of God, and the Laws of the Land. His Majesty thereupon commandeth, That all such courses be forborn for the time to come. That all His good Subjects for the present set forth their Tythes, and pay them to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Incumbents, <hi>or their Farmers only. That the Church-Wardens, Side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and other Parishioners, shall resist all such persons as have been, or shall be intruded into any of the Cures aforesaid: but, that they should contribute their best assistance to the lawful Ministers, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and enjoying of their Glebes and Tythes. With an Injunction to all Sheriffs, Mayors, and other Ministers of Iustice, to be aiding to them, and to resist by force of Arms all such as should endeavour to disturb them in their lawful possessions.</hi> But this served rather for a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His Majesty's Piety, than an Example of His Power. For notwithstanding all this Care, his faithful Subjects of the Clergy in all parts of the Realm, were plundred, sequestred, and ejected for the Crime of Loyalty; some of them never being restored, and others most unjustly kept from their Estates till this present year, <hi>Anno</hi> 1660.</p>
            <p n="32">32. In the other Proclamation he forbids the tendring or taking of the Covenant before remembred. Which Proclamation being short, but full of substance, shall be recited in His Majesty's own words, which are these that follow. <hi>Whereas</hi> (saith he) <hi>there is a printed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per entituled,</hi> A Solemn League and Covenant for Reformation and Defence of Religion, the Honour and Happiness of the King, the Peace and Safety of the Three Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland; pretended to be ordered by the Commons in Parliament, on the</hi> 21 <hi>of</hi> September <hi>last, to be printed and published. Which Covenant, though it seems to make some specious expressions of Piety and Religion, is in truth nothing else but a Traiterous and Seditious Combination against Vs, and against the established Religion and Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in pursuance of a Traiterous Design and Endeavour to bring in Forreign Forces to invade this Kingdom. We do therefore straightly charge and command all Our loving Subjects, of what degree or quality soever, upon their Allegiance, that they presume not to take the said Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and Traiterous Covenant. And We do likewise hereby forbid and inhibit them to impose, administer, or tender the said Covenant, as they and every of them will answer the contrary at their utmost and extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est perils.</hi> Such was the tenour of this Proclamation of the 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October</hi>; which though it served for a sufficient testimony of His Majesty's Prudence, yet it prevailed as little as the other did: For, as the Two Houses did extend their Quarters, and enlarge their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; so were the Subjects forced more generally to receive this yoak, and to submit themselves to those Oaths and Covenants which they could neit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r take for fear of God's and the King's Displeasure; and dared not to refuse, for fear of losing all which was dear unto them. So that it was esteemed for a special favour, as indeed it was, for all those which came in on the <hi>Oxford Articles,</hi> to be exempted from the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:54836:262"/>
taking of this leud and accursed Covenant, by which they were to bind themselves to betray the Church, and to stand no further to the King, than as he stood for the <hi>defence</hi> of that <hi>Religion</hi> which they then allowed of, and of those <hi>Liberties</hi> which they had acquired by what way soever.</p>
            <p n="33">33. And to say truth, it was no wonder that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> should impose new Oaths, when they had broken all the old; or seize upon the Tythes and Glebes of the Regular Clergy, when they had sequestred the Estates of the Loyal Gentry, and intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Revenues of the King and Queen. And it would be no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der neither that they should seize on the Revenues of the King and Queen, when they were grown to such a high degree of impudence, as to impeach the Queen of Treason, and were resolved of having no more Kings to comptroll their Actions. They had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready voted for the making of a new Great Seal, (though so to do, was made High Treason by the Statute of K. <hi>EDWARD</hi> the third) that they might expedite their Commissions with the more Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and add some countenance of Law to the present Warr. Which must be managed in the Name of the King and Parliament, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to abuse the people, and add some Reputation to the Crime of their undertakings. And being Masters of a Seal, they thought themselves in a capacity of acting as a Common-wealth, as a State distinct; but for the present, making use of His Majesty's Name as their <hi>State-holder,</hi> for the ordering of their new Republick. But long He must not hold that neither; though that was locked up as a Secrete amongst those of the <hi>Cabala,</hi> till it was blurted out by <hi>Martin,</hi> then Knight for <hi>Berks.</hi> By whom it was openly declared, <hi>That the felicity of this Nation did not consist in any of the House of STVART.</hi> Of which His Majesty complained, but without repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And for a further evidence of their good intentions, a view is to be taken of the old <hi>Regalia,</hi> and none so fit as <hi>Martin</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that Service. Who having commanded the Sub-dean of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> to bring him to the place in which they were kept, made himself Master of the Spoil. And having forced open a great Iron Chest, took out the Crowns, the Robes, the Swords, and Scepter, belonging anciently to K. <hi>EDWARD</hi> the Confessor, and used by all our Kings at their Inaugurations. With a scorn greater than his Lusts, and the rest of His Vices, he openly declares, <hi>That there would be no further use of those Toys and Trifles.</hi> And in the jollity of that humour, invests <hi>George Withers</hi> (an old <hi>Puritan Satyrist</hi>) in the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Habiliments. Who being thus Crown'd, and Royally array'd, (as right well became him) first marcht about the Room with a stately Garb, and afterwards with a thousand Apish and Ridiculous actions, exposed those Sacred Ornaments to contempt and laughter. Had the <hi>Abuse</hi> been <hi>script and whipt,</hi> as it should have been, the foolish Fellow possibly might have passed for a <hi>Prophet,</hi> though he could not be reckoned for a <hi>Poet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="34">34. But yet the mischief stayed not here. Another visit is bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon these <hi>Regalia</hi>; not to make merry with them, but some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:54836:263"/>
of them: <hi>Mildmay,</hi> a <hi>Puritan</hi> in Faction, and Master of the Jewel-House by his Place and Office, conceived that Prey to belong properly to him; and having sold the King, must needs buy the Crowns. But being as false to his new Masters, as he was to his old, he first pickt out the richest Jewels, and then compounded for the rest at an easie rate. The like ill fortune fell unto the Organs, Plate, Coaps, Hangings, Altar-Cloaths, and many other costly U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensils which belonged to the Church; all which were either broke in pieces, or seized upon and plundered for the use of the State. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest, there was a goodly Challice of the purest Gold; which though it could not be less worth than 300 <hi>l.</hi> was sold to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn</hi> a decayed Gold-Smith, but then a Member of the House, at the rate of 60 <hi>l.</hi> The Birds being flown, the Nest is presently designed to the use of the Soldiers, who out of wantonness, and not for want of Lodging in that populous City, must be quartered there. And being quartered, they omitted none of those shameless Insolencies which had been acted by their Fellows in other Churches. For they not only brake down the Rails before the Table, and burnt them in the very place in the heats of <hi>Iuly</hi>; but wretchedly prophaned the very Table it self, by setting about it with their Tobacco and Ale before them, and not without the company of some of their zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Lecturers to grace the Action. What else they did in imitation of the Brethren of <hi>Exon,</hi> in laying their filth and execrements about it also, I abhor to mention. And now I must crave leave to step into the Colledg, the Government whereof was taken from the Dean and Prebendaries, and given to a select Committee of fifty persons, some Lords, but Members, for the most part, of the Lower-House; who found there a sufficient quantity of Plate, and some other good Houshold-stuff, to a very good value; which was so Husbanded amongst them, that it was either stoln, or sold, or otherwise imbezil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and inverted to the use of some private persons, who best knew how to benefit themselves by the Church's Patrimony.</p>
            <p n="35">35. But the main business of this year, and the three next following, was the calling, sitting, and proceedings of the new Assembly, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Assembly of Divines</hi>; but made up also of so many of the Lords and Commons, as might both serve as well to keep them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and comptroll their Actions, as to add some countenance unto them in the eye of the people. A Convocation had been appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King when he called the Parliament, the Members where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being lawfvlly chosen and returned, were so discountenanced and discouraged by the Votes of the Lower-House, the frequent Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults raised in <hi>Westminster</hi> by the Rascal Rabble, and the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for a Warr against the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they retired unto their Houses, but still continued undissolved, and were in a capacity of acting as a Convocation, whensoever they should be thereunto required, and might do it with safety. But being for the most part well affected to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they were not to be trusted by the Houses of Parliament, who then designed the hammering of such a <hi>Reformation</hi> both in Doctrine and Discipline, as might unite them in a perpetual
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:54836:263"/>
Bond and Confederation with their <hi>Scottish</hi> Brethren. And that they might be furnished with such men, the Knights of every Shire must make choice of two to serve as Members for that County; most of them <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> some few <hi>Royallists,</hi> four of the <hi>Independent</hi> Faction, and two or three to represent the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Which ploughing with an Ox and an Ass, (as it was no other) was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prohibited by the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And yet these men, associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with some Members of either House, as before is said, no ways impow'red or authorised by the rest of the Clergy, must take upon them all the Powers and Priviledges of a Convocation; to which they were invited by an Ordinance of the Lords and Commons, bearing date <hi>Iune</hi> the 12<hi>th.</hi> His Majesty makes a start at this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment on His Royal Prerogative, and countermands the same by His Proclamation of the 22<hi>d.</hi> In which He takes notice, amongst other things, That the far greatest part of those who had been nominated to the present Service, were men of neither <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Reputation, eminently disaffected to the Government of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and such as had openly preached Rebellion, by their exciting of the people to take Arms against Him</hi>; and therefore were not like to be proper Instruments of Peace and Happiness, either unto the Church or State: For maintenance whereof, and for the preservation of His own Authority, he inhibits them from meeting at the time appointed, declares their Acts to be illegal, and threatens them with the punishments which they had incurred by the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p n="36">36. But they go forwards howsoever, hold their first Meeting on the first of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and elect Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> of <hi>Newberry,</hi> (a rigid <hi>Sabbata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> but a professed <hi>Calvinian</hi> in all other points) for their Prolocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor) called to this <hi>Iourney-work</hi> by the Houses; they were dispensed with for Non-residence upon their Livings, against the Laws, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the best Benefices of the Sequestred Clergy, (some of them three or four together) and had withall four shillings a man for their daily wages, besides the honour of assisting in so great an action, as the ruin of the Church, and the subversion of the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Realm of <hi>England.</hi> In reference whereunto, they were to be employed from time to time, as occasion was, <hi>to stir up the people of the Counties</hi> for which they served, <hi>to rise and arm</hi> themselves against the King, under colour of <hi>their own defence,</hi> as appears plainly by the Order of the tenth of <hi>August.</hi> And that they might be looked upon with the greater reverence, they maintain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant intercourse, by Letters, with their Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Churches of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Switzers</hi>; but chiefly, with <hi>Geneva</hi> it self. In which they laid such vile Reproaches on His Majesty and the Church of <hi>England</hi>; the one, for having a design to bring in Popery; the other, for a readiness to receive the same; that His Majesty was necessitated to set out a Manifest in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, for laying open the Imposture to the Churches of all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations. Amongst the rest of this Assembly, Dr. <hi>Dan. Featly,</hi> not long before made Chaplain in Ordinary to the King, must needs
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:54836:264"/>
sit for one; whether to shew his Parts, or to head a Party, or out of his old love to <hi>Calvinism,</hi> may best be gathered from some Speeches which he made and printed. But he was theirs in heart before, and therefore might afford them his body now, though possibly he may be excused from taking the Covenant, as the others did. An <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> whereunto, was the first great work which was performed by these Masters in <hi>Israel,</hi> after their assembling; the Covenant taken by them in most solemn manner at St. <hi>Margarets</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi> on the 25th of <hi>September,</hi> the <hi>Exhortation</hi> voted to be published on the 9th of <hi>February.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="37">37. Now to begin the blessed Reformation which they had in hand, the Houses were resolved upon exterminating all external Pomp, and comely Order, out of the Worship of Almighty God. And to this end, upon the humble motion of these Divines of the Assembly, and the sollicitation of some zealous Lecturers, who were grown very powerful with them; or to ingratiate themselves with the <hi>Scottish</hi> Covenanters, whose help they began to stand in need of; or finally, out of the perversness of their own cross humours, they published an Ordinance on the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August, For the utter demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing, removing, and taking away all Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry.</hi> Under which notion it was ordered, <hi>That before the last of</hi> November <hi>then next following, all Altars and Tables of stone</hi> (as if any such were then erected!) <hi>should be demolished in all Churches and Chappels throughout the Kingdom. That the Communion-Tables should in all such places be removed from the East end of the Chancel, unto some other part of the Church or Chappel. That all such Rails as had been placed before or about the same, should be taken away, and the ground levelled with the rest, which had been raised for the standing of any such Table, within the space of twenty years then last past. That all Tapers, Candlesticks, and Basons, which had of late been used on any of the said Tables, should also be removed and taken away; neither the same, nor any such like, to be from thenceforth used in God's Publick Service. That all Crucifixes, Crosses, and all Images and Pictures of any one or more Persons of the Trinity, or of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and all other Images and Pictures of Saints, should be also demolished and defaced, whether they stood in any of the said Churches or Chappels, or in any Church-yard or other open place whatsoever, never to be erected or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed again:</hi> With a Proviso notwithstanding, <hi>for preserving all Images, Pictures, and Coats of Arms, belonging to any of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, or any of the Kings of this Realm, or any other deceased persons which were not generally considered and beheld as Saints.</hi>

            <p n="38">38. But yet to make sure work of it, this Ordinance was re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced and enlarged by another of the 9th of <hi>May,</hi> in the year next following; wherein, besides the particulars before recited, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to the taking away of all Coaps, Surplices, and other Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Vestments (as they pleased to call them); as also to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of all Organs, and the Cases in which they stood, and the defacing of the same; requiring the same course to be also taken in the removing and defacing of Roods, Rood-Lofts, and Holy-water-water-Fonts
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:54836:264"/>
(as if any such things had been of late erected or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as indeed there were not): where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followed the defacing of all Glass Windows, and the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of all Organs within the compass of their power; the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of the holy Table from the place of the Altar, into some other part of the Church or Chancel; the tearing and defacing of all Coaps and Surplices, or otherwise employing them to domestick uses; and finally, the breaking down and removing of the Sacred Fonts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently used for the Ministration of holy Baptism; the name of <hi>Holy-water-fonts</hi> being extended &amp; made use of to comprise them also: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followed also the defacing and demolishing of many Crosses e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected as the Monuments of Christianity, in Cities, Towns, and most of our Country-Villages; none being spared which came within the compass of those Enemies of the Cross of Christ. Amongst which Crosses none more eminent for Cost and Workmanship, than those of <hi>Cheapside</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Abington</hi> in the County of <hi>Berks</hi>; both of them famous for the excellencies of the Statua's which were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in them; more for the richness of the trimming which was used about them. But the Divine Vengeance fell on some of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners, for a terror to others; one of them being killed in pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down the Cross of <hi>Cheapside</hi>; and another hanged at <hi>Stow on the Wold,</hi> within short time after he had pulled down the first Image of the Cross in <hi>Abington.</hi> And because no Order had been made for the executing of this Order in His Majesty's Chappels (as there was in all Cathedral and Parish-Churches), a private Warrant was obtained by <hi>Harlow,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> for making the said Chappels equal to all the rest, by depriving them of all such Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of State and Beauty with which they had been constantly adorned in all times since the Reformation. And all this done, (or at the least pretended to be done, as the Ordinance tell us) as being pleasing unto God, and visibly conducing to the blessed Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation so much desired; but desired only, as it seems, by those Lords and Commons who had a hand in the Design.</p>
            <p n="39">39. So far they went to show their hatred unto Superstition, their dislike of <hi>Popery</hi>: but then they must do somewhat also for expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their great zeal to the glory of God, by some Acts of Piety. And nothing seemed more pious, or more popular rather, than to enjoin the more strict keeping of their <hi>Lords-day-Sabbath,</hi> by some publick Ordinance. With this they had begun already on the fifth of <hi>May,</hi> on which it was ordered by no worse men than the Commons in Parliament, (the Lords being either not consulted, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring) That His Majesty's Book for <hi>tolerating sports on the Lord's Day,</hi> should be forthwith burned by the hands of the common Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in <hi>Cheapside</hi> and other usual places; and that the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middlesex</hi> should see the same put in execution; which was done accordingly. Than which, an Act of a greater scorn, an Act of greater Insolency and disloyal impudence, was never offered to a Soveraign and Annointed Prince. So as it was no marvel if the Lords joined with them in the Ordinance of the sixth of <hi>April,</hi> 1644,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:54836:265"/>
for to expose all Books to the like disgrace which had been writ, or should be writ hereafter by any person or persons, against the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Sabbath: By which Ordinance it was also signified, <hi>That no manner of person whatsoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should publickly cry, shew forth, and expose to sale any Wares, Merchandises, Fruits, Herbs, or other Goods, upon that day, on pain of forfeiting the same; or travel, carry burthens, or do any act of Labour on it on pain of forfeiting Ten shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for the said offence. That no person from thenceforth on the said day should use, exercise, keep, maintain, or be present at any wrestling, shooting, bowling, ringing of Bells for pleasure or pastime, Mask, Wake, (otherwise called Feasts) Church-Ale, Games, Dancing, Sport, or other pastimes whatsoever, under the several penalties therein contained.</hi> And that we may perceive with what weighty cares the heads of these good men were troubled, when the whole Nation was involved in Blood and Ruin; a Clause was added for the taking down of <hi>May-poles</hi> also; with a Command unto all Constables and Tything-men, to see it done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under the penalty of forfeiting five shillings weekly, till the said <hi>May-poles</hi> (which they looked upon as an <hi>Heathenish Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>) should be quite removed. Which Nail was driven so far at last, that it was made unlawful for any Taylor to carry home a new Suit of Clothes, or any Barber to trim the man that was to wear them; for any Water-man to Ferry a passenger cross the <hi>Thames</hi>; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, to any person whatsoever (though neither new trimmed, or new apparelled) to sit at his own door, or to walk the streets, or take a mouth-full of fresh air in the open Fields. Most Rabinical Dotages!</p>
            <p n="40">40. The day of publick Worship being thus new-molded, they must have new Priests also, and new Forms of Prayer, a new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Faith, new Catechisms, and new Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Towards the first, an Ordinance comes out from the Lords and Commons in <hi>October</hi> following, (Advice being first had with the Assembly of Divines) by which a power was given to some chief men of the Assembly, and certain Ministers of <hi>London,</hi> or to any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or more of them, to impose hands upon such persons whatsoever whom they found qualified and gifted for the holy Ministry; a Clause being added thereunto, That every person and persons which were so ordained, should be reputed, deemed, and taken for a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> sufficiently authorised for any Office or Employment in it, and capable of receiving all advantages which appertained to the same. To shew the nullity and invalidity of which <hi>Ordinations,</hi> a learned Tractate was set out by Dr. <hi>Bohe,</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain sometimes to the Right Reverend Dr. <hi>Houson,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Oxford</hi> first, and of <hi>Durham</hi> afterwards. Never since answered by the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> either <hi>Scots</hi> or <hi>English.</hi> Next after, comes the <hi>Directory,</hi> or new Form of Worship, accompanied with an Ordinance of the Lords and Commons on the third of <hi>Ianuary</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for authorising the said <hi>Directory</hi> or Form of Worship; as also, for suppressing the publick Liturgy, repealing all the Acts of Parliament which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the same, and abrogating all the ancient and established Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:54836:265"/>
that so <hi>Saint Sabbath</hi> (as sometimes they called it) might be all in all. The insufficiency of which Directory to the Ends proposed in the same, pronounced the weakness of the Ordinance which autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised it, and the excellency of the publick Liturgy in all the parts and offices of it; was no less learnedly evinced by Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then newly made a Chaplain in ordinary to His Sacred Majesty. Which though it might have satisfied all equal and unbyassed men, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Learning nor Reason could be heard in the new Assembly; or if it were, the voice thereof was drowned by the noise of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
            <p n="41">41. For on the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>August, Anno</hi> 1645, another Ordinance comes thundering from the Lords and Commons, for the more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Execution of the Directory for publick Worship; with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Clauses in the same, not only for dispersing and use thereof, but for calling in the Book of Common-prayer, under several penalties. Which coming to His Majesty's knowledg, as soon as he returned to His Winter-Quarters, He published His Proclamation of the 13th of <hi>November,</hi> commanding in the same the use of the Common-Prayer, notwithstanding any Ordinance to the contrary from the Houses of Parliament.
<q>For taking notice, first, of those notable Benefits which had for Eighty years redounded to this Nation by the use of the Liturgy; He next observes, that by abolishing the said Book of Common-Prayer, and imposing the Directory, a way would be left open for all Ignorant, Factious, and Evil men, to broach their Fancies and Conceits, be they never so erroneous, to mislead peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into Sin and Rebellion against the King, to raise Factions and Divisions in the Church; and finally, to utter those things for their Prayers in the Congregation, to which no Conscientious can say <hi>Amen.</hi> And thereupon He gives Commandment to all Ministers in their Parish-Churches, to keep and use the said Book of Common-Prayer, in all the Acts and Offices of God's Publick Worship, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws made in that behalf; and that the said <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi> should in no sort be admitted, received, or used; the said pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Ordinances, or any thing contained in them to the contrary notwithstanding.</q>
But His Majesty sped no better by His Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, than the two Doctors did before by their Learned Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For if He had found little or no obedience to his Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when he was strong, and in the head of a victorious and successful Army, He was not to expect it in a low condition, when his Affairs were ruinated and reduced to nothing.</p>
            <p n="42">42. For so it was, that the <hi>Scots</hi> having raised an Army of Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thousand Foot, and Three thousand Horse, taking the Dragoons into the reckoning, break into <hi>England</hi> in the depth of Winter, <hi>Anno</hi> 1643, and marched almost as far as the Banks of the River <hi>Tine,</hi> without opposition. There they received a stop by the coming of the Marquess of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> with his Northern Army, and entertain'd the time with some petit skirmishes, till the sad news of the surprise of <hi>Selby</hi> by Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> compelled him to return towards <hi>York</hi> with all his Forces, for the preserving of that place, on which
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:54836:266"/>
the safety of the North did depend especially. The <hi>Scots</hi> march af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him amain, and besiege that City, in which they were assisted by the Forces of the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Manchester,</hi> who by the Houses were commanded to attend that Service. The issue whereof was briefly this; that having worsted the great Army of Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> at <hi>Marston-moor,</hi> on the second of <hi>Iuly, York</hi> yeelded on Composition upon that day fortnight; the Marquess of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> with many Gentlemen of great Note and Quality, shipt themselves for <hi>France</hi>; and the strong Town of <hi>Newcastle</hi> took in by the <hi>Scots</hi> on the 19th of <hi>October</hi> then next following. More fortunate was His Majesty with His <hi>Southern</hi> Army, though at the first he was necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to retire from <hi>Oxon</hi> at such time as the Forces under <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi> did appear before it. The news whereof being brought unto them, it was agreed that <hi>Waller</hi> should pursue the King, and that the Earl's Army should march Westward to reduce those Countreys. And here the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> began to show its self in its proper colours. For whereas they pretended to have raised their Army for no other end, but only to remove the King from his <hi>Evil Councellors,</hi> those <hi>Evil Councellors,</hi> as they call them, were left at <hi>Oxon,</hi> and the King only hunted by his insolent Enemies. But the King having to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally broken <hi>Waller</hi> in the end of <hi>Iune,</hi> marched after <hi>Essex</hi> into <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire,</hi> and having shut him up in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where he had neither room for forrage, nor hope of succours, he forced him to flye inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously in a Skiff or Cockboat, and leave his Army in a manner to the Conqueror's Mercy. But his Horse having the good fortune to save themselves, the King gave quarter to the Foot, reserving to Himself their Cannons, Arms, and Ammunition, as a sign of His Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. And here again the Warr might possibly have been ended, if the King had followed his good fortune, and march'd to <hi>London</hi> before the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had united his scattered Forces, and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> was returned from the Northern Service. But setting down before <hi>Plymouth</hi> now, as he did before <hi>Glocester</hi> the last year, he lost the opportunity of effecting his purpose, and was fought withall at <hi>Newberry,</hi> in his coming back, where neither side could boast of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Victory.</p>
            <p n="43">43. But howsoever, having gained some reputation by his We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Action, the Houses seem inclinable to accept His offer of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into Treaty with Him for an Accommodation. This He had offered by His Message from <hi>Evesham</hi> on the 4th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the defeat of <hi>Waller</hi>; and pressed it by another from <hi>Tavestock</hi> on the 8th of <hi>September,</hi> as soon as he had broken the great Army of the Earl of <hi>Essex.</hi> To these they hearkned not at first. But being sensible of the out-cries of the common people, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend at last, appointing <hi>Vxbridg</hi> for the place, and the thirtieth day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> for the time thereof. For a preparative whereunto, and to satisfie the importunity and expectation of their Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they attaint the Arch-bishop of High Treason, in the House of Commons, and pass their Bill by Ordinance in the House of Peers, in which no more than seven Lords did concur to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:54836:266"/>
but being sentenced howsoever, by the malice of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> both <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> he was brought to act the last part of his Tragedy on the 10th of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> as shall be told at large in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. This could presage no good success to the following Treaty. For though Covenants sometimes may be writ in blood; yet I find no such way for commencing Treaties. And to say truth, the King's Commissioners soon found what they were to trust to. For having condescended to accompany the Commissioners from the Houses of Parliament, and to be present at a Sermon preached by one of their Chaplains, on the first day of the meeting they found what little hopes they had of a good conclusion. The Preacher's Name was <hi>Love,</hi> a <hi>Welsh-man,</hi> and one of the most fiery <hi>Presbyters</hi> in all the Pack: In whose Sermon <hi>there were many passages very scandalous to His Majesty's Person, and derogatory to His Honour; stirring up the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple against the Treaty, and incensing them against the King's Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; telling them, That they came with hearts full of Blood; and that there was as great a distance betwixt the Treaty and Peace, as there was between Heaven and Hell.</hi> Of this the <hi>Oxon</hi> Lords complained, but could obtain no reparation for the King or themselves; though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Cromwel</hi> paid the debt, and brought him to the Scaffold when he least looked for it.</p>
            <p n="44">44. But notwithstanding these presages of no good success, the King's Commissioners begin the long-wisht-for Treaty, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to these three Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> Concernments of the Church, The Power of the Militia, and the Warr of <hi>Ireland.</hi> In reference to the first (for of the other two I shall take no notice) His Majesty was pleased to condescend to these particulars; that is to say, 1. <hi>That freedom be left to all persons whatsoever in matters of Ceremony; and that all the penalties of the Laws and Canons which enjoin those Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, be suspended.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Bishops should exercise no act of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction or Ordination, without the consent and counsel of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, who shall be chosen by the Clergy of each Diocess, out of the gravest and most learned men amongst themselves.</hi> 3. <hi>That the Bishop shall be constantly resident in his Diocess, except he be required to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend His Majesty; and shall preach every Sunday in some Church or other, within the Diocess, if he be not hindred either by old age or sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> 4. <hi>That</hi> Ordination <hi>shall be publick, and in solemn manner; and none to be admitted into Holy Orders, but such as are well qualified and approved of by the Rural Presbyters.</hi> 5. <hi>That an improvement be made of all such Vicaridges as belonged to Bishops, Deans, and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; the said improvement to be made out of Impropriations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Parliament.</hi> 6. <hi>That from thenceforth no man should hold two Churches with Cure of Souls.</hi> And, 7. <hi>That One hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound should be forthwith raised out of the Lands belonging to the Bishops and Cathedral Churches, towards the satisfaction of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Debts.</hi> An Offer was also made, for regulating the Jurisdiction of Ecclesiastical Courts, in Causes Testamentary, Decimal, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial; for rectifying some Abuses in the exercise of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; for moderating the excessive Fees of the Bishops Officers,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:54836:267"/>
and ordering their Visitations to the best advantage of the Church; and all this to be done by consent of Parliament.</p>
            <p n="45">45. His Majesty also offered them the Militia for the space of three years; which might afford them time enough to settle the Affairs of the Kingdom, had they been so pleased; and to associate the Houses with Him in the Warr of <hi>Ireland</hi>; but so, as not to be excluded from His Care of that People. But these Proposals did not satisfie the <hi>Puritan English,</hi> much less the <hi>Presbyterian Scots,</hi> who were join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Treaty. They were resolved upon the abolition of <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,</hi> both Root and Branch; of having the Militia for Seven years absolutely, and afterwards to be disposed of as the King and the Houses could agree: and finally, of exercising such an unlimited pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Warr of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the King should neither be able to grant a Cessation, or to make a Peace, or to show mercy unto any of that people on their due submission. And from the rigour of these terms, they were not to be drawn by the King's Commissioners; which rendred the whole Treaty fruitless, and frustrated the expectation of all Loyal Subjects, who languished under the calamity of this woful Warr. For as the Treaty cooled, so the Warr grew hotter; mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the most part by the same Hands, but by different Heads: Concerning which, we are to know, That not long after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this everlasting Parliament, the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction became sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents.</hi> And at the first, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> carried all before them both in Camp and Council. But growing jealous at the last of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> whose late miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the West was looked on as a Plot to betray his Army; they suffered him to be wormed out of his Commission, and gave the chief Command of all to Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi>; with whose good Services and Affections they were well acquainted. To him they joined Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> who from a private Captain had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to be Lieutenant to the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi> in the associated Counties, as they commonly called them; and having done good Service in the Battel of <hi>Marston-moor,</hi> was thought the fittest man to conduct their Forces. And on the other side, the Earl of <hi>Brent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> (but better known by the Name of General <hi>Ruthuen</hi>) who had commanded the King's Army since the Fight at <hi>Edg-hill,</hi> was outed of his Place by a Court-Contrivement, and that Command confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> the King's Sisters Son, not long before made Duke of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Holderness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="46">46. By these new Generals, the Fortune of the Warr, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the Fate of the Kingdom which depended on it, came to be decided. And at the first, the King seemed to have much the better by the taking of <hi>Leicester</hi>; though afterwards it turned to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage: For many of the Soldiers being loaded with the Spoil of the place, withdrew themselves for the disposing of their Booty, and came not back unto the Army, till it was too late. News also came, that <hi>Fairfax</hi> with his Army had laid siege to <hi>Oxon,</hi> which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King to return back as far as <hi>Daventry,</hi> there to expect the re-assembling of his scattered Companies. Which hapning as <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi>
               <pb n="471" facs="tcp:54836:267"/>
had desired, he marcht hastily after him, with an intent to give him Battel on the first opportunity: In which he was confirmed by two great Advantages; first, by the seasonable coming of <hi>Cromwel</hi> with a fresh Body of Horse, which reach'd him not until the Evening before the fight: and secondly, by the intercepting of some Letters sent from General <hi>Goring,</hi> in which His Majesty was advised to decline all occasion of Battel, till he could come up to him with his Western Forces. This hastned the Design of fighting in the adverse Party, who fall upon the King's Army in the Fields near <hi>Naisby,</hi> (till that time an obscure Village) in <hi>Northamptonshire</hi>: on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 19th of <hi>Iune,</hi> the Battels joined; and at first His Majesty had the better of it, and might have had so at the last, if Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> having rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one Wing of the Enemy's Horse, had not been so intent upon the chase of the Flying-Enemy, that he left his Foot open to the other Wing. Who pressing hotly on them, put them to an absolute Rout, and made themselves Masters of his Camp, Carriage, and Cannon; and amongst other things of His Majesty's Cabinet: In which they found many of his Letters, most of them written to the Queen; which afterwards were published by Command of the Houses, to their great dishonour. For whereas the <hi>Athenians</hi> on the like success, had intercepted a Packet of Letters from <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> their most bitter Enemy, unto several Friends, they met with one amongst the rest to the Queen <hi>Olympias</hi>; the rest being all broke open before the Council, that they might be advertised of the Enemy's purposes, the Letter to the Queen was returned untouch't; the whole Senate thinking it a shameful and dishonest act to pry into the Conjugal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets betwixt Man and Wife. A Modesty in which those of <hi>Athens</hi> stand as much commended by <hi>Hilladius Bisantinus,</hi> an ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the chief Leading-men of the Houses of Parliament, are like to stand condemned for want of it, in succeeding Stories.</p>
            <p n="47">47. But to proceed, this miserable Blow was followed by the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendry of <hi>Bristol,</hi> the storming of <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> the surprise of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and at the end of <hi>Winter,</hi> with the loss of <hi>Chester.</hi> During which time the King moved up and down with a Running-Army, but with such ill Fortune as most commonly attends a declining-side. In which distress he comes to his old Winter-Quarters, not out of hope of bringing his Affairs to a better condition before the opening of the Spring. From <hi>Oxon</hi> he sends divers Messages to the Houses of Parliament, desiring that He might be suffered to return to <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and offering for their security the whole Power of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Navy, Castles, Forts, and Armies, to be enjoyed by them in such manner, and for so long time, as they had formerly desired. But finding nothing from them but neglect and scorn, His Messages despised, and His Person vilified, He made an offer of Himself to <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who refused also. Tired with repulse upon repulse, and having lost the small remainder of His Forces near <hi>Stow on the Wold</hi>; He puts Himself, in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> into the hands of the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissioners, residing then at <hi>Southwell</hi> in the County of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> a Mannor-House belonging to the See of <hi>York.</hi> For the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:54836:268"/>
               <hi>Scots</hi> having mastered the Northern parts, in the year 1644, spent the next year in harrasing the Countrey, even as far as <hi>Hereford</hi>; which they besieged for a time, and perhaps had carried it, if they had not been called back by the Letters of some special Friends, to take care of <hi>Scotland,</hi> then almost reduced to the King's obedience, by the Noble Marquess of <hi>Montross.</hi> On which Advertisement they depart from <hi>Hereford,</hi> face <hi>Worcester,</hi> and so marcht Northward: From whence they presently dispatch Col. <hi>David Leshly,</hi> with Six thousand Horse; and with their Foot employed themselves in the Siege of <hi>Newark</hi>; which brought down their Commissioners to <hi>Southwell,</hi> before remembred. From thence the King is hurried in post-haste to the Town of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> which they looked on as their strongest Hold. And being now desirous to make eeven with their Masters, to receive the wages of their Iniquity, and being desirous to get home in safety with that Spoil and Plunder which they had gotten in their marching and re-marching betwixt <hi>Tweed</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> they prest the King to fling up all the Towns and Castles which remained in His Power, or else they durst not promise to continue Him under their Protection.</p>
            <p n="48">48. This Turn seemed strange unto the King. Who had not put Himself into the Power of the <hi>Scots,</hi> had He not been assured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand by the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador, of more courteous usage; to whom the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissioners had engaged themselves, not only to receive His Person, but all those also which repaired unto Him into their protection, as the King signified by His Letters to the Marquess of <hi>Ormond.</hi> But having got Him into their Power, they forget those Promises, and bring Him under the necessity of writing to the Marquesses of <hi>Montross</hi> and <hi>Ormond</hi> to discharge their Soldiers; and to His Governours of Towns in <hi>England,</hi> to give up their Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Amongst which, <hi>Oxford</hi> the then Regal City, was the most considerable, surrendred to Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> upon <hi>Midsommer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi> And by the Articles of that Surrendry, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was put into the Power of the Houses of Parliament; together with the Great Seal, the Signet, and the Privy-Seal, all which were most despitefully broken in the House of Peers, as formerly the <hi>Dutch</hi> had broke the Seals of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> when they had cast off all Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and Allegiance to him, and put themselves into the Form of a Common-wealth. But then to make him some amends, they give him some faint hopes of suffering him to bestow a visit on his Realm of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (his <hi>ancient and native Kingdom,</hi> as he commonly called it) there to expect the bettering of his Condition in the changes of time. But the <hi>Scots</hi> hearing of his purpose, and having long ago cast off the yoke of subjection, voted against his coming, in a full Assembly; so that we may affirm of him, as the Scripture doth of our Saviour Christ, viz. <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not,</hi> John cap. 1.2. The like resolution was taken also by the Commissioners of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the chief Leaders of their Army, who had contracted with the two Houses of Parliament, and for the sum of Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pounds in ready money, sold and betrayed him into
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:54836:268"/>
the hands of his Enemies, as certainly they would have done the Lord Christ himself for half the money, if he had <hi>bowed down the Heavens, and came down to visit them.</hi> Being delivered over unto such Commissioners as were sent by the Houses to receive him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was by them conducted on the third of <hi>February,</hi> to his House of <hi>Holdenby,</hi> not far from the good Town of <hi>Northampton</hi>; where he was kept so close, that none of his Domestick Servants, no not so much as his own Chaplains were suffered to have any access unto him. And there we leave him for the present; but long he shall not be permitted to continue there, as shall be shewn hereafter in due place and time.</p>
            <p n="49">49. Such being the issue of the Warr, let us next look upon the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the acts of Peace; in which they threatned more destruction to the Church, than the Warr it self. As soon as they had setled the strict keeping of the Lord's-day-Sabbath, suppressed the publick Liturgy, and imposed the Directory, they gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to their Divines of the Assembly, to set themselves upon the making a new Confession. The Nine and thirty Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were either thought to have too much of the ancient Fathers, or too little of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and therefore fit to be review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or else laid aside. And at the first, their Journey-men began with a Review, and fitted Fourteen of the Articles to their own conceptions; but in the end, despairing of the like success in all the rest, they gave over that impertinent labour, and found it a more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie task to conceive a <hi>new,</hi> than to accommodate the old Confession to their private Fancies. And in this new Confession, they establish the Morality of their Lord's-day-Sabbath, declare the Pope to be the <hi>Antichrist, the Son of Perdition, and the Man of Sin.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in also interweave the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Rigours, in reference to the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Decree of Predestination, Grace, Free-will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But knowing that they served such Masters as were resolved to part with no one Branch of their own Authority, they attribute a Power to the Civil Magistrate, not only of calling Synods and Church-Assemblies, but also of being present at them, and to provide that whatsoever is therein contracted, be done agreebly to the Mind and Will of God. But as to the matter of Church-Government, the Divine Right of their Presbyteries, the setting of Christ upon his Throne, the Parity or Imparity of Ministers in the Church of Christ, not a word deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Their mighty Masters were not then resolved upon those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; and it was fit the Holy Ghost should stay their leisure, and not inspire their Journey-men with any other Instruction than what was sent them from the Houses.</p>
            <p n="50">50. But this Confession, though imperfect, and performed by halves, was offered in the way of an <hi>Humble Advice to the Lords and Commons</hi>; that by the omnipotency of an Ordinance it might pass for currant, and be received for the established Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The like was done also in the tendry of their <hi>Larger Catechism,</hi> which seems to be nothing in a manner but the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of their <hi>Confession</hi> in another dress, and putting it into the form of Questions and Answers, that so it might appear to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:54836:269"/>
else than indeed it was. But being somewhat of the largest to be taught in Schools, and somewhat of the hardest to be learned by Children, it was brought afterwards into an Epitome, commonly called <hi>The lesser Catechism,</hi> and by the Authors recommended to the use of the Church, as far more Orthodox than <hi>Nowel</hi>'s, more clear than that contained in the Common-Prayer-Book, and not inferior to the <hi>Palatine</hi> or <hi>Genevian</hi> Forms. But in all three, they held forth such a Doctrine touching God's Decrees, that they gave occasion of reviving the old <hi>Blastian</hi> Heresie, in making God to be the <hi>Author of Sin.</hi> Which Doctrine being new published in a Pamphlet, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Comfort for Believers in their Sins and Troubles,</hi> gave such a hot Alarm to all the <hi>Calvinists</hi> in the new Assembly, that they procured it to be burnt by the hands of the Hangman. But first, they thought it necessary to prepare the way to that execution, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing in print their <hi>detestation of that abominable and blasphemous Opinion, That God hath a hand in, and is the Author of the sinfulness of his people,</hi> as the Title tells us. So that now <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Followers may sleep supinely without regard to the reproaches of uncivil men, who had upbraided them with maintaining such blasphemous Doctrine. The Reverend Divines of the Assembly have absolved them from it, and showed their <hi>Detestation</hi> of it; and who dares charge it on them for the time to come?</p>
            <p n="51">51. But these things possibly were acted as they were <hi>Calvinians,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Sabbatarians</hi> also, and no more than so. And therefore we must next see what they do on the score of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> for setting up whereof, they had took the Covenant, called in the <hi>Scots,</hi> and more insisted on the abolition of the Episcopal Function, than any other of the Propositions which more concern them. To this they made their way in those Demands which they sent to <hi>Oxon,</hi> the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for Ordination of Ministers, and their advancing of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory in the fall of the Liturgy. They had also voted down the Calling of Bishops, in the House of Commons, on <hi>Septemb.</hi> 8. 1642; and caused the passing of that Vote to be solemnized with Bells and Bonfires in the streets of <hi>London,</hi> as if the whole City was as much concerned in it, as some Factious Citizens. But knowing that little was to be effected by the Propositions, and much less by their Votes, they put them both into a Bill, which past the House of Peers on the third of <hi>February,</hi> some two days after they had tendred their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals to the King at <hi>Oxon.</hi> And by that Bill it was desired to be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted, That from the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> (the day designed for the blowing up the Parliament by the Gun-powder-Traytors) which should be in the year of our Lord 1643, there should be <hi>no Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, Bishops, Commissaries,</hi> &amp;c. (with all their Train recited in the <hi>Oxon</hi> Article, Numb. 21.) <hi>in the Church of</hi> England: <hi>That from thenceforth the Name, Title, and Function of Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Chancellors.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or likewise the having, using, or exercising any Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, Office, and Authority, by reason or colour of any such Name, Dignity, or Function, in the Realm of</hi> England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>should utterly and for ever cease.</hi> And that the King might yeeld the sooner to the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:54836:269"/>
they tempt him to it with a Clause therein contained, for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him into the actual possession of all the Castles, Mannors, Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, belonging to the said Arch-bishops, or Bishops, or to any of them. And for the Lands of Deans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Chapters, the Brethren had a hope to parcel them amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, under the colour of encouraging and maintaining of a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Ministry; some sorry pittance being allowed to the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietaries, and some short Pension during life to the several Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
            <p n="52">52. Such was the tenour of the Bill; which found no better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment than their Propositions. So that despairing of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King's consent to advance Presbytery, they resolved to do it of themselves, but not till they had broken the King's Forces at the Battel of <hi>Naisby:</hi>
               <q>For on the nineteenth of <hi>August</hi> then next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, they publish <hi>Directions</hi> in the name of the Lords and Commons, (after advice with their Divines of the Assembly) for the chusing of <hi>RVLING-ELDERS</hi> in all the Congregations, and in the Classical Assemblies, for the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and the several Counties of the Kingdom, in order to the speedy setling of Presbyterial Government. Amongst which, no small care was taken for making twelve Classes of the Ministers of <hi>London</hi> only; and after, for dividing each particular County into several <hi>Classes,</hi> with reference to the largeness and extent thereof.</q>
Which Orders and Directions, were after seconded by the Ordinance of <hi>October</hi> the twentieth; containing certain Rules for the suspension of scandalous and ignorant persons from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper, and giving power to certain persons therein named, to sit as Judges and Tryers, as well concerning the Election, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Ability of all such men as are elected <hi>Elders</hi> within any of the Twelve <hi>Classes</hi> of the Province of <hi>London.</hi> It is not to be thought, but that the <hi>London-Elderships</hi> made sufficient haste to put themselves into the actual possession of their new Authority. But in the Countrey, most men were so cold and backward, that the Lower-House was fain to quicken them with some fresh <hi>Resolves</hi>; by which it was required, on the twentieth of <hi>February, That choice be forthwith made of Elders, thoroughout the Kingdom, according to such former Directions as had past both Houses; and that all Classes and Parochial Congregations, should be thereby authorised effectually to proceed therein.</hi> And that the Church might be supplied with able Ministers in all times succeeding, the Power of Ordination, formerly restrained to certain persons residing in and about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>London,</hi> (according to the Ordinance of the second of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1644.) is now communicated to the Ministers of each several <hi>Classes,</hi> as men most like to know the wants of the Parish-Churches under their Authority.</p>
            <p n="53">53. But here it is to be observed, that in the setling of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Government in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> as the Presbyteries were to be subordinate to the Classical, Provincial, and National
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:54836:270"/>
Assemblies of the Church, so were they all to be subordinate to the Power of the Parliament, as appears plainly by the Ordinance of the fourteenth of <hi>March</hi>; which makes it quite another thing from the <hi>Scottish</hi> Presbyteries, and other Assemblies of that Kirk, which held themselves to be supream, and unaccountable in their actings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without respect unto the King, the Parliament, and the Courts of Justice. But the truth is, that as the <hi>English</hi> generally were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive that yoak; so neither did the Houses really intend to impose it on them, though for a while, to hold fair quarter with the <hi>Scots,</hi> they seemed forward in it. And this appears sufficiently by a Declaration of the House of Commons, published on the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>April,</hi> 1646; in which they signifie, That they were not able to consent <hi>to the granting of an Arbitrary and unlimited Power and Iurisdiction to near Ten thousand Iudicatories to be erected in the Kingdom, which could not be consistent with the Fundamental Laws and Government of it, and which by necessary consequence did exclude the Parliament from having any thing to do in that Iurisdiction.</hi> On such a doubtful bottom did Presbytery stand, till the King had put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the Power of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that the <hi>Scots</hi> had posted him in all haste to the Town of <hi>Newcastle.</hi> Which caused the Lords and Commons no less hastily to speed their Ordinance of the fifth of <hi>Iune, For the present setling of the Presbyterial Government, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further delay,</hi> as in the Title is exprest. And though it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the end of that Ordinance, That it was to be in force for three years only, except the Houses should think fit to continue it longer; yet were the <hi>London</hi>-Ministers so intent upon them, that they resolve to live no longer in suspence, but to proceed couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously in the execution of those several Powers which both by Votes and Ordinances were intrusted to them. And to make known to all the World what they meant to do, they published a Paper with this Title, that is to say, <hi>Certain Considerations and Cautions agreed upon by the Ministers of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Westminster, <hi>and within the</hi> Lines of Communication. <hi>Iune the nineteenth,</hi> 1646. <hi>According to which they resolve to put the Presbyterial Government into execution, upon the Ordinances of Parliament before published.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="54">54. In which conjuncture it was thought expedient by the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament, to send Commissioners to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and by them to present such <hi>Propositions</hi> to his Sacred Majesty, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be agreeable to his present condition. In the second of which it was desired, <hi>That according to the laudable Example of his Royal Father, of happy memory, he would be pleased to swear and sign the Solemn League and Covenant, and cause it to be taken by Acts of Parliament in all his Kingdoms and Estates.</hi> And in the third it was proposed, That a Bill should pass for the utter abolishing and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Chancellors, Commissaries, Deans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they occur before in the <hi>Oxon</hi> Articles, Num. 21. That the Assembly of Divines, and Reformation of Religion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the said Covenant, should be forthwith setled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:54836:270"/>
by Act of Parliament; and that such unity and uniformity between the Churches of both Kingdoms, should in like manner be confirmed by Act of Parliament, as by the said Covenant was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, after Advice first had with the Divines of the said Assembly. It was required also in the said Propositions, That he should utterly divest himself of all power to protect his people, by putting the Militia into the hands of the Houses; and that he should betray the greatest part of the Lords and Gentry which had adhered unto him in the course of the Warr, to a certain ruin; some of which were to be excluded from all hope of Pardon, as to the saving of their Lives; others to forfeit their Estates, and to lose their Liberties; the Clergy to remain under sequestration; the Lawyers of both sorts to be disabled from the use of their Callings. Demands of such unreasonable and horrid nature, as would have rendred him inglorious and contemptible both at home and abroad, if they had been granted.</p>
            <p n="55">55. These Propositions were presented to him on the eleventh day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> by the Earls of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> of the House of Peers; <hi>Erle, Hipisly, Robinson,</hi> and <hi>Goodwin,</hi> from the House of Commons: Of whom his Majesty demanded, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they came impowred to treat with him, or not? And when they answered, <hi>That they had no Authority so to do</hi>: He presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, That then the Houses might as well <hi>have sent their Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by an honest Trumpeter,</hi> and so parted with them for the present. His Majesty had spent the greatest part of his time since he came to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> in managing a dispute about Church-Government with Mr. <hi>Alexander Henderson,</hi> the most considerable Champion for <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland. Henderson</hi> was possest of all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Books and Helps, which might enable him to carry on such a Disputation. But His Majesty had the better Cause, and the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Arguments. Furnished with which, (though destitute of all other Helps than what he had within himself) he prest his Adversary so hard, and gave such satisfactory Answers unto all his Cavils, that he remained Master of the Field, as may sufficiently appear by the Printed Papers. And it was credibly reported, that <hi>Henderson</hi> was so confounded with grief and shame, that he fell into a desparate sickness, which in fine brought him to his Grave; professing, as some say, that he dyed a Convert; and frequently extolling those great Abilities which, when it was too late, he had found in his Majesty. Of the particular passages of this Disputation, the <hi>English</hi> Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners had received a full Information; and therefore purposely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined all discourse with his Majesty, by which the merit of their Propositions might be called in question. All that they did, was to insist upon the craving of a positive Answer, that so they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto those that sent them; and such an Answer they shall have, as will little please them.</p>
            <p n="56">56. For though his Fortunes were brought so low, that it was not thought safe for him to deny them any thing; yet he demurred upon
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:54836:271"/>
the granting of such points as neither in Honour nor in Conscience could be yeelded to them. Amongst which, those Demands which concerned Religion, and the abolishing of the ancient Government of the Church by Arch-bishops and Bishops, may very justly be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be none of the least. But this delay being taken by the Houses for a plain denial, and wanting money to corrupt the unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Scots,</hi> who could not otherwise be tempted to betray their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; they past an Ordinance for abolishing the Episcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and setling their Lands upon Trustees for the use of the State. Which Ordinance being past on the ninth of <hi>October,</hi> was to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; that is to say, <hi>That for the better raising of moneys for the just and necessary Debts of the Kingdom, in which the same hath been drawn by a Warr mainly promoted in favour of Arch-bishops and Bishops, and other their Adherents and Dependents; it was ordained by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Lords and Commons, That the Name, Title, Stile, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Arch-bishop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>Arch-bishop of</hi> York, <hi>Bishop of</hi> Winchester, <hi>and Bishop of</hi> Durham, <hi>and all other Bishops or Bishopricks within the Kingdom, should from and after the fifth of</hi> September, 1646, <hi>then last past, be wholly abolished or taken away; and that all persons should from thenceforth be disabled to hold that Place, Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Stile, within the Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>and Dominion of</hi> Wales, <hi>or the Town of</hi> Berwick; <hi>or exercise any Iurisdiction or Authority <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hereunto formerly belonging, by vertue of any Letters Patents from the Crown, or any other Authority whatsoever; any Law or Statute to the contrary notwithstanding,</hi> As for their Lands, they were not to be vested now in the Kings possession, as had been formerly intended; but to be put into the power of some Trustees which are therein named, to be disposed of to such uses, intents, and purposes, as the two Houses should appoint.</p>
            <p n="57">57. Amongst which uses, none appeared so visible, even to vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar eyes, as the raising of huge Sums of Money to content the <hi>Scots,</hi> who from a <hi>Remedy</hi> were looked on as the <hi>Sickness</hi> of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. The <hi>Scots</hi> Demands amounted to Five hundred thousand pounds of <hi>English</hi> money, which they offered to make good on a just account; but were content for quietness sake to take Two hundred thousand pounds in full satisfaction. And yet they could not have that neither, unless they would betray the King to the power of his Enemies. At first they stood on terms of Honour; and the Lord Chancellor <hi>Lowdon</hi> ranted to some tune (as may be seen in divers of his Printed Speeches) concerning the indelible Character of Disgrace and Infamy which must be for ever imprinted on them, if they yeelded to it. But in the end, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> on both sides did so play their parts, that the sinful Contract was concluded, by which the King was to be put into the hands of such Commissioners as the two Houses should appoint to receive his Person. The <hi>Scots</hi> to have One hundred thousand pounds in ready money, and the <hi>Publick Faith</hi> (which the Houses very prodigally pawned upon all occasions) to secure the other. According unto which Agreement
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:54836:271"/>
his Majesty is sold by his own Subjects, and betrayed by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; by so much wiser (as they thought) than the Traytor <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> by how much they had made a better Market, and raised the price of the Commodity which they were to sell. And being thus sold, he is delivered for the use of those that bought him, into the custody of the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> (who must be one in all their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands) the Earl of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Mountague</hi> of <hi>Boughton,</hi> with twice as many Members of the Lower House; with whom he takes his Journey towards <hi>Holdenby,</hi> before remembred, on the third of <hi>February.</hi> And there so closely watcht and guarded, that none of his own Servants are permitted to repair unto him. <hi>Marshal</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,</hi> two great sticklers in behalf of Presbytery, (but such as after warped to the <hi>Independents</hi>) are by the Houses nominated to attend as Chaplains. But he refused to hear them in their Prayers or Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, unless they would officiate by the publick Liturgy, and bind themselves unto the Rules of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Which not being able to obtain, he moves the Houses by his Message of the 17th of that Month, to have two Chaplains of his own. Which most unchristianly and most barbarously they denyed to grant him.</p>
            <p n="58">58. Having reduced him to this streight, they press him once again with their Propositions; which being the very same which was sent to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> could not in probability receive any other Answer. This made them keep a harder hand upon him, than they did before; presuming, that they might be able to extort those Concessions from him by the severity and solitude of his restraint, when their Perswasions were too weak, and their Arguments not strong enough to induce him to it. But, Great God! How fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are the thoughts of men? How wretchedly do we betray our selves to those sinful hopes which never shall be answerable to our expectation? The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had battered down <hi>Episcopacy</hi> by the force of an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> outed the greatest part of the Regular Clergy, of their Cures and Benefices; advanced their new Form of Government, by the Votes of the Houses, and got the King into their power, to make sure work of it. But when they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves secure, they were most unsafe. For being in the height of all their Glories and Projectments, one <hi>Ioice,</hi> a Cornet of the Army, comes thither with a Party of Horse, removes his Guards, and takes him with them to their Head-Quarters, which were then at <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> a Town upon the North-west Road in the County of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:</hi> Followed, not long after, by such Lords and others as were commanded by the Houses to attend upon him. Who not being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acceptable to the principal Officers, were within very few weeks discharged of that Service. By means whereof, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> lost all those great advantages which they had fancied to themselves, and shall be better husbanded to the use of their Adversaries, though it succeeded worse to his Majesty's person, than possibly it might have done, if they had suffered him to remain at <hi>Holdenby,</hi> where the Houses fixt him.</p>
            <p n="59">
               <pb n="480" facs="tcp:54836:272"/>59. This great turn hapned on the fourth of <hi>Iune, Anno</hi> 1647, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had remained but four Months in the Power of the Houses. Who having brought the Warr to the end desired, possest themselves of the King's Person, and dismissed the <hi>Scots,</hi> resolved upon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding a great part of the Army, that they might thereby ease the people of some part of their burthens. But some great Officers of the Army had their Projects and Designs apart, and did not think it consonant to common prudence, that they should either spend their blood, or consume their strength, in raising others to that Power, which being acquired by themselves, might far more easily be retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than it had been gotten. Upon these grounds they are resolved against disbanding, stand on their Guards, and draw together to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>London,</hi> contrary to the Will and express Commandment of their former Masters, by whom they were required to keep at a greater distance. The Officers thereupon impeach some Members of the Lower House; and knowing of what great Consequence it might be unto them to get the King into their Power, a Plot is laid to bring him into their Head-Quarters without noise and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; which was accordingly effected, as before is said. Thus have the Presbyterians of both Nations, embroiled the Kingdom first in Tumults, and afterwards in a calamitous and destructive Warr. In which the Sword was suffered to range at liberty, without distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Age, Sex, or Quality. More goodly Houses plundered and burnt down to the ground, more Churches sacrilegiously propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and spoiled, more Blood poured out like Water within four years space, than had been done in the long course of Civil-Warrs between <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster.</hi> With all which Spoil and publick Ruin, they purchased nothing to themselves but shame and infamy; as may be shown by taking a brief view of their true condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after they put the State into these Confusions.</p>
            <p n="60">60. And first, the <hi>Scots</hi> not long before their breaking out against their King, had in the Court two Lords High Stewards, and two Grooms of the Stool, successively one after another. And at their taking up of Arms, they had a Master of the Horse, a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Guard, a Keeper of the Privy Purse, seven Grooms of eight in his Majesty's Bed-Chamber, and an equal number at the least of Gentlemen-Ushers, Quarter-waiters, Cup-bearers, Carvers, Sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and other Officers, attending daily at the Table. I speak not here of those who had places in the Stables, or below the Stairs; or of the Servants of those Lords and Gentlemen who either lived about the Court, or had Offices in it. All which together, make up so considerable a number, that the Cour might well be called an Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation; in which so many of all sorts had their Breeding, Maintenance, and Preferment. Abroad, they had a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Tower, a Fortress of most consequence in all the Kingdom; and a Master-Gunner of the Navy; an Office of as great a Trust as the other: and more of those Monopolies, Suits, and Patents, which were conceived to be most grievous to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:54836:272"/>
than all the <hi>English</hi> of the Court. In the Church they had two Deanries, divers Prebendaries, and so many Ecclesiastical Benefices, as equalled all the Revenues of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> All which they had lost, like <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Dog, catching after a shadow. And yet by catching at that shadow, they lost all those Advantages which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had both in Court and Countrey; and that not only for the present, but in all probability for the time to come. Such losers were the <hi>Scots</hi> by this brutish bargain; but whether out of pure zeal to the Holy Discipline, or their great love to filthy lucre, or the perversness of their nature, or the rebellious humour of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of all together, let them judg that can.</p>
            <p n="61">61. If then the <hi>Scots</hi> became such losers by the bargain, as most sure they did; as sure it is that their dear Brethren in the Cause of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> the <hi>Puritans</hi> or <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> got as little by it. The <hi>English Puritans</hi> laid their heads and hands together to embroil the Realm, out of a confidence, that having alienated the greatest part of the Tribes from the House of <hi>David,</hi> they might advance the Golden Calves of their Presbyteries, in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> and all other places whatsoever within the Land. And for the maintenance thereof, they had devoured (in conceit) all Chapter-Lands, and parcelled them amongst themselves into <hi>Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi> But no sooner had they driven this Bargain, but a Vote pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for selling those Lands towards the payment of the Debts of the Commonwealth. Nor have they lived to see their dear Presbytery setled, or their Lay-Elders entertained in any one Parish of the Kingdom. For the advancement whereof, the <hi>Scots</hi> were first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to begin at home, and afterwards to pursue their Work by invading in <hi>England.</hi> Nor fared it better with those great <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phels</hi> of the popular Party, who laboured in the raising of a new Common-wealth, out of the Ruins of a Glorious and Ancient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. To which end they employed the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as the fittest Instruments for drawing the people to their side, and preaching up the piety of their Intentions. Which Plot they had been carrying on from the first coming of this King to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> till they had got His Sacred Person into their possession. Which made them a fit parallel to those Husband-men in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Gospel, (<hi>Matt.</hi> 21.38.) who said <hi>amongst themselves, This is the Heir, come let us kill him, and let us seize on his Inheritance.</hi> A Commonwealth which they had founded, and so modelled in their brains, that neither Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi>'s <hi>Vtopia,</hi> nor the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi>'s new <hi>Atlantis,</hi> nor <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Platform,</hi> nor any of the old <hi>Idea</hi>'s, were equal to it. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Offices whereof, they had distributed amongst themselves, and their own dependance. But having brought the King (though, as it chanced, by other hands) to the End they aimed, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on nothing more than the dividing of that rich Prey amongst themselves, gratifying one another with huge sums of Money, and growing fat on the Revenues of the Crown, and the Lands of the Church, and guarded as they thought by invincible Armies, they
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:54836:273"/>
were upon a sudden scattered like the dust before the wind, turned out of all, and pulickly exposed to contempt and scorn. All which was done so easily, with so little noise, that the loss of that exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Power did not cost so much as a broken Head, or a bloody Nose; in purchasing whereof, they had wasted so many Millions of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and more than One hundred thousand Lives.</p>
            <p>Thus have we seen the dangerous Doctrines and Positions, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Plots and open Practises; the Sacriledges, Spoils, and Rapins; the Tumults, Murthers, and Seditions; the horrid Treasons and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, which have been raised by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in most parts of Christendom, for the time of One hundred years, and upwards. Which having seen, we shall conclude this History in the words of that Censure which by the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> was once passed on the Jesuits; that is to say, <hi>Videtur haec Societas in negotio fidei pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculosa, pacis Ecclesiae perturbativa, Religionis rectae eversiva; &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis ad destructionem quàm ad aedificationem.</hi>
