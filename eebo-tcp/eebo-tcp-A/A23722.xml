            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is a ſtrange thing, That after all that has been ſo often repeated and inculcated, concerning the <hi>Implacable</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate</hi> Hatred of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in general, having given up their Conſciences to the Management of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,</hi> againſt all that make any Profeſſion of the <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> there ſhould be yet a ſort of People, That ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſo far intoxicated with the Sweet Draughts of the Whore's Cup in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that nothing can retrieve them from that Phrenſical Intoxication, but that they will ſtill be <hi>hankering</hi> after the Fleſh Pots of <hi>Popiſh Slavery and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power,</hi> theſe People are ſtill diſtempered and infected with the Monſtrous Excreſcencies of Arbitrary Power in one ſingle Member, above all the Laws of the whole Infallibility, Divine Right, &amp;c. ſtarted by <hi>Knaves</hi> and <hi>Sycophants,</hi> believed by <hi>Fools,</hi> ſo credulous and good-natured, as not to believe Matter of <hi>Fact;</hi> being the ſtrongeſt Proof and a far better Rule to ſteer Mankind by, than all the empty Notions of the Schools invented, only to perplex and confound our <hi>Racionations.</hi> Once more therefore let them take a ſhort Account of <hi>Publick Promiſes, Oaths</hi> and <hi>ſolemn Contracts</hi> ſo <hi>ſcandalouſly violated,</hi> not only with the Heretics, but even among themſelves,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53884:3"/>
In a Word, to come to our own Home, the Plots and Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies which have bin promoted by the Roman Catholicks in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſince the Reformation, are of that Nature, and have cauſed ſuch dreadful Convulſions both in Church and State, that it is a great Argument of the Goodneſs and Providence of God, that this Kingdom has bin able to bear ſo many Brunts, and to avoid ſo many deep Deſigns as has brought us to the very Brink of Ruine.</p>
            <p>Since then the Almighty, more out of the Goodneſs of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence than our own Deſervings, has bin pleaſed by this our <hi>late Deliverance,</hi> to free us from the <hi>Treachery</hi> and <hi>Infidelity</hi> of our <hi>Antichriſtian Adverſaries,</hi> by defeating the Hopes, and totally overthrowing the Contrivances of that reſtleſs, <hi>Implacable,</hi> and <hi>perfideous Faction;</hi> certainly they muſt be very <hi>impious</hi> or very <hi>Ungrateful,</hi> who inſtead of adoring the boundleſs Favour of <hi>Heaven</hi> towards them, will ſtill be <hi>hankering</hi> after the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſeeking to cloſe again with Idolatry. Nor muſt they be leſs ſtupid, who finding themſelves at Liberty from Tryanny and Superſtition, would be again ſubmitting their Necks under the Yoke of Arbitrary Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>Rather it would become them to pay their moſt thankful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to God in the firſt Place: And-in the next to the Inſtrument of their <hi>Happy Deliverance,</hi> and with all grateful Loyalty and Obedience, ſo to behave themſelves toward his preſent Majeſty, as not to diſturb him by their own <hi>Froward Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> and <hi>Diſcontents,</hi> and by their own idle Heats and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, in carrying on and bringing to Perfection the Great Work which he has ſo magnanimouſly and piouſly begun: Which till they do, they muſt be lookt upon no otherwiſe, than as ſuch who ſeek their own Deſtruction, Troublers of Iſrael, that will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be at Quiet themſelves, nor ſuffer others to enjoy the Benefit of the Public Tranquility.</p>

            <head>THE TRUE SPIRIT OF POPERY.</head>
            <p>CRuelty is a Crime ſo deteſted and abominated of all Mankind, and ſo contrary and ſo deſtructive even to Nature it ſelf; and withal ſo diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the Sacred Precepts and Example of Mans Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiator, and the heavenly Founder of his Religion, that it may well be lookt upon as one of the greateſt Wonders of the World, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be ſo daring, as to pretend eſtabliſhment from Heaven, and to be the only Rule and Infallible Standard of Divine Worſhip among Men, that places her chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Safety and Protection, and has nothing more to truſt to then the boiſterous Arm of Inhumanity and Oppreſſion. And then, again, it is no leſs to be admired, That Men endued with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be ſo infatuated, as in oppoſition to Reaſon, and the innate Light and Law of Reaſon, to ſurrender up all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe to Doctrins that uphold a more ſavage Tyrannie than is exerciſed even among the moſt Savage Beaſts themſelves, as it were in open Hoſtility with God and Man. For it is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of the Eternal to exerciſe all acts of inexorable Cruelty, unlimited Pride and tyrannical Dominion, where he commands Compaſſion, Mercy and Humility. And it is no leſs a mark of irreconcileable Enmity againſt Mankind, upon all occaſions to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53884:4"/>
labour nothing more then the Deſtruction and utter extirpation of Mankind, becauſe they refuſe to bow down and adore the Idol of Papal Authority. One would think that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had bin founded, not by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but by <hi>Maximinus</hi> the Elder, one of the moſt cruel Perſons upon Earth; whoſe Maxim it was, That no Dominion could be ſupported but by Cruelty, or that ſhe had bin a Diſciple of thoſe Apoſtles of Inhumanity that ſet up the ten Perſecutions. And indeed where can we better fix that Character which Scripture gives to <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> of being always <hi>drunk with the Blood of the Saints,</hi> then upon the See of <hi>Rome?</hi> She, that is never well, but when ſhe is carouſing in full Bowls the Blood of Heretics; comprehending under that falſe and ſcandalous Name all People in the World that make a ſyncere and true Profeſſion of Religion, the moſt conformable to the Word of God. Agreeable to which, is the Barbarity and Cruelty of her Doctrin, againſt all that refuſe to ſubmit to her Opinions; which maintains that Heretics are to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over to the Secular Princes, whoſe Duty it is to burn them without Mercy, upon Pain of being anathematiz'd, and depriv'd of their Kingdoms and Dominions, if they deny to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of her Inhumanity. To which we may add her Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Publick Faith, which was decreed by one of her Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, at <hi>Conſtance:</hi> Inſomuch, that notwithſtanding the Safe-conduct which <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> had granted to <hi>John Huſs</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> care was taken to have them both burnt: So that indeed it behoves all mankind beſides, that are not of her Perſwaſion, to ſtand upon their Guard, and to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt her, as if they were in the midſt of the <hi>Libyan</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, or among <hi>Cannibals,</hi> hourly in danger of their Lives.</p>
            <p>For Proof of which there might be produced from the Records of all Ages, all along, ever ſince the firſt Extravagances and Uſurpations of Popery, Inſtances <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>now to convince her moſt bigotted Idolaters of the Truth of what is here alledged, and of what has bin ſo often inculcated into the Minds of Men, were ſince the firſt beginning of the Reformation; but not to inſiſt upon the more remote Barbarities and Butcheries perpetrated upon the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> III, (a Name ill ſuiting with the Cruelties which he commanded and encouraged his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53884:4"/>
Minion of equal Piety and Humility, S. <hi>Dominic)</hi> to the utter deſolation of a Populous Country, and extirpation of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; of whom the ſmall remainder that eſcaped the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were conſtrained to fly for Refuge into <hi>Bohemia:</hi> And the ſucceeding Slaughter of the <hi>Valdenſes</hi> in the City of <hi>Merindoll</hi> and Villages adjoyning, under the reign of <hi>Paul</hi> III, and carry'd on by the Cardinal of <hi>Tournon,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Cavaellon,</hi> the Pope's Vice-Legate, with that fury, that not contented with the bloody Executions of the naked and harmleſs Inhabitants, they ſaid their very Habitations in Aſhes, and levelled them with the Earth. And therefore ſo much the more is the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> to be fear'd and prevented in a Nation that values it's own wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and ſecurity, by how much it appears the moſt Cruel and Deſtructive Religion in the World; as not deeming any People worthy to live upon the Earth, but the Slaves of Papal Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and for that Reaſon not content with petty Cruelties, but ſtill clearing her way to Abſolute Dominion, by General Maſſacres, entire Deſolations, and utter Extirpations. And therefore, tho' it argue Folly, and a womaniſh Fear, to be ſcar'd with Rabble-Reports, on purpoſe rais'd to amuſe the Minds of the Vulgar Herd; yet it is but common Prudence to have a watchful Eye over thoſe that we ſee ſo frequently guilty of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties of the ſame nature, and to be wary of being ſurpriz'd by ſuch as are eaſily induced to act what has bin by their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors ſo dreadfully committed already.</p>
            <p>For that it ſtill runs in their Blood, and that they are the ſame People ſtill, unalterable in their Sanguinary Principles, there is no need of going any farther, then to begin with Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign. At what time <hi>England</hi> was become ſuch a Theatre of Fire and Faggot, as if <hi>Rome</hi> had deſign'd to have chang'd her imaginary, into a real Purgatory over all this Land, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the Bodies of the Proteſtants (a very uncharitable piece of Charity) tho with this difference, That the Sufferers could neither by Prayers nor Money obtain deliverance from this, as her Adherents could both Pray and buy themſelves out of their own.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as <hi>Edward</hi> VI, was dead, the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whoſe Mother, then alive, was Daughter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53884:5"/>
to <hi>Mary,</hi> ſecond Siſter of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, was proclaim'd Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>'s eldeſt Daughter put by the Succeſſion; the Nobility, who then ſat at the Helm, being not a little apprehenſive that ſhe might entangle the Crown by marrying with a Stranger, and more certainly aſſur'd, well knowing her obſtinate Bigottrie to the Romiſh Tenents, in the time of her Brother's reign, that ſhe would alter the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which had bin us'd as well during the Life of her Father, King <hi>Henry,</hi> as in the Days of her Brother, King <hi>Edward,</hi> and ſo bring in the Pope again, to the utter deſtruction of the Realm.</p>
            <p>Upon this <hi>Mary</hi> retires into the Quarters of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> and with ſuch of the Commons as ſhe could get together, kept her ſelf cloſe for a while in <hi>Framingham</hi> Caſtle; thither the Suffolk Men reſorted to her, and promiſed her their utmoſt Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, provided ſhe would not attempt the alteration of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which her Brother, King <hi>Edward</hi> had eſtabliſh'd by Laws and Orders publicly enacted and received, by conſent of the whole Realm. To which Condition ſhe readily agreed, with Promiſes ſo ſolemnly made, That there ſhould be no change of the ſetled Religion, that no Man then could well have miſdoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her. Thus gull'd by her feign'd Aſſurances, the Suffolk Men ſtood by her, and that ſo faithfully, that with little or no Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhe obtained the Crown. But no ſooner was ſhe in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Sovereign Power, but forgetting all her Promiſes, and joyning Ingratitude to Treachery, ſhe forgat the Covenants made in <hi>Hebron,</hi> and diſplacing the Orthodox and Learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops which her Brother had advanc'd, preferr'd in their rooms her own Popiſh Creatures; and above all the reſt, thoſe two Blood-ſuckers and mortal Enemies of the Reformed Religion, <hi>Gardner</hi> and <hi>Bonner,</hi> forbid Preaching and reading of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: And when the Suffolk Men afterwards petition'd her to perform her Promiſe, ſhe returned them for Anſwer, That ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they who were but only Members, ſought to rule their Head, they ſhould one day know, that ſhe would make the Members obey the Head; and to ſtrike the more Terror into others, pillory'd a Norfolk Gentleman for preſuming in moſt humble manner to put her in mind of her Promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53884:5"/>
With no leſs Ingratitude did ſhe proſecute Sir <hi>James Hales,</hi> one of the Juſtices of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> who had ventured his Life in her Cauſe, as being the only Judge that had refuſed to ſet his Hand for her being diſinherited by the Kings Will; yet becauſe he gave a Charge at the Quarter-Seſſions, conformable to the Statutes in <hi>Henry</hi> VIII's time, againſt the Supremacy of the Pope, and concerning Religion, ſhe impriſoned him in the <hi>Counter, Marſhalſea</hi> and <hi>Fleet,</hi> where, by the continual Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the <hi>Warden,</hi> of the Torments that were preparing for Heretics, he was driven to that Deſpair, as at laſt to lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Hands upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> beſides that ſhe had bin bred up from her Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Maxims and Tenents of the Romiſh Church, was naturally of a moroſe and ſowre Diſpoſition, and being ſo bigotted as he was to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there was little Ground for the Proteſtants to expect any Favour, but what they might hope for upon her Promiſes made to the Men of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> But when ſhe had broken thoſe Promiſes, and withal, had advanced to the higheſt degrees of her Favour <hi>Gardner</hi> and <hi>Bonner;</hi> then too late they were too well aſſured of what they had to truſt to.</p>

               <hi>Gardner</hi> was a Man of a haughty and imperious Spirit, craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſubtle, to his Superiors flattering and fair ſpoken; to his Inferiors fierce and diſdainful, and againſt his Equals ſturdy and envious, ſo that his Emulation of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Greatneſs, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for favouring <hi>Bonner,</hi> (for whom <hi>Gardner</hi> had no kindneſs at that time) made him an utter enemy both of him and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; from which, after the fall of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> he became ſo averſe, finding which way the Tide was like to turn, that he continued a cruel Perſecutor of it to his dying day. For as for Divinity, he had no more then to ſerve his turn, as having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way addicted himſelf to thoſe Arts and Studies that fitted him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be Great then Good. So that finding himſelf now at the higheſt Pinnacle of Authority, to which his Ambition could aſpire, he abandon'd himſelf to thoſe Maxims of Cruelty, which he thought moſt proper to ſecure his Grandeur. And therefore finding he muſt ſtand or fall by Popery, he reſolved to gratifie that Profeſſion which had raiſed him. No wonder then he were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53884:6"/>
ſo ſeverely Cruel, for Cruelty and Popery are inſeparable. Nay, there ſeems to be that deep Infection in Popery, that the more ſtrongly a Man imbraces it, the more it renders him Savage and Inhuman. For proof of which there is one remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to be produced from the Behaviour of this Bloody and Tyrannical Biſhop. The ſame Day that Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> and Mr. <hi>Latimer</hi> ſuffered at <hi>Oxford,</hi> it happened that the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> an aged Gentleman, came to dine with <hi>Gardner,</hi> who notwithſtanding that he found the Ancient Duke uneaſie for his Dinner, at the uſual Hour, ſtill put him off, till four a Clock in the afternoon. But then one of the Biſhop's Servants, having rid Poſt from <hi>Oxford,</hi> and bringing him certain Word that thoſe two famous Lights of the Church were extinguiſhed, out he comes to the Duke, and in an exulting Tone; <hi>Now, my Lord,</hi> cry'd he, <hi>we'l go to Dinner:</hi> As if the Biſhop could not dine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he had waſh'd his Hands in the Blood of thoſe Martyrs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bonner</hi> was a Man of the fame Metal, fierce and barbarous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure; only as he was ſomewhat in a lower Station, ſo his Cruelties were more ſordid and pedantic, even to the ſcourging with Rods, and exerciſing his brutiſh Fiſts upon the Faces of the miſerable Creatures that were under his Captivity. He made a Goal of his own Houſe, ſuch was his inveterate Malice againſt the Evangelics, where the poor Creatures lay in the Stocks, and under other Torments whole Days and Nights together. And if we may judge of the Heart of a Man by his Words, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly nothing could more evidently declare the inveterate Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Man then his own Expreſſions; nor could any thing be more unchriſtian-like, then what he ſaid to one that was brought before him: <hi>They call me bloody Bonner,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on you all; I would fain be rid of you, but ye delight in burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But if I might have my Will, I would ſow up your Mouths, and put ye in Sacks, and drown ye.</hi> No leſs bitter and inhuman was that other Saying of the Biſhop, to another in his Cuſtody: <hi>Thou art a vile Heretic, and I will burn thee, or I will ſpend all I have to my Gown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe being the two great Maſter-Wheels that mov'd the Perſecution in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, with full Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in their hands, had their inferior Inſtruments you may be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53884:6"/>
ſure, their <hi>Harpsfeilds</hi> and their <hi>Thorntons,</hi> their Promoters, Apparitors and Sumners in all corners of the Kingdom, and all acting you may be ſure with all the double diligence imaginable, there being no ſtep ſo probable to Church-Preferment, as to be thought a good Hangman and Executioner; no Man ſo Praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, as the moſt ſedulous and treacherous Informer.</p>
            <p>And now began thoſe blazing Bonfires of Human Fleſh in all Towns and Cities of the Nation; ſuch horrid roaſtings, toaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and broylings of Mankind, which if ſo terrible to the ear, of neceſſity muſt have bin dreadful to the ſight of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, Young and Old, Men and Women, faggoted together four, five, ſeven, and ten in a cluſter, and committed to the devouring Flames, to rejoyce the hearts of the mercileſs <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for being again reſtored to their ancient Authority: And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuch again would now have bin the Bonfires for the recovery of loſt <hi>England,</hi> ſo ſoon as they had fix'd their Power. And why all this infernal execution of Fire, for the confuſion of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics, unleſs it be to let us underſtand, that if the Devil be of any Religion at all, he muſt be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> by his making ſuch a terrible uſe of the ſame Element? Thus much in General; let us now deſcend to Particulars.</p>
            <p>And becauſe it is the buſineſs of theſe few ſheets, to ſet forth the Cruelties of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in their malicious Proſecution of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and to ſhew what dangerous Maſters they are like to prove where-e'er they get the upper hand, we ſhall begin with <hi>Bloody Bonner</hi> (for that was the glorious Epitaph which he had acquir'd to himſelf, by his inhuman way of endeavouring, as he pretended, to Convert the Miſguided <hi>Proteſtants)</hi> whoſe Rage and Malice was ſo exorbitant toward thoſe innocent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that he laid aſide the Function of Biſhop, and rather choſe to take upon him the Office of a Hangman and Tormentor, then to be out of Employment. To which purpoſe he had in his own Houſe his Priſons and Dungeons, of which two were more particularly remarkable; the one call'd his <hi>Cole-Houſe,</hi> where he kept his Priſoners without Meat or Drink, allowing them only an Half-peny a day for Bread, and a Farthing a day for Drink: Adjoyning to which <hi>Cole-houſe</hi> was another cloſe Dungeon, where the poor Priſoners were kept with their Hands and Feet all at
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53884:7"/>
once in the Stocks, not without great torment and miſery. In this Dungeon <hi>Thomas Whittle,</hi> a Miniſter of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who through the extremity of his Impriſonment, was conſtrain'd by Writing to yield to the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> his Jaylor, upon which he was ſet at liberty; but ſoon after repenting of what he had done, he came to the Biſhop's Regiſter, and asking for his Bill of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, tore it with his own hands. With which the Bloody Biſhop being acquainted, ſent for the Miniſter again, fell upon him with a Lyon-like fury, cuft and box'd him till his Face was black and blew, and at laſt pluckt away a great part of his Beard.</p>
            <p>Beſides this <hi>Cole-houſe,</hi> he had another Priſon within his Houſe, which was call'd <hi>Mondays-hole,</hi> which Dungeon was within a Court where the Prebends Chambers were, being a Vault under Ground, having a Window enclos'd with a Pale, about four Foot and an half high, and about three Foot diſtant from the ſame; ſo that the Priſoners looking from beneath, could only ſee ſuch as ſtood at the Pale. In this Priſon, among others, was <hi>Alice Binden,</hi> firſt impriſoned by the Biſhop with ſo much rigour, that for nine Weeks together ſhe was forc'd to lye upon a little ſhort Straw, betwen a pair of Stocks and a Stone-wall, with a ſhort Allowance of Three Farthings a day for Bread and Water; during all which time ſhe never had the liberty to change her Apparel, whereby ſhe became a moſt miſerable and loathſom Spectacle to behold: After which Cruelty in <hi>Mondays-hole,</hi> they were at length ſo merciful to her, as to burn her in <hi>Smithfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had alſo another loathſom Priſon under his own Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, call'd the <hi>Lollards Tower,</hi> within the Cathedral of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s it ſelf, which as it had bin formerly made uſe of for the Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of Heretics, and particularly for the murthering of one <hi>Richard Hunn,</hi> a Merchant-Taylor of <hi>London</hi> in the time of <hi>Fitz James,</hi> Biſhop of the ſame Dioceſe, ſo <hi>Bloody Bonner</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for the ſame uſe during his own time. This <hi>Hunn</hi> being cited into the Spiritual Court by one <hi>Thomas Dryfeild,</hi> Parſon of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Mary Matſilon,</hi> for a Mortuary which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly claim'd of the ſaid <hi>Hunn,</hi> upon the Burial of a Son of his that dy'd at Nurſe in the ſaid Pariſh. Upon which <hi>Hunn,</hi> by the advice of his Counſel, purſu'd a Writ of <hi>Praemunire</hi> againſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53884:7"/>
the ſaid <hi>Dayfield;</hi> which ſo incens'd the Prieſtly Order, that they forg'd Articles of Hereſie againſt him, and got him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Lollards Tower,</hi> where he was murthered by Dr. <hi>Horſey</hi> the Biſhop's Chancellor, who to colour the Murther, gave out that he had Hang'd himſelf. But the Citizens not ſo ſatisfied, demanded that the Coroner might ſit upon him. Which ſtartling the Biſhop and his Chaplains, it was reſolv'd that the Biſhop ſhould proceed <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> againſt the Dead Body, ſuppoſing that if the Party were once condemn'd of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, the Inqueſt durſt not then but find him guilty of his own Death: But notwithſtanding the terrible Condemnation of the dead Body, Dr. <hi>Horſey</hi> and his Accomplices were found Guilty of the Murther. So that had not the Biſhop labour'd with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Woolſey</hi> in the Doctor's behalf, to take away the Scandal from the reſt of the Clergy, he had had his deſerts the next Seſſions.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Lollards Tower</hi> it was, that <hi>Bloody Bonner</hi> impriſon'd ſeveral of his Captives, where they were enforc'd not only to a ſingle but a double Captivity; not only enclos'd within the Walls of the ſaid Tower, but forc'd to ſit with their Hands and Feet in Stocks on purpoſe provided within the ſaid Priſon. With which inhuman dealing, and for want of Food, no leſs then three at once were famiſh'd to Death, and by the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Biſhop commanded to be caſt like Dogs into the Fields: For ſuch is the Mercy of Popiſh Charity, that they will not allow ſo much as Chriſtian Burial to Heretics. His very Parlour, and his Orchard at <hi>Fulham</hi> did the inraged Biſhop turn into Places of Execution.</p>
            <p>For the Biſhop being inraged at the Conſtancy of one <hi>Thomas Thomkins,</hi> a Weaver, who was his Priſoner at <hi>Fulham,</hi> ſent for him one day into his Parlour, in the preſence of Dr. <hi>Harpsfeild, Pendleton,</hi> and <hi>Chadſey.</hi> At what time the poor Man ſtanding ſtifly in defence of his Faith, the cruel Biſhop having a Wax-Candle of three wicks ſtanding by him upon his Table, took him by the Fingers, and held his Hand directly over the Flame, till the Veins ſhrunk, and the Sinews burſt, inſomuch that the Water ſpurted forth in <hi>Harpsfeild</hi>'s Face.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:53884:8"/>
In the like manner did the Biſhop ſerve a poor pitiful blind Harper; who being brought before him for a Heretic, preſently cry'd the inſulting Prelate, <hi>Such blind Abjects as thou will be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Heretical Preachers; but when they come once to feel the Fire, will be the firſt that fly from it.</hi> To whom when the poor Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>That tho' every Joynt of him were burnt, yet he truſted in God he ſhould not fly,</hi> the Biſhop order'd a burning Coal to be brought him, and then thruſting it into the hollow of his Hand, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Servant to clutch it again, till the poor Man's Hand was miſerably burnt to the Bone.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Biſhop knew it was as much the Office of an Executioner, to Scourge as well as Burn, he reſolv'd to be no leſs remarkable for the one then the other. Among the Sufferers at his cruel Hands, of this nature, was one <hi>Thomas Hinſhaw,</hi> a young Lad of about Nineteen or Twenty years of Age, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he adventur'd to diſpute the Caſe with the Biſhop and his Archdeacon <hi>Harpsfeild,</hi> was adjudg'd a Heretic; and by <hi>Bonner,</hi> then being at <hi>Fulham,</hi> carry'd into his Garden, and there in an Arbor, being commanded to kneel down againſt a Bench, was forc'd to endure the fury of <hi>Bonner,</hi> who laid on with a Rod of Willows till he was quite out of Breath. Of the ſame number was alſo another, whoſe Name was <hi>John Wills,</hi> who becauſe he refus'd to recant as the Biſhop would have had him, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately carry'd into his Arbor in the Orchard, where the enrag'd Prelate belabour'd the poor Young Man firſt with Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, then with Birchen Rods, till his ſtrength, tho' not his fury, fayl'd him.</p>
            <p>But the moſt Tragical Act, (which if not committed by him, yet was no leſs permitted by him in his own Houſe, which was the ſame thing, while he had knowledge of the Fact,) was the barbarous Whipping of a Child of about Eight or Nine years of age, that came to the Palace for leave to ſee his Father in <hi>Lollards Tower.</hi> This Child being told by one of the Chaplains that firſt met him, That his Father was a Heretic; made Anſwer, That his Father was no Heretic, but that He, meaning the Chaplain, was a Heretic, as having <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Mark. For which the Chaplain carry'd him into the Biſhop's Houſe, where among them they ſo cruelly handled the poor Child, that he dy'd within
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53884:8"/>
fourteen days. However it were, <hi>Bonner</hi> fearing the Detection of a Crime ſo horrid, releas'd the Father, in hopes his Mercy to the Father might attone for the Death of the Child.</p>
            <p>Theſe Barbarities thus acted by <hi>Bonner,</hi> and perpetrated within his own Walls, were committed by the reſt of the Gang with equal virulency and inveteracy. Particularly by one Sir <hi>Edward Tyrrel,</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace at that time in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who coming to <hi>Colcheſter</hi> to apprehend an old Man and his Wife that were accus'd of <hi>Hereſie:</hi> After he had ſeiz'd the Father and Mother, not liking the Replies which the Daughter gave him to certain Queſtions which he put to her, took the Candle out of her hand, and holding the Maid by the Wriſt, held the flaming Candle under her hand ſo long, till the very Sinews crackt aſunder; all the while he exerciſed this Cruelty, reviling the Maid, and bidding her, <hi>Cry Whore, why ye young Whore wont ye cry?</hi> And in the end, after the Sinews burſt, that all the houſe heard them, he thruſt the Maid violently from him, calling her, <hi>ſtrong Whore, ſhameleſs Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>beaſtly Whore,</hi> to ſhew how well he could follow the Examples of his Superiors.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Robert Samuel,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Barfold</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> was moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly handled by Dr. <hi>Hopton</hi> the Biſhop of the Dioceſe, and his Chancellor Dr. <hi>Downing.</hi> Who after they had got him in their clutches, kept him in a cloſe Dungeon, chain'd bolt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to a great Poſt, in ſuch a manner, that ſtanding only on tiptoc, he was forc'd to ſtay the whole weight of his Body upon his Toes. And to make amends for the pain which he ſuffer'd by that means, they kept him without Meat or Drink, ſo that he was moſt unmercifully tormented with hunger and thirſt; only that they allow'd him two or three mouthfuls of Bread aday, and three ſpoonfuls of Water, to keep Life and Soul together; inſomuch that his burning, which afterwards enſu'd, was but a trifle in compariſon which he had ſuffer'd in tedious Impriſonment; while the quick mercy of the Fire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd him from the more ſevere Cruelties of the Biſhop and Chancellor.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Cheſter,</hi> one <hi>George Marſh,</hi> a Prieſt, being condemn'd by Doctor <hi>Coates,</hi> then Biſhop of that Dioceſe, was carry'd to the Stake, where to the uſual cruelty of Burning, they added
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53884:9"/>
a new Invention, of pouring melted Pitch upon his Head.</p>
            <p>In the Town of St. <hi>Peter's Port,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Guernſey,</hi> three Women, a Mother and her two Daughters, being firſt impriſon'd upon Suſpicion of Buying Stoln Goods, after they were acquitted of that, were again remanded to Goal, for not going to Maſs. Of which the Magiſtrates gave notice to <hi>Jacques Amy,</hi> and to other of the Clergy, whoſe officious zeal for the Popiſh Cauſe was ſo enormouſly extraordinary, that upon the bare Letter of the Magiſtrates, they return'd the three Women for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, tho' they had never bin ſo much as Examin'd before them, or had had any particular Information againſt them. But the Magiſtrates underſtanding that the Women had not been Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd by the Dean, would not ſit upon them in Judgment, until they had been firſt carry'd before the Dean and Curate to be Examin'd of their Faith. Which being done, after a ſhort Examination ſeverally and apart, they were return'd to Priſon again. After which the Dean ſent a Sentence under his own Seal and the Curate's Sign, whereby the Women were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd as Heretics, and deliver'd over to the Magiſtrate to do Execution. The Women being ſent for to receive their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, deſir'd to know their Accuſers, and what was laid to their Charge, for that they knew not that they had at any time offended the Queen or the Church, being ready to obey the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of both, as good Subjects ought to do. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Reaſons and Allegations, the three Women were all condemn'd and adjudged to be Burnt. And now theſe three Innocent People (only for the Name of Heretics) being brought to the Stake, the Mother was faſtned to the middle Poſt, the Eldeſt Daughter on the Right-hand, and the Youngeſt on the Left. They were firſt ſtrangled; but the Rope breaking before they were dead, the poor Women fell in the Fire. At what time happen'd a doleful ſight, that would have drawn Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the moſt barbarous of Infidels. For one of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who was Big with Child, falling on her ſide, as her Belly burſt with the vehemency of the Flame, the Infant being a luſty Man-Child, fell in the Fire, and was preſently ſnatch'd out of the Fire, and laid upon the Graſs, by one that ſtood by. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the Child was carry'd to the Magiſtrate. But the Bailiff,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53884:9"/>
neither regarding the miraculous Acts of Providence, nor mov'd with common Humanity, upon an Infant ſo wonderfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, either out of ſtupid Ignorance or wilful Blindneſs, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it to be carry'd back again and thrown into the Fire. And thus the Infant, baptiz'd in his own Blood, was both born and dy'd a Martyr, leaving behind him, to the World, which it ſcarcely ever ſaw, a miſerable Spectacle of the Herodian Cruelty of Popiſh Tormentors.</p>
            <p>In like manner <hi>Eliz. Pepper,</hi> being one of thirteen, that were burnt together at <hi>Stratford Le Bow,</hi> being about thirty Years of Age, tho' they well knew that ſhe was far gone with Child, was hurried with the reſt to the Stake, and conſum'd to Aſhes, with the Fruit of her Womb; ſuch is the difference between Popiſh and Proteſtant Mercy, which never denies a Reprieve, even to the worſt of Fellons, tho' but upon the bare Suggeſtion of a great Belly. Nor did this Inhumanity extend to the Living, but their Barbarity ſtill perſecuted the Bodies of the Dead; for after they had tormented ſeveral in their loathſom Dungeons to Death, with Hunger and Thirſt, they were ſo inhuman as to deny them the common Favour of Chriſtian Burial. Thus <hi>Edw. Burton,</hi> Eſq; dying in the Dioceſs of <hi>Chester,</hi> and deſiring to be buried in his Pariſh Church of S. <hi>Chadds</hi> in <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of the Pariſh, <hi>John Marſhal,</hi> would not ſuffer the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Corps. Upon which, one of the Friends of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed making anſwer, That God would judge him at the laſt day: The Curate replyed, Judge God or Devil, he ſhould not be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there: So that they were forced to bury the Gentleman in his own Garden. Thus <hi>William Glover,</hi> dying a pretended He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic, and his Friends deſirous to have buried him in the Pariſh Church of <hi>Weme</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> ſent forth a Mandate, not only to command the Curate, that he ſhould not be buried in Chriſtian Burial, but that no Man ſhould procure, help or ſpeak to have him buried in Holy Ground. And whereas his Brother <hi>John Glover,</hi> dying in the ſame Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Coventry,</hi> was buried by ſtealth in the Church-yard, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Prieſt or Clerk; yet when Dr. <hi>Drant,</hi> the Chancellour, came to hear of it, he ordered him to be taken up again, and caſt over the Wall into the High-way. To which, when the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53884:10"/>
Parſon anſwered, That he had lain ſix Weeks, and ſmelt ſo that it was impoſſible to endure the Stench. Well then, ſaid <hi>Drant,</hi> take this Bill and pronounce him in the Pulpit a damned Soul, and a twelvemoth hence caſt his Carcaſs over the Wall for Carts and Horſes to go over, and then I will come and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate again that place of the Church-yard, where he lay.</p>
            <p>In the Caſtle of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> no leſs then five being famiſh'd to death, they were all buried in the High-way, by order of <hi>Thornton,</hi> the Suffragan of <hi>Dover,</hi> otherwiſe call'd <hi>Dick</hi> of <hi>Dover.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch was the extream ſeverity of <hi>Thornton</hi> and <hi>Harpsfield,</hi> that the Goalers of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whether of their own rugged Natures, or call'd out of purpoſe, either would not or durſt not admit of the Relief which was ſent or brought the half-famiſh'd Priſoners; but they either turned it back, or kept it for their own uſe.</p>
            <p>After all this, what may be thought of the deteſtable and execrable piece of continued Malice and Violation of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres of the Dead, exerciſed at <hi>Cambridge</hi> towards the Bones of <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Phagius;</hi> Perſons that while they lived, ſo far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending in Learning and Piety, the whole Rabble of Illiterate and Ungodly Biſhops and Prieſts, who ſo violently proſecuted their Sacred Relicts, that they were not to be nam'd in the ſame day with thoſe two Great and Famous Men? This was a piece of Pageantry, perform'd with ſo much Pomp and Solemnity, that nothing more detected the Rancour and Hatred of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts againſt all Men of Piety and Vertue: Nevertheleſs it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo high, that the deceaſed <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Phagius</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally cited to appear before certain Commiſſioners appointed for their Judges, and for default of Appearance, not only their Perſons, but their Books and their Bones were condemned as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, after a ridiculous Examination of Witneſſes againſt the Dead, the Churches where they lay buried were excommunicated, &amp; after all, their Coſſins were taken up, and being chain'd to their ſeveral Stakes, and burnt, together with their Bones, not with out the Indignation and Laughter of the People that beheld the hateful Spectacle; who as they derided the Folly, ſo likewiſe they abominated the ridiculous Cruelty of the Actors. Nor did their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53884:10"/>
barbarous Fury end here, for they purſued the very Bones of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>'s Wife to <hi>Oxford;</hi> where, without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Sex or her Religion (which had never been made known, by reaſon her Language was not underſtood) her Corps was digged up, and buried under a Dunghil. But at length, after the Death of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> this Perſecution ceas'd, after the burning of two hundred eighty four; tho' <hi>Grindal,</hi> who liv'd in that time, reports, That in two Years eight hundred were burnt, beſides ſixty, who after moſt Severe and Cruel Uſage dy'd in Priſon. And to ſhew that it was not the Converſion but the utter extirpation of the Heretics, which thoſe miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Papiſts aimed, and ſtill do aim at, may readily appear, by the ſtory of <hi>Bembridge,</hi> who was burnt near <hi>Wincheſter:</hi> This Man feeling the Violence of the Fire, cryed out, That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted; whereupon the Sheriff cauſed his People to put out the Fire; in hopes, that ſince the Popiſh Clergy deſired the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and not the Deſtruction of Heretics, ſuch an act of Mercy would not diſpleaſe them. But the Council ſent him Orders in Writing, To go on and execute the Sentence, and to take care that the Priſoner dy'd a good Catholic; for it was ſaid, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted ſincerely he was fit to dye, if he did it not ſincerely, he was not fit to live: And after all was done, the Sheriff was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Fleet for his Preſumption. But <hi>Harpsfield</hi> was not of the Sheriff's mind, he underſtood the Senſe of the Roman Catholics better; for he having ſeveral condemned Priſoners under his Cuſtody in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and being at <hi>London,</hi> at the time when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> lay dangerouſly ſick, made haſt home, for fear the miſerable Creatures ſhould eſcape by her death; and was ſo ſpeedy, that five were burnt before the News of her Death could arrive.</p>
            <p>After all this, what difference between the Religion of theſe Cruel Papiſts, and the Religion of the Ancient <hi>Druids</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which <hi>Suetonius</hi> calls <hi>Religionem dirae immanitatis?</hi> The <hi>Druids</hi> were always beſmearing their Altars with the Blood of their Slain Captives; and Popiſh Cruelty is never ſatisfy'd, but when they are fumigating their Hoſt with the Blood of Heretic <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locauſts;</hi> ſo that the ſame Reaſon which moved <hi>Claudius,</hi> a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperour, to aboliſh the one, may juſtifie a Chriſtian

Prince, in at leaſt exterminating the other out of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
            <p>But now to trace them into other Countries; we find this cruel Generation of Men ſtill perpetrating the ſame or worſe Acts of Inhumanity, if worſe can be, wherever they get foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Power, and either by the Fury and exorbitant Tyranny of their Inquiſition, or by the Arms of bigotted Zealots, whole Country's waſted and depopulated, and the Natives cut off from the Face of the Earth by Rapine and tormenting Murder.</p>
            <p>In the Perſecution of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of <hi>Provence,</hi> ſuch was the mercileſs Cruelty of <hi>Miniers,</hi> at the Inſtigation of the Pope and his Legates, that he invaded their Territories with an arm'd Force, by the Permiſſion of <hi>Francis</hi> I, at what time the People were ſlain without reſiſtance, Women and their Daughters ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed, the Breaſts of many Women with Child cut off, many that were with Child murthered, after which their Infants were famiſh'd to Death. All their Habitations were pillag'd, ſack'd and burnt, and Proclamation made, That no Man ſhould give any Relief to thoſe that remain'd alive. Upon the taking of <hi>Cabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres, Miniers</hi> caus'd all the Men to be brought into a Field, and to be cut in Peices, the Soldiers ſtriving who ſhould ſhew the beſt of their Manhood in cutting off Heads, Legs and Arms. And as for the Women, he caus'd them to be lockt in a Barn, with a great quantity of Straw, and ſo ſet ſire to it, ſo that many Women with Children were burnt: Upon which a Soldier mov'd with Compaſſion, opened a Hole in the Wall for ſome of them to eſcape; but <hi>Miniers</hi> cauſed them to be beaten back again with Pikes and Halberts. Some of them alſo that came forth, he ſlew with his own Hands, ripping open their Bellies, ſo that their Children came forth, which he trod under his Feet. Many fled into Cellars and Caves, which he caus'd to be dragg'd out, driven into the Field, ſtuipp'd ſtark nak'd, and then ſlain. After this <hi>Miniers</hi> ſent one of his Captains to the Church, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeveral Women and Children were fled for Sanctuary; whom he put all to the Sword, ſparing neither Young nor old.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:53884:11"/>
Then marching to a Place call'd <hi>Coſta,</hi> where his Men commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame Outrages and Slaughters, raviſhing Women and Virgins to that beaſtly degree, that the Women with Child and young Maids dyed preſently after. Such as hid themſelves in Rocks and Caves were either famiſhed to Death, or elſe choak'd with Fire and Smoak put to the Mouths of the Caves.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of this Perſecution, there was one <hi>John de Roma,</hi> a Monk, who had got a Commiſſion to examin thoſe whom he ſuſpected to be Heretics, and which he exercis'd with all ſorts of Cruelties upon thoſe that fell into his Clutches; among the reſt, this was one. He filled Boots full of boiling Greaſe, and put them upon their Legs, tying them backwards over a Form with their Legs hanging down over a Fire, after which manner he moſt cruelly tormented ſeveral, and then as Cruelty put them to Death.</p>
            <p>No leſs was their Rage againſt the Heretics in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where they made nothing to piſtol the Reformed Paſtors in their Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits; and ſhot one Aged Miniſter, among the reſt, as he lay ſick in his Bed.</p>
            <p>In the Town of <hi>Minion</hi> the Commiſſioners demanded of the People a poſitive Anſwer, Whether they would turn Catholics or no? And when one, in the name of the reſt reply'd, <hi>That Conſcience neither would nor could be forc'd,</hi> he was preſently laid upon the Ground and beaten; and ſtill denying to turn Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, when he could hardly ſpeak, was torn in pieces.</p>
            <p>At another Place the Senators refuſing to turn Apoſtates, the chiefeſt of them was made to ride the Wooden-Horſe in the Market-place for ſix Hours together, tho' he were very Ancient; ſo that he was lame and half dead when he was taken off.</p>
            <p>In ſome Places they ſhut up the People in the Church, and forced them to receive in one kind; and if they would not kneel before the Hoſt, they uſed to beat their Legs with Clubs till they fell down; others they gag'd, and when they had propt their Mouths wide open, they thruſt the Hoſt down their Throats. Others were detain'd in Priſons and Bonds ſo long till they dy'd, and particularly one was kept in a loathſome Dungeon ſo long till his Feet rotted off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:53884:12"/>
If any, to avoid this Tyrannie fled to the Woods or other Private Places for Shelter, Edicts were publiſh'd forbidding all to entertain them, upon Pain of forfeiting great Sums of Money for every Nights Entertainment. The Country People were fetch'd out of their Houſes; nay, out of their very Beds, by Troops of Soldiers, who drove them before them like Beaſts in the ſharpeſt of cold and bitter Weather. And with theſe poor Creatures they filled the common Priſons, Towers, Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, Stables; nay, and Hog-ſties too, where they were kill'd with Hunger, Cold and Thirſt. Marriage, Burial and Baptiſm were forbidden to the Proteſtants, and if they did it privately, they were impriſoned, or elſe put to great Fines. Among others, a Heretic Surgeon, for refuſing to recant, was thrown into a Place full of Snakes. In ſome Places the Heretics were ſhut up in Privies, to the end they might be poiſoned with the Stench. And theſe were the Charitable ways, by which the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemian Catholics endeavour'd to reclaim ſuch as were revolted from the Tyrannie of the Pope.</p>
            <p>The Inquiſition was the true Pattern of Treachery, Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Tyrannie and Cruelty, erected at firſt by the Advice of the Dominican Fryers, againſt the Jews and Moors in <hi>Spain,</hi> but afterwards turned to the Ruine and Deſtruction of all that made true Profeſſion of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>To this Office belong two ſorts of Vermin, which are call'd <hi>Familiars</hi> and <hi>Flies:</hi> The Familiars are to keep Company with all People, to creep into their Companies and grope their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes; and under the colour of Friendſhip to give them daily Viſits, to have an Eye upon all their Actions, and to obſerve what Company they keep, and with whom they converſe: And when theſe Familiars have pickt up ſufficient Matter for Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, they preſently accuſe them to the Inquiſitors. Now, ſo ſoon as any one is Arreſted by any of theſe Familiars, they take from him all the Keys of his Studies, Cabinets, Cheſts and Trunks whatſoever, and they take an Inventory of his Goods; in the doing of which, the Familiars, who are generally Bawds, Thieves, Shoplifts, and the ſcum of the People, will be ſure to pilfer a good ſhare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:53884:12"/>
The Flies are a ſort of Miſcreants, which the Inquiſitors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Priſon, under a Colour. Theſe Flies will cunningly, in two or three Days inſinuate themſelves into the Boſomes of the other Priſoners; and then pretending a great deal of Religion, will profer to diſcourſe them, and by degrees get out of their Mouths matter of Accuſation againſt them. Which done, they move for a Day of Hearing, and by that means being brought before the Inquiſitors, they impeach the Priſoners, who ſhall be ſure to hear of it afterwards to their Sorrow. Theſe Flies, as ſoon as they are out of one Priſon, for lucre of Money, will be content to be put into another, and ſo into a third and a fourth, where they will lie in Chains, as the other Priſoners do, enduring Hunger, and Cold, and the Stench and Loathſomneſs of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and all to betray others.</p>
            <p>If a Keeper of any of the Priſons belonging to the Inquiſition happen to be of a Gentle and Courteous Nature, and uſe his Priſoners favourably, the Offence is ſo heinous, if it come to the Inquiſitors Ears, that he is ſure to be whipt about the City, and to be condemned to the Galleys for ſix Years.</p>
            <p>If any of the Priſoners ſing a Pſalm, or recite any Portion of the Scripture, the Inquiſitors take it for a very great Offence, and preſently ſend an Officer to him, requiring him to be ſilent, upon Pain of Excommunication; and if he do not take that for a Warning, they order a Bit to be put upon his Tongue to teach him Obedience.</p>
            <p>As for the Torments which the Inquiſitors make uſe of to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort Confeſſions from their Priſoners, they are of two ſorts: The firſt is that of the Gibbet or Pulley; with which, when a Miſerable Creature is to be tormented, firſt comes one behind him, and binds his Hands with a Cord, eight or ten times about, the Inquiſitors calling upon him to ſtrain each Binding harder then other. Then they cauſe the Priſoner's Thumbs to be bound extream hard, with a ſmall Line, and ſo both Hands and Thumbs are faſten'd to a Pully which hangs on the Gibbet; then they put heavy Bolts on his Feet, and hang upon thoſe Bolts, between his Feet, certain Weights of Iron, and ſo hoiſe him or her (for they are never curious of the Sex) from the Ground; and while the poor Wretch hangs in this Plight, the Inquiſitors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53884:13"/>
him to accuſe himſelf, and as many others as he knows of, (excellent Popiſh Chriſtianity) and if they can ſcrew nothing out of him, then they command the Priſoner to be hois'd higher to the very Beam, till his Head touch the Pully. After he has hung thus a good while, and that nothing comes from him, the Inquiſitors (who are both Spectators and Judges of the Torment all this while) command him to be let down, and twice as much Weight to be faſten'd to his Heels, and ſo to be hois'd up again. Then they command the Executioner to let him up and down, that the Weights of Iron hanging at his Heels may have the greater Force, to rend every Joynt of his Body aſunder: With which inſufferable Pains, if the Party cries out, then the Inquiſitors roar out as loud to him again, To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſ the Truth, or elſe he muſt come down with a Vengeance. And then they order the Executioner ſuddenly to ſlip the Rope, that the Party under Torture may fall with a Sway; and then ſtopping in the mid way, they give him the Strappado; which being as ſoon done, it rends all his Body out of Joynt, Arms, Shoulders, Back, Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by reaſon of the ſuddain Jerk, and the Weights hanging at his Legs.</p>
            <p>They have another ſort of Torture, which is call'd the <hi>Aſelli,</hi> which is after this manner. There is a Piece of Timber ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hollowed at the top, like a Trough, about the middle whereof there is a ſharp Bar, going croſs, whereon a Man's Back reſteth, that it cannot go to the Bottom: It is alſo ſo plac'd that his Heels ſhall lye higher then his Head. Then is the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, naked, laid thereon, his Arms, Thighs and Legs, being bound with ſtrong ſmall Cords, wreſted with ſhort Trunche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, till the Cords pierce almoſt to the very Bone: Then they take a thick Piece of fine Lawn Cloth, and Jay it over the Parties Mouth, as he lies upright upon his Back, ſo that it may ſtop his Noſtrils alſo, then taking a good Quantity of Water, they pour it in a long Stream, like a Thread, which falling from on high, drives the Cloth down into his Throat; which puts the miſerable Wretch into as great an Agony, as any Man endures at the Point of Death: for in this Torture he has not Liberty to draw his Breath, while the Water ſtops his Breath, and the Cloth his Noſtrils; ſo that when the Cloth is drawn out of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53884:13"/>
bottom of his Throat, it draws out Blood with it, and a Man would think it tore out his very Bowels. And this Torment is iterated as often as the Inquiſitors pleaſe.</p>
            <p>There is yet another ſort of Torture, which is much pactis'd by theſe Inquiſitors, not inferiour to the former: For they take a Pan of burning Charcoal, and ſet it juſt over againſt the Soles of the Parties Feet, juſt before he goes to the Rack; and that the Fire may have the more Force upon them, they baſt them with Lard.</p>
            <p>When a Heretic is brought forth upon the Stage to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grac'd, or to the Stake to be burnt, he is attired in a <hi>Sambenito,</hi> or long Garment, painted all over with ugly Devils, having a high-crown'd Hat, upon which a Man is painted burning in the Fire, with ſeveral Devils plying him with Fire and Faggot. Their Tongues are alſo put between a cleft Piece of Wood, which nips and pinches their Tongues, ſo that they cannot ſpeak, and their Hands are moreover faſt bound behind them. And yet, ſuch is the Wicked Hypocriſie of theſe Inquiſitors, that when they bequeath any perſon to the Secular Power, to be burnt, they do it with this humble requeſt, To ſhew the Priſoner as much Favour as may be, and neither to break any Bone, nor pierce the Skin of his Body. A ſtrange piece of Impudence, to pretend to ſo much Mercy and Clemency toward thoſe, to whom themſelves have bin all along ſo extreamly Barbarous and Cruel.</p>
            <p>Theſe Inquiſitors, one time among the reſt, apprehended a Noble Lady in <hi>Sevil,</hi> becauſe that a Siſter of hers, a vertuous Virgin, confeſſed in the Extremity of her Torments, that ſhe had ſometime had Conference with this Siſter of hers about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. This Lady they ſhut up in cloſe Priſon, and us'd her in all things, as they did their other Priſoners, and at length, ſo terribly tormented her in the Trough, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſtrait ſtraitning of the Strings, cutting to the very Bones of her Arms, Thighs and Shins, ſhe was brought back half dead to the Priſon, the Blood guſhing out at her Mouth in great abundance, ſo that ſhe dy'd within eight days.</p>
            <p>In the ſame manner was a whole Congregation of Faithful and Religious People cut off at <hi>Sevil,</hi> the moſt of whom the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors conſum'd with Fire, as they could diſcover and apprehend them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:53884:14"/>
By what has bin ſaid, it may be eaſily ſeen how great and exorbitant is the rage and cruelty of theſe bloody and mercileſs Inquiſitors to all that profeſs the Truth of Scripture; and how ſlight a thing they make of murthering and torturing the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of all that come under their tyranny; making no diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either of Age or Sex. And hence it may be as eaſie for all true <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> to judge how fatal the Conſequences might have bin, had the Liberty of this Nation bin ſubdu'd under the heavy weight of Inquiſition and Slavery.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Germany,</hi> after the Victories of <hi>Charles</hi> V, againſt the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> there enſu'd a very bitter Perſecution in many places, Authority arm'd with Laws and vigorous Malice, ſtriving againſt ſimple Verity. Both Miniſters and People, ſome were toſſed from place to place; ſome exil'd out of their native Countries, others driven into the Woods, and forc'd to live in Caves; ſome tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented upon the Rack, and others burnt with Fire and Faggot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry Sutphen,</hi> a laborious Miniſter, was by his mercileſs Adverſaries the Monks and Prieſts in <hi>Meldorp,</hi> hal'd out of his Bed naked, in the depth of Winter, and driven bare-foot over the Ice, till his Feet were cut to the Bone; then bound in Chains, and ſet in the Stocks; after that remov'd to another place, and ſhut up in a Cupboard; the next day bound Hands and Feet and Neck together, and hurry'd away to be burnt. At what time a certain Woman proffering herſelf to ſuffer Two thouſand Stripes, and give them a conſiderable Sum of Mony, but to reſpit his Life till he could have a public Hearing, they threw her under foot, and trod upon her; and not content to burn the poor Martyr inhumanly and barbarouſly, cut and mangled him before they threw him in the Fire.</p>
            <p>Another of the ſame Function was thrown into Priſon, where, among other Cruelties, he was hoiſted up with a Cord, and a great Stoue hanging at his Heels, ſo that the Sweat which dropt from his Body through pain and anguiſh, lookt like Blood, and they let him down with ſuch an extraordinary ſwing, that the violence of the fall laid him almoſt for dead; then they let him down into a deep Dungeon, where they kept him eighteen days, and then burnt him. And all this while, none but the Monks and Fryers both his Accuſers, Judges, and Hangmen.</p>

With the ſame cruelty was one <hi>Nicholas</hi> apprehended at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> bound up in a Sack, and thrown into the River.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1543, notice being given that certain <hi>Lutherans</hi> met privately together at <hi>Lovaine,</hi> an Inquiſitor coming from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> with a Band of Soldiers, brake into their Houſes, and hal'd away the Men and Women out of their Beds from their Children. Two were burnt alive in the Fire; an Aged Man was beheaded, and two old Women burnt quick. Which leads us to the bloody Perſecution in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where the Light of the Goſpel being much ſpread abroad, King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> ſent the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> with a great Army to root out the Profeſſors of it; who exerciſed unparallell'd Cruelties and Butcheries againſt all ſorts of Perſons both of the Nobility and Commons, permitting his Soldiers to Raviſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and Virgins, while their Husbands and Parents were forc'd to ſtand by and behold it.</p>
            <p>The Duke himſelf alſo boaſted, that he had bin a diligent Rooter out of Hereſie; for that beſides thoſe which he had ſlain in War, in the ſpace of ſix yeras he had put into the Hands of the common Hangman above eighteen thouſand Perſons.</p>
            <p>His Son <hi>Don Frederic</hi> being ſent by him to <hi>Zurphen,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the Burghers without any Oppoſition; yet was he no ſooner entred the Town but he fell to murther, hang and drown a number of Inhabitants, with infinite Cruelties ſhew'd upon Wives and Virgins, not ſparing the very Infants. From thence marching to <hi>Naerden,</hi> the Inhabitants made an agreement with him, and he entred the Town upon Conditions conſented to, and the Faith of a Soldier. But never did Canibals or Scythians, or the moſt barbarous People in the World, commit more abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Outrages then Duke <hi>Frederic</hi> ſufferd in this Town. For after he had aſſembled the Burghers into the Chappel of the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, under pretence of giving them Inſtructions for the future government of their City, he commanded his Soldiers to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them all, without ſparing any one. Thus the Men were Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred, the Women were firſt Raviſh'd, and then moſt cruelly Murther'd, the Inhabitants and Children had their Throats cut; and in ſome Houſes they ty'd the Inhabitants to the Poſts, and then ſet fire to their Houſes, and burnt them alive. So that in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53884:15"/>
the whole Town, neither Man, Wife, Maid nor Child, Young nor Old, wereſpar'd.</p>
            <p>After this, the Town of <hi>Harlem</hi> was, after a long Siege, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred to the ſame <hi>Don Frederic</hi> upon a Compoſition, by which they were to pay Two hundred and forty thouſand <hi>Florins</hi> to redeem themſelves and the Town from Spoil. But <hi>Don Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric</hi> having thus got into the Town, commanded that at the Toll of the Great Bell, all the Burghers and Soldiers ſhould carry their Arms into the Stat-houſe; that the Townſmen ſhould go into the Cloyſter of <hi>Ziel,</hi> the Women into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church, and the Soldiers into another Church; and while the poor Burghers were guarded in the Church, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious <hi>Spaniards</hi> plunder'd their Houſes. The next day, the bloody <hi>Don Frederic</hi> caus'd Three hundred <hi>Walloons</hi> to be Hang'd and Beheaded; and the next day, Captain <hi>Riperdon</hi> and his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, together with one <hi>Stemback</hi> a Miniſter, were hang'd, and Two hundred forty ſeven Soldiers drown'd in the Sea of <hi>Harlem.</hi> The next day, a great number were executed, and the next day Three hundred more Soldiers and Burghers loſt their Heads, together with one <hi>Simon Simonſon</hi> another Miniſter. Preſently after, three of the principal Magiſtrates loſt their Heads; and to fill up this Sea of Blood, all the Sick and Wounded were beheaded before the Hoſpital-Gate.</p>
            <p>Not long before, the Town of <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> in <hi>Hainault,</hi> having the free Exerciſe of the Reformed Religion among them, was ſurrendred to the Lord of <hi>Noircarmes,</hi> upon good Conditions. Nevertheleſs the ſaid <hi>Noircarmes</hi> being entred, kept the City-Gates ſhut for divers days, and moſt perfidiouſly and barbarouſly hang'd up all the <hi>French</hi> Soldiers, with all the Miniſters and Proteſtant Merchants. So little ſafety is there to be expected from the Treachery and Perfidy of <hi>Roman Catholics,</hi> whom no Conſiderations of Conſcience or Honour are ſufficient to oblige to keep Faith with Heretics.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, the bloody Inquiſition was no leſs active in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> where multitudes of People were murthered without any Pity or Compaſſion, and their dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies thrown into the public High-ways, to be gaz'd upon by all that paſt by. Numbers of Believers, both Men and Women,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53884:15"/>
were thrown into Priſon, where they languiſh'd and dy'd, the greateſt part of them for want of Food.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John de Boſcane</hi> was apprehended at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and for his Conſtancy in his Religion condemn'd to Death; but becauſe the Magiſtrates durſt not put him to death publicly, they reſolv'd to drown him ſecretly in the Priſon: For which purpoſe a Tub of Water was provided, and an Executioner ſent to drown him; but the Water was ſo ſhallow, and the Priſoner ſo tall, that the Executioner ſeeing he could not diſpatch him that way, gave him ſeveral wounds and ſtabs with his Dagger, and ſo did his work. And thus go where you will, you ſhall find Fire, and Faggots, Maſſacres, Racks and Gibbets, the only method by which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſupport their Cauſe, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate their Faith.</p>
            <p>And indeed the Popiſh Prieſts and Friers had a fine time of it to exerciſe their Cruelties in <hi>Flanders,</hi> being under a Popiſh King ſo bigotted to the Pope, and ſuch an Upholder of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, that by their Advice he poyſon'd his own Son, for which he was applauded by <hi>Pius</hi> V. And if the Head be ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, no wonder the Members are ſo blood-thirſty. With theſe Inquiſitors it was that <hi>Philip</hi> the Second conſulted what he ſhould do with his Heretic Subjects (as he call'd them in the <hi>Netherlands)</hi> who anſwer'd, That all the People of the <hi>Belgic Netherlands,</hi> and all the States of thoſe Countries, except ſuch as were otherwiſe noted in their Probation-Books, were Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Apoſtates and Rebels, and not only thoſe who were openly revolted from God and the holy Church, but alſo thoſe who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling themſelves to be <hi>Papiſts,</hi> had bin neglecting to ſuppreſs the Sectaries and Heretics at the beginning. As alſo, That all thoſe Noblemen and others who had preferr'd and publiſh'd Petitions, againſt the holy Inquiſition, and ſo had under-hand encourag'd the Sectaries and Heretics to Sedition, were all guilty of high Treaſon both againſt God and Man. Upon theſe Inſtigations it was that <hi>Philip</hi> the Second ſent his Orders to <hi>Alva,</hi> by which he was commanded, according to the Decree of the Inquiſition, to rack and torture all Revolters and Sectaries according to that rigorous method which was preſcrib'd him. For which reaſon Articles were propounded in his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53884:16"/>
Council, commonly call'd the <hi>Council of Blood,</hi> according to which the Judges were commanded to determin and ſettle the Puniſhments, that there might be no difference among them in the variation of Sentences; which comprehending altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nocent and Innocent, left no hole for any Man to creep out of, and exempt himſelf from the Sanction of the general Decree. Heavens! what an inhuman thing it was to ſee the Country People harras'd with the Demoniacal Decrees of the Inquiſitors; and the Cities fill'd with Butcheries and Exilements of thoſe that tarry, and with the Sequeſtrations and Plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thoſe that were fled. In one day no leſs then eighteen Perſons of chiefeſt Remark and Quality, were publicly put to death at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> by <hi>Alva</hi> and his <hi>Council of Blood.</hi> The next day three more of great Note, together with a Miniſter of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Worth and Learning, were executed in the ſaid City; where alſo ſoon after Count <hi>Horn</hi> and Count <hi>Egmond</hi> loſt their Heads, being brought with a ſtrong Guard from <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> And all theſe Murthers did <hi>Alva,</hi> together with his <hi>Bloody Council,</hi> bring to paſs out of a mortal hatred of all that favour'd or abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Reformed Religion.</p>
            <p>With no leſs fury and deſpite did <hi>Philip</hi> the Second purſue the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> himſelf, whom becauſe he could not get into his hands by fair and open hoſtility, he endeavour'd to deſtroy by the treacherous hands of unſanctify'd Deſperado's. For <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> being General of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> after they had ſhaken off the Popiſh Yoke, preſently the King of <hi>Spain</hi> proſcrib'd him, and in his Proſcription promis'd a large Sum of Mony, and large Preferments, to any one that ſhould bring him into <hi>Spain</hi> alive or dead. Which ſoon encourag'd ſeveral to make the attempt: Among the reſt, one <hi>Javeregny</hi> was pitch'd upon by a knot of Confederate <hi>Papiſts</hi> to do the Fact, of which they intended to ſhare the Profit. For which purpoſe he was directed to charge a Piſtol with two Bullets, and to ſhoot the Prince behind in the Head. And the Eighteenth of <hi>March</hi> was the day appointed for the Execution: Upon which day the Prince was to be at a great Feaſt at the Duke of <hi>Anjon</hi>'s Court. But the Preſs being too great there, the Aſſaſſin rather choſe to do it at the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s own Houſe, as he ſate at Dinner.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53884:16"/>
The Villain thus deſperately reſolv'd, a <hi>Jacobin</hi> Frier came to him and Confeſs'd him, gave him the Popiſh Communion, and fortify'd him in his Reſolution with many ſweet words, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading him that he ſhould go inviſible, to which end he gave him certain Characters in Paper, and little Frogs Bones, with other petty pieces of Conjuration.</p>
            <p>After this he drank a draught of ſtrong Wine, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with his ghoſtly Father, he went to the Prince's Court, where at the Stair-foot the Fryer gave him his Bleſſig (a hopeful Bleſſing) and ſo left him. Nor did the Villain faint in his deſign, for he ſhot the Prince; but neither the Fryer's Bleſſing nor his Conjuration prov'd effectual as was intended: For neither did the Wound prove Mortal, nor the Aſſaſſin eſcape with his Life, being immediately run through by the Prince's Followers. And the Jugling Fryer was alſo apprehended and executed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> having miſt their blow, but ſtill believing they had no greater Oppoſer in the World then the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and that if he were dead, they ſhould quickly attain their deſire in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> found out a fit Inſtrument, one <hi>Balthazar Gerrard,</hi> who was more ſucceſsful, and watch'd his opportunity ſo well, that as the Prince was going out of the Hall after Dinner, the Murtherer ſtood behind a Pillar, and as the Prince was going by, ſhot him from the Left Side to the Right, through the Stomach and Vitals. So hard a thing it is to ſcape the never ſleeping <hi>Argus</hi>'s of Popiſh Malice and Revenge. And ſo far different are the <hi>Papiſts</hi> from all other Men that have any thing of common Morality, not to mention Chriſtianity, that whereas all other Men deteſted the Fact, they alone rejoic'd and glory'd in it. Nor was it at all for the honour of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarch to countenance ſuch an inglorious and treacherous Act of Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this was. Nevertheleſs it cannot be ſaid to be the only Preſident, which ſhews that the Contagion of <hi>Romes</hi> bloody Maxims ſpreads it ſelf as well into the Courts of Princes, as into the Cloyſters of Rabble Monks and Jeſuites. For let us but ſtep into the neighbouring Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and there we ſhall ſee Popiſh Treachery and Diſſimulation in the higheſt degree, deſigning not only the Maſſacre of ſingle Perſons, but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53884:17"/>
of thouſands in Cluſters, and all upon that unchriſtian Pretence of rooting out of Heretics. A ſtrange blindneſs in Princes, not to diſcover themſelves to be only the Pope's Inſtruments to deſtroy their own Subjects, and diſpeople their own Dominions, merely to pleaſure the Tyranny and Uſurpation of an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
            <p>After a tedious Conteſt of ten years, in all which time the Popiſh Party made but little progreſs in their Deſigns, being headed by the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the old Admiral <hi>Coligny,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other great Lords their Kindred and Adherents, <hi>Charles</hi> IX, who was but young, the Queen-Mother, and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> began to think of laying Force aſide, and to betake themſelves to Craft and Diſſimulation. To which purpoſe the King was advis'd to ſet on foot a Treaty of Peace with the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> not ſo much out of a deſign to quiet Affairs by a happy Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to bring the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> into a fatal Snare, in which being once intrapp'd, they might be the more ſecurely and eaſily deſtroy'd. For it was believ'd that the Extirpation of Hereſie might be done at a much cheaper rate then by a Civil War, if the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> had granted them what Conditions they deſired, and were treated with all imaginable Kindneſs; by which means their Jealouſies being once extinguiſh'd, and they lull'd into a Confidence, the chief Heads of the Party might be drawn to the Court, and then they were ſure of them. To this effect the firſt bait to be offer'd, was the Marriage of the King's Siſter to the King of <hi>Navar:</hi> Which not ſucceeding, new means might be thought upon, till they found out one that would do their buſineſs. Nor would it ſignifie any thing if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Pope were offended to ſee the young King ſo highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Heretics, in regard that when they had effected their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he would come off at laſt with ſo much the more Honour, and receive applauſe from both.</p>
            <p>The Plot being thus laid, the Queen-Mother by her Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries aſſur'd the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that ſhe mortally hated the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which for ſeveral good Reaſons was then eaſily believ'd. On the other ſide, the King diſſembled an Inclination to undertake the Protection of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> then under the Tyranny of the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi> He alſo ſeem'd to be weary of the Greatneſs of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53884:17"/>
the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and his Party. Moreover the Queen of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr</hi> was promis'd an Army for the recovery of her Country. And as for the Conſtable, he was weary of the Civil Wars, and believing he ſhould be the Perſon employ'd in the Conqueſt of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> began to liſten to theſe Lures. So that upon theſe and ſome other Conditions, a Peace was concluded between the King and the Proteſtants, and ſome cautionary Towns put into their hands till a full ſettlement of Matters. In all which things the King acted his part with all the ſubtilty imaginable: He ſhew'd himſelf much kinder to the <hi>Mont morency</hi>'s, and the reſt of the Admiral's Friends; ſeem'd to neglect thoſe of <hi>Lorain;</hi> threatned the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> for making ſome difficulty in paſſing the Edicts in favour of the Proteſtants; treated pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately with <hi>Lewis</hi> Count of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> about the Wars of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> entred into a Confederacy with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and employ'd the Cardinal of <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> to treat of a Match between Her and the Duke of <hi>Anjou.</hi> And when the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador and the Pope's Legate diſſuaded him from the Peace and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Queen of <hi>Navar,</hi> the King deſir'd the Legate to aſſure the Pope, that his deſign in the Marriage was only to be reveng'd on thoſe that were Enemies to God and himſelf; and that he would either cut them all to pieces, or loſe his Crown.</p>
            <p>Upon ſuch Demonſtrations as theſe it was no wonder if Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſo much candour as the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi> and the Admiral were deluded. The Admiral went firſt to Court, where he was receiv'd by the King with all the ſhew of Reſpect and Kindneſs imaginable. He embrac'd him three times, laid his Cheek so his, ſqueez'd his Hands, call'd him <hi>Father,</hi> and left nothing omitted to poſſeſs him with a deep opinion of his Friendſhip. Nor was the Queen leſs officious in her Carriage to him. He was allow'd a Guard of Fifty armed Gentlemen; a Hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Franks</hi> were ſent him to refurniſh his Houſes that had bin ſpoil'd during the Wars. And when he carry'd any Complaints to the King of any Violation of the Edicts, the King order'd the Offenders to be forthwith ſeverely puniſh'd. With all, the King told him, That ſince he had got him ſo near his Perſon, he would never permit him to forſake him as long as he liv'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:53884:18"/>
The Admiral being thus ſucceſsfully brought into the Toyl, the Propoſal of the Marriage was vigorouſly carry'd on, and the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi> was next inveigled to Court; but ſoon after dy'd (as is generally preſum'd) of Poyſon, which was given her in a Pair of perfum'd Gloves. To conceal which, the Chyrurgeon that opend'd her (according to his Inſtructions) would not open her Head, but pretended ſhe dy'd of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume in her Side. The Cardinal of <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> was poyſon'd alſo at the ſame time; which tho' confeſs'd by him that did it, was huſh'd up without any further Enquiry made into the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>However, to colour theſe Miſcarriages, the King of <hi>France</hi> ſeem'd to be wholly bent upon the War in <hi>Flanders;</hi> to which purpoſe he ſent into the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> to conſult about the Preparations. He alſo furniſh'd the Count of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> with Mony, and ſent ſome of his beſt Commanders with him, who acted their part ſo dext'rouſly, that <hi>Mons</hi> was ſurpriz'd by the Count of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> and <hi>Valenciennes</hi> by <hi>Lanoue.</hi> Upon which all Men believ'd that the King was now engag'd, and the War begun. Upon which the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> were brought to Court, and receiv'd with all the Marks of aſſured Friendſhip. A Diſpenſation was alſo obtain'd from the new Pope for the Marriage; which the Pope was eaſily induc'd to grant upon the Information which he had receiv'd from the Cardinal's Legate of the King's treacherous Deſign in Marriage, which it behov'd the Pope neither to obſtruct nor delay. So that the Bull being ſent to the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the day was appointed, and the chief Heads of the Proteſtants were all drawn into <hi>Paris,</hi> partly to be preſent at the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, partly to get Employments in the Army, which all Men believ'd would be commanded by the Admiral.</p>
            <p>And now the Deſign being ripe, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who was privy to the Conſpiracy, was order'd to gather as many Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rado's and Bravado's about him, as might be fit for any ſort of Miſchief. By which means the Plot getting into more hands, took wind, ſo that the Rochellers being inform'd of ſome ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Paſſages, wrote to the Admiral to leave the Court, and not to truſt the guilded Appearances which he ſaw there. But
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53884:18"/>
the Admiral was ſo infatuated, that he wrote them back a long Anſwer, wherein he aſſur'd them, That the King's Heart was wholly chang'd, That there was never a better Prince in the World, and that for his part, he would rather die a thouſand deaths, then ſuſpect him capable of ſo baſe a Deſign. So eaſie a thing it is for Treachery in Youth to deceive hoary Generoſity and Candour.</p>
            <p>On the Seventeenth of <hi>August</hi> the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd, and four days were ſpent in all the magnificent Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are uſual upon ſuch Occaſions.</p>
            <p>But now it was time for the Mine to play, that had bin ſo long working under Ground. As for the Proteſtants, there was nothing to be blam'd but too much Candour and Confidence. They deſign'd nothing but the Tranquility of their Country, and the Grandeur of the Crown.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, in the Papiſts, nothing but deep Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and villanous Deſign. While the Proteſtants were cajol'd with the moſt engaging Tokens of Friendſhip that ever could be ſhew'd, they took the King to be ſincere, and being then but juſt coming to be of Age, that he was going about to take new Methods of Government. And he had ſo artificially cover'd the Cruelty of his Temper with a ſhew of Good Nature, that the Proteſtants expected nothing but happineſs under him. And as for the Queen-Mother, tho' they knew her too well to put any Confidence in her, yet her paſſionate Affection for her Daughter, and her Revenge againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for poyſoning her Daughter, made them believe themſelves now aſſur'd of her. And perhaps ſo deep and ſo refin'd a piece of Diſſimulation was hardly ever known in the World before. So that there was but one part of the King's Deportment which could give any Ground for Jealouſie, and that was his continual uſing moſt horrid and blaſphemous Oaths and Imprecations to make the Proteſtants believe the Reality of his Intentions; a ſort of Perſuaſion which always raiſes Suſpition among ſober and wary Perſons.</p>
            <p>However the Proteſtants beginning at length to apprehend ſome danger, the Papiſts thought it neceſſary to execute their Deſign with all ſpeed. For they ſaw the King reſolv'd to let
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53884:19"/>
thoſe who had ſurpriz'd the Towns in <hi>Flanders,</hi> periſh without ſending them any relief. The Admiral alſo was reſolv'd to take his leave in few days; beſides that, his Friend <hi>Montmorency</hi> ſaw the Storm coming, and was retir'd to his Houſe, together with ſeveral other little Circumſtances, which gave them all juſt Cauſe of Fear: So that the Popiſh Party had no time to Ioſe. Therefore on the Twenty ſecond of <hi>August,</hi> about Noon, as the Admiral was going home from the Court, reading a Paper which he had in his hand, <hi>Maurenel</hi> the Aſſaſſin, whom the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had made choice of to do the Feat, ſhot him from a a Houſe where the Duke had plac'd him, with a Harquebuz charg'd with three Bullets thought to be poyſon'd. Of which one carry'd away a part of the Fore-finger of the Admiral's Right-hand, the other ſtook in his Left Arm, and the third miſs'd him. The King being in the Tennis-Court when the News was brought him, counterfeited a deep Reſentment, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly full of Affliction, and with a terrible Oath cry'd out, <hi>Shall I never have quiet?</hi> and ſo throwing away his Racket, went out in a rage.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> coming to the King to complain, and deſiring leave to go out of Town, ſince there was no ſafety ſo near the Court. The King ſeem'd to reſent it more then they, and with the horribleſt Oaths he could think of, ſwore he would execute ſuch a Revenge on all that were found guilty of it, whoever they were, that it ſhould never be forgotten, deſiring them to ſtay and be Witneſſes of it. The Queen-Mother alſo ſeem'd to inflame his Rage with moſt vehement Expreſſions, by which means they were perſuaded to ſtay.</p>
            <p>The next day, the King, with the Queen-Mother and his two Brothers, went to viſit the Admiral, and coming to his Bed-ſide, expreſs'd the greateſt Tenderneſs imaginable, and in his Looks, and by the tone of his Voice, diſſembled the moſt profound Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that could be, ſaying to the Admiral, <hi>You, my Father, have receiv'd the Wound, but I feel the Smart, and will puniſh it in ſo ſevere a manner that the like was never known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:53884:19"/>
The next day, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and his Uncle the Duke of <hi>Aumale,</hi> coming to the King, and deſiring leave to go out of Town, the King by his Looks and Carriage ſeem'd to abhor them; telling them that they might go whether they would, but that he would find them out, if they appear'd to be guilty of the Fact. Upon which they took Horſe, as if they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to go out of Town, but came back to <hi>Guiſe</hi> Houſe, and preſently began to raiſe Commotions in <hi>Paris,</hi> ſending their Agents up and down the City, and Arms to ſeveral Parts. Upon which the Admiral ſending to the King to deſire a Guard, about Fifty were ſent him, under the Command of <hi>Coſſoius,</hi> one of his moſt implacable Enemies; only ſome of the King of <hi>Navar's Swiſſes</hi> were ſent to keep Guard within the Doors. The King alſo order'd all the Papiſts that lay near his Houſe, to remove their Lodgings, that the Proteſtants might have the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to be about him.</p>
            <p>All which ſeem'd not only very ſincere, but very kind; and by ſuch Arts as theſe were the Proteſtants not only ſecur'd from Fears, but alſo had great hopes rais'd in them of future Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. Only the <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Chartres</hi> ſaw through this Diſguiſe, and in a Council of the Proteſtant Party held in the Admiral's Chamber, ſpoke his mind freely, and propos'd, That the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, ill as he was, might be carry'd to <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> in which there would be leſs danger then to ſtay in a place where they and all their Friends would be ſuddenly deſtroy'd; and ſo the next day left the City.</p>
            <p>This was carry'd to the Queen-Mother by a perſidious Perſon in the Aſſembly, one <hi>Bouchavannes.</hi> Upon which both ſhe and her Party being preſs'd for time, they reſolv'd to delay the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their Deſign no longer then the next night. So that the Cabinet Council being met, it was reſolv'd, That not only the Perſons of Quality of the Religion ſhould be Kill'd, but that every one, of what Condition ſoever, that were of that Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhould be Maſſacred.</p>
            <p>There was a long Debate, whether the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſhould periſh among the reſt. But as for the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> it was thought contrary to the Laws of Hoſpitality and of Nature to murther a Prince, that was now ſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53884:20"/>
nearly ally'd to the King. But for the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> who had marry'd his Wife's Siſter, interpos'd ſo vigorouſly for him, that at length he prevail'd for the ſparing of his Life. But for the reſt, it was agreed on to raiſe the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſet then on upon the Party.</p>
            <p>The Conduct of which was committed to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who firſt imparted his Deſign to the Guards, and order'd them to keep a ſtrict Watch, both about the <hi>Loure,</hi> and the Places where the Admiral and his Friends were lodg'd, that none might eſcape. Then aſſembling the Chief Magiſtrates and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the City at Midnight in the Town houſe, he gave them to un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſtand, that the King was reſolv'd to deſtroy the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, that had ſo long diſtracted the Kingdom: That therefore they ſhould repair every one to his Quarter, and have all People in readineſs with the greateſt ſecreſie that might be; and that they ſhould provide Torches and Flambeaus in a readineſs, to light out at their Windows: That the Sign ſhould be a white Linnen Sleeve on the Left Arm, and a white Croſs in their Caps; and upon tolling the great Bell of the Palace, which ſhould be done near the break of day, they ſhould light their Torches and march.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the King was under great Irreſolutions: The Horror of the Fact, the Infamy that would attend it, and the Danger he might be in, if it either miſcarry'd or were not fully executed, fill'd him with great Confuſion. But the Queen, who had overcome all the Perſuaſions of Tenderneſs and Pity which are natural to her Sex, ſo ſoon as ſhe heard of it, haſtned to him, and wrought him ſo effectually, that in the end ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd, and caus'd the King to ſwear bloodily that he would go through with it. Which done, the Queen being impatient, and fearing a turn in the King's Mind, caus'd the Bell of St. <hi>Germans</hi> forthwith to be toll'd; which was the Warning for tolling that of the <hi>Loure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Fatal Sign was given upon the morning of the twenty fourth day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> being Sunday, and St. <hi>Bartholmews</hi> day. Upon which in a ſhort time (with ſo much Diligence, the Blood-ſuckers had haſten'd their Preparations) above three ſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men were in Arms. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> with his Uncle
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53884:20"/>
               <hi>Aumale,</hi> haſten'd with the firſt (ſuch was their eager deſire of Revenge) to the Admirals Gate; which upon call was ſoon opened by <hi>Coſſeius,</hi> who kept Guard there on purpoſe, the more eaſily to betray him; and then the Murderers killed the Porter, and broke into the Court, where the King of <hi>Navars</hi> Switzers being overpowr'd by number after ſome Reſiſtance, the Murderers to the number of ſeven, all in Armour, broke into the Admirals Chamber, and finding him up, and in his Night-gown, <hi>Beſme,</hi> that had bin one of the Duke of <hi>Guiſes</hi> Grooms, advanced towards him; and having firſt thruſt him into the Belly, cut him over the face, upon which he fell, and then the reſt pierc'd him with their Swords, till he was quite dead. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> being below in the Court-yard, and hearing the noiſe, called to the Murderers to throw him out at the window; which <hi>Beſme</hi> and another did. At what time, when he was down, the Duke or <hi>Angouleſme</hi> wiped his face diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured with blood, to ſee if it were he indeed, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was he, trampled upon his Belly, and ſo went away: An <hi>Italian</hi> cut off his Head, and carryed it firſt to the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then Embalmed it, and ſent it to <hi>Rome.</hi> After this, all the Ignominy and Barbarity imaginable was exerciſed about the dead Carkaſs. His hands and fingers were cut off, his Body dragged about the Streets, thrown in the <hi>Sein,</hi> and hang'd up in Chains, his feet uppermoſt. But ſome days after <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy</hi> cauſed it to be taken down ſecretly, and buried in his Chappel at <hi>Chantilly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This done, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ran out into the Streets, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloud, <hi>that it was the Kings command they ſhould go on, and finiſh what they had begun.</hi> And then it was, that the Multitude was let looſe to murder all that were of the Religion; for which the Plunder of their Houſes was to be their own. After which, enſued the moſt enraged and cruel Maſſacre that ever was heard of: It exceeded all that either the Heathen had done, or all their Poets had faign'd, while every Man ſeem'd a Fury; and as if they had bin transformed into Wolues and Tigres, out did the cruelty of Beaſts: Twenty Lords of Note, Twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Gentlemen, and Ten thouſand others were all killed. No Age or Sex was ſpared, Husbands and Wives were Murthered
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53884:21"/>
in one anothers Arms, after they had ſeen their Children killed at their feet. One of theſe <hi>Miſcreants</hi> butcher'd an Innocent Babe, as it was playing with his Beard. Men of Four-ſcore were not permitted the ſmall Remainder of their Lives; but hewn down before their time: Nor did a ſingle death ſatisfy their bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Rage; but they made the poor Creatures dye many deaths before death releived them. Thoſe that fled to the Tops of their Houſes, were made to leap down into the Streets, where they were knockt on the head like Dogs; Such as thought to eſcape through dark Paſſages, were either immediately kild, or driven into the <hi>Seine,</hi> where the blood-thirſty Papiſts took pleaſure in killing and drowning them according to Art. The Streets ran Blood; and the <hi>Loure</hi> it ſelf was full of Blood and the dead Carkaſſes of thoſe whom the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and Prince <hi>Conde</hi> had brought along with them for their ſecurity; But where they expected a Sanctuary, they found a Maſſacre.</p>
            <p>Thus were the Proteſtants deſtroyed in <hi>Paris,</hi> with a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and Cruelty, which the moſt Barbarous of Nations had never ſhewed one to another: Nor had the Heathen bin ever guilty of any like it, towards the Chriſtians. The Preſident which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſhewn in the Maſſacre of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> was the likeſt thing to it in Hiſtory for Barbarity: But never had Treachery and Cruelty met together in ſuch a manner, till this Execrable day.</p>
            <p>Soon after a Jubilee was granted to all who had been in that Maſſakcre, and they were eommanded to go every where to Church, and bleſs God for the ſucceſs of that abominable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So little did they relent, after all theſe black and bloody Crimes, that they believed they had done God good Service. And to that hight did their Impudenoe riſe, that they preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd to Addreſs themſelves to that Merciful Being, who abhors cruel and Blood-thirſty Men, and that with hands not only pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with Blood, but boaſting of it as a Sacrifice offered to God, which had bin a fitter Oblation to him that was a Lyar and a Murderer from the beginning.</p>
            <p>But theſe bloody Facts were not confin'd to <hi>Paris</hi> only; there being a Proſecution of the ſame Cruelties in many other Parts of <hi>France.</hi> For at <hi>Meaux,</hi> a little Town not far from <hi>Paris,</hi> they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53884:21"/>
began about the twenty fifth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and ſpent the whole week in ſhedding Blood: They kill'd above two hundred, many of which were Women, whom they deflowr'd before they Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. At <hi>Troy</hi> in <hi>Champaigne</hi> about the ſame number was kill'd: At <hi>Orleans</hi> a thouſand; ſix or ſeven hundred at <hi>Roan.</hi> At <hi>Bourges, Nevers</hi> and <hi>La Charite,</hi> all they could find were killed: At <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louze,</hi> two hundred were ſlaughtered. At <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> they were for ſome time reſtrained through fear of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> but the Prieſts did ſo inflame the Multitude, that at length they Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred all they could find. At <hi>Lyons</hi> the Governour had a mind to have ſaved the Proteſtants, and to that end having got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about ſix or ſeven hundred, lodged them in ſeveral priſons to preſerve them. But the people were ſo heated by the Clergy, that they broke open the Priſons, and Murdered them all; drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g'd their Bodies through the Streets, and cut up the bellies of the fatteſt of them to ſell their Greaſe to the Apothecaries: So that all over <hi>France,</hi> as it is reported by a credible Author, there were no leſs then a hundred thouſand Butcher'd; beſides a hundred thouſand more that were ſent a begging, the moſt of them Widows and Orphans.</p>
            <p>When the News of this Maſſacre was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> which was upon the ſixth of <hi>September</hi> following, a Conſiſtory of the Cardinals was preſently call'd, at what time the <hi>Legates</hi> Letter, which contained the Relation of the Maſſacre, being read, they went immediately in a Proceſſion to St. <hi>Marks</hi> Church, where they offered up their ſolemn Thanks to God for ſo great a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Catholic Church. And on the <hi>Monday</hi> following, there was another Proceſſion made by the Pope and Cardinals to the <hi>Minerva,</hi> where they had High Maſs, and then the Pope granted a Jubilee to all Chriſtendom, of which this was one of the Reaſons, <hi>that they ſhould thank God for the Slaughter of the Enemies of the Church, lately Executed in</hi> France.</p>
            <p>Two days after this, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had another great Proceſſion of all the Clergy, Embaſſadors, Cardinals and the Pope himſelf, who came to St. <hi>Lewis's</hi> Chappel, where the Cardinal ſaid Maſs in Perſon, and in the King of <hi>France</hi>'s name, thank'd the Pope and the Cardinals for their good Counſels, the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53884:22"/>
help they had given him, and the Aſſiſtance which he had receiv|'d from their Prayers.</p>
            <p>Soon after, the Pope ſent Cardinal <hi>Urſin,</hi> in his Name, to congratulate the King of <hi>France,</hi> who in his Journey through the Cities, highly commended the Faith of thoſe Citizens who had a hand in the Maſſacres, and diſtributed his Holineſs's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings among them.</p>
            <p>Moreover the beſt Picture-drawers and Tapeſtry-weavers were put to work to ſet off this Action with all the Glory and Splendor that Art could invent, and a Suit of theſe Hangings is to this day in the Pope's Chapel.</p>
            <p>By all which we may eaſily gather what is to be expected from the <hi>True Spirit of Popery,</hi> and what we are to look for, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we come to lye at the Mercy of Prieſts and Jeſuites, whoſe Religion and Tenets will not only bear them out, but embolden and encourage them to commit ſuch treacherous and bloody Acts.</p>
            <p>From hence to proceed, and ſhew that more Arts of Cruelty have bin found by the Romiſh Clergy, for the Propagation of their Religion, then ever the Heathen Perſecutors reach'd to, let us take a ſhort view of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion.</p>
            <p>For moſt certain it is, that the firſt Principles of that inhuman Conſpiracy were roughly drawn and hammer'd out at the <hi>Roman</hi> Forge, powerfully ſomented by the Treachery and Animoſities of ſome of the Chief <hi>Iriſh</hi> Natives; and being once hatch'd and ſet on foot by that Vicar of the Devil, the Pope, was carry'd on by thoſe vigilant and induſtrious Emiſſaries of his, who are ſent continually abroad by the Power of that abominable See, with full Commiſſion, <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> to make way for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of the Popiſh Religion in all Parts where it has bin ſuppreſs'd; and by their venomous Infuſions work ſo powerfully upon the blind, ignorant and ſuperſtitions People, as to make them eaſily ready for Change, the Great ones miſchievouſly to Plot and Contrive, the Inferior ſort treacherouſly to riſe up and execute whatever they command. By the Examinations alſo of ſeveral Perſons to whom the moſt eminent and active of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prieſts has confeſs'd it, it appear'd that the Prieſts, Jeſuites and Fryers of <hi>England, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Countries
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53884:22"/>
beyond the Seas, were the Plotters, Contrivers and Projectors of that Inſurrection, and that they had bin buſied above ſix years in preparing and bringing it to paſs. And by Letters from <hi>Rome</hi> to Sir <hi>Phelim Oneale</hi> and the Lord <hi>Macguire,</hi> which were intercepted, it was no leſs apparent that the Pope and his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Nephews rejoyc'd when they heard that Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> had taken Arms, and aſſur'd him all Aſſiſtance from <hi>Rome.</hi> The Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, Prieſts, Fryers, and all the reſt of the viperous Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity belonging to their Holy Orders, were well aſſur'd of that, and therefore during the ſix years, loſt no time, but moſt dext'rouſly apply'd themſelves to accompliſh their Deſign. So that when the Plot was ſo ſurely (as they thought) laid, that it could not fail, and that the Day was once prefix'd for Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, they were ſo impudent as publicly to ſolicit Heaven, by their Prayers, for the good Succeſs of a great Deſign much tending to the Good of the Kingdom, and the Advancement of the Catholic Cauſe. And to facilitate the Work, and incenſe the Zeal and Fury of the People, they loudly declaim'd in all places againſt the Proteſtants, telling the People they were He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics, and not to be ſuffer'd any longer to live among them: That it was no more a Sin to kill a Proteſtant, then to kill a Dog; and that it was a mortal and unpardonable Sin to relieve or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect any of them.</p>
            <p>According to this Doctrin, one of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prieſts being ask'd, whether it were not lawful to kill an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſter, becauſe he would not go to Maſs, made Anſwer, That it was as lawful to kill him, as to kill a Sheep or a Dog. And ſeveral of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels after the Ceſſation, confeſs'd, That their Prieſts had given them the Sacrament, upon condition they ſhould ſpare neither Man, Woman nor Child that were Proteſtants. Nor did thoſe Caitif Prieſts and Fryers ſtick to ſtir up the Multitude, by promiſing them Celeſtial Wages for the Reward of Slaughter and Maſſacres. Inſomuch that one <hi>Ocullan</hi> a Prieſt told his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, That the Bodies of ſuch as dy'd in the Quarrel, ſhould not be cold before their Souls ſhould aſcend up into Heaven, and that they ſhould be free from all the Pains of Purgatory. But the moſt comfortable Encouragement was the Licence which their helliſh Prieſts gave them, under the Aſſurances of its being
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53884:23"/>
Lawful and Meritorious, to Strip, Rob and Diſpoil the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, there being no greater Incentive to provoke the Multitude to Wickedneſs and Villany, then Plunder and Rapine.</p>
            <p>The Rabble being thus let looſe, and prepoſſeſs'd by their Prieſts with a belief, that it was lawful for them to riſe up and deſtroy all the Proteſtants, as being worſe then Dogs, or rather Devils, and ſuch as ſerv'd the Devil, and aſſuring them, that the Killing of ſuch was a Meritorious Act, and a rare Preſervative againſt the Pains of Purgatory, preſently fell to work, and having partly by Force, and partly by Treachery, poſſeſs'd themſelves of the Chief Places of Strength in ſeveral Provinces, diſarm'd the Proteſtants, robb'd them of their Goods, ſtripp'd them to the Skins, and gotten their Perſons into their Power, could no longer contain from acting in all Places where they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſters, thoſe horrid Maſſacres and execrable Murthers which Canibals themſelves would be aſham'd to own. Then the <hi>True Spirit of Popery</hi> began to appear in her own Colours, and with delight to ſatiate her ancient implacable Malice, in her long wiſh'd for, and often plotted Deſtruction of the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>At the Caſtle of <hi>Liſgool,</hi> in the County of <hi>Fermanagh,</hi> the ſaid Caſtle being ſet on Fire, an Hundred and fifty Men, Women and Children were either burnt or ſmothered to death, not above two or three eſcaping.</p>
            <p>The ſame bloody Company being admitted into the Caſtle of <hi>Tullah,</hi> tho' it were deliver'd into the hands <hi>Rorie Mac <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uire</hi> upon Compoſition, and faithful Promiſes of fair Quarter; yet the Proteſtants having ſurrender'd their Arms, were firſt all ſtripp'd by the Rebels, and them moſt cruelly murther'd, to the number of an hundred: For they maſſacred ſtill by Whole-ſale.</p>
            <p>In the ſame County of <hi>Fermanagh,</hi> ſeventeen Proteſtants were half hang'd in the Church of <hi>Clowniſh,</hi> and ſo buried. For ſhould we number ſingle Murthers, we ſhould never have done, and therefore we pick out the choiceſt of their Cruelties. And thus they were not content to Murther a Child of one <hi>Thomas Stratton</hi> of <hi>Newton,</hi> but Boyl'd it to Death in a Caldron.</p>
            <p>In the Pariſh of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> they thruſt two and twenty Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants into a thatch'd Houſe, and then burnt them alive. In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, they compell'd a Woman to hang her own Husband.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53884:23"/>
One <hi>John Greg</hi> was quarter'd alive in the Church of <hi>Loghgall,</hi> and his Quarters thrown in his Father's Face. Lieutenant <hi>James Maxwell,</hi> by Order of Sir <hi>Phelim Oneale,</hi> was drag'd out of his Bed raving in the height of a Fever, driven two Miles, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd; and his Wife great with Child, ſtripp'd ſtark naked and drown'd in the Black-water, the Child halfborn.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Leighlin</hi> Bridge, a Woman was deliver'd of two Children, of which one had the Brains daſh'd out againſt the Stones, the other was more mercifully murthered.</p>
            <p>A Dyar's Wife of <hi>Roſs-Trevor,</hi> being great with Child of two Children, had her Belly ripp'd up by the Rebels, and was thrown both ſhe and her Children in a Ditch.</p>
            <p>In the County of <hi>Roſcommon,</hi> one <hi>William Stewart</hi> had Collops of Fleſh cut off from his Body while he was alive, Fire-coals put into his Mouth, and his Belly ripp'd up, and his Entrails wrapt about his Neck and Wriſts.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Temple-Houſe</hi> in <hi>Slego,</hi> ten Men, Women and Children were buried alive. And in the ſame County the Rebels forc'd one <hi>Lewis</hi> the Younger to kill his Father, and then hang'd the Son.</p>
            <p>In the County of <hi>Tyrone</hi> they hang'd up eight <hi>Scoth</hi> Infants upon a Cloather's Tenter-hooks; and having ripp'd up the Belly of a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> they ty'd the end of his ſmall Guts to a Tree, and then wound him round and round the Tree, that they might try (as they ſaid) whether a Dog's or a <hi>Scotchman's</hi> Guts were longeſt.</p>
            <p>With ſuch an inhuman Violence, and unſatiable Thirſt of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood; with ſuch Savage Butcheries of Men, Women and Children, without reſpect either of Age, Sex or Quality, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd in Story, did this barbarous and cruel Rebellion overflow the whole Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And all this by the Contrivance, and at the Inſtigation of the moſt immortal and bloody Generation of Men, the Jeſuites, Popiſh Prieſts and Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Fryers; a ſort of People ſo wickedly inhuman, and ſo inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly cruel, that the Damned may look for more Mercy in Hell, then Proteſtants at their hands, where-ever they come under their tyrannical and deſtructive Power.</p>
            <p>For not only by the recited Examples, but by a cloud of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proofs it appears, that the Execrable Rage of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:53884:24"/>
Murtherers, inflam'd by thoſe Infernal Incendiaries, was not ſatisfied with the variety of Tortures and cruel Deaths of the Living, by Stripping, Starving, Burning, Strangling, bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive; and by many Exquiſite Torments putting Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children to death (inſomuch that a quick diſpatch was a great Mercy, ſo cruel are the Mercies of the wicked) but their Helliſh Rage and Fury extended alſo to the Babes unborn, ripping them out of their Mothers Womb, and deſtroying thoſe Innocent Creatures, to glut their Savage Inhumanity. Nor ſtopp'd it there; but extended alſo to the Ranſacking of the Graves of the dead, while they dragg'd the dead Carkaſes of the Proteſtants out of their Graves, that they might not reſt in hallow'd ground.</p>
            <p>Neither did their Execrable Malice ſtay here, but became boundleſs, not only to the Deſtruction and Devaſtation of the Houſes, Caſtles, and whole ſubſtance of the Proteſtants, but even to the utter Extirpation of the Engliſh Nation, and the Proteſtant Religion out of the Kingdom. All which they acted with that brutiſh fury, as if the wild Beaſts of the Deſerts, Wolves, Bears and Tigres, nay Finds and Furies had bin let loofe from Hell upon the Land.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, words are not ſufficient to declare, how thoſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Rebels, actuated by their bloody Prieſts and Jeſuites, violated all Laws of God and Man, all Bonds of Charity and Human So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and how perſidious and treacherous they were; yet how true in the Obſervation of that Maxim of <hi>Rome, That there is no Faith to be kept with Heretics.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence it is now time to waft over into <hi>France,</hi> which brings up the Scene of theſe Tragical Relations, or rather ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Leſſons to warn all that are free from the Slavery of <hi>Rome,</hi> how they ſupinely ſuffer themſelves to be reduc'd under the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of her Cruelty. Hitherto the Jeſuits, Prieſts and Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have bin all for Maſſacre and Extirpation, the Torments and Tortures of which are but like Storms and Hurricanes, that laſt only for a time, from whence at length Death gives releaſe. But the <hi>French</hi> are generally accompted a more wittie and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſort of people then their Neighbours; and therefore the Virulent Popiſh Clergy of that Kingdom, tho no leſs malicious
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53884:24"/>
and wicked then their Brethren, would be thought more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious then to go the common Road of Maſſacre and Extirpation, finding themſelves perhaps ſo infamous for that already. For which reaſon they have found out a new way to keep Men alive in their Torments; and make uſe of their Tortures, not ſo much to kill the Body, as the Soul. They find they cannot by their own Arguments convert the Proteſtants, and therefore they ſend Profligate Dragoons and vilanous Soldiers, to try what they can do by the rude Arguments of Rapine and Violence. And becauſe they cannot find that ever Chriſt or his Apoſtles ever made uſe of any ſuch means of Converſion, therefore they pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Proteſtants not for their Religion, but for being Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and Diſobedient to their Soveraign, and make their rejecting Popiſh traſh and Ceremony to be diſloyaltie.</p>
            <p>Perfidiouſneſs and Ingratitude generally go together; and both meeting in the Popiſh Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> have bin the Ruin of ſo many hundred thouſand of <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, ſome in their Bodies and Eſtates, ſome in Eſtates Bodies and Souls altogether. But it is well known, that ſoon after the preſent King of <hi>France</hi> came to the Crown, there aroſe a Civil War in the Kingdom ſo ſharp and deſperate, that it brought the State within a hairs breadth of Ruin. In the midſt of which Troubles, thoſe of the reformed Religion kept their Loyaltic in ſo inviolable a manner, and gave each proofs of their Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Services, that the King found himſelf oblig'd to give pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Marks of it by a Declaration made at St. <hi>Germans,</hi> in the year 1652. So far were they from being at that time accounted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels or Diſobedient. But the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy of <hi>France</hi> more then Diabolically Malicious, and envying the Proſperity of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and believing a Toleration of their Religion would be an Eclipſe or Diminution of their Authority, orderd it ſo that their chiefeſt Glory, proved the principal and moſt eſſential part of their Ruin. For the Jeſuits and their Party made it their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to envenome all thoſe Impotent Services in the King, and his Miniſters minds: Reaſoning by the Inſtinct of the Devil, that if the Party of the Proteſtants were ſo conſiderable, that they could preſerve the State, they were able as well to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it, if a fair occaſion ſhould offer it ſelf: For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53884:25"/>
grounded upon Antichriſtian Politicks, a Reſolution was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to ſuppreſs all the Proteſtant Party, and to bury in Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion all the good Services they had done. To which purpoſe, in the firſt place, they took from them the uſe of their Churches, and deny'd them the benefit of Law and Juſtice, and overwhelm'd them with an Inundation of Criminal Proceſſes that faſtned on their Reputations, their Liberties and their Lives. The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and other Officers of Pariſhes were impower'd to enquire exactly into whatever the Reformiſts might have done or ſaid for ſome years paſt, either upon the ſcore of Religion or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and to make Information thereof before the Magiſtrates of the Places, who were to puniſh them without Remiſſion. So that in ſhort time, in all places, the Priſons were fill'd with theſe kind of Criminals, neither were falſe witneſſes lacking; and that which was moſt horrible was, that tho the Judges were convinc'd that the Witneſſes were all Knights of the Poſt; yet they maintained them and upheld them in their falſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. And thus the moſt Innocent and Virtuous perſons were Condemned, ſome to the Gallies, others to Exilement, and public penances: And this ſort of Perſecution fell chiefly on the Miniſters, who could never preach without having for their Spies and Obſervators, a Troop of Monks, Prieſts and Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries, who made no ſcruple to charge them with things which they never ſo much as thought of, and to pervert others into a contrary Senſe; and theſe falſe Interpretations of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thoughts, were lookt upon by the chief Miniſters of State, as evident Proofs. Then as for the Secular Proteſtants; Their Eſtates were weaken'd, and by expenſive Suits in maintenance of their own Rights, which were always giv'n againſt them, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort were deprived of all Offices and Employments, both Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and Civil; and the meaner ſort of all ways of Subſiſtance.</p>
            <p>They rendred all Arts and Trades almoſt inacceſſible to the Proteſtants, by the difficulties of arriving to the Maſterſhip of them, and by the exceſſive Expences they muſt be at to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein, which they could not be without a Law-Suit, under the weight of which moſt commonly they ſunk, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to hold out. They were made incapable of being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of Towns or Cities, and they were ſo narrowly lookt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53884:25"/>
after, that they were not ſuffer'd to be ſo much as Meſſengers, Coachmen or Waggoners, or any thing of that nature. Nay, they proceeded to that exceſs of Cruelty, that they would not ſuffer any Midwives of the Reformed Religion to do their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; by which unheard of Methods it is not to be expreſt how many particular Perſons and Families were reduc'd to Ruin and Miſery. And thus we ſee how ſevere the Uſages ſhew'd to the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants were, before they came to the utmoſt Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But now they come to open Force, to accompliſh the Ruin of the Proteſtants, and Dragooners muſt be the <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors to confute them of their Errors. The manner of which was this, in all the Proteſtant Towns, Cities and Villages of <hi>France,</hi> the Inhabitants were aſſembled together, and told, That it was the King's pleaſure they ſhould immediately turn Catholics; and that if they would not do it freely, he would make them do it by Force. To which the People anſwer'd, That they were ready to ſacrifice their Lives and Eſtates to the King, but their Conſciences being God's, they could not in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſpoſe of them. This being the general Propoſal, and the general Reply, preſently the Dragoons that lay not far off were all ſent for, and quarter'd in the Reformiſts Houſes at diſcretion, with a ſtrict Charge, That none ſhould ſtir out of their Houſes, nor conceal any of their Goods or Effects, on great Penalties. Then the firſt Arguments they us'd for the Converſion of the Souls committed to their Charge, was to conſume all the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the Houſe afforded; then to plunder what they could find, whether Money, Rings or Jewels, and in general what ever was of value: afterwards they pilladg'd the Houſes, and ſold the Goods before the owners faces. Laſtly, they fell upon their perſons, and there is no Wickedneſs or Act of Horrour which they did not put in practiſe to force them to change their Reli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gion. Amidſt a thouſand hideous cries, and a thouſand Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they hung up Women by the hair and feet on the Roof of the Chamber or Chimney Hooks, and ſmoakt them with wiſps of wet hay, till they were no longer able to bear it; and when they Had taken them down, if they would not ſign a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, they hung them up in the ſame manner again. They threw them into great fires kindled on purpoſe, and never pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53884:26"/>
them out till they were half roaſted: They ty'd ropes under their Arms, and plung'd them up and down in Wells, till they promiſed to change their Religion. They ty'd their hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, and then with a funnel pour'd Wine down their Throats ſo long, till being depriv'd of their reaſon, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be Catholics. They ſtript Women naked, and after they had offered them a thouſand Indignities, they ſtuck them with pins from the top to the bottom: They cut them with pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knives, and ſometimes with red hot pincers dragged them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the room till they promiſed to turn. They kept others from ſleeping ſeven or eight days and nights together, releiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, to keep them waking; If they found any ſick, and that kept their Beds, they had the Cruelty to beat twelve Drums together about their Ears without Interceſſion, for whole weeks together. They ty'd Fathers and Husbands to the Bedpoſts, and Raviſhed their Wives and Daughters before their faces. They pluckt off the Nails from the hands and toes of others: They blew up Men and Women with bellows, till they were ready to burſt: Pretending to ſhave Mens Beards, and cut their Hair, they flead off Skin and Hair from both Parts. Where they found wine and glaſſes good ſtore, they broke their glaſſes at every Health; and then having trod or broken the Glaſs very ſmall, cauſed the obſtinate Heretic as they call'd him, to daunce upon the broken Glaſs till he was able to ſtand no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; then ſtripping him, they rowl'd him from one end of the room to the other upon ſharp glaſs, till the Skin was ſtuck full of the little Fragments; and then ſent for a Surgeon to cut them out of his Body.</p>
            <p>By theſe Inhuman and more then Barbarous Arguments, do the wicked Crew of Jeſuits and Monks in <hi>France</hi> endeavour to vanquiſh the moſt reſolv'd Patiences; and by ſuch deviliſh inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as theſe to drive the diſtreſſed Proteſtants to deſpair, and faint-heartedneſs. They refuſe to give them Death, which they deſire, and only keep them alive to torment them.</p>
