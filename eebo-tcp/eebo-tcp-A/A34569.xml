            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS <hi>Delightful Companion,</hi> the <hi>Pipe Recorder,</hi> hath been for a long time out of use;
but now it's beginning to be in a greater Repute than ever it was before: And indeed
there is no Musick so near a natural Voice, it admits of excellent Harmony in Consort
of two and three Parts. I have therefore with the Assistance of several able Masters set
down these plain and easie Instructions for Beginners.</p>
            <p>The first thing that a Practitioner is to observe, is the true manner of holding the
<hi>Pipe,</hi> and placing his Fingers exactly on the holes; for the perfecting of which, observe these Rules
following:</p>
            <p>First, hold your <hi>Pipe</hi> with your left hand uppermost next your Mouth, then observe there is eight
holes upon the <hi>Pipe, viz.</hi> seven before and one underneath, which we call the uppermost, and is to be
stopt with your Thumb, the next with your fore finger, the third with your second finger, the fourth
with your third finger, next stop the next or fift hole with the fore finger of your right hand, your
second finger of the same hand stop on the sixth hole, then stop the seventh hole with your third
finger, the last or lowest hole stop with your little finger; having thus placed your fingers, be sure to
stop them all close, then begin to blow with a gentle breath, which will sound the first Note or Stop
which is called <hi>F-fa-ut,</hi> next take off your little finger, keeping all the rest close, then you will sound
or stop <hi>G-sol-re-ut,</hi> and so you are to proceed in all the Notes ascending, which are prickt upon five
lines, and named and placed according to the proper places in Space and on Rule according to the Scale
or <hi>Gamut,</hi> the several Stops are placed under them by Dots on seven Lines, the seven Dots do express
all to be stopt by your fingers as is afore-mentioned; where you see no Dots are placed, there the
holes are open, as you may plainly see and learn by this following Table.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In this Table observe, That the lower seven Lines represent the several holes, and the Dots
upon those lines what holes are to be stopt.</p>
            <p>The little finger or eighth hole hath no peculiar line, but is placed below the other seven lines, and
is expressed by this Signature or Circumflex marked thus <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>; next observe, that for <hi>G-sol-re-ut,</hi> above
which we call <hi>in Alt,</hi> you are to keep on your second finger on the third hole (as you find underneath it
a Dot on the third line) and not to blow the <hi>Pipe</hi> open as on the <hi>Flagelet,</hi> for so the <hi>Pipe</hi> will be out of
Tune.</p>

Next you are to observe, That the seven Lines and Dots are not intended for a method or constant
Rule to play by, for it is not a commendable way, neither do I advise any to use it any other ways than
to attain to the right knowledge of the Stops for every Note, that so you may the readier know them
when you come to play any Tunes prickt in the right Musical way upon five Lines, as all the following
Tunes are.</p>

            <p>Thus I have in the most plain and easiest manner I could, set down the Examples of all Notes and
Proportions of Time; such as desire to see the same more at large, I refer them to Mr. <hi>John Playford</hi>'s
<hi>Introduction</hi> to <hi>Musick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude; By these Rules and Directions, with a little help of some able Master to explain the
true meaning and use thereof, you may in a short time become good Proficients on this Instrument.
Thus hoping that these my Endeavours will be kindly accepted, it will be an Encouragement for me to
present you with a Second Part of this nature in a few Months.</p>
