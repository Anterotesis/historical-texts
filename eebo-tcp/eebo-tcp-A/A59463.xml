            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Most Illustrious Prince WILLIAM, Duke of NEWCASTLE, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>May it please your Grace,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O long as your Grace pèrsists in Obliging, I must go on in Acknowledging; nor can I let any opportunity pass of telling the World how much I am favored by you; or any occasion slip of assuring your Grace, that all the actions of my life shall be dedicated to your service; who by your Noble Patronage, your Generosity and Kindness, and your continual Bounty, have made me wholly your Creature: nor can I forbear to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that I am more obliged to your Grace, than to all Mankind. And my misfortune is, I can make no other return, but a declaration of my grateful Resentments.</p>
            <p>When I shew'd your Grace some part of this Comedy, at <hi>Welbeck,</hi> being all that I had then written of it, you were pleased to express your great liking of it, which was a sufficient encouragment for me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in it: And when I had finish'd it, to lay it humbly at your feet; what ever I write, I will submit to your Grace, who are the greatest Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Wit, the most exact Observer of Mankind, and the most accurate Judge of Humour, that ever I knew. And were I not assured of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of your favour, I should be afraid of the excellency of your judgment.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured in this Play at Humor, Wit, and Satyr, which are the three things (however I may have fallen short in my attempt) which your Grace has often told me, are the life of a Comedy. Four of the Humors are entirely new; and (without vanity) I may say. I n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>'r pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd a Comedy that had not some natural Humour in it not represented before, nor I hope ever shall. Nor do I count those Humours which a great many do, that is to say, such as consist in using one or two By-words; or in having a fantastick, extravagant Dress, as many pretended Humours have; nor in the aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ctation of some French words, which several Plays <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> shown us. I say nothing of impossible, unnatural Farce Fools, which some intend for Comical who think it the easiest thing in the world to write a Comedy, and yet will sooner grow rich upon their ill Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> natural Imperfection; and they might as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> has the humour of one

who speaks very fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t, and of another who speaks very slow: But Natural imperfections are not fit Subjects for Comedy, since they are not to be laugh'd at, but pitied. But the Artificial folly of those, who are not Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs by Nature, but with great Art and Industry make themselves so, is a proper object of Comedy, as I have discoursed at large in the Preface to the <hi>Humorists,</hi> written five years since: Those slight circumstantial things mentioned before are not enough to make a good Comical Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: which ought to be such an affectation, as misguides men in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Art, or Science, or that causes defection in Manners, and Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or perverts their minds in the main Actions of their lives. And this kind of Humour I think I have not improperly described in the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> to the <hi>Humorist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But your Grace understands Humour too w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ll not to know this, and much more than I can say of it. All I have now to do, is, humbly to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lay to your Grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, which has succeeded beyond my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Humours of which have been approved by Men of the best Sense and Learning. Nor do I hear of any profest Enemies to the Play, but some Women and some Men of Feminine understandings, who like slight Plays onely, that represent a little tattle sort of Conversation like their own; but true Humour is not liked or understood by them, and therefore even my attempt towards it is condemned by them. But the same people, to my great comfort, damn all Mr. <hi>Johnson'</hi>s Plays, who was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the best Drammatick Poet that ever was, or, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ever will be; and I had rather be Author of one Scene in his best Comedies, than of any Play this Age has produced. That there are a great many faults in the conduct of this Play, I am not ignorant. But I (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Pension but from the Theatre, which is either unwilling, or una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to reward a Man sufficiently, for so much pains as correct Comedies require) cannot allot my whole time to the writing of Plays, but am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to mind some other business of Advantage. (Had I as much Money, and as much time for it) I might perhaps write as Correct a Comedy as any of my Contemporaries. But I hope your Grace will accept of this with all its imperfections; which since the Royal Family have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved favorably, I have all my aim, if it be approved by your Grace, who are next to them, in the greatest esteem and observance of,</p>

               <l>YOu come with such an eager appetite</l>

               <l>Our Poet fears, that by so rich a Treat,</l>
               <l>Your Palates are become too delicate.</l>

               <l>To give a better taste to Comick Wit.</l>
               <l>But this requires expence of time and pains,</l>
               <l>Too great, alas, for Poets slender gains.</l>
               <l>For Wit, like <hi>China,</hi> should long buri'd lie,</l>
               <l>Before it ripens to good Comedy;</l>
               <l>A thing we ne'r have seen since <hi>Johnson</hi>'s days,</l>
               <l>And but a few of his were perfect Plays.</l>
               <l>Now Drudges of the Stage must oft appear,</l>
               <l>They must be bound to scribble twice a year.</l>
               <l>Thus the thin thred-bare Vicar still must toil,</l>
               <l>While the fat lazie Doctor bears the spoil.</l>
               <l>In the last Comedy some Wits were shown;</l>
               <l>In this are Fools that much infest the Town.</l>
               <l>Plenty of Fops, grievances of the Age,</l>
               <l>Whose nauseous Figures ne'r were on a Stage.</l>
               <l>He cannot say they'll please you, but they're new;</l>
               <l>And he hopes you will say, he has drawn <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>em true.</l>
               <l>He's sure in Wit he cann't excel the rest,</l>
               <l>He'd but be thought to write a Fool the best.</l>
               <l>Such Fools as haunt and trouble Men of Wit,</l>
               <l>And spight of them will for their Pictures sit.</l>
               <l>Yet no one Coxcomb in this Play is shown;</l>
               <l>No one Man's humour makes a part alone,</l>
               <l>But scatter'd follies gather'd into one.</l>
               <l>He says, if with new Fops he can but please;</l>
               <l>He'll twice a year produce as new as these.</l>

The other, Mr. <hi>Longvil,</hi> who has a pleasing sweetness in his countenance, an agreeable straitness, and a grareful composure and strength in his Limbs. I am distracted in my choice on whom to fix my affection. Let me see, which shall I like best? Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> is a fine person really, and so is Mr. <hi>Longvil:</hi> and so is Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> I vow, and so is Mr. <hi>Longvil,</hi> I swear.

               <l>Our Poet can from you no mercy find,</l>

               <l>Rant at the Gods, and do impossible things;</l>
               <l>Though they can laugh at danger, bloud and wounds;</l>

               <l>This Play is not well bred, nor yet well drest;</l>
               <l>Such Plays the Womens Poets can write best:</l>

               <l>Not in small trifling forms, but in good sense.</l>
               <l>Yet, Ladies, to Stage-fools some favour show,</l>
               <l>Since off the Stage some Fops you can allow.</l>
               <l>Few of the Sexes happy Favourites yet</l>

               <l>You know the pangs, and many labouring throws,</l>
               <l>By which your Brains their perfect births disclose.</l>
               <l>You can the faults and excellencies find;</l>
               <l>Pass by the one, and be to th'other kind.</l>

               <l>And cannot by your care its death escape,</l>
