            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It chanced that in Summers heate, this faire Virgin being greatly distressed for lacke of drinke, and not knowing where to get any, there sprung vp suddenly a christall streame of most sweet and pleasant water out of the hard ground, whereof this Virgin did daily drinke: Vnto the which God himselfe gaue so great a vertue, that many people hauing beene washed therein, were healed of diuers and sundry infirmities wherewith they were borne. Moreouer, round about this well, where this Virgin did vse to walke, did grow a kinde of Mosse, which is of a most sweet sauour, and the colour thereof is as fresh in Winter as in Summer; so that lying thereon, you would suppose your selfe to be on a bed of Downe, perfumed with most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious odours?

Why then belike I am not welcome, said sir <hi>Hugh.</hi> Yes quoth she, as welcome to me, as a storme to a distressed Mariner: I muse greatly that reason will not rule you, nor words win you from your wilfulnesse: if you were as weary to wooe as I am wearie to heare you, I am perswaded that long since you would haue ceased your vaine sute. You thinke by these perswasions to turne my opinion, but as well you may thinke that you may quench fire with oyle: therefore I pray you good sir <hi>Hugh,</hi> be not so tedious vnto me, nor troublesome to your selfe.</p>
               <p>Come, come, quoth he, all this will not serue your turue, ponder with thy selfe <hi>Winifred</hi> that thou art faire, O that thou wert as fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; thy beauty hath bound me to be thy seruant, and neuer to cease till I s√©e another obtaine th√©e, or my selfe be possessed of my hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Thou art a Kings daughter, and I a princes sonne, staine not the glory of true Nobility with the foule sin of obstinacie, but be thou as kind, as thou art courtly, and gentle as thou art noble, &amp; then shall our strife soone end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Winifred</hi> perceiuing that the farther off she was to grant loue, the more eager he was to desire it, shifted him off thus: Sir although your ouerhastinesse driue me into the greater doubtfulnesse, yet let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, if you loue me, to giue me one moneth respite to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on this matter, and it may be that vpon my better deliberation it shall be pleasing vnto you, and not at all discontent me.</p>
               <p>Faire loue, quoth he, farre be it from my heart to denie so kind a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; I am content to stay a moneth from thy sight, were it two or thr√©e, vpon condition that thou wouldest then grant m√©e thy good will: thr√©e moneths, although it bee very long, yet it will come at last, and could be content for that time to bee dead for thy sake, in somuch that my life might be renewed by thy loue.</p>
               <p>Nay (quoth <hi>Winifred</hi>) stay thr√©e moneths and stay for euer: by this a Maid may see how readie men are vpon a light occasion to take long daies, whose loues are like a Ferne bush, soone set one fire, and soone consumed, and s√©eing it is so, in faith sir <hi>Hugh</hi> I doe meane to try you better before I trust you.</p>
               <p>Pardon me faire <hi>Winifred,</hi> said sir <hi>Hugh,</hi> if my tongue doe outslip my wit: in truth I speake but to please th√©e, though to displease my selfe: but I pray th√©e, let it not be thr√©e houres, nor thr√©e quarters of an houre, if thou wilt.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:18841:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>Nay, nay (quoth she) your first word shall stand: after thr√©e months come to me againe, and then you shall know my minde to the full, and so good sir <hi>Hugh</hi> be gone: but if I doe euer heare from th√©e, or s√©e th√©e betwixt this time and the time prefixed, I will for euer hereafter blot thy name out of my booke of Remembrances, and neuer yeild th√©e that courtisie which thou at this time so earnestly intreatest for.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> vpon these words departed betwixt hope and dread, much like to a man committing a trespasse, that stayed for the sentence of life or death.</p>

               <p>Why how now brother? hath <hi>Winifreds</hi> faire beauty so greatly wounded you, as you cannot speake a merry word to your freinds, but sit in a corner, as if you were tonguelesse like a Stocke: tush brother, women are like shadowes, for the more a man followes then the faster mey run away: but let a man turne his course, and then they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently follow him. What man? plucke vp a good heart: for there are more women now, then liued in the time of our old father <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O, said <hi>Hugh,</hi> were there ten thousand times more then there are now, what were that to me, if <hi>Winifred</hi> he vnkinde? yet is she the oile that still maintaines she lampe of my light, and without her there is nothing comfortable to my sight.</p>
               <p>Then (replied <hi>Griffith</hi>) you are as much troubled in loue, as a Goat in an ague, and as blind as a Flie in October, that will stand still while a man cuts off his head.

               <p>By this time was the weather<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>beaten Barke driuen vpon the shore of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> where the men had safety of their liues, although with losse of their ships, and spoyle of their goods: but they had no sooner shaken off their dropping wet garments on the shore, but that they were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted by a sort of monstrous men that had but one eye a piece, and that placed in the midst of their foreheads, with whom the tempest heaten souldiers had a fierce fight, in which many of them were slaine, and diuers of them fled away to saue themselues; so that in the end sir <hi>Hugh</hi> was left alone to Fortune in a double Fray: and hauing at last quite ouercome all his aduersaries, he went his way, and so passing vp the country in darke night, in the end he lost his way, and was so farre entred into the darke wildernesse, that hee could not deuise with himselfe which way ha should take to get out, where he was so cruelly affrighted with the dreadfull cry of fierce Lyons, Beares, and wilde Bulls, and many thousand more of other dangerous &amp; cruell rauenous beasts, which with gr√©edy mouthes ranged all about for their prey: in which distresse, sir <hi>Hugh</hi> got him vp to the top of a tr√©e, and being there, brake out into this passion.</p>
               <p>O Lord (quoth he) hast thou preserued me from the great perill and danger of the Sea, &amp; deliuered me out of the cruell hands of monstrous men, and now suffer me to be deuoured of wild beasts? Alas, that my soule sins should bring so many sundry sorrowes on my head.</p>

               <p>This strange sight betwixt these two beasts, caused good sir <hi>Hugh</hi> to iudge that nature had planted bewixt them a deadly hatred, the fire whereof could not be quenched, but by shedding of both their hearts blood.

               <p>Thou didst wooe me for loue, and now haue I wonne thee to loue<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> where setling both our loues vpon God his loue, we will loue one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and in token of that heauenly loue receiue of m√©e I pray thee a chaste and louing kisse from my dying lips.</p>

               <p>The thing that I euer before called Loue, was but a shadow of loue, a sw√©etnesse tempered with gall, a dying life, and a liuing death, where the heart was continually tossed vpon the Seas of tempestuous sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and wherein the minde had no calme quietnesse: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore blessed be the time that I euer learned this Loue.

                  </gap>lt die likewise, and albeit the execution thereof be something deferred, yet at length it will come, and that shortly, for neuer did Tyrant carry gray haires to the graue.</p>
               <p>The young Lady desired first to dye, saying to Sir <hi>Hugh,</hi> Come deare friend and learne magnanimity of a Maid: now shalt thou s√©e a silly woman scorne death at his t√©eth, and make as small ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his cruelty, as the Tyrant doth of our liues, and there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all script vp her silken sl√©eues, and committed her slablaster armes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the executioners foule hands, hauing made choice to dye in bl√©eding: at what time being prickee in euery veine, the scarlet blood sprung out in plentifull sort, much like a precious fountaine lately filled with Claret wine.</p>
               <p>And while she thusbled, she said, Here doe I sacrifice my blood to him that bought m√©e, who by his blood washt away all my sinnes, O my sw√©et Sauiour, thus were thy sides pierced for my transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in this sort sprung thy precious blood from thee, and all for the loue thou barest to mankinde: I f√©els my heart to saint, but my soule receiueth strength, I come sw√©et Christ, I come.

               <p>But it is to bee remembred, that all the while the young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse bled, her blood was receiued into certaine basons, which being in that sort saued together, the Tyrant caused to be tempered with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And thereupon incontinently, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delaying of time, h√©e caused a cup of that most deadly poysoned blood to bee deliuered into his hands, who with a louely and cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenance receiued the same, and then vttered his minde in this manner.</p>
               <p>O thou cruell Tyrant (quoth h√©e) what a poore spite is this to inflict vpon a dying man, that is as carelesse how he dies, as when he dies? Easie it is for thee to glut me with blood, although with blood thou art not satisfied. Sw√©et blood (quoth he) precious &amp; pure, how faire a colour dost thou cast before mine eyes? Sw√©et I say wast thou, before such time as this ill sauoring poyson did infect thee: and yet as thou art, I nothing despise thee. O my deare <hi>Winifred,</hi> full little did I thinke, that ouer I should come to drinke of thy heart blood.</p>
               <p>My gr√©edy eye that glutton-like did f√©ede vpon thy beauty, and yet like the Sea was neuer satisfied, is now with thy gore bloud fully gorged. Now may I quench my thirstie desire with loue, that like hot burning coales set my heart in such an extreme heate, that it could not be quenched before this time; For if faire <hi>Winifred</hi> could spare any loue from Heauen, assuredly she left it in her blood, her sw√©et heart blood I meane, that nourished her chaste life: s√©e, here is a Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yes come (quoth he) my thirst is not quenched; for the first draught gaue me but a taste of sw√©etnesse, and like a longing woman, I desire the rest; and with that he dranke the second draught.

               </p>
               <p>I drinke to you all (quoth he) but I cannot spare you one drop to pledge me.

There with the last draught he finished his life, whose dead carkasse after hanged vp where the Fowles deuoured his flesh, and the young Princesse was contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously buried by the Well where she had so long liued.

               </argument>
               <p>IN the meane time that <hi>Crispine</hi> was secretly busied about his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, his brother <hi>Crispianus</hi> the same night, with many other, was prest to warres into the Countrey of <hi>Gaule,</hi> now called <hi>France,</hi> which made his Master and Dame full of woe, who had committed to his gouernement the whole rule of his house.

And as he sate one day at his worke, he sung this song in commendation of marriage, himselfe sung the Ditty, and his fellowes bore the burthen.</p>
               <l>AMong the joyes on earth, though little joy there be,</l>

               <l>A wife is evermore, both faithfull, true and just,</l>

               <p>Now now, what is that you say (quoth <hi>Crispine?</hi>) Nothing (quoth they) but onely beare the burthen of your Song. And surely we thinke it great pitty that you are not married, s√©eing you can sing so well in the praise of marriage.

               <p>The rest of the Iourney-men hearing him enter into such a d√©epe discourse of the matter began therefore to demand many questions: but s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Thou insolent Commander of the Easterne troupes, how durst thou set thy ambitious foot within our territories?

               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Prince sent him word, that it was a right hardy <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> which had performed that honourable seruice: but no knight, though well deseruing greater dignity, but a shoomaker in <hi>England:</hi> and thus (quoth he) a Shoomakers son was by a shoomaker foyled.</p>

                  <p>How Sir <hi>Simon Eyer</hi> being at first a Shoomaker, became in the end Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> through the counsell of his wife: and how he broke his fast every day on a Table that he said he would not sell for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds: and how he builded <hi>Leaden Hall.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>OUr English Chronicles doe make mention, that sometime there was in the honourable City of <hi>London</hi> a worthy Mayor, known by name of Sir <hi>Simon Eyre,</hi> whose fame liueth in the mouthes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men to this day, who albeit be descended from meane parentage, yet by Gods blessing, in the end he came to be a most worthy man in the common-wealth.</p>
               <p>This man being brought young out of the North Countrey, was bound prentise to a Shoomaker, bearing then the name of the <hi>Gentle-Craft</hi> (as still it doth) his Master being a man of reasonable wealth, set many Iourney-men and prentises to worke, who followed their businesse with great delight, which quite excludeth all wearines,

for when seruants doe sit at their worke like Dromedaries, then their minds are neuer lightly vpon their businesse: for it is an old prouerbe,</p>

                  <l>They prove servants kind and good,</l>

               <p>Now their custome was so, that euery Sunday morning diuers of these prentizes did vse to goe to a place neare the Conduit, to breake their fast with pudding Pies, and often they would take <hi>Simon</hi> along with them: but vpon a time it so fell out, that when hee should draw money to pay the shot with the rest, that he had none<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> whereupon h√©e merrily said vnto them: My faithfull friends, and Conduit compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, treasurers of the Water-tankerd, and maine pillars of the pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-house, I may now compare my purse to a varren Doe, that yeelds the K√©eper no more good than her empty carkasse: or to a bad nut, which being opened hath neuer a kernell: therefore, if it will please you to pardon me at this time, and excuse me for my part of the shot, I doe here vow vnto you, that if euer come to be Lord Mayor of this City, I will giue a breakfast vnto all the prentizes in <hi>London.</hi> We doe take your word (quoth they) and so they departed.</p>
               <p>It came to passe, that <hi>Simon</hi> hauing at length worne out his y√©eres of Apprentiship, that hee fell in loue with a Maiden that was a n√©ere neighbour vnto him, vnto whom at length he was married, and not him a shop, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The Officer being permitted to come in, after due reuerence, he said, Sir, it hath pleased my Lord Mayor, with the worshipfull Aldermen his brethren, with the counsell of the whole communalty of the honorable City, to chuse your worship Sheriffe of <hi>London</hi> this day, and haue sent mee to desire you to come and certifie your minde therein, whether you be contented to hold the place or no.</p>

               <p>What, content your selfe good husband (quoth sh√©e) and disable not your selfe in such sort, but be thankfull vnto God for that you haue, and doe not spurne at such promotion as God sendeth vnto you: the Lord be praised for it, you haue enough to discharge the place whereto you are called with credit: and wherefore sendeth God goods, but there withall to doe him and your Countrey seruice? Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (quoth he) it is an old prouerbe, Soft fire makes sweet mault: for such as take things in hand rashly, repent as suddenly: to be Sheriffe of <hi>London</hi> it is no little cost.

               <p>Good Lord Husband (quoth sh√©e) what n√©ede all these repetitions? you n√©ed not tell m√©e it is a matter of great charge: notwithstanding I verily thinke many heretofore haue with great credit discharged the place, whose wealth hath not in any sort b√©ene answerable to your riches, and whose wits haue beene as meane as your owne: Truely Sir, shall I be plaine?

herselfe ready, m√©et to goe before such an assembly as he went vnto, he went out of doores, at what time his wife called after him, saying: and holding vp her finger.</p>
               <p>Husband, remember, you know what I haue said: take h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>So soone as he was gone out of sight, his wife sent one of his men after him to Guild Hall to hearken and heare, whether her husband held his place or no: and if he do, bring me word with all possible sp√©ed.</p>
               <p>I will Mistresse quoth her man.</p>
               <p>Now when Master <hi>Eyer</hi> came to Guild Hall, the Lord Mayor and his brethren bad him heartily welcome, saying: Sir, the communalty of the City hauing a good opinion of you, haue chosen you for one of our Sheriffes for this y√©ere, not doubting but to finde you a fit man for the place.</p>
               <p>My good Lord, quoth hee, I humbly thanke the City for their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie and kindnesse, and would to God my wealth were answerable to my good will, and my ability were able to beare it. But I finde my selfe insufficient; I most humbly desire a y√©ere respite more, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for this present.</p>
               <p>At these words, a graue Commoner of the City standing vp, with one reuerence spake thus vnto the Mayor: My good Lord, this is but a slender excuse for Master <hi>Eyer</hi> to make; for I haue often heard him say, and so haue diuers others also, that he hath a Table in his house, where on hee breakes his fast euery day, that hee will not giue for a thousand pounds: Wherefore (vnder your Lordships correction) in my simple iudgement, I thinke hee that is able to spare a thousand pounds in such a dead commodity, is very sufficient to be Sheriffe of <hi>London.</hi> S√©e you now, quoth my Lord, I muse Master <hi>Eyer,</hi> that you will haue so lame an excuse before vs, as to take exceptions at your owne wealth, which is apparently proued sufficient; you must know Master <hi>Eyer,</hi> that the Commons of <hi>London</hi> haue searching eyes, and seldome are they deceiued in their owne opinion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looke what is done, you must stand to it.</p>
               <p>I bes√©ech you my Lord (quoth Master <hi>Eyer</hi>) giue me leaue to speeke one word. Let it be granted, that I will not giue my Table whereon I breake my fast for a thousand pounds, that is no conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to proue it is worth so much, my fancy to the thing is all<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>


                  <pb facs="tcp:18841:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for doubtlesse no man here would giue me a thousand shillings for it when they s√©e it. All is one for that, quoth my Lord Mayor, yet dare I giue you as much wine as you will spend this yeare in your Shriual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to let mee haue it: my good Lord quoth hee, on that condition I will hold my place, and rest no longer troublesome to this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. You must hold, sayd my Lord, without any condition or excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at all in this matter: and so they ended.</p>
               <p>The Assembly being then broken vp, the voice went M <hi>Eyer is</hi> Sheriffe, Master <hi>Eyer</hi> is Sheriffe. Whereupon the fellow that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris <hi>Eyer</hi> sent to obserue how things framed, ranne home in all haste, and with leaping and reioycing sayd: Mistris, God giue you ioy, for you are now a Gentlewoman.

               <p>Within a while after came her husband, and with him one of the Aldermen, and a couple of wealthy Commoners, one of them was he that gaue such great commendations of his Table, and comming to his doore, he sayd, You are welcome home good Master Sheriffe<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Nay, I pray you<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> come in and drinke with me before you goe.</p>
               <p>Then sayd hee, Wife bring me forth the Pastie of Uenison, and set mee here my little Table, that these Gentlemen may eate a bit with mee before they goe. His wife which had b√©ene oft vsed to this terme, excused the matter, saying; The little Table! good Lord hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, I doe wonder what you will doe with the little Table now knowing that it is vsed already? I pray you good Husband, content your selfe, and sit at this great Table this once. Then shee whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him in the eare, saying; What man, shall we shame our selues?

               <p>Trust me wee are troublesome guests (said the Alderman) but yet we would faine s√©e your little Table, because it is sayd to b√©e of such price.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18841:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>Whereupon his wife s√©eing him so earnest, according to her wonted manner, came in: and setting herselfe downe on a low stoole, laid a faire Napkin ouer her kn√©es and set the platter with the pastie of Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nison thereupon and presently a chaire was brought for Master Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman, and a couple of stooles for the two Commoners, which they beholding, with a sudden and hearty laughter, said; Why Master Sheriffe, is this the table you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
