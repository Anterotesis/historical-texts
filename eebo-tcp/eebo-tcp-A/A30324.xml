            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ANSWER
TO THE
ANIMADVERSIONS
ON THE
HISTORY
OF THE
Rights of Princes, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHen I first met with the Animadversions on
my Book of the <hi>Regale,</hi> I was not a little
surprized to find so many things laid to my
charge, of which I never so much as suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my self guilty: and thought it very
strange if I had so unhappily expressed my self in that Book, that
I had given any just occasion to such severe accusations. I knew
well my intentions were innocent and sincere, and I thought my
stile was not so dark or perplexed as to lead a Reader into such
mistakes concerning my meaning. But what darkness soever might
be in my expressions, I was very well assured I had none of those ill
intentions, with which these sheets charged me. What faults so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I may be guilty of, I am sure want of Integrity or Ingenuity
in my Writings is none of them, and for false Inferences, I may
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47930:3"/>
through weakness of Judgement perhaps draw them: But I am
sure I neither affirm nor suggest any thing falsly; and do think a
lie in a Book is so much a greater sin than in discourse, as it may
last longer, and deceive more. And upon this point, as I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
my Soul in relation to another World, so I chearfully venture
my reputation, which is the valuablest thing I have in this, if it
can be made appear that I have shewed either in that <hi>Criminal-book,</hi>
or in any other I ever writ, the least disingenuity, want of integrity,
or falshood.</p>
            <p>Finding my self so severely accused from the Press, in a way so
publick, as that of two sheets sold about the streets, and with
care conveyed to such persons, whose ill opinion might have a
particular ill effect on me, I could not be so over-charitable
as not to think that the Writer or Publisher of this, or both,
were not acted by so charitable and candid a Spirit as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
men of their profession. I found these sheets first in a
Stationers shop, and some hours after, that I might not want
the comfort of them, they were left at my house by the Penny
Post: I wondred much to see a man that professeth a zeal for the
Christian Religion, act so manifestly against some of the plainest
precepts of it. For besides the railing and ill language in it, and
the uncharitable Inferences and Judgements that are made to my
prejudice, the manner of doing it is so directly contrary to our
Saviours rule of speaking to our brother first in private, and then
in the presence of a few, before we proceed publickly against
him; that in Charity to the Animadverter or the Publisher,
I am bound to think that he made no reflection on that precept
while he wrote or published these sheets. I speak of the Writer and
Publisher as of two different persons, because he who is generally
supposed to be the Author, did very seriously protest to one of the
Right Reverend Fathers of the Church, that whosoever was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of those sheets (which he did not directly acknowledge was
himself) he did not intend to publish them till I had first seen them,
but that he had put them in the hands of another to have them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to me, who without his knowledge published them; and he
expressed over and over again some trouble by reason of their being
Printed in such a manner. This I take as it was told, without making
any reflections on it. It cannot be denied, but his friend shewed
an officious keenness in this matter, and it is hard to tell whether in
publishing them without his leave, he shewed himself less his friend
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47930:3"/>
than mine, and it was a strange piece of forwardness to Print such
Animadversions without the Authors consent, especially he being
here in Town.</p>
            <p>I had indeed upon another great occasion, shewed how ready I
was to receive corrections of such mistakes as I had made, and
how willing I was not only to submit to so kind a censure, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
to own to the world both my own Errours, and the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I lay under, to that friendly and learned person who
discovered to me some faults in the first Volume of my
History of the Reformation of this Church. I confess the stile of
these Animadversions had nothing of the gentleness and good
breeding which was in the other Animadversions, and as much as
the one exceeded the other in the matter, being really well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so much did it also in all respects shew the worthiness, the
exactness, and the candour of the Writer, which, I confess, do
not appear so very evidently in this: And I must say, if it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
I should have seen it first, and so have been gained by it to
have retracted what was amiss, the stile was not well considered:
For he that reproves and corrects as a Brother, with design to gain
ground on him to whom he offers such admonitions, ought to gild
the pill, and do somewhat to temper the aversion that is too na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to all men for such discoveries.</p>
            <p>As soon as I went home, and had got among my Books, I turned
to the places for which I was accused, and quickly found there was
no cause given for all those Tragical complaints; and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the discipline that was so liberally bestowed on me, there
were only two places in which there was the least colour of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
against me. The one was, that I cited a Capitular of <hi>Charles the
Great</hi>'s that was not full to the point, and forgot to refer to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that was much fuller. The other was, that I had taken <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naras</hi>'s
words too large, and that what he had said was neglected
by the greater number of the Bishops, I cited as if all the Bishops
had neglected it. These being the only two passages for which
I could censure my self, I did take heart a little, and presently
writ a particular Answer to the Animadversions, in which there
was mixed such a sharpness of stile, that how much soever I had
been provoked to it, yet I could not think it any way becoming
my profession to publish it with so much acrimony, which I thought
might be more easily forgiven in that Paper, that was intended
to be seen only by some few, and in particular by him that was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47930:4"/>
supposed to be the Author of them, for I was not unwilling that he
might see what I could in Reason and Justice say in my own defence,
and in answer to him, though upon other reasons I did not think it
convenient to publish it to the world in that stile.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of his Paper I am told that there are <hi>so many
things that seem amiss in my Book, that it would be extreamly tedious to set
them all down, and that therefore some general hints, and a few instances
are only pickt out.</hi> This, I confess, I look on as an artifice too common
to work much on any person, and therefore I do believe the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter
has done his worst: yet lest I should fall asleep upon this
confidence, I am told in the end that if I do not speedily correct in
a second Impression what is amiss in the first, I may look for some
<hi>rougher hand;</hi> but what hand can be <hi>rougher</hi> that keeps the Kings
Peace, and does not use a Cudgel or a Brick-bat, I do not imagine:
For how I can be used more sharply in words, than when I am taxed
with want of <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> of <hi>falshood</hi> and <hi>sedition,</hi> and
<hi>being an Enemy to the Government both in Church and State,</hi> I cannot
readily apprehend. But, I thank God, I have learnt to bear ill
language and unjust dealing without making the ordinary returns.
I will not pretend with the Philosopher to say, <hi>If an Ass kick, shall I
kick again;</hi> but, I hope, I may be allowed to learn of our Saviour,
who <hi>when he was reviled, reviled not again:</hi> and since he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Disciples to pray for them that despitefully use them:
I shall make no other return to all those reproaches, but to pray
God to inspire both the Animadverter and the Publisher with a
better temper, and to make them consider well when they bring
their <hi>gift to the Holy Altar,</hi> whether before they <hi>offer</hi> or <hi>consecrate</hi>
it, they ought not to do somewhat previous to it, for the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of one, whom, without any cause that I know of, they have
treated not as a <hi>Brother,</hi> but as an <hi>Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I once intended to publish no answer at all, but to rest satisfied
with the Vindication which I offered to a few of my Friends, and
to the sight of such as desired it, having laid my answer in a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
shop, where any that were curious might find it. I was
firmly resolved against saying any thing in Print at all, for I thought
in a time of common danger we had something else to be busied
about than the engaging in personal matters, by which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Church might have the diversion of seeing us employ the
Press one against another, and I had some time ago freely, and of
my self promised to some of my superiours, that if any thing in my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47930:4"/>
Book should draw forth an Answer from any of the friends of the
Church, I should sit silent, and leave what I had written to stand
or fall according to the strength that was in it. This I meant only
of such a fair answer, as might have been expected from a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
or a Divine, and therefore I did not conceive my self bound
by it, when I was so openly, and violently traduced, yet I was
so exact to what I had seemed to promise, that I would say nothing
of this matter, till one of the Right Reverend Fathers of the Church
told me it was necessary for me to free my self of those imputations;
and he undertook that my superiors should not be ill satisfied with
it, if I wrote without reflection or sharpness of stile. Upon this
Encouragement, I now publish my answer, and shall observe that
caution so carefully, that I will rather give the Reader cause to
complain that I write flat, than sprinkle it with that Salt, which
is thought necessary to give some relish to this dull sort of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
And if those that read what I wrote first, thought it too sharp,
I am confident they will rather think this is too much in the other
extream. I do not affect Satyre, nor am I so much concerned in
what censures may pass upon me, as to endeavour to redeem my
self from them, by any methods which are not sutable to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
and gentleness that become my Profession. I now come to the
Animadversions themselves.</p>
            <p>The first thing objected to me is, that the greatest part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in the former and latter parts of my book are borrowed
from <hi>De Marca,</hi> and that I disguise them as if I had taken them
from the Originals: I do not deny that I read <hi>De Marca</hi> very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
but he must needs know, if he has compared the Quotations,
that I have searched the Originals themselves: And indeed I do
not remember of any one Quotation in that whole book, taken
from second hand, which I do not cite as from that hand.
For this he first cites <hi>page</hi> 27, 28, 29, 30. compared to <hi>De
Marca, page</hi> 383. In all which there are but ten Quotations,
of which four are not mentiond by <hi>De Marca,</hi> so that here are but
six Quotations that he can pretend are from him. He again cites
<hi>Page</hi> 205. 210. and refers me to <hi>De Marca</hi> 439. and 442.
<hi>Page</hi> 205. there are four Quotations, of which three are not cited
by <hi>De Marca,</hi> and for the fourth, if he will come to my closet he may
see my mark on the book from which I vouch it. <hi>Page</hi> 210. there
are but two Quotations, one is from <hi>Balusius</hi> notes upon <hi>De Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
and the other is from <hi>Goldastus,</hi> which though I have not by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47930:5"/>
me, yet I compared it exactly, so this charge comes to nothing.</p>
            <p>His next charge is, that <hi>page</hi> 16. I had asserted with <hi>De Marca,</hi>
that there was no set quantity for the Christians oblations; but
forgot to observe from him, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> said they exceeded the
tenth part of their Revenues. I assert no such thing from <hi>De Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
but from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he set no rate on them: And it was not
necessary that I should vouch <hi>Irenaeus</hi> from <hi>De Marca,</hi> when in that
very page I cite his own words, <hi>that the Christians did not give less
than the Iews, who gave Tithes, but converted all they had to Religious
uses;</hi> and I do not see how necessary it was for me to say that <hi>De
Marca</hi> had observed this.</p>
            <p>The second head of my Accusation is of those passages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I have mistaken the words or the sense: I shall not criticize a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the mistaking of words, which may be <hi>miscited,</hi> but not <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken.</hi>
He tells me he could at least produce 40 examples of this,
but in great tenderness for me, he gives 7 for the specimen; so
the other 33 are to be judged by these.</p>
            <p>The first is <hi>page</hi> 13. He accuses me for saying that mention is
made of Elections by the People in the Second and Sixth Canons of
the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> and affirms that mention is made of them in
neither of those Canons. I see no way of conviction, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Canons themselves. In the Second, mention is made of
some things that were done against the Ecclesiastical Canon <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
through the urgency of men; and they instance
it in two particulars, the one is that they brought those who were
newly converted from Heathenisme to be baptized; the other is,
that as soon as they were baptized they used <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
to <hi>promote</hi> or <hi>bring,</hi> or <hi>advance</hi> to a <hi>Bishoprick,</hi> or <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterate.</hi>
Now though these words alone might perhaps be wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to another sense, yet if we compare them with the History of
that time, they can admit of no other sense; especially if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

which was to take place, notwithstanding the opposition
of two or three, can only be understood of the Election by the
People: For that suffrage which the Bishops gave, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of it, and proceeded to ordain the elected person, was
not determined by the Majority: For the Metropolitan had a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
So that the Election where the Majority prevailed, must
be only understood of the decree, that was made by the people.

wrong, and to make this pass the better he puts those words
which I had set down as my own, in <hi>Italica,</hi> to make it appear that I
had set them down as a part of <hi>Cyprians</hi> words, and had rendred
<hi>quae nunc ratio &amp; forma tenetur, instead thereof.</hi> If the scope of <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
Epistle is considered, it will appear to how little purpose these
words are cited. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is arguing against Churchmens medling
in Secular affairs, and he brings the instance of the Priests and Levites
among the <hi>Iews,</hi> who were well provided for by Tythes, that
they might have no tentation lying on them, to entangle themselves
with the cares of this World. <hi>Which reason and form,</hi> says he, <hi>is
observed in the Clergy:</hi> The <hi>reason</hi> was that they being well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for, might be freed from these distractions, and the <hi>form</hi> was
their receiving their share out of the Basket, as a Tythe of the fruits
of the Earth.</p>
            <p>In the end of this Paragraph, he accuses me for saying that
<hi>Origen</hi> affirmed that <hi>First-fruits were only to be payed under the
Gospel:</hi> and says that he mentions <hi>Tythes as due under the Gospel.</hi>
By this it appears that either these Animadversions were writ in
hast, or that the writers thoughts went too quick, for all I said
was that <hi>Origen</hi> concluded that <hi>First-fruits only were to be brought
to the Priest.</hi> And it is certain that he does not speak one word
of <hi>paying Tythes to the Priest;</hi> but all along repeats that of the
first-fruits: So that it does not appear that he thought it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to <hi>bring Tythes to the Priest.</hi> But I never said that he affirmed
that first-fruits were only <hi>due under the Gospel.</hi> There is a great
difference between what was to be <hi>paid to the Priest,</hi> and what <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians

the endowments of Churches: and tells me those are the
endowments of Monasteries and not of <hi>Parish Churches;</hi> But I did
not name <hi>Parish Churches;</hi> this was put in by him, otherwise he had
lost his Objection. I hope he does not deny that Cathedrals are
Churches, though possest by Monks. I cite but four of these, and
of the first it does not appear what sort of Church it was; of the
second it is clear it was the Cathedral, where St. <hi>Martins</hi> body lay;
and it mentions Rectors as well as the Abbot. The third and
fourth that I cite, are general forms of endowment, for Churches
that had either Abbots or Rectors in them, and were to be filled
up according to the constitution of the Church, to which the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment
was made.</p>

my self guilty of it; but if this imports the quite contrary,
then he was too inconsiderate in his censure. Nor will it serve
his turn to say that some <hi>Eastern</hi> Kings did take Tythes; <hi>that being
begun when the Kings and Priests were one person:</hi> For <hi>Samuel</hi> that is the
ancientest Author cited for it, lived some ages after those two
Offices were divided: And St. <hi>Paul Heb. 7. ver.</hi> 2. after that he
had said that <hi>Abraham</hi> gave a tenth part of all to <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi>
adds, <hi>He being first by interpretation King of Righteousness, and after
that also King of Salem;</hi> and ver. 4. he says <hi>consider also how great this man
was, unto whom even the Patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoil.</hi>
I leave it to any impartial man to consider if this will not justifie
my exposition, guarded with a <hi>perhaps</hi> and an <hi>it seems.</hi> It is true
St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues afterwards upon the supposition of Tythes being
due to Priests, but this was to the <hi>Iews</hi> to whom he wrote: But
if he had intended to bring the Christian Church under the like obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
it is not very accountable why he did not say one word
about it, this being so proper a place for it.</p>

the Council of <hi>Chalons</hi> obliged the Bishops in their visitations to
<hi>confirm,</hi> and not to prey upon their people, and tells me that the
Canon did only oblige, that when they did visit to confirm, they
should not oppress their people: But the Canon in general speaks <hi>cum
Episcopi Parochias suas peragrant, &amp; si quando peragrandae parochiae
necessitas incumbit,</hi> and charges them that they should confirm,
enquire what was to be amended, Preach the word of God, and that
they should use their industry rather in the gaining of souls, than
in the robbing and spoiling of their Subjects, and scandalizing of
their brethren: Now I am not quick sighted enough to divine what
can be made out of this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 192. He challenges me for citing <hi>Zonaras,</hi> saying that
there were no Stewards in the <hi>East</hi> in his time, and alledges that
he says that many Bishops, and some Abbots did not regard the
Canon that enjoyned the use of them. But he says that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part did not observe it, <gap reason="foreign">

contracts it as if it only signified <hi>many:</hi> But the whole matter is
of no consequence. And now if the rest of the forty places be
to be judged of by these as the sample, I shall not much apprehend
the censures of Learned and impartial men; but if a man has
before hand resolved to find fault, it will be no hard task to write
severe strictures, on much better books than I can pretend mine
to be.</p>
            <p>But now I come to the third head of this accusation, of my omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssions
of many passages which the Animadverter thinks were as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to me as those I have cited; and he judges that they were past
over by me, lest they should look too favouorably on the Clergies
power or their right to the Tythes. But he does not know if
these were as obvious to me, as it seems they were to himself;
and he must know me better than he does yet, before he can
judge what my intentions are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 40. He quarrels with me for not citing a part of the 23.
Canon of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the 13. Canon of the <hi>African</hi> Code, which
speak of the Election of Bishops. By the Metropolitan and the other
Bishops of the Province. But this was not at all necessary to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
for I had laid it down as a thing undisputed, over and
over again, that the Bishops had a power of judging, after the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47930:7"/>
people had pitcht on the person; nor was it ever imagined by any
that I know of, that the Bishops met meerly as tools for ordaining
those that were nominated by the People; though violence was
sometimes used, for which see what I have said <hi>page</hi> 7, 8, 9, 12, 13.
therefore having laid that down as an unquestionable truth, there
was no need of accumulating more proofs: So there was no cause
to charge this on me as a designed omission.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 72. He charges me for leaving out the clearest and firmest
proofs for Tythes, of the Fathers of that age; and yet as there are
none more eminent than <hi>Chrysostom, Ierom</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> whom I cite;
so I do not remember to have fallen on any thing more express for
them in Doctor <hi>Combers</hi> History of Tythes. It is very strange
that he does not observe a difference between the advising People to
set off more than a tenth for Charities, and a rule obliging them
to pay in a tenth, as a Rent due to the Priest. And that this was
never set up in the Greek Church, nor authorized by the <hi>Roman</hi>
Law, seems some inducement at least to a man of no extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sagacity, to believe that the Divine right of Tythes payable to
Priests, antecedently to humane Laws, was not the Doctrine of
that age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 119 He challenges me for not citing all the Laws made
by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, for the payment of Parochial Tythes, and
is not satisfied that I cite two. But my purpose was to shew it
was setled by him; and I do not see the great need of telling
how oft this was repeated by him: And after that I had said that
<hi>Alfred</hi> had setled the payment of Tythes in <hi>England,</hi> I do not see
why he should object to me the not mentioning the latter Laws
that came afterwards: For either those were only confirmations
of the former, and so they signifie nothing; or all that could have
been drawn from them was to represent the unwillingness of the
People to submit to them, and who knows but he would have
made this criminal in me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 127. His next exception is that I say before <hi>Caroloman</hi> and
<hi>Pepin,</hi> there had been no Synods in <hi>France</hi> for 80 years, that is
from 662. till 742. and this still holds good, notwithstanding the
four he mentions; for by <hi>Synods</hi> it is plain, my meaning was As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
for regulating the affairs of the Church. Some meetings
indeed there were in that interval, which seem rather to have
been Assemblies of the Estates or Parliaments, than Ecclesiastical
meetings: For in some of them the Priviledges of Monasteries were
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47930:7"/>
confirmed, and in other Bishops were condemned to be behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But that which he cites from <hi>Binnius</hi> at <hi>Chalons</hi> is not in my
Edition, nor will I enter into dispute with him whether <hi>Vtrecht</hi>
belongs to <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Germany.</hi> But for justifying what I said, <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi>
his letter to Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> is a sufficient authority, for (cap.
2.) he writes to him that the <hi>Franrks, as ancient men then said, had
had no Synod for above eighty years.</hi> This serves to acquit me and
hereafter he may deal with <hi>Boniface</hi> as he pleases.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 129. He accuses me for passing over some words in a
Canon at <hi>Akin</hi> which shew that <hi>Charles</hi> the Great believed that
Tythes were due by a Divine right. But he cannot think I intended
to disguise this matter, for <hi>page</hi> 113. where I first enter upon it, I do
largely set out the Churches pretending to a Divine right for them;
and it was needless to repeat this at every time, though I do
expresly speak of it again <hi>page</hi> 140. and 141.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 180. He accuses me for leaving out that provision made
for the Emperours power of annulling Elections by the Clergy
and People, in the Popes concession of the investiture to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
But if this is not plainly enough insinuated in these words,
<hi>that when a Bishop was canonically elected by the Clergy and People,
he should not be consecrated till the Ring and Staff were given him by
the Emperour,</hi> I am to seek as to the true use and sense of words:
For this clearly expresses that the Emperour had a Negative, and
by consequence the power of annulling Elections: and they are
the very words of the Popes concession.</p>
            <p>The fourth Head is of the contradictions he finds me guilty of,
of these he reckons up three, but with what success I now come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 52. and 169. I had affirmed that Church Lands in <hi>England</hi>
before the Conquest were subjected to the service called <hi>Trinoda Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitas,</hi>
for <hi>Fortifying Castles, building Bridges,</hi> and a <hi>rate for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,</hi>
and yet from <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> I assert that they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> held their
Lands in <hi>Frank Almoin,</hi> and so were free from all secular service.
He acknowledges I have cited Right from <hi>Matthew Paris;</hi> so all his
quarrel must be for what I say of the <hi>Trinoda Necessitas.</hi> I my self
have seen it in some Original Charters in the <hi>Saxon</hi> time, which I am
ready to shew him as soon as I certainly know his name. If there is
a contradiction between these two things, I am not to be blamed
for it, having good authority for all I affirm: And if there should
fall to be a contradiction betwixt Original Charters, and <hi>Matthew
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47930:8"/>
Paris,</hi> who was a Monk, and so ready to speak in favour of
their priviledges, one would think it were not very difficult to
determine the controversie. But if they can be both reconciled,
then the contradiction and objection both are out of doors. They
were exempted from all constant and personal services, and so were
free from the bondage of the feudal tenure, yet upon great emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
they might be obliged to bear a share in the public bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
            <p>The two other contradictions are a little odd. He tells that
whereas <hi>page</hi> 117. I had made this distinction betwixt the Levitical
Priesthood and Church men under the Gospel, that whereas the
former had not the charge of Souls, the latter had it; and yet
<hi>page</hi> 323. I say the distinction of <hi>with cure</hi> and <hi>without cure</hi> is
ill grounded, and savours too much of the niceties of the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists.
Now where to find out the contradiction here, is really above
my skill; I had asserted that Church-men under the Gospel have
the care of Souls; and pursuant to this, I rejected the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of benefices <hi>with</hi> and <hi>without cure,</hi> (the word <hi>benefice</hi> was left
out, for it would have spoyled this imaginary contradiction.)
If the quarrel to me is, because I am displeased with those, that
whatsoever be the nature of their Benefice, are sure to make them
<hi>sine cures,</hi> I must submit to his indignation, for I cannot easily
change my mind in that particular.</p>
            <p>The next contradiction is no less strange, <hi>page</hi> 126. I blame
Bishops for turning Souldiers; and yet <hi>page</hi> 131. I relate how
they were forced to go to the Wars. Now if it is impossible to
force a man to do a thing unbecoming his profession; here's a
contradiction with a witness: But he may as well call it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to blame men for apostatizing from the Faith, and
yet shewing how they were forced to it by Persecution.</p>
            <p>Having thus far examined the contradictions objected to me,
I now come to consider another part of my charge that falls under
the fifth head, of my <hi>odd and mistaken assertions, false reasonings,
weak suggestions,</hi> which only shew <hi>ill will to the power and rights of
the Clergy;</hi> and of this he gives ten instances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 18. I tell that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> gathered 100000 Sesterces for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
Captives, and yet <hi>page</hi> 21. I seem to think it Poetry in <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius,</hi>
when he mentions the Christians offering thousands of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterces:
whereas I made no reflections on the quantity of the summ,
but upon that acusation of the Heathens, that the Christians sold their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47930:8"/>
Lands, and brought in the prizes of them, and of this all I
say, is that it's hard to determine how much of Poetry may be in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 65. He accuses me, that in imitation of Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> I cite
Canons that were made to prevent abuses, and were frequently
established upon one or two ill practices, to prove abuses crept
into the Church, which he calls a <hi>false</hi> and <hi>disingenuous way of arguing.</hi>
This I had said when I began to treat of the Canons of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and eight of these Canons do expressly mention
abuses crept in: Now one would think that this might suffice to
acquit me of falshood or disingenuity. The maxime is not more
common than true, <hi>Ex malis moribus oriuntur bonae leges,</hi> and few
Law-givers have the foresight to prevent abuses, though all that
are good have the zeal to condemn them when they appear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 72. He accuses me for saying that in St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>'s time
there was no rule set for the Charities of Christians, and says
that my own instances prove they thought it a sin to give less than
a tenth; yet St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> expresly says he did not pretend to
make a Law in that matter: and there is one distinction that he
seems resolved never to observe, between the setting a rate on
what the Christians were bound to pay into the Church, and the
directions that were given them for their Charities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 80. He condemns me for what I say against converting
fines to Secular uses, and says that since the money raised out of
Tythes may be applied to the maintenance of ones family, which
is a Secular use, why may not fines raised by Leases be applied to the
same purpose? But it's clear I was speaking of those Fines that were
raised to the prejudice of ones successors or of the Church, so in this
case I plead for the Rights of the Church. There is indeed no reason
to blame the levying of fines, if the Leases do last but ones own
life; but I cannot see why an Incumbent should have a consideration
for those years in which his Successors may enjoy the Benefice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 113. He says I applaud the distinctions found out to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the payment of a full tenth part, whereas I neither applaud
them nor condemn them, but barely relate matter of fact: He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
accuses me for calling it the heaviest tax that any Nation ever
came under, <hi>as if I forgot that this is all that men give for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of Ministers to look to their Souls,</hi> which insinuates that he thinks
it still too little; And says, that I do not consider <hi>that the Iewish</hi>
Nation was put under a double Tythe by God himself. This last
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47930:9"/>
he knows I have considered, and shewed the difference between
Jews and Christians: The former having their soil given them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by God, who might therefore lay what charge on it he
pleased, which is not the case of Christians. A tenth in a cold
climate, upon a moderate computation, will rise to a fifth, if not
to a fourth part of the revenue. Now the People of this Nation
are estimated at six millions, and the Clergy are about ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand;
the six hundredth part of the whole. It will be necessary
therefore that the proofs be very clear, before it can be easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that the six hundredth part of a Nation have by Divine
Right, a title to a fourth or fifth part of its Revenue. One would
think that the Taxes for the preservation of the State ought in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be much higher, the necessary expence of Government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much greater; and yet no Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> unless it be <hi>France</hi>
of late, has paid a half of the full tenth of the growth to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
treasure. He also goes on confidently in one mistake, though
I have taken some pains to rectifie it in my Book, that the Tythes
are the Priests portion alone, whereas I have fully proved that at
first it was appointed that they should be divided between the
Clergy and the Poor: I confess, I have great prejudices to any
Doctrine, which if true, puts a whole Nation in a state of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and brings them under so hainous a guilt as the sin of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge
must draw after it. He asserts the Parochial Right of
Tythes, and that he that blesses the People has a right to them;
and if this is true, then the King, and all the Nobility and Gentry
that are impropriators, all the Bishops, the Cathedrals, Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
and Colledges who have impropriated Tythes in their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
and all Non-residents who farm out the blessing of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to their Curates, and yet raise the Tythes, must be every one
of them in a state of damnation. For the last of these I am not
very sollicitous, but for the former, I will not easily drink in such
a damning Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 117. He accuses me for gathering some odd pretences to
give reason why Tythes were easier to the <hi>Iews</hi> than to us: He says,
I urge the vast number of the Priests, and one would think that
the thirtieth part of a Nation (which was the lowest proportion of
the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi>) had a right to a greater portion than the six
hundredth part. He also says that I urge the fruitfulness of their
Land and the barrenness of ours, which, he adds, I drew from the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47930:9"/>
Quakers Books, but I can assure him, if he will believe me, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read one of them on this Argument. I think it is no such My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
but that any Man might have hit on it, that a fruitful Land
may pay a greater Rate than a barren: But I have given no advantage
to the Quakers for their unjust Robbery of Church-men, or rather
the robbing of God, in detaining that which the Law provides for
them; which it might well do, tho there were no antecedent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Right making it necessary: and the Law, which is the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Property, having determined this, the denying to pay it is
as much Injustice, as robbing on the High-way: the Sin of which
is not one Jot the less, tho no Man can make out his Title to his
Goods from a divine Right. And the Sin of this is so much the
greater, as the robbing God must be greater than the robbing a
private Person.</p>
            <p>Page 118, he accuses me for <hi>affirming falsely concerning us and the
Iews, that the same Rule was applied to all: tho I grant that the Iews
Tithe was but a fifth Part, and know that the Christians was but a
tenth.</hi> So here I lie against my Conscience. I will not say this is
a willful Mistake in him, but I am sure it is a gross one; for the <hi>all,</hi>
to whom I say the <hi>same Rule was applied,</hi> does not belong to Jews
and Christians, but to the Northern and barren Climates, where
the Returns are not above ten, five, and in some not above three.
And for the kindness of his Censure, I leave it to his own Conscience
to consider, how far he is bound to ask God Pardon for it.</p>
            <p>Pag. 172. He condemns me for my Criticism about the Term
<hi>Bishoprick</hi> Anno 1077, and says, that I bring Proof that it was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
used: and yet all that Proof is the Title of a Chapter, where
it is once used; and every Body knows that Titles we reset before
Books or Chapters some Ages after they were written.</p>
            <p>Page 199. He accuses me for saying that Kings might begin the
Seizure of the Goods of deceased Bishops, as representing the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who before might make those Seizures: and whereas the
Poor at first made them, he argues that the Kings could not be
supposed to represent the Poor. But since I pretend only in this
Matter to proceed upon Conjecture, any Errour I may be guilty
of, ought to be easily forgiven me: and I tell what might have
fallen out in Fact, and not what is to be defended in Right. It
is probable, as long as the Bishops were poor, the poor only spoiled
their Goods; but when they grew rich, it is like enough others
might have mixed with the poor in these Spoils, and that might
have invited the Officers of Princes first to seize on them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:47930:10"/>
Page 320, He accuses me for saying that there was nothing so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
under the New Testament as was under the Old, and cites
that of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi> But certainly great Difference is to be
made between a voluntary Dedication, and a divine Appointment,
and between the Laws of God, that cannot be repealed but by
the same Authority that first enacted them, and human Laws, that
are still subject to the supream legislative Power.</p>
            <p>But his last Instance makes Amends for all the Defects in the
former. This Nation has been under great Apprehensions of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery:
many Expedients have been proposed, and the Dangers
have been much considered, and nothing has been more seriously
examined by both King and Parliament for some Years, but none
of them were so wise as to foresee one Danger, with which he
frights me: Because <hi>I determined, that a Popish Prince may extend
the Regale to all Churches in his Dominions, and this he thinks an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
Assertion to publish here in</hi> England, <hi>as our Case stands with
respect to the next in Succession.</hi> But if this be all the Danger he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends,
he may go to bed and sleep very securely, for the <hi>Regale</hi>
is already in the Crownhere, and has been for some Ages exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to all the Churches in <hi>England.</hi> So the next Prince can add
nothing to what the Crown is already vested with.</p>
            <p>The sixth Head, for which I come under his Discipline, is the
many gross Reflections on the Clergy, both ancient and modern,
which he thinks <hi>prodigiously strange,</hi> and especially in this Age, and
that the rather, that the Ground of many of the Accusations is
false, and to bring this to Instances he complains, that</p>
            <p>Page 26, I inveigh against the Corruptions of the Church in the
Beginning of the fourth Century, and yet acknowledg that the
better and sounder Part did still prevail in publick Synods: from
which he inferrs, <hi>that if the major Part was good, there was no
Ground for that Invective:</hi> Yet any that reads that Passage will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find much of <hi>Invective</hi> in it, and it's far short of what might have
been cited from <hi>Nazianzen</hi> and <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> whose Credit he would
be sure to magnify, if it made for him. The running backward
and forward as they did, in the fundamental Points of Faith, will
justify a far severer Character than I give of them: and may not a
Church be corrupted, tho the Majority continues sound? Nor can
we judge of the Majority of a Church, by the Majority of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
for all Bishops did not come to every Synod. And I may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
add, that many will be guilty of ill Practices, that have not
the Face to defend them, when they come to be examined.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:47930:10"/>
Page 33, He accuses me for calling <hi>Constantius</hi> a superstitious
weak Man, upon the Credit of <hi>Marcellin</hi> a Pagan Writer. How judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
a Writer he is, all learned Men know: and that Passage, I refer
to, has been cited by many of the greatest Men of this and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Age. Nor was it quoted by me as a Proof, but as an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Saying. The Law <hi>Constantius</hi> made for Churchmen, by which
the driving of Trade and Merchandize among Clergy-men was set
on, and encouraged, was severely censur'd by St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> one of
the best Men of that Age, who saw the ill Effects it had. But he
says, I represent <hi>Martel</hi> as a brave Man, who robbed the Church.
Do I say any Thing in Commendation of him for his Vertues? I
only speak of his good Conduct and great Success in his Wars; and
if this raises his Spleen, I must conclude that he is very much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Vapours.</p>
            <p>He, in the next Place, accuses me for representing <hi>Pulcheria</hi> as
superstitious; and cites two Authors that say, she was a prudent and
pious Woman, but in this he shews no great Judgment of Church-Historians.
The first is <hi>Zonaras,</hi> that lived almost seven Ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her Time, so that he might have cited <hi>Baronius,</hi> or the VVri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of this Age, as well as one that lived so long after her. And
for <hi>Socrates,</hi> he does not bring his History down to her Reign nor
can I find a VVord of her in him; tho in this I cannot be positive,
having only cursorily run over his last Book. If he had quoted Book
and Chapter, I could have sought it out, but the naming the Page,
without he had also named the Edition, helps me little: yet I do
not deny that she was a very pious and prudent VVoman, nor do
I call her <hi>superstitious;</hi> but say that she was, even to <hi>Superstition,</hi> set
on raising the Authority and Greatness of the Church: which is a
far milder Expression than that he fastens on me.</p>
            <p>Page 54 He accuses me for thinking that the Strength of our
Separatists lies in the ill Lives of the Clergy: But in what does he
think their Strength lies? Is it in their Cause, or their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
I am sure if I had said this, he would have charged it home
upon me, and with Reason. But after all I only say the chief Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that the <hi>Donatists</hi> then took, were from the Corruptions of the
Clergy: and this he must either know to be true, or he is a great
Stranger to all St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s VVritings against them: and that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
I conclude with this general Expression: <hi>That in those Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
with which the Vulgar are possest, from the Disorders which they
observe in the Persons and Conduct of Church-men, lies the Strength of all
Dividers from the publick Constitutions:</hi> which I set down as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47930:11"/>
Maxime, without applying it to our Separatists.</p>
            <p>Page 59, To shew his great exactness in Chronology, he says,
that before the fourth Council at <hi>Carthage</hi> the African Churches had
been lately oppressed by the <hi>Vandals;</hi> but <hi>Baronius</hi> and the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the Councils, place this Anno 398, and the first mention of
the <hi>Vandals</hi> invading <hi>Gaul</hi> is Anno 406. Nor did they invade <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi>
till the Year 427, 28 Years after this Council. The other
Parts of this Remark are not worth the answering.</p>
            <p>Page 120 He says I boast of an odd Discovery of the VVeakness
or Disingenuity of the Bishops, in making two contrary Decrees
in one Day: but adds, that if we compare <hi>de Marca</hi> with <hi>Baluzius,</hi>
both these make good Sense in one Law, and have no Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in them. <hi>Baluzius</hi> speaks not a VVord of the Canon, and
only sets down the Edict: nor does <hi>de Marca</hi> offer to reconcile
them, but only says that the Bishops made the Canon according to
the Ecclesiastical Rules; and that in the Assembly of the States
they would not strugle against the King's Inclinations. But if the
<hi>Annulling of Ordinations made by Authority, without the regular Way
of Election,</hi> which is in the Canon, be not plainly contradicted by
the <hi>Proviso</hi> that is in the Edict, <hi>for excepting from this Rule those
that were chosen out of the Palace,</hi> I must learn again the Use of the
Parts of Speech.</p>
            <p>Pag. 141 He accuses me of speaking, without any just Ground,
contemptibly of the divine Right of Tithes, and for calling Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for it <hi>irksom Stuff:</hi> and all this is, because I speak slightly of
those who run it up to <hi>Adam,</hi> and say that <hi>Abel</hi> was a true Tither,
and <hi>Cain</hi> a false one; of this I shall say nothing, but refer it to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
good Judge. He also complains that I with Satisfaction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
(Page 196, and 200) that all was thought well gotten by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that could be got from the Clergy; tho I express no Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
at that, but on the contrary great Regret at the Scandals of
Church-men, which made Princes and others lose that esteem that
former Ages had for them.</p>
            <p>Page 166 He accuses me, that here and in many other Places I
industriously search for those Canons, that may reflect most on the
present Bishops and Clergy, and omit many that were more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to the <hi>Regale:</hi> when he discovers these Omissions I shall be
beholden to him, but till then, I must look on these as so many
angry VVords; nor are any of the Bishops that I know concerned in
those he refers to.</p>
            <p>But his Displeasure against me rises higher in the seventh Head,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47930:11"/>
in which he represents me as a Criminal against the State; and the
Care that was taken to convey these Animadversions by the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-Post
to a great Minister, who is known to have much Goodness
for me, shews well on what design this was writ.</p>
            <p>Page 97 He says I enlarge the Words of <hi>Gregoras,</hi> but wisely adds, if
his Edition is right; so he is safe till I know his Edition: but let
the Reader take them in Greek, and then see what can be objected
to my Translation: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Page 199 He accuses me for saying that Princes do commonly
assert a Right for any Thing which their Ancestors have once pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised;
and to this he answers that of late Parliaments in <hi>England</hi>
have done this oftner than Kings. But what am I concerned in
this? I did not blame Princes for Building upon Prescription, but
was only historically shewing, that the Practice of the Regale was
confest to be an Abuse at first, but after a whiles Continuance, it
was claimed as a Right.</p>
            <p>Page 244 He shews first great Unacquaintedness with French Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
in calling the <hi>Court of Parliament at</hi> Paris <hi>the Parliament of</hi>
France: And when <hi>Francis the first</hi> had delivered up the best part of
the Liberties of the French Church to the Pope; he insinuates as if it
were Sedition in me to reflect on the Arbitrariness of that King,
and the ill Effects of that Temper: nor do I know what relation
this has to late Proceedings, except he will presume to fasten the
Imputations of Arbitrariness upon his Majesty. But as it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to be a Mark of good Times under the Romans, when Men
might safely speak against the Tyranny of former Princes; so his
Majestie's mild and gracious Inclinations are so well known, and
his Resolution to govern according to Law hath been so often and
so lately declared, that I am not at all afraid of incurring his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
by speaking against <hi>Arbitrariness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Page 250, 251 He mentions a large Encomium I give of stiff
Parliaments, which he says he needs not transcribe, nor tell what
it aims at: nor need I tell what he aims at in this. But it seems he
cannot tell what I aim at; for he Mistakes the Thing, and does
not rightly distinguish between their Courts of Parliament in <hi>France,</hi>
which answer to our Judges; and their Assembly of States, which
answers to our Parliaments. The Ground of that Contest was,
Whether they should deliver up their Liberties to the See of <hi>Rome?</hi>
and if he condemns me for commending the Firmness of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47930:12"/>
Judges in this Point, it's plain enough what he aims at,</p>
            <p>And for a parting Blow he concludes, that the whole Discourse
is so very partial for Popular Elections, and strains all Places to
make it seem they had more Right than indeed they ever had, that
it seems writ to court the Favour of the People. But if he would
temper his Acrimony a little, he would see that I have overthrown
the Argument for popular Elections much more effectually, than
if I had entered into a long VVrangling about Matter of Fact. I shew
that they began not upon any divine Right, but upon the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in which the Church was during the first three Centuries:
And that as soon as the Government became Christian, the Town-Councils
and Possessors of Lands took it out of the Hands of the
Rabble; which had not been observed by any that writ before me,
that I could fall on: so that I think I have effectually overthrown
any Argument that can be drawn from the Practices of that Time.
One thing I must observe that on which Side soever I may seem to
write, I must fall under his Displeasure; for when I assert a Prince's
Prerogative of extending the Regale to all the Churches of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
he tells me of the Danger of a Popish Successour: and if I
acknowledg Matter of Fact as to popular Elections, he says I write
for the People. I see I am irrecoverably lost with him; but a Man
must bear his Misfortunes with a patient and constant Mind.</p>
            <p>The eighth Head is of divers Errours in Chronology, which he
is pleased to suppress: tho it appears by his Inquiries into the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the <hi>Vandals</hi> that he has a peculiar Talent in that. Some
Men always love to be tossing great Names, and therefore he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
frighting me with the Authority of Dr. <hi>Beveridg,</hi> whom, for his
great Learning and rare Worth, I esteem as much as any Man I
know: and he, to his other excellent Qualities, adds so generous
and worthy a Disposition of Mind, that he is not at all offended with
those, who cannot in every Point agree with him. Therefore as
long as I use that Liberty to which all that converse in Books have
a Right, of following what I think best grounded, notwithstanding
the learned Performances of worthy and great Men, I am not at
all afraid of incurring his Displeasure.</p>
            <p>His last Exception falls on the Compositors and Correctors, and
therefore I am little concerned in it.</p>
            <p>When he had thus performed this Piece of Discipline upon me,
in which if I have escaped without any harm done me, I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
else than him to thank for it; he dresses up a new Scene that he
may fall on me again; and as if all that had been said, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47930:12"/>
he begins anew. He leaves it to his Friend to communicate
it to me or not, when between them it was resolved to send it to
the Press. Then he makes his Conjectures about my Temper, and
says, <hi>Perhaps I will despise it, and study Revenge for this modest Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</hi>
I confess I cannot admire it, but I heartily pity him for
writing it, and do earnestly pray to God to inspire him and all
Church men with a better Temper: and this is all the Revenge I
shall return on him. But sure he has a peculiar Dictionary of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Words for himself, when he calls this a <hi>modest Admonition.</hi>
Yet, whatever he thinks of me, it's very evident from what follows,
that he thinks well of himself. But to drop some Crumbs of
Comfort, as a little Oil after a severe Whipping, he saies he is
loth to believe that I should directly design Mischief to the Church,
and is willing enough to believe that this Piece was writ in haste;
and then he tells me on what Terms he may be confirmed in this
favourable Opinion: yet, lest this Tenderness should make me too
wanton, he adds, that if this <hi>modest Admonition</hi> does not work on
me, I must expect a rougher Hand. But to this I gave my Answer
in the Beginning of this Paper.</p>
            <p>As for the Books that he enjoyns me to read, if this is all the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
he will lay on me, I hope I may recover his Favour. I have
read and do much admire Dr. <hi>Beveridg</hi> his Vindication of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Canons, and am fully convinced by him, that there was
an Ecclesiastical <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Canon</hi> received in the Church before these
Councils that met in the Beginning of the fourth Century. But if I
am not yet persuaded that that was put in Writing, and in the
same Form in which we now have it, and instead thereof think it
consisted rather in a Tradition, and constant Practice, I hope that
excellent Person will be more favourable to me, than to think the
worse of me for it.</p>
            <p>He next directs me to some Authors that have writ of the Right
of Tithes: but I wonder he did not name Dr. <hi>Comber</hi> his late cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Book on that Argument, for whose Person and Writings I
believe he has a singular Affection and Esteem; yet I can assure him
that tho that Book came into the World too late for instructing me
before I writ concerning the Regale, yet I have read it perhaps with
as much <hi>Care,</hi> and more <hi>impartiality</hi> than he used in reading mine;
and do look on it as a very learned Work: and hope that worthy
Doctor will not make War with me, if I cannot be in all Things
of his mind. I think I have now said enough to satisfy all disinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essed
Persons, and even the Animadvetrer or the Publisher them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47930:13"/>
that there was no just Cause given by any Thing in my
Book, for such severe Censures as he fastens on me; and I hope
he is freed from the Apprehensions he seemed to be under, lest
Papists and others should take Advantage from any Faults in this
Book to weaken the Credit of my other <hi>Pieces:</hi> which honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Compellation is bestowed on some Volums in Folio, that
have had the Luck not to be ill-received in the World. But I
hope the Credit not only of those <hi>Pieces,</hi> but even of my <hi>Piece</hi> of
the Regale, shall not suffer much by the Performance of this <hi>Piece</hi>
of his Animadversions.</p>
            <p>So much I have thought fit to say in my own Vindication. I
hope all along I have not forgot the Caution that was given me, of
tempering my stile so, that nothing of resentment should appear
in it: If any Thing has escaped me, that savours of it, it has fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
from me unawares; and I humbly beg Pardon for it of the
Person concerned.</p>
