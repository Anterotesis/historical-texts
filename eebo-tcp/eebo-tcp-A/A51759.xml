            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Here beginneth a short Treatise of Sir <hi>John Mandevile,</hi> Knight (who was born in <hi>England,</hi> in the Town of Saint <hi>Albans</hi>) that speaketh of the Ways to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> to <hi>Inde,</hi> and to the great <hi>Caan,</hi> and <hi>Prestor John's</hi> Land, and to many other Countries, and also of many marvels that are in the Holy Land.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>FOrasmuch as the Land beyond the Sea, that is, the Holy Land, which some call the Land of Behest, or Promise, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all other Lands is most worthy. In that Land it pleased our Lord to take flesh and blood of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and to traverse that Land, with his own feet, and there he did many Miracles, Preach and Teach the Faith, and the Law of Christian men, as unto his Children, and there did suffer many reproofs and scorns for us: and he that was King of Heaven and Earth, and of all things that are contained in them, would only be called King of that Land, when he said, <hi>I am King of the Jews:</hi> For at that time it was the Land of the <hi>Jews:</hi> and that Land he chose before all other Lands, as the most worthy part of all the World. And as the Philosopher saith, <hi>Virtus rerum in medio consistet</hi>; that is, the vertue of things is in the midst. In that Land he led his life, and suffered death of the <hi>Jews</hi> for us, to save and deliver us from the pains of Hell, and from death without end, the which was ordained to us for the sin of our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> and our own sins also. For he that will do any thing, to have it known openly, will proclaim it in the middle place of a Town or City, so that it may be known to all parties of the City: So he that was King of Glory, and of all the World, would suffer death for us at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> which is the midst of the World; that it might be known to all Nations of the World how dear he bought man. Ah dear God! what love had He to his Subjects, that when he had done no trespass, would for his Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passors suffer death? Right well ought men to love, worship, and serve such a Lord, and praise such an Holy Land that brought forth a Lord of such Fruit, through the which each man is saved if it be not his own fault. This is that Land prepared for in Heritage to us: and in that Land would he die as <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>fed, to leave it to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. For the which each good Christian man that may and hath
<pb facs="tcp:56519:4"/>
wherewith, should strengthen him for to conquer his right Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and purchase it out of evil peoples hands; for we are called Christian men of Christ our Father, and if we be the right Children of Christ, we ought to challenge the Heritage that our Father left us, and take it out of strange mens hands. But now Pride, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, and Envy, have so enflamed the hearts of the Lords of the World, that they are more busie to disinherit their Neighbours, than to challenge or conquer their right Heritage aforesaid. And the common people that would put their bodies for to conquer this Heritage, they may not do it without Lords: for assembling of the people without a chief Lord, is as a Flock of Sheep without a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, the which depart asunder, and wot not whether they do go. But would God the worldly Lords were at a good accord, and with other of their common people would take this Holy Voyage over Sea, I trust well, that within a little time our right Heritage beforesaid would be recovered and put into the hands of the right Heirs of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Now forasmuch as it is a long time since there was any general Passage thither, and that many men desire to hear the description of the Holy Land, I will declare it.</p>
            <p>I, <hi>John Mandevile,</hi> Knight, who was born in <hi>England</hi> in the Town of <hi>St. Albanes,</hi> passed the Sea in the year One thousand three hundred thirty two on Saint <hi>Michaels</hi> day; and there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long time, and went through many Lands, and many Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Kingdoms, and Isles, and have passed through <hi>Turkie,</hi> and through <hi>Armony</hi> the Little and Great, through <hi>Tartary, Sury, Araby, Egypt</hi> the High and the Low, through <hi>Liby, Chalde,</hi> and a great part of <hi>AEthiope,</hi> through <hi>Amazony,</hi> through <hi>Inde</hi> the Less and the More, and through many other Isles which are about <hi>Inde,</hi> where many people dwell of divers shapes. Of the men of which Lands and Isles, I shall speak plainly, and shall declare part of the the things I have seen.</p>
            <p>For them that will visit the holy City of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and the places that are thereabout, I will tell the right way that they shall hold thither; for I have ridden it, and passed it with good obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E that will travel to Hierusalem, may go many ways both by Sea and Land, after the Country that he cometh from. And think not, kind Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that I will tell all the Towns, Cities, and Castles that men shall pass by going, for then should I make too long a Tale, but only the most principal Countries, Cities, and Towns that men shall go by, and through, to go the right way.</p>
               <p>First, if a man come from the West side of the World, as <hi>England, Ierland, Wales, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> he may if he will go through <hi>Almain,</hi> and through the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which King is a mighty Lord, and holdeth many Lands and great: for he holdeth the Land of <hi>Hungary, Savoy, Camony,</hi> a great part of the Kingdom of <hi>Russia,</hi> and reacheth to the land of <hi>Millain,</hi> and marcheth on to <hi>Cyprus.</hi> And men must pass then through the land of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and through the City that men call <hi>Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numy,</hi> and neer the Castle of <hi>Nurburgh,</hi> and by the Isle <hi>Torne,</hi> and so by the River of <hi>Danubi,</hi> that is a great River, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into <hi>Almain</hi> under the Hills of <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> and it taketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it forty other Rivers, and runneth throughout <hi>Hungary,</hi> through <hi>Cresses</hi> and <hi>Crochie,</hi> and goeth into the Sea so strongly, and with so great might, that the water is fresh thirty miles
<pb facs="tcp:56519:3"/>
within the Sea. And afterwards men go to <hi>Belgrave,</hi> and enter into the Land of <hi>Bugres,</hi> and there men pass a Bridge of Stone that is over the River of <hi>Morack,</hi> and so pass the Land of <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seras,</hi> and come to <hi>Greece,</hi> to the City of <hi>Stermisse,</hi> and to the City of <hi>Affinpan,</hi> that was sometime called <hi>Bradre</hi> the Noble, and so to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that was sometime called <hi>Byzantium,</hi> and there the Emperor of <hi>Greece</hi> hath his Court. <figure/> At Constantinople is the fairest Church in the World, and it is called St. <hi>Stevens.</hi> And before this Church is a guilt Image of <hi>Justinian</hi> the Emperor, and it is sitting upon an Horse, and crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it was wont to hold a round Apple in his hand, and men say there, that it is a token that the Emperor hath lost a part of his Lands, for the Apple is fallen out of the Images hand, and sure he hath lost a great part of his Lordship; for he was once sole Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> and of all <hi>Asia</hi> the less, of <hi>Sury,</hi> and of the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> in the which <hi>Hierusalem</hi> is, and of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of <hi>Persy</hi> and <hi>Araby,</hi> but he hath lost all but <hi>Greece,</hi> and that he holdeth only. They would put the Apple into the Images hand, but it will not hold it. The other hand he lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up against the East, to menace misdoers. This Image stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon a Pillar of Marble.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56519:4"/>Likewise at Constantinople is the Cross of our Lord, and his Coat without seam, the Spunge and the Reed, with the which the Iews gave our Lord Gall to drink on the Cross; and there is one of the Nails that our Lord was nailed with to the Cross. Some men think that half the Cross of Christ is in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, in an Abbey of Monks, that men call the Hill of the holy Cross: but it is not so; for the Cross that is in Cypress is the Cross on the which <hi>Dismas</hi> the good Thief was hanged: but all men know not that; yet for the getting of the offering they say, that it is the Cross of our Lord. For ye shall understand, that the Cross of our Lord Iesus Christ was made of four manner of trees, as is apparent by the Verse following:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>In Cruce fit Palma, Cedrus, Cypressus, Oliva.</l>
               </q>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56519:5"/>For the piece that went up right from the Earth unto the head, was of Cypress, and the piece that went overthwart, to which his hands were nailed, were Palm; the stock that stood within the Earth, in which they made a Morteis, was of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, and the Table above his Head, on which the Title was written, was of Olive. The Iews made this Cross of these four Woods, for they thought our Lord should have hanged as long as the Cross would last, therefore made they the foot of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, for Cedar will not rot in the earth, nor in water: they thought that the body of Christ would have stunk; therefore they made the piece that went from the Earth upwards, of Cypress; so that the smell of his Body should grieve no man that came by: and that overtwart was made of Palm, in signification of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and the Table wherein the Title was, was made of Olive, for it betokened peace; as the Story of <hi>Noe</hi> witnesseth, when the Dove brought the Branch of Olive, it betokened peace made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man.</p>
               <p>And ye shall understand that the men that dwell beyond the Sea, say, that the piece of the Cross that was of Cypress, was of the Tree that <hi>Adam</hi> eat the apple of; for so they find writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; They say also, that their Scripture saith, that when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was sick he willed his Son <hi>Seth,</hi> that he should go to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, and pray the Angel that kept Paradice, that he would send him Oyl of the Tree of Mercy, for to annoint him, that he might have health; and <hi>Seth</hi> went, but the Angel would not let him come at the Gate, but said unto him, that he might not have of the Oyl of mercy, but he gave him thrée kernels of the same Trée that his Father eat the Apple of, and bad him as soon as his Father was dead, that he should put those ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels under his tongue, and bury him, and he did so: and of these three kernels sprang a tree; and the Angel said, when the trée bare fruit, then should <hi>Adam</hi> be made whole. And when <hi>Seth</hi> came again and found his
Father dead, he did with the kernels as the Angel commanded him; of which came three trees, whereof a Cross was made that bare good Fruit, that is, our Saviour Iesus Christ, through whom <hi>Adam,</hi> and all that came of him shall be delivered from everlasting death, if it be not their own default. This holy Cross had the Iews hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earth in the Rock of the Mount Calvary, and it lay
<pb facs="tcp:56519:5"/>
there two hundred years and more, as they say, unto the time that St. <hi>Elene</hi> found it; which St. <hi>Elene</hi> was the Daughter of <hi>Coel</hi> king of England, and then was called Brittain, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter married to <hi>Constantius</hi> first Consul, and after Emperour of Rome, who had by her, issue, <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, born in England, and afterward Emperour of Rome; which <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> turned the name of Bizantium into Constantinople: he reedified that City and made it the Monarchal Seat of all Europe and Asia minor. Also the Cross was in length eight cubits, and the piece that went overthwart was three cubits and a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> half.</p>
               <p>A part of the Crown wherewith our Lord was crowned, and one of the Nails, and the Spears head, and many other Reliques, are in France at Paris, in the king's Chappel; and the Crown lyeth in a Vessel of Chrystal richly decked: for the French king bought those Reliques sometime of the Iews, to whom the Emperors had laid them to pledge for a great sum of Gold. And though men say that this Crown was of Thornes, ye shall understand that it was of Iunks of the Sea, which be white, and prick as sharp as Thornes, for I have seen and beheld many times that at Paris, and that at <figure/> Constantinople, and they were both made of the Iunks of the Sea. And you shall understand that our Lord in that night that he was taken, he was led into a Garden, and there he was examined sharply, and there the Iews crowned him with a

Crown of Abbespine branches that grew in the same Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and set it on his Head so fast, that the blood ran down many places of his Visage, Neck, and Shoulders; and thereby the Abbespine hath many vertues; for he that beareth a branch of it about him, no Thunder nor no manner of Tempest may hurt him; nor in the house that it is in, may no evill spirit come, nor in no place where it is. And in that same Garden St. <hi>Peter</hi> denyed our Lord thrice. And afterwards was our Lord led before the Pharisées and Ministers of the Law, into another Garden of <hi>Annas,</hi> and there he was examined, scourged, and crowned oft with sharp Thorns, that men call Harbarenes, that grew in the same Garden, and that hath many vertues. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he was led to a Garden of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and there he was crowned again with Eglantine, and after that he was led to a chamber of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and there he was crowned, and the Iews set him in a chair, and clad him in a Mantle of Purple, and then
made they a Crown of the Iunkes of the Sea, and there they kneeled to him, and mocked him, saying: <hi>Ave Rex Judaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> that is, Hail king of the Iews; and of the Crown, half is at Paris, and the other half at Constantinople, the which our Saviour Christ had on his Head, when he was nailed on the cross. And the Spears shaft the Emperour of Almany hath; but the head which was put in his side is at Paris, they say, in the holy Chappel: Likewise, the Emperour of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople saith, that he hath the Spears head, and I have seen his, but it is greater than that at Paris. Also at Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople lyeth Saint <hi>Anne</hi> our Ladies Mother, whom Saint <hi>Elene</hi> caused to be brought from Ierusalem, and also the Body of Saint <hi>John Chrysostome,</hi> that was Bishop of Constantinople. There lyeth also St. <hi>Luke</hi> the Evangelist, for his bones were brought from Bethany, where he was bursed; and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reliques are there: and there is a Vessel of Stone, as it were Marble, which
men call Hydrius, that evermore drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth water, and filleth it self every year once. Ye shall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know that Constantinople is a fair City, and well walled, and is three cornered, and there is an Arm of the Sea that men call Hellespont, and some the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the Islands of Greece.</head>
               <p>ABout Greece are divers Isles that men call Calabre, Calcas, Settico, Thosoria, Minono, Farion, Molo, Carpate and Lampne: and in this Isle is Mount Athoes that passeth the Clouds. And there are divers speeches, and many Countries that are obedient to the Emperour of Constantinople; that is, Turco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, Pinrie, Narde, Comage, and many other: Thracie and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedony, of which <hi>Alexander</hi> was king. In this Country was <hi>Aristotle</hi> born, in a City that men call Strageris, a little from the City of Tragie; and at Strageris is <hi>Aristotle</hi> buried, and there is an Altar on his Tomb, where they make a great Feast every year, as it were a Saint. And upon this Altar the Lords hold their great Counsels and Assemblies; for they think that through the Inspiration of God and him, they have the better Counsel. In this Country are very high Hills: there is the Hill Olympus, that parteth Macedony and Thracia, whose height reacheth to the Clouds. There is also the Hill Athoes, which is so high that the shadow of it reacheth to Olympus, and it is near threescore and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventéen miles between. And above that Hill is an Air so <figure/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56519:7"/>
clear, that no wind can be felt, neither may any beast live there, the Air is so dry. Some of the Country say, that Philosophers were wont to go up to the top of those Hills, (holding to their Noses a Sponge wet with water, because of the driness of the Air) and in the dust of the Hill write letters with their fingers, which when they came again the next year, they found without any default, even as they had written them the year before; whereby it appeareth that those Hills pass the Clouds to the pure Air.</p>
               <p>At Constantinople is the Emperors Palace, which is fair and richly built, and therein is a place for Iusting made about with Stages, that every man may well see without hindring of one another. Vnder these Stages are vaulted Stables for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Horses, and all the Pillars are of Marble. Within the Church of St. <hi>Sophie,</hi> an Emperor would have laid the body of his Father when he was dead; and as they made the Grave, they found a Body in the Earth, and upon the Body lay a great Plate of fine Gold, and thereupon was written in Hebrew, Greek and Latin Letters, these words, <hi>Jesus Christus nascetur de Virgine Maria, &amp; ego credo in eum</hi>; that is, Iesus Christ shall be born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and I believe in him. And the date was, that it lay in the Earth two hundred years before our Lord Iesus Christ was born, and yet is that Plate in the Treasury of the Church; and it is thought that <hi>Hermogenes</hi> the wise man writ it.</p>
               <p>And although the men of that Country be Christians, yet nevertheless they vary from our Faith: for they say, that the holy Ghost procéedeth not from the Son, but from the Father only: neither are they obedient to the Church of Rome, nor to the Pope; but they say, that their Patriarchs have as much power there, as the Pope hath at Rome. And therefore Pope <hi>John</hi> the xxii. sent Letters to them, how that Christians should be all one, and that they should be obedient to the Pope; and among divers answers, they sent him this for one. <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam tuam summam circa subjectos tuos firmiter credimus. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbitatem tuam sustinere non possumus. Avaritiam tuam satiare non intendimus. Dominus tecum sit, quia Dominus nobiscum est. Vale.</hi> That is, We believe well, that thy
<pb facs="tcp:56519:7"/>
power is great over thy Subjects. We may not suffer thy pride. We are not purposed to fulfill thy covetousness. Our Lord be with thée, for our Lord is with us. Farewell. Other answer might he not have of them. And also they make their Sacrament of the Altar of tharf Bread, because our Lord made it of tharf Bread, when he made his Maundy: and on Shrove-thursday make they their Bread, in token of the Maundy, and they dry it in the Sun, and keep it all the year, and give it to sick men. And they make but one Vnction, when they Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten children, and they anoint no sick men; also they say there is no purgatory, and that souls shall have neither joy nor pain untill the day of Doom.</p>
               <p>And they say, that Fornication is no deadly sin, but a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, and that men and women should wed but once, and whoso weddeth more than once; their Children are Bastards, and gotten in sin; and their Priests also are Wedded: and they say, that Vsury or Simony is no deadly sin, and they sell Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices of the Church, and so do men of other places; but it is great pity, for now Simony reigneth in the holy Church; God amend it when his will is: and they say, that Lay-men should not sing Mass, but on the Saturday, and on the Sunday: and they fast on the Saturday no time in the year, unless it be Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mass or Easter-even. And they suffer no man that is on this side the Greek sea, to sing at their Altars; and if it fall out that one do, then they wash their Altar without tarrying, with holy water; and they say, that there should be but one Mass said at one Altar in a day. And they say, that our Lord did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver eat meat, but he made a shew of eating. And also they say, that we sin deadly in shaving off our Beards, for the Beard is a token of a man, and a gift of our Lord: and they say, that we sin in eating Beasts that were forbidden in the old Law, as Swine, Hares, and other Beasts.</p>
               <p>And this they say, that we sin in eating of Flesh on the day before Ashwednesday, and in eating of Flesh on the Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and when we eat Cheese or Eggs on the Friday: and they curse all those that eat no flesh on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Also the Emperour of Constantinople maketh the Patriarchs, Archbishops and Bishops, and he giveth all the Dignities of Churches, and depriveth them that are unworthy. Although
<pb facs="tcp:56519:8"/>
it be so, that these touch not any way, nevertheless they shall serve to shew a part of the Customs, Manners, and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of countries; and because this is the first Country discor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant from the Faith, and opposeth the Faith on this side the sea; therefore have I set it here, that ye may see the diversity between our Faith and theirs: for many men have great liking to hear Report of strange things.</p>

               <p>First, men come to the Isle of Silo, and in that Isle groweth Mastick, upon as small·Trees as Palm-trees or Cherry-trees. Thence men go through the Isle of Pathmos, where Saint <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist wrote the Apocalyps. You shall also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that when our Lord Iesus Christ dyed, St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist was of the age of thirty two years, and he lived
<pb facs="tcp:56519:8"/>
after the Passion of Christ forty thrée years, and then died. From <hi>Pathmos</hi> men go to <hi>Ephesim,</hi> which is a fair city and near to the sea, and there died St. <hi>John,</hi> and he was buried behind the Altar in a Tomb, and there is a fair Church: for Christians were wont to hold that place. But in the Tomb of Saint <hi>John</hi> is nothing but Manna, for his body was translated into Paradise: and the <hi>Turks</hi> hold now the City; and the Church, and all <hi>Asia</hi> the less; therefore is <hi>Asia</hi> the less called <hi>Turky:</hi> and you shall understand that Saint <hi>John</hi> did make his Grave there in his life, and laid himself there being alive; and therefore some say he died not, but that he resteth there untill the day of Iudgment: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truly there is a great marvel, for men may sée there appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently the Earth of the Tomb many times stir and move, as if there were a quick thing under.

And it is not long since a Knight of the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> that was hardy and valiant, said that he would kiss her, and when the Dragon began to lift up her head against him, and he saw she was so hideous, he fled away, and the Dragon in her anger bare the Knight to a Rock, and from thence cast him into the Sea.</p>

               <figure/>
               <p>There was a young man that wift not of the Dragon; he went out of a ship, and passed through the Isle till he came to the Castle, and entred into a Cave, and went so long till he found a Chamber, and then he saw a Damsel combing her Head, and looking in a glass, and she had much Treasure about her, and he thought her to be a common Woman that dwelled there to Lodge men; and as he stood by the Damsel, the Damsel saw the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of him in the glass, and she turned towards him, and asked him what he would? and he said, He would be her Paramour or Lemman: and she asked him, if he were a Knight? and he said, No: and she said, then he might not be her Lemman; but she bade him go again to his Fellows, and be made a Knight, and come again on the morrow, and she would come out of the Cave, and then he should kiss her mouth: and she bade him have no bread, for she would do him no harm, although shée seemed hideous to him: she said, It was done by enchantment; for she said, She was not such as he saw her then. Moreover she said, That if he kissed her, he should have all the Treasure, and be her Lord, and Lord of all those Isles. Then departed he from her, and went to his Fellows to the ship, and they made him Knight, and he came again on the morrow to kiss the Damsel: but when he saw her come out of the Cave in form of a Dragon, he had so great dread that he flew to the ship, and she followed him; and when she saw that he returned not again, she began to cry, as one that had
<pb facs="tcp:56519:9"/>
much sorrow, and returned again, and soon after the Knight died: and since might no Knight sée her but he died presently. But when a Knight cometh that is so hardy as to kiss, he shall not die, but he shall turn that Damsel into her right shape, and shall be Lord of the Country aforesaid.</p>
               <p>From thence men go to the Isle of Rhodes; which Isle the Hospitallers held and governed, and that they took before time from the Emperor, and it was wont to be called Colsos, and yet the Turks call it Collos: And saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle writeth to them of the Isle Collossenses. This Isle is near one hundred and fourscore miles from Constantinople. And from the Isle of Rhodes men go into Cypress; where are many Vines, that first are red, and after a year they wax all white; and those Vines that are most white, are most pleasant: and as men pass that way, is a place where was wont to be a great City that was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Salathy; for all that country was lost through the folly of a young man, who had a fair Damsel whom he loved well, and she died suddenly, and was buried in a Tomb of Marble; and for the great love he had to her, he went in a night to her Tomb, and opened it, and went and lay by her; and a while afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home again; and when it came to the end of nine moneths, a Voice came to him and said in this manner, as in the next Chapter followeth.</p>

From <hi>Rhodes</hi> to <hi>Cypress</hi> is five hundred miles and more; but men may go to <hi>Cypress</hi> and not come to <hi>Rhodes, Cypress</hi> is a good Isle, and a great, and there are many good cities.

In <hi>Cypress</hi> the custom is, that Lords and other men eat upon the Earth, for they make Ditches within the earth, all about the Hall, deep to the knée, and they Pave them; and when they will eat, they go thereinto, and sit there. This they do to be more fresh; for that Land is hotter than it is here. But at great feasts and for Strangers, they set Forms and Boards as they do in this country, yet they had rather sit on the Earth. From <hi>Cypress</hi> men may go by land or by sea to Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem; and in a day and a night he that hath a good wind may come to the haven of Tyre, that now is called Sur, for it is at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Sury.

                  <hi>Jerusalem</hi>: and he shall go from <hi>Gaza</hi> to the Castle <hi>Dayre.</hi> And after a man cometh out of <hi>Sury,</hi> and goeth on, the way is very sandy, and the Wilderness lasteth eight days journey, wherefore men must provide them of necessary victuals: and that Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is called <hi>Archellek</hi>: When a man cometh out of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart, he entreth into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and they call <hi>Eygpt Canopat,</hi> and in another Language men call it <hi>Mersine</hi>: and the first good Town that men come to, is called <hi>Beleth,</hi> which is at the end of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Alap,</hi> and from thence men come to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to <hi>Kayre</hi>: and in <hi>Kayre</hi> is a fair Church of our Lady, where she dwelt seven years, when she was out of the Land of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for dread of King <hi>Herod.</hi> And there lyeth the body of Saint <hi>Babara</hi> Virgin; and there dwelt <hi>Joseph</hi> when he was sold of his Brethren. And in <hi>Babylon Nebuchodonosor</hi> put the Children into the Fire, because they worshipped the true God: these Children were called <hi>Anani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Azarias</hi> and <hi>Misael</hi> (as the Psalm of <hi>Benedicite</hi> saith) but <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chodonosor</hi> called them thus, <hi>Sadrak, Misak,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> that is, God glorious and victorious, God over all Kingdoms, and that was for Miracle, that he made God's Son, as he said, go with those Children through the Fire. There dwelleth the Soldan, for there is a fair City and a strong Castle which standeth upon a Rock. In that Castle are always dwelling to keep the Castle, and to serve the Soldan above eight thousand persons, that take all their provision at the Soldans Court. This I well know, for I dwelt with him a great while a Soldier in the Wars against the <hi>Bedians</hi> or <hi>Arabins,</hi> and he would have marryed me unto a great Princess If I would have forsaken my Faith.</p>

This Town of <hi>Bersheba</hi> was founded by <hi>Vrias,</hi> on whose Wife <hi>David</hi> begat <hi>Solomon</hi> the wise, that was King of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and of the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> and he reigned forty years: and from thence men go to the Vale of <hi>Ebron,</hi> that is from thence near twelve miles, and some call it the Vale of <hi>Mambre,</hi> and it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Vale of <hi>Tears,</hi> forasmuch as <hi>Adam</hi> in that Vale bewailed an hundred years the Death of his Son <hi>Abel,</hi> whom <hi>Cain</hi> slew. And this <hi>Ebron</hi> was sometime the principal City of the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims,</hi> and there dwelt Byants, and it was frée, so that all that had done evil in other places were there saved. In <hi>Ebron Joshua</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56519:14"/>
and <hi>Caleb,</hi> and their Company came first to espy how they might win the Land of Promise. In <hi>Ebron David</hi> reigned first seven years and a half: and in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> he reigned two and thirty years and a half: and there be the Graves of the Patriarchs <hi>Adam, Abraham Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and of their Wives, <hi>Eve, Sara, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekah,</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi>: and they Ise in the side of the Hill. And beside this Hill is a right fair Church builded after the fashion and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Castle, which the <hi>Sarasins</hi> kéep right well, and they have the place in great Worship for the Holy Patriarchs sake that lie there, neither do they suffer either Christians or Iews to come therein except they have special leave of the Soldan, for they hold Christians and Iews but as Heunds, therefore they come not to that Holy Place, and they call the place <hi>Spelunk</hi> or <hi>Double Cave,</hi> or <hi>Double Grave,</hi> or one lyeth upon another.

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. Of a fair Maiden that should be put to death wrongfully.</head>
               <p>THE cause is, forasmuch as a fair Maiden, that was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed wrongfully, for that she had done Fornication, for which cause she was doomed to die, and to be burnt in that place, to which she was led. And as the wood began to burn about her, she made her prayer to our Lord, as she was not guilty of that thing, that he would help her, that it might be
<pb facs="tcp:56519:16"/>
known to all men. And having thus prayed, she entred the Fire, and those Branches that were burning became red Roses, and those that were not kindled became white Roses, and these were the first Roses that any man ever saw: and so was the Maiden saved through the Grace of God, wherefore that field is called the Field that God flourished, for that it was full of Roses. Near the Quire of the Church aforesaid, at the right side as men come downward, twelve steps, is the place where our Lord was born, which is now buil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> with Marble, and trimmed with Gold, Azure, and other Colours. A little thence, about their paces, is the Crib of the Ex or the Ass, and near that is the place where the Star fell that led the thrée Kings, <hi>Jaspar, Melchior,</hi> and <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi>: these thrée Kings offered to our Lord Incense, Gold, and Myrrhe, and they met together through the miracle of God in a City called <hi>Casake,</hi> which is thrée and thirty days journey from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> yet were they at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> the fourth day after they had séen the Star. Vnder the Cloyster of this Church eightéen degrées, at the right side is a great Pit where the bones of the Innocents lie, and by that place is the Tomb of Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> who translated the Bible and the Psalter out of <hi>Hebrew</hi> into <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi> And near unto that Church is the Church of Saint <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> where our Lady rested her, when she was delivered of Child: and forasmuch as she had so much milk in her breasts that pained her, she drew it out upon the red Stones or Marble, and people say, that yet may the traces be seen white upon the Stones. Ye shall understand also, that they that dwell in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and there are fair Vines all about the City, and great plenty of wine: but their Book that <hi>Mahomet</hi> gave them, which they call <hi>Alkaron,</hi> and some call it <hi>Massap,</hi> and some call it <hi>Harme,</hi> forbiddeth them to drink any wine: for in that Book <hi>Mahomet</hi> curseth all that drink of that wine, and all that sell it. And some men say that once he slew in his drunkenness a good Hermit whom he much loved, and therefore he curseth the wine, and them that drink wine, but his malice is turned to himself, as holy writ saith: <hi>Et in verticem ipsius iniquitas ejus descendit</hi>: that is, His wickedness shall descend on his own head. The Sarasins also eat neither Géese nor Swines flesh; for they say, it is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a man, and was forbidden in the Old Law. Likewise in the Land of Palestine, and in Egypt they eat little Veal or Béef,
<pb facs="tcp:56519:16"/>
except it be so old that it may no more travel or work: not because it is forbidden, but they keep them for tilling their Land.</p>
               <p>In this city of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was King <hi>David</hi> born: he was King of the Land of the Iews, and reigned in <hi>Herusalem,</hi> and had forty Wives, and thrée hundred Concubines. And at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South side, is a Church of Saint <hi>Markoret,</hi> that was Abbot there, for whom they had much sorrow when he died: and it was shewed there how he made lamentation when he died: and it is a pitious thing to behold. From <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> is two miles: and in the way to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> half a mile from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> is the Church where the Angel told the Shepheards of the Birth of Christ. In that way is the Tomb of <hi>Rachel</hi> that was Mother to <hi>Joseph</hi> the Patriarch, who died as soon as <hi>Benjamin</hi> was born, and there she was buried, and <hi>Jacob</hi> her Husband set twelve great stones upon her.

               <p>AND ye shall understand that when men first come to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> they go first on Pilgrimage to the Church where the holy Grave is, the which was out of the City on the North side, but it is now closed in with the wall of the Town. And there is a fair Church,<figure/> round, all flat above, and well covered with Lead: and on the West side is a fair and strong tower for Bells: and in the midst of the Church is a Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, made like a little House, in manner of a half Compass, very richly trimmed with Gold, Azure, and other colours. In the right side is the Sepulchre of our Lord Christ: and the Tabernacle is eight foot long, five foot wide, and eleven foot high. And it is not long since the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre was all open, so that any man might then touch it: but because the folks that came thither, spoiled and brake the stones all in pieces, therefore hath the Soldan
<pb facs="tcp:56519:17"/>
made a Wall about the Sepulchre, that no man may touch it. In the left side is a window, wherein are many Lamps lighted; and there hangeth a Lamp burning before the Sepulchre, which they say on Good Friday goeth out by it self, and lighteth again by it self at the hour that our Lord rose from death to life. And within that Church upon the right side of Mount Calvary, where our Lord was Crucified, the Cross was set in a Morteis in the Rock, that is white of colour, and mingled with a little red; and upon that Rock, dropped the blood of the wounds of our Lord, when he was nailed on the Cross, and that is called <hi>Golgatha</hi>; and men go up to that <hi>Golgatha</hi> upon steps: and in that Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teis was Adams Head found after <hi>Noahs</hi> Flood; in token that the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> should be redéemed in the same place: and upon that Rock <hi>Abraham</hi> offered sacrifice to our Lord; and there is an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and before that Altar lyeth <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bouloign, Baldwin,</hi> and others that were Christians, and Kings of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise where our Lord was crucified it is written, <hi>Hic De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Rex noster, ante saecula operatus est salutem in medio terrae,</hi> that is, This God our King, before Worlds, hath wrought health in the midst of the Church. Vpon this Rock also where the Cross was fixed, is written within the Rock, <hi>Quod vides est fundamenta totius mundi, &amp; hujus fidei</hi>; that is, That theu séest is the ground of all the World, and of this Faith. Ye shall understand also, that when our Lord died he was two and thirty years old, and thrée Months, yet the prophesie of <hi>David</hi> saith that he should live forty years, when he saith thus, <hi>Quadraginta annis proximis sui generationi huic,</hi> that is, Forty years was I neighbour to this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: and thus it should seem that Prophesie is not true, but it is. For in old time men counted but ten Moneths to a year, of which <hi>March</hi> was the first, and <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>mber</hi> the last: but <hi>Gaius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> that was Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> added to these, two Months more, <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> and ordained the year of twelve Months, that is, thrée hundred sixty five days without Leap-year, the proper course of the Sun, and therefore after the accounting of ten Moneths to the Year, he died in the fortieth year, and after our years of twelve Moneths it is thirty two years and thrée Months.</p>
               <p>Also within Mount Calvary at the right side, there is an Altar where the Pillar lyeth that our Lord was bound to when he was
<pb facs="tcp:56519:18"/>
scourged and thereby are thrée other Pillars that always drop water;<figure/> and some say, that those Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars wéep for our Lords Death. And near this Altar in a place forty steps déep was found the very Cross, by the knowledge of St. <hi>Elene,</hi> under a Rock, where the Iews had hid it. And they found thrée Crosses, one of our Lord, and two of the Théeves. These Crosses St. <hi>Elene</hi> tryed upon a dead Body, that did rise as soon as the very Cross of our Lord was laid upon him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is the Vale of the place where the four Nailes of our Lord were hid, for he had two in his hands, and two in his féet; and with one of those Nailes the Emperour of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople did make a Bridle for his Horse to bear him in Fattel, by the vertue whereof he overcame his Enemies, and won all the Land of Asia, Turkey, Damasse the more and the less, Sury, Hierusalem, Arabia, Persia, and Mesopotamia, the Kingdoms of Asape, Egypt the high and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

And these words he said when he hanged upon the Cross. And upon these steps went our Lord when he bare the Cross upon his Shoulder; and under these stayers is a Chappel where the Priests sing. And near there is the stone where our Lord rested him when he was weary with bearing of the Cross. And ye shall understand that before the Church of the Sepulchre is a most strong city; and the great plain that is betwéen the city and the Church on the East side without the Walls of the city, is the Vale of <hi>Josaphat,</hi> that cometh even to the Walls.</p>
               <p>In this Vale of <hi>Josaphat,</hi> without the city is the Church of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> where he was stoned to death, and thereby is a gate buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that may not be opened. Through this gate our Lord entred on <hi>Palm Sunday</hi> upon an Ass, and the gate opened unto him, when he would go to the Temple: and in full hard stones there are three steps like the steps of an Ass, which the people say, are the steps of the Ass that our Lord did ride on. Before the Church of the Sepulchre, two hundred paces, is a great Hospital of St. <hi>John,</hi> in the which Hospital are fifty four Pillars made of Stone. And to go toward the East from the Hospital, is a right fair Church, that men call our Lady the Great; and then is there

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. Yet of the Temple of God.</head>
               <p>AND ye shall understand that this is not the Temple that <hi>Solomon</hi> made, for that Temple lasted but one thousand one hundred and two years. For <hi>Titus, Vespasian</hi> his Son, that was Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> laid siege against Hierusalem, for to discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the Jews, because they had put Christ to death without leave of the Emperour. When he had taken the City, he burnt the Temple, and cast it down, and took all the Iews, and put to death eleven hundred thousand, and the rest he imprisoned and sold thirty for a penny: for he said that they bought Iesus Christ for thirty pence. And since <hi>Julian Aposlata</hi> gave leave to the Iews to build the Temple of Hierusalem again, but he forsook his Law. And when the Iews had builded again the Temple, then came the Earthquake (as God would) and cast down all that they had made. Since that, <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, who was of <hi>Troy,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56519:20"/>
made <hi>Hierusalem</hi> again, and the Temple in that same manner that <hi>Solomon</hi> made it, and commanded that no Iew should dwell there, but Christians; for although he himself was not a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, yet he loved the Christians more than other men, save men of his own faith. This Emperour did also enclose and wall the Church of the holy Sepulchre within the City, that before was far without the City, and he would have changed the name of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and called it <hi>Helam</hi>; but that name lasted not long. And ye shall understand that the <hi>Sarasins</hi> do worship in that Temple; and they say, that place is holy; and when they go in, They go barefoot; and before I and my Fellows came herein, we put off our Harness, and came barefoot into the Temple; and thought that we ought to do as much or more than they that were Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. And this Temple is thréescore and thrée cubits in wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and as much in length, and thirty two cubits in height, and covered with lead, and it is within full of Pillars of Marble. And in the middest of the Temple is an Altar of twenty and four steps of height. This place the <hi>Jews</hi> called <hi>Sanctus Sanctorum</hi>; that is, Holy of Holyest: and in that place cometh none but their Prelate that maketh their Sacrifice; and the people sit all about in divers seats, as they are in dignity: and there be four Entrings into the Temple, and the doors are of Cypress; and within the East door our Lord said, Here is Ierusalem. And on the North side within the door is a Fountain, and it runneth out: of the which holy Writ speaketh, and saith, <hi>Vidiaquam egredientem de Templo</hi>; I saw water coming out of the Temple. And upon the other side is a Rock that men called sometime <hi>Moryach,</hi> (but after it'was called <hi>Belet</hi>) and there is the Ark of God, with some Reliques of the Iews. This Ark did <hi>Titus</hi> carry with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> when he had discomfitted the Iews.</p>
               <p>In that same Ark were the Ten Commandments, and <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, and <hi>Moses</hi> Rod, with which he parted the Red sea, when the people of Israel passed through on dry foot: and there was the Vessel of Hanna, the Clothing and Ornaments, and the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and a square Table of Gold, with twelve precious Stones, and a Fox of Iasper graven with four fingers, and eight Names of our Lord within, and seven Candlesticks of Gold, and four Censors of Gold, and an Altar also of fine Gold, and four Lions of Gold, unto the which they had a Cherubim of Gold
<pb facs="tcp:56519:20"/>
twelve spans long, and a Tabernacle of Gold, and also twelve Trumpets of Silver, and a Table of Silver, and seven Earley Loaves, and many other Reliques that were before the Nativity of Christ.</p>
               <p>Vpon the Rock slept <hi>Jacob</hi> when he saw Angels go up, and said, <hi>Vere locus iste sanctus est, &amp; ego ignorabam</hi>; that is, Surely this place is holy, and I wist not. And there the Angel changed <hi>Jacobs</hi> Name, and called him <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that same place also <hi>David</hi> saw the Angel that slew the People with a Sword, and put it all bloody into the Sheath. And on this Reck was S. <hi>Simeon,</hi> when he received our Lord into the Temple, and on this Rock set he him when the Iews would have stoned him, and the Rock rent in two, and in that Cleft he hid him, and after came down and gave him Light.</p>
               <p>And on this Rock sat our Lady and learned her Psalter. There likewise our Lord forgave the sins of the woman that was taken and found in Adultery: And there was our Lord Iesus Circumcised, and there the Angel denounced to <hi>Zachary</hi> the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of S. <hi>John Baptist.</hi> And there first offered <hi>Melchisedech</hi> Bread and Wine and Water to our Lord, in token of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament that was to come: and there <hi>David</hi> prayed to our Lord for mercy for him, and for his people, when he saw the Angel slay his people, and our Lord anon heard his prayer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would have made the Temple in the place, but our Lord Iesus Christ forbade him by an Angel, for he had committed murther in consenting to the slaying of the good Knight <hi>Vriah,</hi> for to have his wife; therefore all that he had prepared for the building of the Temple he left to <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son, and he built it, and prayed to the Lord, that all those that prayed in that place deboutly, and with good heart, that he would hear their prayer, and grant that they servently asked; and the Lord granted it: wherefore <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son called it the Temple of Counsel, and help of God.</p>
               <p>Without the doors of that Temple is an Altar, where the Iews were wont to offer Doves and Turtles; and in that Temple was <hi>Zichary</hi> slain; and on the Pinacle the Iews set St. <hi>James</hi> that was the first Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> And a little from this Temple on the right side is a Church covered with
<pb facs="tcp:56519:21"/>
Lead, that is called the School of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Towards the South is the Temple of <hi>Salon,</hi> which is a great place, and they were the Founders thereof, and of their Order; and in that <hi>Templum Domini</hi> dwell Canons.</p>
               <p>From this Temple toward the East, six and twenty paces in a corner of the City, is the Path of our Lord: and this Path was wont to go to Paradise: and not far thence is our Ladies Bed, and near that is S. <hi>Simeons</hi> Tomb. Without the Cloyster of the Temple toward the North is a fair Church of St. <hi>Anne</hi> our Ladies Mother; and there was our Lady conceived; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Church is a great Trée, which began to grow that same night. And as men go down from that Church two and twenty steps, lyeth <hi>Joachim</hi> our Ladies Father, in a Tomb of stone; and there near was laid sometime St. <hi>Anne,</hi> but St. <hi>Elena</hi> did translate her to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> In this Church is a Well in manner of a Cistern, that is called <hi>Probatica piscina,</hi> that hath five Enterings, and into that Cistern an Angel was wont to descend and stir the water, and what man had bathed first therein, after the stirring, was made whole, what disease soever he had. There was the man of the Palsie made whole, who had béen sick eight and thirty years: and there beside was the House of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and a little from that the House of King <hi>Herod,</hi> who slew the Innocents.</p>

               <p>THis King <hi>Herod</hi> was a very wicked man, and a Tyrant: for he did first and formost slay his Wife, whom he loved full well; and for the great love of her he went out of his wits, and so was he a long time, and afterward he came again to himself, And after he slew his own Children that he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the said wife, and commanded likewise his second wife to be slain, and a son that he had begotten of her, and after that he slew his own Mother; and he would also have slain his own Brother, but his Brother dyed suddenly; and thus he did all the ill that he might. And then he fell sick, and when he
<pb facs="tcp:56519:21"/>
saw that he should die, he sent for his Sister and all the great Lords of the Country; and when they were there, he did put all the Lords into a Tower, and said to his Sister, he wist well that the men of the Country would make no sorrow for him when he was dead; and therefore he made her to swear unto him that she would smite off the Heads of the Lords every one after his death; and then would men of the Country make sorrow for his death, in regard of the Noble mens deaths: and then he made his last Testament. But his Sister fulfilled it not as pertaining unto the death of the Lords, for as soon as he was dead, she delivered the Lords out of the Tower, and sent every one home to their houses, and told them what her Brother commanded her to do unto them. And ye shall understand that in that time were thrée <hi>Herods</hi> of great name. This of whom I speak was called <hi>Herod Ascolonite</hi>; and he that did smite off St. <hi>John Baptists</hi> Head, was called <hi>Herod Antipa,</hi> and the third was called <hi>Herod Agrippa,</hi> and he did slay St. <hi>James,</hi> and put St. <hi>Peter</hi> in Prison.</p>

               <p>And at the entering of Mount <hi>Sion</hi> is a Chappel, and in that Chappel is that great and large Stone, with which the Sepulcre was covered when Christ was laid therein: the which Stone, as it is written, the thrée <hi>Maries</hi> saw turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when they came to the Sepulcre, and they found an Angel that told them that Christ was Risen from Death to Life: and there is a little Pillar, to the which our Lord was bound and scourged: and there was <hi>Annas</hi> House, that was Bishop of the Iews at that time; and in that same place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed S. <hi>Peter</hi> our Lord thrice before the Cock crew, and there is a part of the Table, at which Christ eat his last Supper with his Disciples: and yet there is the Vessel with Water, out of which the Disciples féet were washed: and near by, also is Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> Grave: and there is the Altar where our

               <p>In that same Chappel behind the high Altar, were all the Apostles on Whitsunday, when the Holy Ghost descended on them in likeness of Fire; and there God made peace with his Disciples: and there slept S. <hi>John</hi> the Evengelist on our Lords breast, and saw in his sléep many secret things of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Also <hi>Mount Sion</hi> is within the city, and it is a little higher then the other side of the City, and that City is stronger on the one side then on the other; for in the foot of <hi>Mount Sion</hi> is a fair and strong castle, which the Soldan did cause to be made there.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Mount Sion</hi> was King <hi>David</hi> buried, and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and many other Kings of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and there is the place where Saint <hi>Peter</hi> wept full bitterly, when he had denyed our Lord: and a stones rast from that, is another place where our Lord was judged, for at that time was <hi>Caiaphas</hi> House there; and betwéen the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Mount Sion</hi> is the place where Christ raised the Maiden from death to life.

               <p>Then men go to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> of the which our Lord had his Name; and from <hi>Nazareth</hi> unto <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is thrée daies journey.

               <p>And after men come to <hi>Sybula,</hi> where the Ark of God was kept under <hi>Helie</hi> the Prophet.

Some men say that Antichrist should be born at <hi>Corasim</hi>; and nourished at <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> but he shall reign at <hi>Corasim</hi>; therefore saith holy Writ, <hi>Vae tibi Corasim, Vae tibi Bethsaida</hi>; that is, Wo be to thée <hi>Corasim,</hi> wo be to thée <hi>Bethsaida</hi>; But others say, he shall be born in <hi>Babylon</hi>; therefore said the Prophet, <hi>De Babylonia Coluber exit qui totum mundum devorabit</hi>; that is, Out of <hi>Babylon</hi> shall come a Serpent that shall devour all the World. <hi>Cana</hi> a chief City of <hi>Galile</hi> is four miles from <hi>Nazareth</hi>: of which City was the woman of Canaan, of whom the Gospel speaketh, and there our Lord did his first Miracle, when at the Marriage of the Architri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

From thence men go to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which hath béen a great City, but now there is but a little Town, and that unwalled: There was our Lady born, and of this City our Lord took his Name. At <hi>Nazareth</hi> also <hi>Joseph</hi> took our Lady to wife, when she was fourtéen years of age: There the Angel saluted her, saying, <hi>Ave, gratia plena, Dominus tecum,</hi> that is, Hail full of grace, the Lord is with thée. And there was sometime a great Church, but now there is but a little Room to receive the offerings of Pilgrims. There is the Well of <hi>Gabriel,</hi> where our Lord was wont to bath him when he was little. At <hi>Nazareth</hi> was our Lord nourished: and <hi>Nazareth</hi> is called the flower of Gardens; and it may well be so called, for there was nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Flower of Life, even our Lord Iesus Christ. About half a mile from <hi>Nazareth</hi> is the bloud of our Lord, for the Iews led him upon a high Rock, to cast him down and slay him, but Iesus escaped them, and leapt to another Rock, where steps be yet séen, which they say are the steps of our Lord, therefore some when they are in danger of Thieves or Enemies, say

               <figure/>
               <p>ANd in this Country, as in many other Lands beyond the Sea, it is a custom when they have war, that if a City or Castle be besieged so strongly that they can send no Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to any Lords for succour, then they write their Letters, and bind them about the necks of Doves, and let them flye their ways, because the Dove is of that nature, that she will return again to the place where she is bred; and thus they do commonly in that country. And ye shall understand that among the <hi>Sarasins,</hi> in many places dwell Christians under Tribute, and they are of divers manners, and have divers Laws, though they be all Christians, and believe all well in our Lord God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; but yet they fail in the Articles of our Faith, and they are called <hi>Jacobins</hi>: for Saint <hi>James</hi> converted them to the Faith, and Saint <hi>John</hi> Baptized them: and they say, that men need onely to confess their sins unto God, and not unto men; for they say, that God bade not one man confess himself to another man. And therefore said <hi>David</hi> in this manner, <hi>Confitebor tibi Domine in toto corde meo</hi>; That is, Lord, I will confess my self unto thee with all my heart. And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, he saith thus, <hi>Peccatum meum cognitum tibi feci</hi>;
<pb facs="tcp:56519:29"/>
                  <figure/> that is, my trespasses I have made known unto thee. And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, <hi>Deus meus es tu, &amp; confitebor tibi</hi>: that is, thou art my God, and I will confess my self unto thee. And in another place, <hi>Quoniam cogitatio hominis confitebitur tibi</hi>; that is, The thought of man shall be known unto thee. And they read of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Bible and Psalter, but they say not in Latin, but in their own Language; for they say, that <hi>David</hi> and other Prophets did so. And Saint <hi>Austin</hi> and Saint <hi>Grogory</hi> say, <hi>Qui scelera sua cogitat, &amp; conversus fuerit, veniam sibi credat.</hi> That is, Whoso knoweth his sin, and turneth, he may believe to have forgiveness. And Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> saith thus, <hi>Dominus potius men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem quam verbum considerat.</hi> That is, our Lord taketh more heed to thought, than to word. And Saint <hi>Hillarius</hi> saith, <hi>Longorum temporum crimina ictu oculi, &amp;c.</hi> That is, sins that are done of old time, perish in the twinkling of an eye, if hatred of them be in a mans heart. And therefore say they by these Authorities, that men should confess them only to God; and this way the Apostles taught: but the Popes that came since, have ordained that men should confess them to Priests and men as they are; and the cause is this: For they say, that a man that hath sickness, men may give him no good medicine, except they know the kind of sickness: also they say, a man can give no good advice, except he know the sin.</p>

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>For there is a manner of sin that is grievouser to one man then it is to another; and therefore it is needfull that a man know and understand the kind of sin.</p>
               <p>And there be also other men that are called <hi>Surreyens,</hi> and they hold half our Faith, and half the Faith of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and they have long Beards, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> have.</p>
               <p>And there be others that men call <hi>Georgians,</hi> whom Saint <hi>George</hi> converted, and they do worship more the Hallowes of Heaven then others do, and they have their Crowns shaven: the Clerks have round Crowns, and the Lay-men have square Crowns, and they hold the <hi>Greeks</hi> Law.

               <head>CHAP. XLI. How a man may go the shortest way to Hierusalem.</head>
               <p>NOw have I told you the furthest and longest ways by the which men go to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> as by <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is also called <hi>Kayre</hi>; and <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and many other places, through the which men go to the Land of Promise. Now will I tell you the shortest way to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> for many will go the long way, some for want of Company, and many other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable causes: and therefore I shall tell you shortly how a man may go with little cost and short time.</p>
               <p>A man that cometh from the Land of the West, he goeth through <hi>France, Burgony, Lumbardy,</hi> and to <hi>Venice,</hi> or to <hi>Gene,</hi> or some other Haven of those Marches, and taketh there Ship, and goeth to the Isle <hi>Grisse,</hi> and so arriveth he in <hi>Greece,</hi> or else in Port <hi>Myroch,</hi> or <hi>Valon,</hi> or <hi>Duras,</hi> or some other Haven of those Marches, and arriveth to <hi>Cypress,</hi> and cometh not in the Isle of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> but arriveth at <hi>Famagust,</hi> that is the chief Haven of <hi>Cypress,</hi> or else at <hi>Lamaton</hi>: and then taking Ship again, he passeth beside the Haven of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and cometh not to Land, and so passeth by all the Havens to the Coast, till he come to <hi>Jaffe,</hi> that is the next Haven to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> for it is but twenty eight miles between. And
<pb facs="tcp:56519:31"/>
from <hi>Jaffe</hi> men go to the City of <hi>Ramos,</hi> and that it is but little thence, and it is a fair City, and beside <hi>Ramos</hi> is a fair Church of our Lady, where our Lord shewed himself unto her in three shadows, betokening the Trinity; and there near is a Church of S. <hi>George,</hi> where his Head was smitten off: and then to the Castle of <hi>Emaus,</hi> and then to the <hi>Mount Joy,</hi> and from thence Pilgrims see <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and then to <hi>Mount Modin,</hi> and then to <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> At <hi>Mount Modin</hi> lyeth the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> and over against <hi>Ramatha</hi> is the Town of <hi>Douke,</hi> whereof the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> was.</p>

               <p>FOrasmuch as many men cannot endure the trouble of the Sea, and better it is to go by Land, although it be more pain; then a man shall go to one of the Havens of <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> as <hi>Venice,</hi> or another, and ye shall pass into <hi>Greece,</hi> or Port <hi>Myroch,</hi> or another, and ye shall go to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and shall pass the Water that is called the Breach of Saint <hi>George,</hi> that is an arm of the Sea. And from thence ye shall come to <hi>Pulveral,</hi> and then to the Castle of <hi>Synople,</hi> and so to <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> which is a great Countrey, wherein are many great Hills: and ye shall go through <hi>Turky,</hi> and to the City of <hi>Nike,</hi> the which they won from the Emperour of <hi>Constantinople</hi>: and it is a fair City, and well walled, and there is a River that is called the Lay: and then men go by the Alpes of <hi>Mormount,</hi> and through the Vales of <hi>Malebrines,</hi> and the Vale <hi>Ernax,</hi> and so more easily to <hi>Antioch,</hi> which standeth richly on the River. And he that will go another way, he goeth by the <hi>Roman</hi> Ceast. and the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea: on that Ceast is a fair Castle that is called <hi>Florage</hi>: and when a man hath passed the Hills, he cometh to the city of <hi>Moriach,</hi> and to <hi>Artose,</hi> where is a great Bridge upon the River of <hi>Ferne,</hi> that men call <hi>Fassor</hi>; and it is a great River bearing Ships: and beside the City of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> is a River that cometh from the Mount of <hi>Libany,</hi> which is called <hi>Alban</hi>: at the passage of this River, Saint <hi>Eustace</hi> lost his two Sons, when he had lost his Wife: and it runneth
<pb facs="tcp:56519:32"/>
through the Plain of <hi>Chalcides,</hi> and to the great Sea. Then men go to the City of <hi>Fermine,</hi> and so to the City of <hi>Ferne,</hi> and then to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and that is a fair City and well walled, and it is two miles long, and there is a Bridge over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that hath at each Pillar a good Tower, and it is the best City of the Kingdom of <hi>Sury.</hi> From <hi>Antioch</hi> men go to the City of <hi>Locuth,</hi> and so to <hi>Geble,</hi> and to <hi>Tortouse,</hi> and thereby is the Land of Lambre, and a strong Castle that men call <hi>Mambeke.</hi> And from <hi>Tortouse,</hi> men go to <hi>Tripoly</hi> on the Sea, and by this Sea men go to <hi>Dicres</hi>: and there is two wayes to <hi>Hierusalem</hi>: by the way on the left hand men come first unto <hi>Damas</hi> by the River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and on the right side men go through the Land of <hi>Flagme,</hi> and so to the City <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> in which City <hi>Caiphas</hi> was Lord, and some call it the Castle <hi>Pellerius,</hi> and from thence is four days iourney to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and they go through <hi>Cesary Philippi, Jaffe, Ramas,</hi> and <hi>Emaus,</hi> and so to <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XLIII. Yet another way by Land toward the Land of Promise.</head>
               <p>NOw have I told you some ways by land and by water, how men may go to <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> And there be many other ways that men go by, after the Countries that they come from, nevertheless they come all to, one end. Yet is there a way all by Land to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and pass no Sea but to <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Flanders,</hi> but that way is very long and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and of great travel, wherefore few go that way; but he that will go that way, must go by <hi>Almaine</hi> and <hi>Pruse,</hi> and so to <hi>Tartary.</hi> This <hi>Tartary</hi> is holden by the great <hi>Caane,</hi> of whom I shall speak afterward, for thither reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Lordship, and all the Lords of <hi>Tartary</hi> yield to him Tribute. <hi>Tartary</hi> is a barren Country, and very san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for there groweth little either Corn or other Fruit, but there is a great plenty of Beasts, and therefore they eat flesh without bread, and they sup the broth, and they drink the milk of all manner of Beasts. And because they have great
<pb facs="tcp:56519:32"/>
scarcity of Wood, they dry the dung of Horses and of other Beasts, and burn it for to dress their meat by. Princes and other Lords eat but once in the day, and that is very little: and they be foul folk, and of ill liking. In Summer there are many great Tempests, and Thunders, that slay many men and beasts: sometime on the sudden it is very cold, and again on the sudden it is very hot. The Prince of the Land they call <hi>Roco,</hi> and he dwelleth at a City that is called <hi>Orda</hi>: but very few Strangers do desire to dwell in that Land, for it is good to sow Thorns and Weeds in, but other good there is none, as I heard say, for I was not that way, but I have been in other Countries marching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in the Land of <hi>Russia,</hi> and <hi>Nisland,</hi> and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Grecon,</hi> and <hi>Lectow,</hi> and the Kingdom <hi>Grasten,</hi> and in many other places: but I never went that way to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and therefore I cannot well tell it, for I have understood that men may not well go that way but in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the waters and mires that be in that Land be frozen and covered with Snow, so that men may pass thereon: for were not that Snow, there might no man go in that Land but he were loss. And ye shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that a man must go three days iourney from <hi>Pruse</hi> to pass this way, before he can come to the Land of <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if by chance any Christians pass that way, as once a year they do, they carry their victuals with them, for they should find nothing there but a manner of food that they call Syles, and they carry their Victuals upon the Ice on Steds, and Chariots without Wheeles; and as long as their Victuals last, they may dwell there, but no longer. And when the Spies of the Countries see Christians come, they run to the Towns, and Castles, and cry aloud, <hi>Kara, Kara, Kara</hi>; and as soon as they have cryed, then do the people arm them. And ye shall understand that the Ice there is harder then it is here, and every man hath a Stove in his House, and therein they eat and do all things that them needeth; and that is at the North part of the World, where it is commonly cold, for the Sun appeareth not, nor shineth but little in that Countrey: and that Land is in some places
<pb facs="tcp:56519:33"/>
so cold, that there may no man dwell therein; and on the South side of the World it is in some places so hot, that there can no man dwell, the Sun giveth so great heat in those Countries.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLIV. Of the Faith of the Sarasins, and of the Book of their Law, named Alkaron.</head>
               <p>FOrasmuch as I have told you of the <hi>Sarasins,</hi> and of other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Lands, I purpose to set down a part of their Law, and of their Belief, as their Book saith that they call Alkaron, and some call that Book Mysap, and some call it Harme, in divers Languages of Countries, which Book <hi>Mahomet</hi> gave them, in the which Book he wrote among other things, as I have often read and seen, that they that are good shall go to Paradise, and the evil folks to Hell; and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all Sarasins. And if a man ask of what Paradise they mean, they say it is a place of Delights, where a man shall find all manner of Fruits at all times, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Rivers running with Milk and Honey, Wine and fresh water, and they shall all have fair Houses and good, as they have deserved, and those Houses are made of precious stones, gold and silver, and every man shall have ten Wives and Maidens, and he shall every day once have to do with them, and yet shall they still be maidens. And they speak often of the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and tell of the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>Mary</hi> was learned of Angels, and that <hi>Gabriel</hi> said to her that she was chosen before all other from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World, and that witnesseth well their Book: and <hi>Gabriel</hi> told her the Incarnation of Iesus Christ, and that she should conceive and bear a Child: and they say, that Christ was a holy Prophet in word and deed, and also meek and right wise to all men, and one not any way blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy: and they say that when the Angel told her of the Incarnation, she had great dread, for she was very young, and there was one in that Country that practised Sorcery, who was called <hi>Takina,</hi> that with Enchantments could make him like an Angel, and went often and lay with Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
<pb facs="tcp:56519:33"/>
and therefore was <hi>Mary</hi> the more afraid of the Angel, and thought in her mind that it had been <hi>Takina,</hi> who went to Maidens; and she charged him in the Name of God to tell her if he were the same <hi>Takina,</hi> and the Angel bade her have no dread, for he was for certain a true Messenger of Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Also their Book Alkaron saith, that she had a Child un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Palm-Trée: then was she greatly ashamed, and wished her self dead, but as soon as her Child was born, he spake and comforted her, saying, <hi>Netimeas Maria,</hi> that is, Be not afraid, <hi>Mary.</hi> And in many other places saith their Book <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>karon,</hi> that Iesus Christ spake as soon as he was born: and the Book saith that Iesus Christ was sent of Almighty God, to be an ensample to all men, and that God shall Iudge all men, the good to Heaven, and the wicked to Hell, and that Iesus Christ is the best Prophet of all other, and next to God, and that he was a holy Prophet, for he gave the blind their sight, and healed all Diseases, he raised men that were dead, and was taken quick into Heaven. And if they may find a Book with Gospels, such as, <hi>Missus est Angelus,</hi> they do it great Worship: and they fast one Moneth in the year, and eat only a night, and they keep them from their Wives; but they that are sick are not constrained to it. And their Book Alkaron speaketh of <hi>Jews,</hi> and saith, they are wicked people, for they will not believe that Iesus Christ is of God. Further they say, that the <hi>Jews</hi> speak falsly of our Lady, and her Son Iesus Christ, in saying that they did not hang him on the Cross. Their Book Alkaron forbiddeth Murther and Theft; and commandeth them to do so to others, as they would have others do to them: for the <hi>Sarasins</hi> believe so near our Naith, that they are easily converted when men preach the Law of Iesus Christ. They say also that they know right well by their Prophesies, that their Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> shall fail, as the <hi>Jews</hi> Law doth, and that the Law of Christians shall last to the Worlds end. And if a man ask them wherein they believe, they say that they believe in God Almighty, that is the Maker of Heaven and Earth, &amp; all other things, and without him is nothing done; and at the day of Iudgment every man shall be rewarded after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
<pb facs="tcp:56519:34"/>

               <head>CHAP. XLV. Yet further concerning Mahomet.</head>
               <p>ALso <hi>Mahomet</hi> had writ in his Book Alkaron, that every man should have two Wives, or three, or four; but now they have nine, and as many Lemmans as them liketh; and it any of these Wives do wrong to their Husbands, he may drive her out of his House, and take in another, but he must give part of his goods. Moreover, where men speak of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, they say that they are not three Persons, but one God: for their Book Alkaron speaketh not thereof, nor of the Trinity: but they say that God spake, or else he was dumb; and that God had a Ghost, or else he was not alive: They say Gods Word hath great strength, and so saith their Alkaron, and they say that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> were greatly in favour with God, for they spake with him; and <hi>Mahomet</hi> was a true Messenger of God: and they have many good Articles of our Faith, and some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Scriptures, Prophets, Gospels, and the Bible, for they have them written in their Language. In their manner they know holy <hi>Writ,</hi> but they understand it but after the Letter, and so do the Iews, for they understand it not Spiritually, but after their Letter: and therefore saith Saint <hi>Paul, Litera occidit, Spiritus autem vivificar,</hi> that is, the Letter killeth, but the Spirit quickneth. The <hi>Sarasins</hi> likewise say, that the <hi>Jews</hi> are wicked for they keep not the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> which he gave them: and also Christians are evil, for they keep not the Commandments of the Gospel, that Iesus Christ sent unto them.</p>
               <p>And further, I shall tell you what the Soldan told me upon &amp; day in his Chamber, shutting out all other men, as Lords, Knights, and others, for he would speak with me in counsel: and then he asked me how Christians governed themselves in our Country: I answered him and said, Right well, thanks be to God: but he said secretly, nay, for he said that our Priests made no force of Gods Service: for they should
<pb facs="tcp:56519:34"/>
give good example to men to do well, and they give ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and therefore when the people should go on the Holy days to Church to serve God, they go to the Tavern to sin in glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny both day and night, eating and drinking as Beasts that wot not when they have enough. He said also, that there was much contention among Christians, and one would defraud another, and they were so proud that they wist not how to clothe them; now short, now long, now strait, now wide, and of all fashions: whereas they should be humble and meek, giving their alms as Iesus Christ did, in whom they believe. He said also that they were so covetous, that for a little money they would sell their children, sisters, or wives, one man taking another mans wife, and no man keeping his promise: Therefore said he, for their sins hath God given these Lands to our hands, and not through our strength, but all for your sins: For we know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, that while ye truly serve God he will help you, so that no man shall win of you, if that ye serve God as ye ought to do: but while ye live so sinfully as ye do, we have no dread of you, for God will not help you. And then I asked him how he knew the state of Christians in that manner: and he said that he knew well the state both of Lords and of Commons, by his Messengers which he sent through all the Countries as it were Merchants, with precious Stones and other Merchandise, to know the manner of every Country. And then he did call again all the Lords into his Chamber to us, and then shewed he unto me three persons that were great Lords of that Country, who shewed unto me the manner of my Country and of all Christendom, as though they had béen men born in the same parts, and they spake <hi>French</hi> right well, and the Soldan also: and then I had great marbel of this slander of our Faith; and so they that should be turned by our good examples to the Faith of Iesus Christ, they are drawn away through our evil living; and therefore it is no wonder if that they call us evil, for they say truth; but the Sarasins are true, for they keep truly the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of their Alkaron.</p>

               <p>ANd ye shall understand that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was born at <hi>Ithareb</hi> in <hi>Araby,</hi> and his Father was a <hi>Painim,</hi> and his Mother a <hi>Jew</hi>; their names were <hi>Abdal</hi> and <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mna,</hi> and they were but poor folk; and he was first a poor drudge, and kept horse: and afterward he followed Merchandise.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Sarasins</hi> say, he came into <hi>Egypt</hi> with Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, and <hi>Egypt</hi> was the same time Christened, and there was a Chappel beside <hi>Araby,</hi> and there was an Hermit; and when he came to the Chappel that was but a little low House, as soon as he entred, it began to be as great as it were a Palace Gate; and that was the first Miracle that the <hi>Sarasins</hi> say he did in his youth. After began <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be wise and rich, and became a great Astronomer, and since was the Keeper of the Land for the Prince of <hi>Carasan,</hi> and governed it full well, in such manner that when the Prince was dead, he marryed the Lady named <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>adiga,</hi> And <hi>Mahomet</hi> fell of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into the falling Evil: wherefore the Lady was sorry that she had taken him to be her Husband: and he made her believe that every time he fell so, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> spake to him, and for the brightness of the Angel he fell down. This <hi>Mahomet</hi> raigned in <hi>Araby,</hi> in the year of our Lord six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty: he was of the kindred of <hi>Ishmael</hi> that was <hi>Abrahams</hi> Son, whom he begat on <hi>Hagar</hi>: the other are called <hi>Sarasins of Sara</hi>: but some are called <hi>Moabites,</hi> and some <hi>Amonites,</hi> after <hi>Lots</hi> two Sons. And ye shall understand that the <hi>Turks, Arabins,</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> do profess the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>karon, but they vary one from another in many matters. This <hi>Mahomet</hi> loved well a good man an Hermit, that dwelt in the Wilderness, a mile from <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> in the way as men go from <hi>Araby</hi> to <hi>Chalde,</hi> a daies iourney from the Sea whence Merchants of <hi>Venice</hi> come: and <hi>Mahomet</hi> went often to this Hermit, for he heard gladly the Hermit preach; but his men were displeased at it, for they travelled sometime all night; wherefore they wished the Hermit dead. So it befell on a night, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was sore drunk with strong Wine,
<pb facs="tcp:56519:35"/>
so that he fell asleep; then his men took his sword out of his sheath whiles he lay and slept, and therewith they slew the Hermit, and when they had done, they put up the sword again all bloody; and upon the Morrow when that he found the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thus dead, he was very angry in his mind, and right wroth, and would have put his men unto death; but they all with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, <figure/> and with one consent said, that he himselfe had slain him, when he was drunken, and they shewed him his own sword all bloody; and then he believed that they said truth; and cursed the Wine, and all those that drank it. And therefore <hi>Sarasins</hi> that are devout, drink no Wine openly, lest they should be reproved, but they drink good Beverage, sweet and nourishing, that is made of Calamels, and thereof is Sugar made.</p>
               <p>And it befell sometime that Christians become <hi>Sarasins,</hi> either through poverty, simpleness, or wickedness; and therefore their Archbishop when he received them, said, <hi>Laelles ella Mahomet ros sella</hi>; that is to say, there is no God but one, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> is his Messenger. And seeing I have told you a part of their Law and their Customs. Now I shall tell you of their Letters, with their Names.</p>

               <p>And thereby is the Kingdom of <hi>Albany,</hi> which is a great Land; and it is so called because that men are more white there than in other places. In this Country are great Hounds <figure/>

               <p>NOw he that will go to <hi>Tartary, Persia, Chalde</hi> or <hi>Inde,</hi> he taketh Ship of <hi>Gene,</hi> or at <hi>Venice,</hi> or at any other Haven, and so he passeth by the Sea, and arriveth at <hi>Topa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sond,</hi> that is a good City, that sometime was called the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of <hi>Briga,</hi> and thereby is the Haven of <hi>Persia,</hi> of <hi>Media,</hi> and of other Marches. In this City lyeth Saint <hi>Athanasius</hi> that was Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and made the Psalm <hi>Quicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que vult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This man was a great Doctor of Divinity, and of the God-head: he was accused unto the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he was an Heretick, and the Pope sent for him, and put him in Prison, and while he was in that Prison he made this Psalm, and sent it unto the Pope, and said, if that he were an Heretick then was that Heresie, for that was his Faith and his Belief: and when the Pope saw that what he had said therein, was all our Faith, he anon delivered him out of Prison, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that Psalm to be said every day at the beginning of Service; and so he held <hi>Athanasius</hi> for a good Christian: but he would never after go to his Bishoprick, hecause they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him of Heresie. <hi>Topasond</hi> was sometime holden of the Emperor of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but a great man that he sent to help the Country against the <hi>Turks,</hi> did hold it to himself, and called himself Emperor of <hi>Topasond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And from thence men go through little Armony, and in that Country is an old Castle, that is on a Rock, that men call the Castle of <hi>Cypress</hi>; there people say, men find an Hawk sitting upon a Perch right well made, and a fair Lady of Fairy that keepeth it; and he that will watch the same Hawk seven daies and seven nights (some say, that it is but thrée daies and thrée nights) alone without any company, and without sleep, this fair Lady will come unto him at the seven, or at thrée
<pb facs="tcp:56519:37"/>
daies and, and shall grant unto him the first thing that he shall ask of worldly things, and that hath often béen proved, the folk say: So upon a time it befell that a man who at that time was King of <hi>Armony,</hi> that was a right daughty man, watched upon a time; and at the seven days end, the Lady came to him <figure/> and bade him ask what he would: For he had well done his duty: and the King answered and said, that he was a great Lord, and in good peace, and was rich; so that he would ask no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the continual love of the fair Lady, or to have his will of her. Then this fair Lady answered and said unto him, that he was a fool, for he wist not what he asked, neither might he have her: but he should not have asked of her any worldly thing, for she was not worldly. Then the King saith he would nought else: and she said, sith he would ask nought else, she would grant him and all that came after him thrée things, and said unto him: Sir King, ye shall have War without peace unto the ninth degree; and ye shall be in subjection unto your Enemies, and ye shall have great néed of good Cattel. And since that time all the Kings of <hi>Armony</hi> have béen in War, and néedy, and under tribute of the <hi>Sarasins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also a poor mans son who watched on a time, asked of the Lady that he might grow rich and happy by Merchandise, and the Lady granted him: but she said to him, that he had
<pb facs="tcp:56519:37"/>
asked his undoing, for great pride that he should have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And this man became so great a Merchant both by Sea and Land, that he was so rich, that he knew not the thousand part of his goods.</p>
               <p>Also a Knight of the Templers watched likewise, and when he had done, he desired to have a Purse full of Gold; and whatsoever he took thereof, it should ever be full again: and she granted it him, but she told him that he had desired his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; by the great mispending that he should have of the same Purse; and so it befell. But he that shall watch hath great néed to kéep him from sléep: for if he sléep, he is lost, so that he shall never be séen after. But this is not the right way, but for a marvel.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Topasond</hi> men go to great <hi>Armony,</hi> to the City <hi>Artyron,</hi> which aforetime was a fair City, but the <hi>Turks</hi> have so destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, that there neither groweth Wine nor Fruit. From <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyron,</hi> men go to the Hill <hi>Sabissocal,</hi> and there near is another Hill called <hi>Arah,</hi> but the <hi>Jews</hi> call it <hi>Thano</hi>; where the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> rested after the Deluge, and on that Hill a man may sée very far in clear weather, for the Hill is full seven miles of height; and some say, they have been there and put their fingers in the holes where the Fiend went out, when <hi>Noah</hi> said in this manner, <hi>Benedicite.</hi> But I judg, that for Snow that is alwaies upon that Hill, both Winter and Summer, no man hath ever gone up since <hi>Noah</hi> was there: but only one is said to have been there, who brought a Plank that yet is in the Abbey at the Hills foot, for he had great desire to go up that Hill, and when he was at the third part upward, he was so weary that he might not go further, and he rested him and slept; and when he was awake, he was down at the Hill foot, and then prayed he to God, devoutly, that he would suffer him to go to the upper part of the Hill, and an Angel said, that he should have his desire, and so he did; and since that time no man did ever come there: but a man ought not to believe all things that are spoken of it.</p>
               <p>And from thence men go to a City that is called <hi>Tanziro,</hi> which is a fair and a rich City; beside that City is an Hill of Salt, and thereof every man taketh what he will: and there dwell many Christians under Tribute of the <hi>Sarasins.</hi> From thence men go through many Cities, Towns and Villages toward <hi>Inde</hi>; and then come to a City that is called Cassage,
<pb facs="tcp:56519:38"/>
                  <figure/> that is a fair City, and near that is abundance of Corn; Vines, and all manner of Fruits; and there met the three Kings together, that went to make their Offering to our Lord in <figure/> 
                  <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> From that City men go to another called <hi>Carra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page</hi>; and <hi>Painims,</hi> say, that Christians may not dwell there,
<pb facs="tcp:56519:38"/>
but they die soon, yet they know not the cause. From thence men go through many Countries, Cities and Towns; so that it were too long to tell all: and to the City of <hi>Carnaa,</hi> that was sometime so great, that the Wall was five and twenty miles about, which yet may be seen, but it is not inhabited, and at that place endeth the Land of the Emperor of <hi>persia.</hi>

And when they will have any men to lie by them, they send for them into a country that is near their land, and the men come and stay there eight days, or as the woman liketh, and then go they again: and if they have men-children they send them to their Fathers when they can eat and go, if they have maid-children they keep them: and if they be of Noble blood, they burn the left Pap away, for bearing of a Shield; and if they be of base degree, they burn the right Pap away, for shooting.

               <p>FRom <hi>Ethiope</hi> men go through many and divers Countries before they come into <hi>Inde</hi>: and it is parted into thrée
<pb facs="tcp:56519:40"/>
parts, that is to say, Inde the more, which is a hot Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Inde the less, which is a temperate Land: and the third part is toward the North, and there it is very cold, so that with great cold, frost and ice, the water becomes Chrystal, and upon that groweth the rich Diamonds that are of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled colour, which Diamond is so hard that no man may break it. Other Diamonds men find in Araby, that are not so good, for they are more soft, and there be some in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press. In Macedonia men find Diamonds likewise, but the best are in Inde, and some are many times found in a masse, in the Mines where gold is gotten, when men break the masse in pieces: sometimes men find some as great as a Pease, and some less, and those are as hard as those of Inde: sometime there are good Diamonds found in Inde upon the Rock of Chrystal: and also upon the Rock of Adament in the Sea. And upon other Hills are Diamonds found that are as great as Hazel Nuts, which are square, and pointed of their own kind, and they grow two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, male and female, and are nourished with the Dew of Heaven, and they engender commonly and bring forth other small ones, which encrease and grow all the year. I have many times tryed that if a man keep them with a little of the Rock, and wet them often with the Dew, they will grow every year, and the small will wax great: and if a man do bear that Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond on his left side then it is of more vertue, for the strength of their growing is toward the North, that is, on the left side, as men of those Countries say. To him that beareth the Diamond with him, it giveth hardiness, it keepeth the limbs of the body, it also giveth a man victory over his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if his cause be right, and it keepeth him that beareth it in good temper, free from strife; riot, ill dreams, sorceries, and enchantments. Moreover, no wild beast shall assail or any way hurt them. This Diamond should be neither bought nor sold, but given freely, for then it is of most vertue. It healeth the Lunatick, and him that is possessed with a Devil: and as soon as any Venome or Poyson is brought near to the Diamond, it moistneth, and begins to sweat. And men may easily pollish them, though some think they may not be pollish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and men may assay them well in this manner: First, cut
<pb facs="tcp:56519:41"/>
them on prceious Stones. Saphirs, or upon Christal, and then take a Stone that is called Adamant, and lay a Néedle before that Adamant, and if the Diamond be good and of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the Adamant draweth not the Néedle to it, whiles the Diamond is there. And this is the proof that they make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sea. But it chanceth sometime that the good Diamond loseth the vertue through him that beareth it, and therefore it is néedfull for to make it recover the vertue again or else it is of little value.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LIII. Of divers Kingdomes and Isles in the Land of Inde, and of people that are of a yellow and green colour, and of many strange things.</head>
               <p>THere is in Inde many Countries and divers Kingdoms, and it taketh the name of a River that runneth through it which is called Inde also, and there are many precious Stones in the said River and divers other strange things, as Eales of thirty foot long: and men that dwell near that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are of evil colour yellow and gréen. In that Land of Inde are more than five thousand Isles that are inhabited, (beside divers that are uninhabited) and in each one of those are great plenty of Cities, and much people; for the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are of that condition, that commonly they pass not out <figure/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56519:41"/>
of their Land, for they dwell under the Planet <hi>Saturn,</hi> which maketh his course through the twelve Signes but once in thirty years; yet the Moon passeth through the twelve Signs in one Moneth, and for that <hi>Saturn</hi> is of so little stirring, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men that dwell under it, and in the Climate, have no good will to stir much abroad. But in our Country it is contrary, for we are in a Climate that is under the Moon, and of light stirring, and therefore it giveth us will to much moving and stirring, and to go into divers Countries of the World, for it goeth about the World more swifter than any other Planet doth.</p>
               <p>Also men pass through Inde to many Countries by Sea, and then they come to the Isle of Hermes, where Merchants of Venice and of Gene, and of divers other parts of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come to buy their Merchandise. And it is so warm there in that Isle that mens members hang down to their shanks, for the great dissolving of the Body. But men of that Country that know better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> manners do bind them strait, and anoint them with Ointments, made therefore for to hold them up, whereby they may live more civilly. In this Island men and women lie all naked in the Rivers, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the heat of the day till it be pass noon, and they lie all in the water but the face, for the great heat that is there, <figure/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56519:42"/>
and the women be not ashamed for the men. In this Isle the Ships are without nail or bands of Iron, lest the Rocks of Adament that are in the Sea should draw the Ships to them. From this Isle men go by Sea to the Isle of Lana, where is great plenty of Corn, and the King of this Isle was sometime so mighty that he held War against King <hi>Alexander</hi> with great strength: Men of this Isle have many manners of Beliefs and saith, and have also divers Laws: for some do worship the Sun, some the Fire, some the Trées, and some the Serpents, or any other thing that they first méet in the morning, and some do Worship simple Simulacres and Idols; but between Simulacres and Idols is no difference, for they are but Images made to what likeness soever a man may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent: for some Image hath an head like an Ox, and some have three or four Heads, one of a Man, or an Horse, or an Ox, or any other beast that a man hath séen.</p>
               <p>And ye shall understand, that they that worship Simulacres, they worship them for worthy men that were sometime, as <hi>Hercules</hi> and others, who did many marvels when they lived: for they say, they know well that they are not that God which created all things, but that they are in estemation with God for the marvels they did, and therefore they worship them. <figure/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56519:42"/>
And so say they of the Sun, for it changeth ost times, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth sometime great heat for to nourish all things on Earth: and because it is so great profit, they know well that it is not God, but it is in Gods favour, and he loveth it more than any other thing, and for this cause they worship it.</p>
               <p>Also they have their reasons for other Planets, and for Fire also, for it is profitable &amp; néedfull. And of Idols they say that the Ox is the holiest that they may find on Earth, and more profitable than any other: for he doth much good, and none ill, and they know well that it may not be without the special grace of God, and therefore they make their God the one half like an Ox, and the other half like a Man, for Man is the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and chiefest creature in the World. And they do worship to Serpents and other beasts that they first méet in the morning, and namely those beasts that have good méeting, after whom they spéed well all the day after, the which they have proved of long time, and therefore they say that this méeting cometh of Gods grace, and therefore they do make Images like unto these things, that they might worship them before they meet any thing else.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56519:43"/>And there are some of them that say some Beasts are better for to meet than others; for Hares, Swine, and other Beasts are ill to méet first, as they say. In this Isle of Lana are many wild Beasts, and Rats in that Country are as great as Hounds here, and they take them with Mastiffs, for Cats may not take them. From thence men go to a City that is called Sarchis, and it is a fair and good City, and there dwell many true believing Christians, and there be men of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. From thence men come to the Land of Lombe, and in that Land groweth Pepper, in a Forrest that is called Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, and it groweth in none other place more in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try than in that Forrest, and that Forrest is fifty days Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and there by the Land of Lombe is the City of Polomes, and under that City is a Hill that men call Polombe, and thereof taketh the City his name.</p>
               <p>And so at the foot of the same Hill is a right fair and clear Well, that hath a full good and sweet savour, and it smelleth of all manner of sorts of Spices. And also at each hour of the day it changeth his savour diversly; and who so drinketh thrice in the day of that Well he is made whole of all manner of sickness that he hath, I have sometime drunk of that Well and me thinketh yet that I fare the better: some call it the Well of Youth for they that drink thereof, séem to be young alway and have little sickness: and they say that this Well comes from Paradise <hi>terrestre,</hi> because it is of such vertue. In this Land groweth Ginger, and thither come many rich Merchants for Spices. In this Country men worship an Ox, for his great simplicity and meekness, and the profit that is in him; for they make an Ox to labour six or seaven years, and then they eat him, and the King of that Land hath evermore an Ox with him, and he that kéepeth him, every day taketh his Fées for the kéeping. And also every day he gathereth his urine, and his dung into a vessel of Gold, and beareth it to the Prelate that they call <hi>Areth porta paparon,</hi> and the Prelate beareth it to the King, and maketh thereupon a great stur, and then the King putteth his hand therein, and they call it gaul, and he anointeth his Front and his Breast therewith, and they do it great worship, and say he shall be fulfilled with the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Ox before said, and that he is hallowed through ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

And if any man dye in that Country, they burn them in token of Penance, that he should suffer no penance, if he were laid in the Earth, by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Worms: and if his Wife have no Children, then they burn her with him, and they say it is good reason, that she kéep him company in the other world, as she did in this; but if she have Children she may live with them if she please, also if he will.

               <p>FRom this Land men go many a days journey to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try called Mabaron, and this is a great Kingdom, there are many fair Cities and Towns. In this Land lyeth St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in a fair Tomb, in the City of Calamy, and the Arm <figure/>

and the Hand that he put into our Lords side after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, when Christ said unto him. <hi>Noli esse incredulus, sed fidelis,</hi> that is to say, Be not of vain hope, but believe: that same hand lyeth yet without the Tomb bare; and with this hand they give their dooms in that Country, to wit, who saith right, and who doth not; for if any strife be betwéen two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they write their names, and put them into the hand, and then incontinently the hand casteth away the Bill of them that do wrong and holdeth the other still that doth right, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men come from far Countrys to have judgment of causes that are in doubt.</p>
               <p>In this Church of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> is a great Image, that is a Simulacre, and is richly beset with precious Stones and Pearls; to that Image men come in Pilgrimage from far Countries with great devotion, &amp; there come some Pilgrims that bear sharp knives in their hands, and as they go by the way they slash their shanks and thighs that the blood may come out for the love of that Idol, and they say that he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that will die for that Idols sake. And there be some that from that time that they go out of their Houses, at each third pace they knéel, till that they come to this Idol; and when they come there, they have Incense, or some other thing to offer to the Idol: And there before that Minster or Temple of this Idol, is a River full of water, and in that River Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims cast Gold, Silver, Pearls, and other precious Stones <figure/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56519:44"/>
without number, in stead of offerings; and therefore when as the Minster hath any need of mending, then the Master of the Minster goes unto the River, and takes out thereof as much as is needful for the mending of the Minster.</p>
               <p>And ye shall understand that when any great Feasts of that Idol come, as the Dedication of the Temple or of the Thron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Idol, all the country thereabout assemble there to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: then they set the Idol with great revernce in a chair richly beset with Gold and Tapestry, and so they carry him with great reverence &amp; worship roundabout the city; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the chair goeth first in procession, all the Maidens of the country go two and two together, and so after them go the Pilgrims that are come from far countries, of the which Pilgrims some fall down before the chair, and so let all go over them, in so much that some are slain, and others have their arms and legs broken: this they do for love of the Idol, thinking that the more pain they suffer here for their Idol, the more joy shall they have in the other world. But a man shall find few Christians that will suffer so much penance for our Lords sake, as they do for their Idol. And nigh before the chair go all the Minstrels of the country, which are without number, with great melody.</p>

               <p>And when they are come again to the Temple, they set up the Idol again in his Throne: and for worship of the Idol two

               <p>Also the land is all common, for every man taketh what he will; for that one man hath now this year, another man hath the next year. And all the goods, as Corn, Beasts, and all manner of things in that country are common. For there is nothing under lock, and as rich is one man as another; but they have an evil custome to eating of flesh, for they eat mans flesh more gladly than other. Nevertheless, in that land is abundance of Corn, of Flesh, of Fich, of Gold, of Silver, and of all manner of good. And thither do Marchants bring <figure/> children for to sell, and those that are fat they eat, but those that be lean they keep till they be fat, and then are they eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.

Also Honey, Wine, and Venim, are drawn out of other Trees in the same manner, and they put it into vessels to keep. In that Isle is a dead Sea, which is a water that hath no bottom; and if any man fall therein he can never be found: beside that Sea groweth great Canes, and under their Roots men find precious Stones of a great vertue, for he that bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one of those Stones about him, there may no Iron wound him nor draw blood of him and therefore they that have those Stones fight full hardy, for there may no weapon that is of Iron wound them; therefore they that know the manner, make their weapons without Iron, and so they slay them.</p>

But no man can tell the cause why it is so: But they of that country say, that those Fishes come so thither to do worship to their King, for they say, he is the worthiest King of all the world, for he hath so many Wives, and getteth so many children of them. And that same King hath fourteen thousand of Elephants, or more, which be <figure/>

Marmozets, and other: and when the Covent have eaten, a Monk taketh the remainder and beareth it into the Garden, ringeth once with a Bell of Silver, which he holdeth in his hand, and anon come all those beasts that I speak of, and many more, near two or three thousand, and he giveth them meat in fair Vessels of Silver; and when they have eaten, he smiteth the Bell again, and they go away: and the Monk saith that those Beasts are souls of men that are dead, and those Beasts that are fair, are souls of Lords, and other rich men; and those that are foul Beasts, are souls of other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: and I asked them if it had not been better to give that relief to poor men; and they said, There is no poor man in that Country; but if there were, yet were it more Alms to give it to those souls that suffer there their penance, and may go no farther to get their meat, then to men that have wit, and may travel for their meat.

<pb facs="tcp:56519:53"/>
and it is the fairest that may be found in any place; and all about the Hill are many Trees bearing vivers fruits, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Hill is a great Ditch, and there near are many Rivers on each side, and in those are many wilde Fowls that he may take and not go out of the Palace. Within the Hall of that Palace are thirteen Pillars of Gold, and all the Wals are covered with rich skins of Beasts that men call Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>These are fair Beasts and well smelling, and by the smell of those Skins, no evil smell may come to the Pallace; those Skins are as red as blood, and they thine so against the Sun, that a man can scarcely behold them, and those Skins are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stéemed there as much as gold. In the midst of the Palace is a place made, that they call, the Monntor for the great <hi>Caan</hi>: that is well deckt with great and precious stones hanging about: and at the four corners of the Mountor are four Nedders of Gold, and under that Mountor, and about are Conduites of Beverage that they drink in the Emperors Court. And the Hall of that Palace is richly deckt and well: and first at the upper end of the Hall is the Throne of the Emperor very high, were he sitteth at meat, at a Table that is well bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with gold, and that border is full of precious stones, and great pearls, and the greeces on which he goeth up, are of Divers precious stones bordered with Gold.</p>
               <p>At the left side of this Throne, is the seat of his Wife, a degree lower then he sitteth, and that is of Iaspar, bordered with gold; and the seat of his second Wife, is a degree lower than the first, and that is also of good Iasper, bordered with gold; and the seat of the third Wife is a degree lower than the second, for always he hath thrée wives with him whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is: beside these Wives, on the same side sitteth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ladies of his kin, each one lower than other, as they are of degrée: and all those that are married, have a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit of a mans foot upon their Heads, near a cubit long, all made with precious stones, and about they are made with shining Feathers of Peacocks, or such other, in token that they are in subiection of man, and under mans feet; and they that are not Wedded have none such. And on the right side of the Emperor sitteth first his Son, the which shall be Emperor

And the Emperour hath his Table by himself alone that is made of gold and precious stones, or of white christal, or yellow bordered with gold, and each one of his Wives hath a Table by her self.</p>
               <p>And under the Emperors Table sitteth four Clarks at his feet, that write all that the Emperor saith, be it good or ill. And at great feasts about the Emperors table, and all other ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in the Hall is a Vine made of gold, that goeth all about the Hall, and it hath many branches of grapes like to grapes of the Vine; some are white, some are yellow, some red, some green, and some black: all the red are of Rubies, of Creams, or Allovance; the white are of Christal or Byral, the yellow are of Topaces, the gréen of Emeralds and Chrysolites, and the black are of Dutcks and Gorands; and this Vine is made thus of precious stones so properly, that it seemeth that it were a Vine growing. And before the board of the Emperor standeth great Lords, and no man is so hardy to speak unto him, except it be Musicians to solace the Emperor. And all the Vessels that are served in his Hall or Chambers, are of precious Stones, and specially at the Tables where great Lords eat, that is to say of Iasper, Chrystal, Amathist, or fine Gold, and the cups are of Emeralds, Saphirs, Topaces, and other of any manner of stones, and of Silver have they no Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, for thy esteem but little of silver to make Vessels of, but they make of Silver Greeces, Pillars, and Pavements of Halls and Chambers.

But ye shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that the Emperor of Cathay is called <hi>Caane,</hi> and not <hi>Cham,</hi> and for this cause: It is not long ago that all Tartary was in subjection and thrall to other Nations about, and they were made Heardsmen to keep beasts, and among them were vij. Linages or Kings: the first was called Tartary, that is the best, the second Linage is called Tamahot, the third Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, the fourth Vilatre, the fifth Semoth, the sixth Menchy, and the seventh Sobeth. These are all holden of the great <hi>Caane</hi> of Cathay. Now it befel that the first Linage was an old man, and he was not rich, and men called him <hi>Chanius.</hi> This man lay and slept on a night in his bed, and there came to him a Knight all white, sitting upon a white horse and said to him, <hi>Caane,</hi> sléepest thou? God that is Almighty sent me to thee, and it his will that thou say to the vij. Linages, that thou shalt be their Emperor, for you shall conquer all the land about you, and they shall be in your subjection, as you have béen in theirs: and when the morrow came he rose up and told it to the vij. Linages, and they scorned him, and said he was a fool: and the next night the same Knight came to
<pb facs="tcp:56519:55"/>
the seven Linages, and have them in Gods behalf to make <hi>Chanius</hi> their Emperor, and they should be out of all subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And on the morrow they those <hi>Chanius</hi> to be Emperor, and did him all worship that they might do, and called him <hi>Caane</hi> as the white Knight called him, and they said they would do as he have them. Then he made many statutes and Laws, the which is called Isakan. The first Statute was that they might be obedient to God Almighty, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he would deliver them out of thraldom, and that they should call on him in all their works. Another Statute was, that all men that could bear arms should be numbred, and to each ten should be a Master, and to a hundred a Master, and to a thousand a Master. Then he commanded to all the greatest and principallest of the vii. Linages that they should forsake all that they had in Heritage or Lordship, and that they should hold them apaid of that he would give them of his Grace: and they did so. And also he had them, that each man should bring his eldest Son before him, and slay his own Son with is own hands, and smite off his Head; and presently they did his bidding. And when he saw they made no letting of that he bade them, then he bade them follow his Banner and then he put in subjection all the Land about him.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:56519:56"/>
speaketh a word. And on the one side of the Emperours Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sitteth many Philosophers of many Sciences, some of Astronomy, Negromancy, Geometry, Pyromancy, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Sciences, and some have before them Astrolobes of Gold or pretious Stones, full of sand or of Coals burning; some have Horologies well dight and richly, and many other Instruments after their Sciences; and at a certain hour when they sée time, they say to men that stand before them, Make peace; and then say those men with a loud voice to all the Hall, Now he still a while, and then saith one of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, Each man make reverence, and incline to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, that is Gods Son, and Lord of the world, for now is time and hour: and then all men bow to him, and knéel on the Earth, and then the Philosopher biddeth them rise up again; and at another hour, another Philosopher biddeth them put their finger in their Ears, and they do so; and at another hour another Philosopher biddeth that all men shall lay their hands on their Heads, and they do so; and then he biddeth them take them away, and they do so: and thus from hour to hour they bid divers things. And I asked privately what it should mean, and one of the Masters said, that the bowing &amp; the knéeling on the Earth at that time hath this token, that all those men that knéeled so, shall evermore be true to the Emperor, that for no gift nor threatning they shall never be Traytors nor false to him; and the putting of the finger in the Ear hath this token, that none of those shall hear any ill spoken of the Emperor, or his Council. And ye shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that men bring nothing, as cloaths, bread, drink, nor no such things to the Emperor, but at certain hours that the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers tell; and if any man raise War against the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror in what Country soever it be, these Philosophers know it soon, and tell the Emperor, or his Council, and he sendeth men thither, for he hath many men.

And when they have done their Penance, they shall pass through a fire or two, to make them clean of their sins: when they have eaten they wipe their hands upon their skirts, for they have no Table-cloaths, except it be very great Lords: and when they have all eaten, they put their dishes or plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not washed, into a Pot or Cauldren with the flesh that is left when they have eaten, until they will eat another time: and rich men drink Milk of Mares, Asses, or other beasts, and other Beverage, that is made of Milk and Water together, for they have neither Beer nor Wine. And when they go to War they War full wisely, and each man of them beareth two or thrée Bows, and many Arrows, and a great Hatchet: Gentlemen have short Swords, and he that sleeth in Battel they slay him, and they are ever in purpose to bring all the land in subiection to them; for they say, it is Prophesied that they shall overcome by shot of Archers, and that they shall turn men to their Law, but they wot not what men they shall be: and it is great peril to pursue the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians when they flée, for they will shoot behind and slay men, as well as before: and they have small eyes as little Birds, and they are commonly false, for they hold not their promise. And when a man shall die among them, they strike a Spear in the earth beside him; and when he draweth to the death, they go out of the House till he be dead, then they put him into the Earth in the Field.</p>

               <p>NOw have I said and spoken of many things on this side of the great Kingdom of Cathay, of whom many are obeysant to the great <hi>Caane.</hi> Now I shall tell of some land, countries, and Isles that are beyond the land of Cathay: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so goeth from Cathay to Inde the High and the Low, he shall go through a Kingdom that men call Cadissen, and it is a great land: there groweth a manner of Fruit as it were Gourds, and when it is ripe, men cut it asunder, and they find therein a Beast as it were of flesh, bone; and bloud, as it were a little Lamb without wooll, and men eat the beast and Fruit also, and sure it seemeth very strange. Nevertheless, I said to them, that I held that for no marvel, for I said that in my country are Trees that bear Fruit that become Birds flying and they are good to eat, and that that falleth on the water liveth, and that that falleth on the earth dieth; and they marvelled much thereat. In this land, and many other
<pb facs="tcp:56519:61"/>
thereabout are Trees that bear Cloves, and Nutmegs, and Mace, and many other Spices; and there be Vines that bear so great Grapes that a strong man shall have enough to bear a Cluster of Grapes. In that same Land are the Hills of Caspy that men call Vber, and inclosed within these Hills are the Iews of the. x. kinds, that men call <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and they may come out on no side. There were inclosed xxii. Kings, with their Folk that dwelled between the Hills of Syche: and King <hi>Alexander</hi> chased them thither among those Hills, for he trusted to have inclosed them there, through the working men, but he might not; and when he saw be might not; he prayed to God that he would fulfill that which <figure/> he had begun: God heard his Prayer, and inclosed the Hills all about them but at one side, and there is the sea of Caspy. Here some men might ask, if there be a sea on one side, why go they not out there? thereto answer I, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be called a sea, it is not a sea, but a Pool standing among Hills, and it is tho greatest Pool of all the world; and though they go over that pool, yet they wot not where to
<pb facs="tcp:56519:62"/>
arrive, for they can speak no speech but their own: and ye shall understand that those Iews which dwell among the Hills have no Law among them, and yet they pay tribute for these land to the Kings of Armony: and sometime it is so, that some of those Iews go over the Hills, but many may not pass there together, for the Hills are so great and high. Nevertheless, men say in that country thereby, that in the time of Antichrist they shall do much harm to Christian men, and therefore all the Iews that dwell in divers parts of the World learn for to speak Hebrew, for they hope that these Iews, that dwell among the Hills aforesaid shall come out of the Hills, and speak all Hebrew, and nothing else, and then shall these Iews speak Hebrew to them, and lead them into Christendom for to destroy Christian men. For these Iews say they know, by their Prophesies, that those Iews that are among those Hills of Caspy, shall come out, and Christian men shall be in their subjection, as they be under Christian men now. And if ye will know how they shall find the Passage out, as I have understood I shall tell you. In the time of Antichrist, a Fox shall make his Den in the same place where King <hi>Alexander</hi> did make his Gates, and he shall dig in the earth so long till he pierceit through, and come among the Iews; and when they see the Fox, thry shall have great marvels of him for they never saw such a Beast, but other Beasts they have among them many: and they shall chase this Fox and pursue him until that he be fled again into his Hole that he come from, and then shall they dig after him until they come to the Gates that <hi>Alexander</hi> did make of great Stones well laid with Morter; then shall they break those Gates, and they shall find the way forth.</p>

               <p>FRom this land of Badile men go in many days journey to the land of <hi>Prester John,</hi> that is a great Emperor of Inde, and men call his land the Isle of Pantrore. This Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Prester John</hi> holdeth a great land and many good Cities and good Towns. In this Kingdom are many good Isles and large; for the land of Inde is parted into Isles, because of great Rivers that come out of Paradise: and also in the sea are many great Isles. The best City that is the Isle of Pantrore is called Nile, that is a noble City end a rich. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster John</hi> hath under him many Kings, and divers Lords, and his land is good and rich: but not so rich as the land of the great <hi>Caane,</hi> for Merchants come not so much thither as they do into the land of the great <hi>Caane,</hi> for it is too long a journey. And also they find in that Isle of Cathay all things that they have need of, as Spicerie, Cloth of Gold, and other Riches: and although they might have better cheap in the land of <hi>Prester John</hi> then in the land of Cathay, and more fine, nevertheless they will not go thither by reason of the length of the journey, and great perils on sea: for there are many places in the sea where are many Rocks of a Stone that is called Adamant, the which of his own kind draweth to him all manner of Iron; and therefore there may be no
<pb facs="tcp:56519:63"/>
Ships that have iron nails pass, but it draweth them to it, and therefore they dare not go into that country with Ships for fear of the Adamant; I went once into that sea, and saw as it had been a great Isle of trees, stocks, and branches growing; and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Shipmen told me that those were great ships that above there through the vertue of the Adamants: and of things that were in the ships whereof those Trees sprung and wared; and such Rocks are there many in divers places of the Sea; and therefore dare there no shipmen pass that way. And another thing also is, that they fear the long way; and therefore they go most to Cathay, and that is nearer unto them. And yet it is not so near, but that from Venice or Gene by sea to Cathay is xi. or xii. months jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The land of <hi>Prester John</hi> is long, and Merchants pass thither through the land of Persia, and come into a City that men call Hermes, for a Philospher that was called <hi>Hermes,</hi> founded it; and then pass an arm of the sea and come to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother City that men call Saboth, and there find they all Merchandises, and Popinjayes as great plenty as Larks in our country: In this country is little Wheat or Barley, and therefore they eat Rice, Milk, and Cheese, and other fruits. This Emperor <hi>Prester John</hi> wedded commonly the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the great <hi>Caane,</hi> and the great <hi>Caane</hi> his Daughter. In the land of <hi>Prester John</hi> is many strange things, and many precious stones so great and so large, that they make of them Vessels, Platters, and Cups, and many other things, of which it were too long to tell: but some what of his Law and of his Faith I shall tell you.</p>

And he hath under him 72 Provinces and countries, and in each one is a King,
<pb facs="tcp:56519:63"/>
and those Kings have other Kings under them. And in this land are many marvels; for in this land is a gravelly sea that is of sand and gravel, and no drop of water, and it ebbeth and fleweth with very great waves as another sea doth, and it is never standing still, and never in rest; and no man can pass to the land beyond it. And although there be no water in the Sea, yet men may find therein very good Fish, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fashion and shape then are in any other sea, and also they are of a very good taste, and sweet, and good to eat. And three daies journey from that Sea, are many great Hills, through which runneth a great Floud that cometh from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, and it is full of precious stones, and no drop of water, and it runneth with great Waves into the gravelly sea: and this floud runneth three daies in the week so fast, that it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth great stones of the Rock with it that make such noise, and as soon as they come into the gravel sea they are no more seen: and in those three daies, when it runneth thus no man dare come in it; but the other daies men go therein when they will. And so beyond that floud toward the Wilderness is a great Plain among Hills all sandy and gravelly, and in that plain grow trees, that at the rising of the Sun each day, begin to grow, and so grow they till-midday; and bear fruit: but no man dare eat of that fruit, for it is a manner of Ir<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THen is there another Isle that is called Synople wherein also are good people and true, and full of good Faith and they are much like in their living to the men beforesaid, and they go all naked. Into that Island came King <hi>Alexander,</hi> and when he saw their good Faith and Truth, and their good Belief, he said he would do them no harm, and bid them ask of him Riches, or any thing else, and they should have it. And they answered, that they had Riches enough when they have meat and drink to sustain their bodies; and they said also, That Riches of this world is nought worth; but if it were so that he might grant them, that they should never die, that would they pray him. And <hi>Alexander</hi> said That might he not do, for he was mortal, and should die as they should. Then said they, Why art thou so proud, and wouldest win all the world, and have it in subjection, as it were a God, and hast no term of thy life, and thou will have all Riches of the World, the which shall forsake thee, or thou forsake them, and thou shalt bear nothing with thee, but it shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to others, but as thou wert born naked, so shalt thou be done in Earth? And <hi>Alexander</hi> was greatly astonished at this speech. And though it be so that they have not the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our. Faith, nevertheless I believe that God liketh their service as he did of <hi>Job,</hi> that was a Painim, the which he held for his true servant and many other. I believe verily that God loveth all those that love him, and serve him meekly and truly, and that despise the vain glory of the World as these men do, and <hi>Job</hi> did: and therefore said our Lord, through the mouth of the holy Prophet <hi>Esay, Ponam eis mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplices leges meas,</hi> that is to say, I shall put Laws to them in many manners: And the Gospel faith thus, <hi>Alias oves habeo, quae non sunt ex hoc ovili</hi>; that is I have other sheep that are not of this fold: and thereto accordeth the Vision that S. <hi>Peter</hi> saw at Ioppa, how the Angel came from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and brought with him all manner of Beasts, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,

               <p>ALso in an Isle of <hi>Prester Johns</hi> land, called Miscorach, there was a man that was called <hi>Catolonapes,</hi> he was rich, and had a fair Castle on a Hill, and strong, and he made a Wall about the Hill, very strong, and fair; within he had a fair Garden, wherein were many Trées bearing all manner of Fruits that he might find, and he had planted therein all manner of Herbs of good smell, and they bear Flowers, and there were many fair Wells; and
<pb facs="tcp:56519:65"/>
by them was made many Halls and Chambers, well deckt with Gold and Azure, and he had made there divers Stories of Beasts and Birds that song and tuned by Engine or Dr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, as they had béen quick: and he had in his Garden all things that might be to mans solace and Comfort: He had also in that Garden Maidens of the age of fiftéen years, the fairest that he might find and men-children of the same age, and they were clothed with Cloth of Gold, and he said that they were Angels, and he caused to be made certain Hills, and enclosed them about with precious Stones of Iasper and Chrystal, and with Gold and Pearl, and other manner of Stones; and he made a conduit under the earth, so that when he would, the Wells ran sometime with Milk, sometime with Wine, and sometime Honey; and this place he called Paradise; and when any young Batchelor of the country, Knight or Squire, cometh to him for solace or sport, he lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them into his Paradise, and sheweth them these things, as the Songs of Birds, and his Damosels, and Wells: and he did strike divers Instruments of Musick in a high Tower that might be heard, and said, they were Angels of God, and that place was Paradise, that God had granted to those that believed, when he saith thus, <hi>Dabo vobis terram fluentem lacte &amp; melle</hi>; that is, I will give you a land flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Milk and Honey: And then this man did make these men drink a manner of drink by which they were drunken; and he said to them, If they would die for his sake, when they were dead, they should come to his Paradise, and they should be of the age of those Maidens, and should dwell alway with them, and he would put them in a fairer Paradise, where they should sée God in his joy, and in his Majesty: and when they granted to do that he would, then he had them go and slay such a Lord, or a man of the country that he was wroth with, and that they should have no fear of any man; and if they were slain themselves for his sake, he would put them into his Paradise, when they were dead: And so went those Batchelors to slay great Lords of the country, and were slain themselves, in hope to have that Paradise; and thus was he avenged of his enemies through his deceit:
<pb facs="tcp:56519:65"/>
And when rich men of the country perceived his cautel and malice, and the will of this <hi>Catolonapes,</hi> they gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together, and assailed the Castle, and slew him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed all his goods, and his fair places, and riches that were in his Paradise; and the place of the Wells are there yet, and some other things, but the riches are gone: and it is not long agone since it was destroyed.</p>

               <p>ANd a little from this place, on the left side, beside the River of Pison, is a great marvell: There is a Valley betwéen two Hills, and that is four mile long, and some men call it the Valley Enchanted, some the Valley of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, some the Valley perilous: and in that Valley are many Tempests, and a great noise very hideous both day and night, and a sound as it were a noise of Labours and Trumpets, as it were at a great Feast. This Valley is full of Divels, and hath béen always, and men say there is an entry to Hell.</p>
               <p>In this Valley is much Gold and Silver, whereof many Christian men, and other, go thither for desire of that Gold and Silver, but few of them come out again, for they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non strangled with Divels: And in the middest of that Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, on a Rock, is a Visage, and the head of a Fiend bodily, very hideous and dreadful to sée, and there is nothing séen but the head and the shoulders, but there is no Christian man or other in the world so hardy, but that he would be greatly afraid to behold it; for he beholdeth each man so sharply, and his eyes are so stairing, and sparkling as fire, and he changeth so often his countenance, that no man dare come near for all the World: and out of his Nose conteth great plenty of fire of divers colours; and sometime is the fire so stinking, that no man may suffer it; but alway a good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man, and one that is stedfast in the Faith, may go thereto without harm, if they call to God only, for forgiveness of
<pb facs="tcp:56519:66"/>
their sins, then shall the Devils have no power over them. And ye shall understand that when my Fellows and I were in that Valley, we had very great doubt if we should put our Bodies in a venture to go through it, and some of my Fellows agréed thereunto, and some would not; and there were in our campany two fryers minours of Lumbardy, who said, If any of us would go in, they would also: As they had said so, upon trust of them, we said that we would go, and we did make our Prayers to God for our safeguard, and so we went in 14 men, and when we came out we were but 10; and we wist not whether those four was lost there or whether they turned again, but we saw them no more: other of our company who would not go in with us, went about another way for to be before us, and so they were, but we went through the Valley, and saw there many strange things, as Gold, Silver, precious Stones, and Iewels, great plenty as we thought, whether they were so or no I know not, for Devils are so subtil and false, that they make many times a thing to séem that it is not, for to deceive men; and therefore I would touch nothing for fear of enemies that I saw there, in many likenesses, some of dead bodies, that I saw lie in the Valley, but I dare not say that they were all bodies, but they were bodily shapes through making of Devils; and we were often thrown down to the earth by wind, thunder, and tempest, but God helped us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and so passed we through that Valley without peril or harm, thanks be to God.</p>

               <p>ANd beyond that Valley is a great Isle, where be people as great as Gyants, of 28 foot long, and they have no clothing but Beasts Skins that hang on them, and they eat no bread, but raw flesh, and they drink Milk, and they have no Houses, and they gladlier eat mens flesh than other: And
<pb facs="tcp:56519:66"/>

               <p>Another Isle there is Northward, where are many evil and foul Women, but they have precious stones in their eyes, and they have such force, that if they behold any man with wrath they slay them with beholding, as the Basilisk doth.

In this Isle they Elect their Kings by voices; and they chuse him not for his riches, and nobleness, but him that is of good conditions, and most righteous and true, that judgeth every man truly, little and much, after their trespass; and the King may judge no man to death, without counsel of his Barons and that they all assent. And if it be so that their King do a great trespass, as slay a man, or such like, he shall die also, but he shall not be slain, but they charge and command that no man be so hardy to keep him company, nor to speak to him, nor give him meat nor drink; and thus he dieth: for they spare no man that hath done a trespass for Love, Lordship, Riches, or Nobleness, but they do him right after he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:56519:69"/>
some of Gold and precious Stones, and the Pillars that bear the Table are of such Stones also; and the Stairs on the which the Emperor goeth up to his Table where he sitteth at meat, one is of Mastick, another of Chrystal, and another of gréen Iaspy, another of Diasper, another of Sardin, another of Cornelin, another of Senton, and that he setteth his foot upon is of Chrisolites; and all those Stairs are bordered with fine Gold, and well set with great Pearls and other precious Stones; and the sides of his Table are Emeraulds, bordered with Gold and with precious Stones: the Pillars in his Chamber are of fine Gold, with many Carbuncles and other such Stones that give great light in the night: and though the Carbuncles give great light, nevertheless there burneth xii. great Vessels of Chrystall full of Balm, to give good smell, and to drive away evil Air. The frame of his Bed is all Saphire, well bound with Gold, to make him sléep well, and for to destroy Lechery, for he will not lye by his Wives but thrice a year, after the seasons, and that only for getting of Children.

               <p>This Paradise Terrestre, is inclosed all about with a Wall, and that Wall is all covered with Mosse, as it seemeth, that men may see no stone nor nothing else whereof it is; and in the highest place of Paradise in the middest of it is a Well, that casteth out the four Flouds that run through divers lands. The first floud is called Pison or Ganges, and that runneth through Iude; in that River are many precious Stones, and much <hi>Lignum Aloes,</hi> and gravel of Gold. Another is called Nilus or Giron, and that runneth through Ethiope and Egypt. The third is called Tygrée, and that runneth through Assyria and Armony the great. And the fourth is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Euphrates, that runneth through Armony the less, and Persia: and men say, that the swéet and fresh waters of the World take their springing of them. The first River is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Pison, that is to say, gathering of many Rivers together and falling into one; and some call it Ganges, of a king that was in Iude, that men call <hi>Gangeras,</hi> for it runneth through his land: and this River is in some places clean, in some. places troubled; in some places hot, in some places cold. The second River is called Nilus or Giron, for it is ever trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; for Giron is to say, trouble. The third River is called Tygrée, that is to say fast running, for it runneth faster then any of the other, named so of a Beast that men call Tygris, for he runneth fast. The fourth River is called Euphrates, that is to say, well bearing, for there groweth many good things upon that River. And ye shall understand that no man living may go upon that Paradise, for by land he may not go for wild Beasts that are in the Wildernesse, and for Hills and Rocks which no man may pass: Neither by those Rivers may any man pass, for they come with so great a course, and so great waves, that no Ship may sail against them. Many great Lords have assayed many times to go by these Rivers into Paradise, but they might not speed in their way; for some died for weariness in rowing, some were blind, and some
<pb facs="tcp:56519:71"/>
deaf with noise of the waters; so no man may pass there but through special grace of God. I can tell you no more of that place which I may speak of upon mine own sight.</p>

               <p>THese Isles of the land of <hi>Prester John,</hi> they are under the Earth to us, and they lie foot against foot to England, and other Isles there are whoso would pursue them, for to compass the Earth having the Grace of God to help the way, he might come right to the same countries that he were come of, and come from, and go about the earth; but for that it, asketh so long time, and also there are so many perils to pass, that few men assay to go so, and yet it might be done, for men come from those Isles to other Isles, coasting on the Lordship of <hi>Prester John,</hi> which men call Cassay, and that country is near ix. days journey long, and more than fifty of breadth; and this Cassay is the best land that is in those countries, save Cathay: and if Merchants came thither as commonly as they do to Cathay, it would be better than in Cathay: for it is so thick of Cities and Towns, that when a man goeth out of a city, he séeth another at each side: there is good plenty of Spices and other goods: the king of this Isle is rich and mighty, and he holdeth his land of the great <hi>Caane</hi> for that is one of the twelve Princes that the great <hi>Caane,</hi> hath under him, beside his own land.</p>

               <p>FRom this Isle men go to another Kingdom, that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Ryboth, and that is also under the great <hi>Caane.</hi> This is a good country, and plenteous of Corn, Wine, and other things: men of this land have no houses, but they dwell in Tents made of Trées: and the prineipall city of the Country is all black made of black stones, and white; and all the
<pb facs="tcp:56519:72"/>
Streets are paved with such stones, and in the city is no man so hardy to spill blood of man nor beast, for worship of an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage that is worshipped there. In that city dwelleth the Pope of their Law, and they call him <hi>Lopasse</hi>; he giveth all Dignities and Benefices that fall to the Image: And men of Religion, and men that have Church-livings in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are obedient to him, as men here to the king. They have a custom in this country, that when a mans Father is dead, whom they will do worship unto, they send after all his Friends, religious Priests, and many other, and they bear the body to an Hill with great joy and mirth, and when it is there, the greatest Prelate smiteth off his head, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it upon a great place of Gold or Silver, and giveth it to his son, and the son taketh it and giveth it to other of his friends, singing and saying many Orisons; and then the Priests and the religious men cut the flesh off the body in pieces, and say Orisons, and the Birds of the country come thither, for they know well the custom, and they flye about them as the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles and other Birds that eat flesh, and the Priests cast the pieces unto them, and they bear it away a little from thence, and then they eat it: and as the Priests were wont to sing for souls, <hi>Subvenite sancti Dei,</hi> so those Priests there sing, with high voice in their Language, in this manner wise, Sée and behold how good and gracious a man this was, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God come for to fetch him, and bear him into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise. And then thinketh the Son of his Father that he is greatly worshipped when birds have eaten him: and when there are most plenty of birds there is most worship. And then cometh the son home with all his friends, and maketh them a great feast; then maketh he clean his fathers Scalp, and giveth them drink therein; and the flesh of his fathers head he cutteth off, and giveth it to his most special friends, some a little, and some a little, for dainty. And in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this holy man that the Birds have eaten, the son kéepeth his Scalp for a Cup, and therein drinketh he all his life, in remembrance of his father.</p>

               <p>ANd from this place men go ten dayes journy through the land of the great <hi>Caane,</hi> which is a very good Isle and a great Kingdom, and the King is very mighty. And in this Isle is a rich man, which is neither King, Prince, Duke, nor Earl, but he hath each year four thousand Horses, charged with Rice and Corn and he liveth Nobly and richly after the manner of the country, for he hath fifty Damesels that serve him every day at his meat and bed, and do what he will. And when he sitteth at the Table they bring him meat, and at each time five Messes together; and they sing in the bringing in a Song, and they cut his meat and put it into his mouth: and he hath very long Nails on his hands, for that is great Nobility in that country, and therefore they let their Nails grow as long as they may: and some let them grow so long that they come about their hands, and that is great Honour and gentry: and the gentry of a woman is to have small feet, and therefore so soon as they are born, they bind their feet so straight, that they cannot wax half as they should. And he hath a very fair Palace and rich, where he dwelleth, of which the Wall is two mile about, and therein is many fair Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and all the Pavements of the Hall and Chambers is of Gold and Silver, and in the midest of one of his Gardens is a little Hill whereon is a place made with Towers and Pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles all of Gold, and there he will sit often to take the air and disport, for it is made for nothing else. From this Land men may go to the Land of <hi>Caane.</hi>

But they cannot speak perfectly, but as their natural wit teacheth them, net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Son nor of the holy Ghost; but they can well speak of the Bible, and especially of Genesis, and the Books of <hi>Moses.</hi> And they say, that those Creatures which they worship are no Gods, but they worship them for the great vertue that is in them, which may not be without the special grace of God: and of Simulacres and Idols, they say that all men have Simulacres, whereby they mean the papists, who have Images of our Lady and others, but they think that they worship the Images of Stone and of Wood, and not the Saints whom they do represent; for as the Letter teacheth Clerks how they shall believe, so Images and Pictures teach Lay-men: they say also that the Angel of God speaketh to them in their Idols, and doth Miracles, and they say thus: but it is the evil Angel that doth Miracles to maintain them in their Idolatry.</p>
