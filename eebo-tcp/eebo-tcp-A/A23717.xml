         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all endeavors of persuasion, the credit of the
Speaker being of as great moment as the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
truth and evidence of what is spoke, it
will be reasonable that there should go along
with this large collection of Sermons, some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Person who was the Author of
them; for if it be made out, that they came from one of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and knowledge, who neither would deceive others, nor was
likely to be deceiv'd himself; one who practic'd what he taught,
and preacht to his own soul what he deliver'd to his Auditory,
his discourses must carry with them a proportionable weight and
value. That this narrative may be the more satisfactory, by
being entire and particular, it shall take the Author from his
infancy, and bring him to his grave, without the vain addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of flattery and ostentation, which he abhorr'd while alive,
and therefore needs not being dead.</p>
            <p>He was the Son of <hi>Robert Allestree,</hi> a Gentleman of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
family in <hi>Darbyshire,</hi> who being decai'd in his fortune by
the profuseness of his Predecessors, retain'd unto S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Richard
Newport,</hi> afterward created Lord <hi>Newport</hi> Baron of high
<hi>Arcol,</hi> in the quality of his Steward; and being married,
settled himself at <hi>Uppington</hi> near the <hi>Wreken</hi> in <hi>Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
where <hi>Richard Allestree,</hi> the person of whom we write,
was born, in March An. 1619. He being grown up to be capable of
institution, was sent to a neighbouring country free Schole, and
from thence to another somewhat more celebrated, at <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi>
where he remain'd till he became fit for the Vniversity.
In the year 1636 he was brought to <hi>Oxford</hi> by his Father, and
plac'd a Commoner in <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> having for his Tutor
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Richard Busby,</hi> who since is D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Busby</hi> the eminent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of <hi>Westminster</hi> Schole, and Prebend of that Church. Six
moneths after his settlement in the Vniversity, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Samuel Fell</hi>
the Dean observing his parts and industry, made him Student
<pb facs="tcp:40114:3"/>
of the College, which title he really answer'd by great and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
application to study, wherein he made remarkable emprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
as a testimony and encouragement of which, so soon as
he had taken the degree of Batchelor of Arts, he was chose
Moderator in Philosophy, and had the emploiment renew'd year
by year, till the disturbances of the Kingdom interrupted the
studies and repose of the Vniversity, putting them into Arms.</p>
            <p>His Majesty in the year 1641 being by tumults driven from
<hi>London,</hi> and issuing out his Commission of Aray into the
several parts of the Nation, did also direct it to the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where it found an active and a ready obedience,
as by the generality of the members of that place, so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree,</hi> who engag'd in the service, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in it till S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>John Biron,</hi> afterwards the Lord <hi>Biron,</hi>
(who was sent with a party of horse to support and countenance
the Scholars in arms there,) withdrew from thence; He after a
short stay was call'd off to join with Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and by the
assistance of the loial Gentlemen of <hi>Worcestershire</hi> was receiv'd
into that City, where he was prest by the Rebels forces; but
the Prince came up seasonably to reinforce him, and thereupon
follow'd the sharp fight in <hi>Poyick</hi> field near the aforesaid City,
the unexpected success of which gave great consternation to the
Rebels, who being Masters of the Mony, Forts and Magazeens of
the Kingdom, hop'd to have carried all without a stroke. As
many of the Scholars as could furnish themselves for a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
march, went along with S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>John Biron</hi> from <hi>Oxford;</hi>
the others, among whom was M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree,</hi> staied behind, and
return'd to their Gowns and Studies.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, the Lord <hi>Say</hi> with a party of the Rebels
forces drew into <hi>Oxford,</hi> and plunder'd the Colleges of such
plate as had not bin before sent to his Majesty, making en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
after those who had bin forward to promote the King's ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
on which occasion, and also a particular accident that
then happen'd, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> was call'd in question. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
was this: at <hi>Christ-Church</hi> some of the Rebels attemted
to break into the Treasury, and after a daies labor forced a
passage into it; but met with nothing, except a single groat
and a halter in the bottom of a large iron chest: enrag'd with
that disappointment, they went to the Deanery, where having
ransackt what they thought fit, they put it altogether in a
chamber, lockt it up, and retir'd to their quarters, intending
<pb facs="tcp:40114:3"/>
the next morning to return and dispose of their prize. But
when they came, they found themselves defeated, and every
thing remov'd to their hand. Vpon examination it was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> had a key of the Lodgings, the Dean
and his family being withdrawn, and that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi>'s key
had bin made use of in this enterprize: hereupon he was seiz'd,
and notwithstanding all the defence he could make, had bin se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
handled, but that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> call'd away the
forces on the suddain, and so redeem'd him from their fury.</p>
            <p>In October following, the King having strengthned himself at
<hi>Shrewsbury</hi> with the supplies that came from the <hi>North,</hi> and
<hi>Wales,</hi> and the Loial Gentlemen of other parts of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
began his march towards <hi>London,</hi> and was met by the
army of the Rebels, commanded by the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> in <hi>Kein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
field in <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> where both armies engag'd: at
this battail M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> was present; after which, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that the King design'd immediatly to march to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
and make his Court at the accustomed place, the Deane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
at <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> which was in part left to his care in
the absence of the Dean, hasting thither he was taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
by a party from <hi>Broughton</hi> house, which was garrison'd
by the Lord <hi>Say</hi> for the Parliament. His confinement here was
very short, the Garrison surrendring it self to the King's forces,
who summon'd it in their passage.</p>
            <p>The war being now form'd, and the King being return'd from
the fight at <hi>Brainford,</hi> having made <hi>Oxford</hi> his head quarter,
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> settled himself again to his study, and in the next
Spring took his degree of Master of Arts; after which he was in
great hazard of his life, being seiz'd by the pestilential disease
which rag'd in the Garrison, and which was fatal to very many
eminent men of all emploiments and conditions; and fell more
severely upon him by reason of a relapse, which doubled the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
and danger.</p>
            <p>Having recover'd a little strength, he was engag'd to
employ it in military service, the exigence of his Majesties
affairs calling for the aid of all his Loial Subjects, and in
particular the Scholars: and accordingly a Regiment of them
was rais'd, who serv'd as Voluntiers without any pay or reward,
and perform'd all duties not only in the Garrison, and sallies
for the defence of it in case of attacques and sieges; but
were also commanded upon parties abroad, and endur'd the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue
<pb facs="tcp:40114:4"/>
of marches, and ill treatment of mean quarters, differing
in nothing from the poor mercenary Soldier, besides their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
and justice to the country people while they staid with
them, and paying them at departure: things so unusual,
that when at their going off from quarters they offer'd their
Landlords mony, they imagin'd it don in jest and abuse, and
at last by finding it left with them, were convinc'd that it was
don in earnest. In this Regiment M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree,</hi> tho a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Arts and fellow of the College, thought it no disgrace
to carry a musket, and perform all duties of a common Soldier,
forward upon all occasions to put himself into action. And in
this service he continued till the unhappy end of the war,
gaining still what time was left from military duties, to the
prosecution of his studies: nay joining both together, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
holding his musket in one hand and book in the other, and
making the watchings of a Soldier the lucubrations of a
Student.</p>
            <p>But then when carnal weapons prov'd frustrate, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence call'd his servants to the more Christian exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of praiers and tears for the defence of the King and the
Church, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> wholy betook himself to these, and put
himself into that warfare, to which his former education had
design'd him: entring into Holy Orders, at a time when there
was no prospect of temporal advantage; and his being in the
service of God threatned no less danger, than his having bin
in the service of his Prince.</p>
            <p>In that little interval of safety, which the Articles of
<hi>Oxford</hi> gave, and was for some time continued, while the two
factions of the Rebels were in contest who should divide the spoil
of the Nation, and enjoy <hi>the price of bloud;</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> with
great sedulity addicted himself unto his studies, and became a
Tutor of many young Gentlemen and other Students; which
trust he discharg'd with great sufficiency, as he did also the office
of Censor in the College: moreover he bore a part in the signal
test of the Loialty of the Vniversity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> possibly the
greatest that has bin given by any society of men; I mean the
passing of the solemn Decree and Judgement of theirs against the
Covenant and Rebellion enflamed and fomented by it, perform'd
in Convocation, when the City was held by a Garrison of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
whose swords were at the throats of those Confessors, and
yet the decree was carried by a most unanimous suffrage of the
<pb facs="tcp:40114:4"/>
whole body, there being but one dissenter in that numerous Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and he a person who had absented himself from the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
during the war, and taken part with the Rebels.</p>
            <p>Soon after which great performance, the Visitors of the pretended
Parliament being at last come with a second Commission to <hi>kill
and take possession,</hi> having lost their first by outstaying in a
long praier and sermon the time assign'd for the opening of it,
began their enquiry, and did it not as one would have expected
from men of Zeal and Godliness, with an inspection into vice
and immorality, but set their whole affair upon the short issue
of submitting to the Authority of the pretended Parliament;
and they who could prostitute their allegeance to their Prince,
and oaths to the Vniversity, and their local Visitors, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the lust of these Vsurpers, tho never so flagitious, were
immediatly receiv'd to favor: all others, however meriting,
were without farther regard proscrib'd, the method whereof
was, to write the names of as many as they thought fit to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
at once in paper, and affix it upon the door of St. <hi>Maries</hi>
Church, wherein 'twas signified, that the persons there nam'd
were by the Authority of the Visitors banisht the Vniversity,
and requir'd to depart the precincts thereof within three daies,
upon pain of being taken for spies of war, and accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
against. By which practice often repeted, the men
of greatest hopes and merit in the Vniversity were spoil'd
of all things, and not suffer'd to breath the common air; so
that within the compass of few weeks an almost general rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
was made of the loial Vniversity of <hi>Oxford;</hi> in whose
room succeeded an illiterate rabble, swept up from the plough
tail, from shops and grammar Scholes, and the dregs of
the neighbor Vniversity. Tho in that scandalous number,
some few there were, who notwithstanding they had parts and
learning, were prefer'd upon the account of their Relations;
who merited a better title to the places they possest, and have
since prov'd useful men in the Church and State. Those of
the ancient stock who were spar'd upon this trial, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
cast off upon the second test of the engagement, till
in the end there were left very few legitimate members in any
of the Colleges.</p>
            <p>In this diffusive ruin M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> had an early share, being
proscrib'd about the middle of July in the year 1648. And tho
he had the care of several persons of quality his Pupils, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<pb facs="tcp:40114:5"/>
of his own and theirs to make up; he with difficulty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
from the Governor of the town Lieut. Coll. <hi>Kelsey</hi> a little
respit, for his settling his affairs, and doing justice to those for
whom he was concern'd; the Visitors utterly refusing his request,
for this reason, as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rogers,</hi> one of their number was pleas'd
to word it, <hi>because he was an eminent man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> being thus driven from <hi>Oxford,</hi> retir'd into
<hi>Shropshire,</hi> and was entertain'd as Chaplain to the Honorable
<hi>Francis Newport</hi> Esquire, now Viscount <hi>Newport,</hi> where he
continu'd till such time as <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Newport</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
died in <hi>France,</hi> whither he had some time before retir'd
to avoid the insolence of the conquering Rebels. On this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> was sent over to clear accounts, and see
if any thing could be preserv'd from the inhospitable pretence
of the <hi>droit d'Aubeine,</hi> which pillages those Strangers who
happen to die in the <hi>French</hi> Dominions. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> having
dispatcht this affair with good success, came back to his emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and continued in it till his Majesties march into <hi>England</hi>
with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, and his miraculous escape at <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi>
at which time the Managers of the King's affairs want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an intelligent and faithful person to send over to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
desir'd M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> to undertake the journey, which
accordingly he did, and having attended the King at <hi>Roan</hi>
and receiv'd his dispatches, he came back into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At his return he found his friends M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dolben</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fell,</hi>
the present Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> and Bishop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who had
likewise bin banisht the Vniversity, adventuring to sojourn pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly
there, and serve the uses of those who adher'd to the Church
of <hi>England</hi> in performing Religious offices according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Church; whereupon he join'd himself to their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and continued with them till such time as S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Antony
Cope</hi> a loial young Gentleman of considerable quality and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in the County of <hi>Oxford,</hi> prevail'd upon him to live in
his family; which he did for several years, having liberty to
go or stay as his occasions requir'd, whereby he was enabled to
step aside without notice upon messages from the King's friends;
which service he manag'd with great courage and dexterity.</p>
            <p>After several difficult journies succesfully perform'd, in the
Winter before his Majesties happy restauration he was sent over
into <hi>Flanders,</hi> from whence returning with letters, he upon
his landing at <hi>Dover,</hi> was seiz'd by a party of Soldiers, who
<pb facs="tcp:40114:5"/>
waited for him. The Rebel's Spie, who was emploied by them
in his Majestie's Court, having given notice of his dispatch;
and describ'd particularly his person and his habit. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this diligence of the Rebels, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> had so
much presence of mind, to secure his letters, and shift them into
a faithful hand, who took care of them.</p>
            <p>The Soldiers according to their orders guarded him to
<hi>London,</hi> where he was examin'd by a Committee of the
Council of Safety, and charg'd with having correspondence
with the King, and having brought letters from him, which
they backt with several circumstances of his journy, and
threats of utmost severity in case he should persist in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy,
and not confess the truth. But they not being able
by questions to entrap, nor menaces to fright M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi>
to betray either himself or others, he was sent Prisoner to <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
house, which was then made a goal for the King's friends,
where by ill usage he contracted a sickness which was like to
have cost him his life. After the durance of about six or eight
weeks, his friends made means for his enlargement, which was
the easier obtain'd, for that some of the Leaders of the Party,
seeing things move towards his Majestie's restoration, were
willing by kindnesses to recommend themselves in case of a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
among whom was the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> who
was us'd to value himself, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> owed his preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to him. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> having obtain'd liberty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> from whence after a short stay he went
into <hi>Shropshire</hi> to see his Relations; in his return from thence
designing in his way to visit his excellent friend D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hammond</hi>
at <hi>Westwood</hi> near <hi>Worcester,</hi> he at the gate met the body of
that great man carrying to his burial; which circumstance is
therefore mention'd, because that eminent Light of the <hi>English</hi>
Church, at his death gave this testimony not only of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree,</hi> but also of his esteem of his parts and
learning, that he left to him his Library of books as a Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
well knowing that in his hands they would be useful wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
for the defence of that cause he had during life so vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
asserted.</p>
            <p>The King being happily return'd, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> was soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
made Canon of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> where he cheerfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
to the attemt, which was set on foot there for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
of those decaies and ruins which had bin made by the
<pb facs="tcp:40114:6"/>
late Vsurpers; for however those Godly Robbers who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
that Church and College, suffer'd them both almost to
drop upon their heads, and without shame sawed down for firing
the timber work of the North side of the great Quadrangle:
the legitimate Children were concern'd first to cloth their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
nakedness, and not till that was provided for, consider
their own.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> at the same time undertook one of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of the City, thinking it might be a service to instil prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Loialty there after the contrary infusions of schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
rebel Teachers, which for so many years had bin the
Gospel of that place, discountenanc'd by none of the Parochial
Ministers, besides M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lamplugh</hi> the now Reverend Bishop of
<hi>Exeter,</hi> who had the courage and loialty there to own the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the worst of times. This
Lecture M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> continued for several years, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
any part of the Salary belonging to it, but ordering
that it should be distributed among the poor.</p>
            <p>While he emploied himself in popular preaching, he was also
call'd to the service of the Court being the King's Chaplain,
and also to the severer studies of Scholastical Learning, in his
exercise for the degree of Doctor, and Moderator-ship in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in the College; and soon after upon the vacancy of the
chair of that faculty, to the laborious emploiment of <hi>Regius
Professor</hi> in the Vniversity.</p>
            <p>In the year 1665 the Provost-ship of <hi>Eton</hi> falling void,
that honorable and beneficial emploiment was by his Majestie's
especial grace and favor conferr'd upon him, to the acceptance
whereof he was not without difficulty induc'd; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the consideration that a great interest was made by a Lay
man, who probably might succeed upon the advantage of his
refusal, notwithstanding that the Provost there be actually the
Parson of <hi>Eton</hi> Parish, and presented to the Cure, and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> the Diocesan, as all other
parish Priests are: so that as nothing could be more plainly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious
and irregular in it self, than such an usurpation by
a Lay person; so nothing could be a greater disservice to the
Church, than by an unseasonable modesty to make way for it.
Vpon these motives it was, that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> became Provost
of <hi>Eton;</hi> and for the same reason it was, that during his life
he continued so, never hearkning to any offer of preferment,
<pb facs="tcp:40114:6"/>
which might make a vacancy, and repete the former hazar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d.
And it may be truly said that this was the greatest secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
care that he carried with him into another world, it being
his dying request unto his friends, to interpose with his sacred
Majesty, that he might have a Successor lawfully capable, and
who would promote the welfare of the College.</p>
            <p>The Succession in the Chair he more timely secur'd, for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his health, and particularly his eie sight exceedingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
by the toil of that emploiment, he resign'd it in the year
1679, and had the satisfaction to be succeeded by his friend
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Jane,</hi> of whose abilities he had perfect knowledge.</p>
            <p>But diseases are not cur'd by the removal of the causes
which first occasion'd them, and tho by the use of mineral wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in the Summer season, and the taking of journies in the
Autumn, he for some time supported himself, the decay conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
and encreast upon him, till it was form'd into a Dropsy;
the prevalence of which was so great and suddain, that his
Physicians advis'd him by all means to come up to <hi>London,</hi>
where he might be neer their inspection and care; in compliance
with whose desires more than from an expectation of cure, he
went thither, and having taken a privat lodging, submitted
himself to the methods they propos'd: in the mean time setling
his litle temporal concerns; but was more intent upon his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
interests, employing those vacancies which his sickness
gave, in attending the offices of the Church constantly read to
him, and his private devotions; and when he saw his end ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching,
in receiving the great <hi>Viaticum</hi> of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
in reference whereto having desir'd those friends of his
who happen'd to be in Town to communicat with him, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Lord Archishop of <hi>York,</hi> the Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi>
the Lord Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> the Lord Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> the
Lord Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> the Reverend D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Busby,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fell</hi>
one of the Fellows of <hi>Eton</hi> who continued with him the whole
time of his sickness: he afterwards took his last leave of them
with great equanimity and constancy of mind, and waited for
the hour of his release.</p>
            <p>Having hitherto drawn together the series of actions and
emploiments which made up our Authors life, it will not be
amiss to set him in another light, and take a prospect of his
mind and personal qualifications. As to his bodily appearance
and outward features, as they are of less importance, so are
<pb facs="tcp:40114:7"/>
they in recent memory, and by sculpture and other delineations
are so generally known, that there will be no need they should
be exprest by words.</p>
            <p>His mind, that nobler part of him, was compos'd by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
indulgence of nature, those faculties which in
others use to be single, and are thought necessarily to be so, as
excluding each the other, were united in him. Memory, Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Judgement, Elocution, great Modesty and no less Assurance,
a comprehension of things, and fluency of words; an aptness
for the pleasant, and sufficiency for the rugged parts of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
a courage to encounter, and an industry to master all
things, make up the Character of his happy genius. Which
felicity of temper was seconded by the circumstances of the times
in which he liv'd, which engag'd him severally to exert and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
his faculties. Before the national calamity of the civil
war, he had secur'd the foundations of the whole circle of
learning, by his own indefatigable study, as also the indulgent
care of his Tutor D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Busby,</hi> than whom no person is more
happy in the Arts of transfusing his knowledge into others;
and the particular encouragement of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Fell</hi> the Dean, who
alwaies lookt upon him as a part of his family, and treated him
with the same concern as his own children.</p>
            <p>When the war broke out, he had the benefit of being, instead
of one, in several Vniversities; <hi>Oxford</hi> was then an Epitome
of the whole Nation, and all the business of it: there was here
the Court, the Garrison, the Flower of the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Lawyers and Divines of all <hi>England.</hi> And times of
action have somewhat peculiar in them to ferment and envigorat
the mind, which is enervated by the softness of peace. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous
times which succeeded, as they engag'd him to the
exercise of popular preaching, a talent which nothing besides
necessity and practice can cultivate; so they led him out into fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
parts, enter'd him into the managery of business of
greatest trust and hazard, and made him as well read in Men,
as in Books. After all this, it was no small advantage to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
by the King's happy restauration to the Vniversity, and
to the opportunities of reading and conversation with learned
men, and in that conspicuous Theater, to have the obligation
of a public emploiment to exert all his faculties, and with ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
endeavor to emprove and communicate his knowledge. And
we may say it without envy, that few of his time had either a
<pb facs="tcp:40114:7"/>
greater compass, or a deeper insight into all the parts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the modern and learned Languages, Rhetoric, Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
Mathematics, History, Antiquity, Moral and Polemical
Divinity, all which was not to be pumpt up, or ransackt out
of common place books; but was ready at hand, digested for
his own use, and communication in discourse to others.</p>
            <p>From his first child-hood he had a strong impression of Piety,
and the Duties owed to God and Men, which next to Divine
Grace may be ascrib'd to the strict and severe education which
he had from his Father; a blessing that cannot be sufficiently
valued, and on which he often reflected with a great sense of
gratitude. Hereby notwithstanding the licence of war, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations
of youth, he preserv'd his innocence, and love of God
and vertue, till he made the more immediat service of them his
profession. In his constitution he had a great deal of warmth
and vigor, which made him apt to take fire upon provocation;
but he was well aware of it, and kept a peculiar guard upon
that weak part: so that his heat was reserv'd for the great
concerns of the honor of God, and the service of his Prince and
Country, wherein he was altogether indefatigable, and in the
most dismal appearances of affairs would never desert them, nor
despair of their restauration. There was not in the world a man
of clearer Honesty and Courage; no temtation could bribe him to
do a base thing, or terror affright him from the doing of a
good one.</p>
            <p>This made his friendships as lasting and inviolable as his
life, without the dirty considerations of profit, or slie reserves
of craft; not the pageantry of ceremonious address, or cold ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility:
much less the servile falseness of obsequious flattery. It
was a solid and masculine kindness, a perfect coalition of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and minds: so that there was nothing he possest, but it
was his friend's as absolutely as it was his own; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a general observation, that he and they had all things in
common.</p>
            <p>This temper of his directed him to live with great kindness
with his Neighbors and acquaintance, so that <hi>Eton</hi> College,
while he liv'd there, was but one family, his lodging being every
Fellow's chamber, and they as much at home with him as in their
own apartment: And in the Vniversity, tho his station and parts
might object him to envy, he had no competition or difference
with any person; so that no man ever liv'd with a more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
<pb facs="tcp:40114:8"/>
good will of all that knew him, or died with a more general
sorrow at his loss.</p>
            <p>His conversation was alwaies cheerful and entertaining, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the reception of his acquaintance at his table, and
friendly visits; and in the evening after he had wearied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the studies of the day, which he generally continued
till eight of the clock at night, during the many years he held
the Chair, soon after which he was to be call'd away to the
night praiers of the College; this short interval he made as easy
as he could to himself and those that were with him: and he
had great reason to relax his mind at this time with a little
cheerful discourse, there being no person who more literally ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
the saying of the wise Man, that <hi>much study was a
weariness to the flesh.</hi> After his daies work he was us'd to
be as faint and spent, as if he had bin laboring all the time
with the sithe or flaile; and his intention of thought made such
wast upon his spirits, that he was frequently in hazard, while
at study, to fall into a swoun, and forc'd to rise from his seat,
and walk about his room for some time, before he could reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
himself.</p>
            <p>To render secure from the inordination of intemperance, he
frequently abstain'd from lawful satisfactions, by the stated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of fasting and abstinence; and continuance in celibacy
during his whole life. Nor had his singular abilities and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
the usual effect to make him proud and contemtuous;
all his discourses were with deference and respect, and were
spoke with weight becoming a Professor, but the softness of a
Learner.</p>
            <p>In his conversation he was exceedingly tender of saying any
thing that might administer offence, or reflect upon any ones
reputation; and most ready, in case of resentment, to give the
person aggriev'd, whoever he happen'd to be, the utmost satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
A remarkable proof hereof is his dealing with one who
had taken part with the Rebels in the late war, and who was
said to have don an act of cruelty therein, which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi>
in a private discourse had chanc'd to mention. The party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
hearing hereof, wrote to the Doctor, professing his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and charging him with uncharitableness in believing,
and injustice in reporting such an untruth. Hereupon, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that the matter of fact had for about thirty years
gon on as common fame, and also had bin charg'd in print, and
<pb facs="tcp:40114:8"/>
that collateral evidence by a person now alive and a sufferer from
the same hand, had bin produc'd to enforce the probability, and
that here nothing was asserted but on the credit of what had
bin formerly heard; yet D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> by letter desir'd the said
Complainant's pardon: who, without regard to the laws of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
printed it as a vindication of his innocence, when indeed
it was rather a proof of the Doctor's candor, and an evidence
that the Complainant wanted better arguments for his defence.
But it were to be wisht that they who were in their youth so
unhappy to be engag'd in an ill cause, would spend their old
age, which God's and the King's mercy has given them, rather
in repenting of what they have don amiss, than in contesting
what they have not don; and would more busy themselves in
humble retractations, than passionat Apologies.</p>
            <p>His contemt of the world was very extraordinary, as in his
large and constant charities, both by settled Pensions to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
persons and families, and occasional Alms; so also his
bounteous hospitality, which will need no attestation, being
perform'd in so conspicuous a Scene as <hi>Eton,</hi> and in the view of
<hi>Windsor,</hi> which for several years his Majesty has favor'd with
his Court and Presence. Yet a higher instance hereof will be
his giving away a fixt and constant revenue that he might have
fairly retain'd, to the value of above three hundred pounds by
the year; the particulars whereof are thus.</p>
            <p>At his Majesties return, as we have intimated, he was made
Canon of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and soon after King's
Professor in the Chair of Divinity, to which emploiment a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonry
in the said Church, and the Rectory of <hi>Ewe Elme</hi> in
the said County and Diocess are annext, so that the profit of
two Canonries and the Rectory belong'd to him, and being
earn'd with the labor of that weighty charge, no one who made
a just estimate of things, would have envied it to him; but he
regretted it to himself, and for several years gave the whole
profit of one of his Canonries to the repairs of the College: and
afterwards being mov'd by the right reverend Father in God
the Lord Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> in the behalf of an ancient
Student of the College, who was destitute of a suitable support,
he entirely quitted the advantage of the aforesaid Canonry to
him. And as to the Living, he never receiv'd a penny from it,
but left it to a friend, whose circumstances requir'd such an
accession.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40114:9"/>
The revenue of <hi>Eton</hi> had a suitable disposal, the west side of
the outward court of the College being built from the ground and
finish'd at his single expence. And whereas at his coming to
<hi>Eton,</hi> he found the Society dipt in a great debt, by an ill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
brought in by the pretended godly men of the late times,
who at the year's end divided what ever mony remain'd after the
ordinary paiments were discharg'd, incidental ones and debts
contracted being still thrown off to the future year; which in
time grew to a bulk, that endanger'd the College's becoming
bankrupt. To remedy this he by an exemplary retrenchment of
his own dues, prevail'd on the Society to do the like, so that
within few years the College has paid above a thousand pound
debt, expended above two thousand pound in repairs, and every
day goes on to do things honorable and beneficial to the Society.</p>
            <p>It may not here be omitted, tho it be an instance of lesser mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the Edition of the first Volume of these Sermons was
entirely upon an account of Charity. For his ingenious Kinsman
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>James Allestree</hi> the Book-seller, from a plentiful fortune
being by the fire of <hi>London</hi> reduc'd to great poverty, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestree,</hi>
besides other assistances, bestow'd upon him the copies
of eighteen of his Sermons, to make some reparation to his
losses.</p>
            <p>But the uncontroulable proof of contemt of the world, is the
dying poor, and not to have collected any thing against the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of fortune, and commonly pretended exigences of old age
and sickness; which was in a remarkable manner D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi>'s
case, he having never during his life purchast an inch of ground,
nor any annuity or lease to the value of a penny; nor did he
take care to renew the patrimonial estate which he held by a
lease for life, tho it were the place of his birth, which generally
gives an endearment, and a desire to continue the possession.
Thereby, as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> expresses it, <hi>sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the earth as in a strange country, and shewing
plainly that he lookt for a better one, and a city which
has foundations whose builder and maker is God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His greatest tresure was his Library, which was indeed a
considerable one, both for the number of Books and choice of
them; but these he dispos'd of by deed before his death to the
Vniversity of <hi>Oxford</hi> for the use of his Successors in the Chair.
So that his Executors had only his personal estate to share
among them, which he took to be so inconsiderable, that he
<pb facs="tcp:40114:9"/>
thought it not worth the formality of a Will; but designing,
after the distributing some little remembrances among his friends,
that small pittance which remain'd to his Relations, conceiv'd
that the Law by an Administration would of course divide it
among them. But being told by his Friend, to whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
this purpose of his, that in this malicious world the
dying intestate would be a thing of ill fame, and interpreted
the product of an unwillingness to think of death, or part with
what he had: and that what he so left would come less obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his Relations, and probably would occasion contention
among them: he took the advice, and by Will dispos'd of such
Legacies as he thought fit to leave to the poor and to his
friends, and gave the remainder among his sisters and their
children.</p>
            <p>Tho he hung thus loose from the world, he neither was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent
in secular affairs, nor unskilful in the managery of
them; which was made manifest by his dextrous discharge of the
private trusts committed to him in behalf of his dead friends,
and the administration of his public emploiments. He was for
several years Tresurer of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> in a busy time of their
repairing of the ruins made by the entruding Vsurpers; and
amidst the necessary avocations of study, found leisure for a full
discharge of that troublesom emploiment.</p>
            <p>The College of <hi>Eton,</hi> as I intimated before, he found in a
very ill condition as to its revenue and fabric, and what was
no less a mischief, unstatutable and unreasonable grants of
Leases; to all which, excepting one, whose reduction must be
the work of time, he applied effectual remedies. The Schole he
found in a low condition, but by his prudence in the choice of
a learned, discreet and diligent Master; by his interest, in
bringing young Gentlemen and Persons of Quality thither, and
by his great kindness to them when there; and taking care for
the building fit accommodation for their reception within the
precincts of the College, in few years the Schole grew into that
great reputation and credit which it yet maintains.</p>
            <p>And here we may not pass by another considerable service
don in behalf of the said Schole, and also <hi>King's College</hi> in
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> whose Seminary it is: that whereas both those So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
were formerly under the discouragement, that the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
of <hi>Eton</hi> were generally dispos'd of to persons of foreign edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
by the vigorous interposition of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> added to
<pb facs="tcp:40114:10"/>
the petition of the Provost and Fellows of <hi>King's College,</hi> his
sacred Majesty was pleas'd to pass a grant under the broad Seal,
that in all future times five of the seven Fellows should be
such as had bin bred in <hi>Eton</hi> Schole, and were Fellows of King's
College, which has ever since took place, and will be a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
incitement to diligent study, and vertuous endeavor in
both those roial foundations.</p>
            <p>In the managery of the business of the Chair of Divinity, as
he performed the Scholastic part with great sufficiency in exact
and dextrous untying the knots of argument, and solid determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of controverted points, so that he was not opprest by the
fame of any of his most eminent Predecessors: his prudence was
very remarkable in the choice of subjects to be treated on; for
he wasted not time and opportunity in the barren insignificant
parts of Schole Divinity, but insisted on the fundamental
grounds of controversy, between the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
the most formidable Enemies thereof. With an equal steddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
he asserted the Gospel truth, against the usurpations of
<hi>Rome,</hi> the innovations of <hi>Geneva,</hi> the blasphemies of <hi>Cracow,</hi>
and the monsters of our own <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> never intermedling
with the un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>athomable abyss of God's decrees, the indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
five points; which in all times and in all countries
wherever they have happen'd to be debated, past from the
Scholes to the State, and shock'd the government and public
peace. By his judicious care herein, tho he found the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
in a ferment, and a great part of its growing hopes suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
season'd with ill prepossessions, he so brought it to pass,
that during the whole tract of seventeen years that he held the
Chair, there was no factious bandying of opinions, nor petulant
sidings on the account of them; which thing disturb'd the peace
of the last age, and help'd forward to inflame those animosities,
which ended in the execrable mischeifs of the civil war.</p>
            <p>There is nothing at this day which learned men more desire
or call for, than the publishing of those Lectures, which were
heard, when first read, with the greatest satisfaction of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory;
it may therefore be fit to give some account of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why those expectations are defeated, which in short is this.
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi> a little before his death having communicated to
the Bishop of <hi>Oxford</hi> several particulars concerning his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the disposal of his goods and papers, the Bishop ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
that there was no mention made of his Lectures, and
<pb facs="tcp:40114:10"/>
knowing how his modesty had during his life resisted all impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
for the publishing of them, suspected that the same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
might be more prevalent at his death; therefore he wrote
to him thereupon, desiring him that his Lectures might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
which had cost him so much study and labor, and would
be useful proportionably to others. His answer by letter bearing
date Jan. 19. 1680. was, that <hi>having not had opportunity
to revise what he had writen, which was not every where
consistent with his present imaginations, tho in nothing
material, yet in some particulars which he should have
better examin'd; especially diverse of the Act Lectures,
which being upon the same head, the thred of them was
not right nor didactical, and</hi> Nectarius<hi>'s Penitentiary not
expounded the same way in one place as in another, and
the first blundring and not true:</hi> therefore he adds, <hi>that if
the Bishop had not writ, and for that he himself would
not go out of the world without satisfying him in every
thing, he had resolv'd to have sent for his papers and
burnt them; but now he gave them up all to the Bishop
upon this inviolable trust, that nothing of them should
be publish'd as a Scheme of his, but to be made use of to
serve any other design the Bishop should think fit.</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Allestree</hi>'s
words are here transcrib'd, for that the plainest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of things is alwaies the most satisfactory.</p>
            <p>His Sermons not lying under the same interdict, so many of
them as were thought needful to make up a Volume, are here
publish'd. The variety of Auditors for whom they were first
design'd, makes them not to be all of the same finess of spinning
and closeness of texture: but in them all there will appear the
same spirit of perswasive Rhetoric and ardent piety, whereby
<hi>tho dead he yet speaketh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon the 28th. day of January in the year 1680. this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
person after a life spent in indefatigable studies, and
faithful endeavors for his Religion, his King and Country, and
after the patient sufferance of a long and painful sickness, with
Christian resignation and full assurance, render'd his soul into
the hands of God; and on the first of February was decently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd
in the Chore of the Collegiat Church at <hi>Eton,</hi> where his
Executors erected to his memory a Monument of white Marble
with the following inscription.</p>

to this end both the autority of the Teacher
himself, who had secur'd the truth of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

as if that were a more effectual enforcement,
pressing him with his own education in the Scriptures; how he had

with the faith of all things necessary to be known concerning
Christ, is meant. Now since St. <hi>John,</hi> after the view of all that
the other three Evangelists had wrote concerning Christ,
adding his story also says, that Christ<note n="*" place="margin">John 20. 30, 31.</note> 
                     <hi>did and spoke more
than what is written,</hi> yet affirms most positively that <hi>those things
were written that we might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
God, and believing might have life through his name;</hi> and so enough
is written for that faith which is in Jesus that is necessary to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life: therefore the Holy Scripture of the Old Testament, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the faith of what is written in the New, is that which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms is <hi>able to make us wise unto Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Here is the advantage <hi>Timothy</hi> had above others as to Faith in
these, and consequently the far greater obligation to continue in it.
<hi>He had known them from a child. And that from a child thou hast known
the holy Scripture, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first thing that doth offer it self to our consideration is the
state suppos'd, <hi>Salvation.</hi> But because my Text supposes it, I shall
do so too, nor shall think it needful to prove here, that there is such
a state, nor consequently that all those are stupid who propose not
to themselves this everlasting safety for their main end, and by
strict care in the duties of Religion and Gods service aime at it: for
if that state be granted, nay if it be but possible, it must be granted,
that there can be no security but in doing so, nor consequently any
wisdom without being <hi>wise</hi> thus <hi>unto salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then if this were granted, that the wisest thing man could
propose to himself, were by strict care in all the duties of Religion
to design Gods honor and his own salvation; still, as to the other
part of prudence which consists in the choice of means, we are to
seek for that Religion we are to pursue this end by and attain it;
since there are so many and so opposite Religions in the world, that
tis not easier to reconcile them, then to make peace between ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and contradictions. And it alwaies was so; for excepting that
mankind agreed still in the notion of the necessity of Religion,
that all had apprehensions of invisible powers above us, and differ'd
not much in the rules of Justice and Morality, in other things there
was no nearness. Almost from the beginning there was more varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Gods then Nations, I had almost said then Worshippers.
Beasts were their sacrifices and their Deities, and therefore their
Votaries were certainly no better. Vices also were their worships;
things which their Cities and their Camps would not endure, found
Sanctuary in their Temples; and the actions which were whipt in
the Judgment-hall, were their piety in the holy places. And tho
some wise men among them found good reason to decry this, yet
they knew not what to take up in the stead. I need not add the
present differences of the world, even that call'd Christian too,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40114:14"/>
great part of which as heretofore they seal'd their faith with their
own blood, now seal it in the blood of all that differ from them;
and by their persecutions hope to merit Heaven more, then those
did hope to gain it by their Martyrdoms. But these I need not add
to make up this into a demonstration, that it is impossible for lapsed
men, so far as they are left to themselves, and have no other guide
to follow but their reason, to find out what they are to believe of
God, and how to serve him, and save themselves. The<note n="a" place="margin">Hil. l. 1. de Trin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what we must understand of God; who must be known only as he
himself is pleas'd to revele himself. His worship also, how he will

since it depends on his own good plesure, therefore without his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
tis in vain to hope to please him with our Religious service

                     </gap>, inspir'd by God; they come from
him. All which must be made out in the next place.</p>
                  <p>That those Holy Scriptures which St. <hi>Paul</hi> first mentions, those
of the Old Testament were so, and did contain sufficient revelation
both of God, and of the way of worship of the Jews, that Nation
did so perfectly believe, that neither Sufferings nor Miracles could

yet take them off from <hi>Moses</hi> and his Scriptures. Now that this

<hi>Moses</hi> wrought on the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to give leave the people should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part:

How they were<note n="f" place="margin">Exod. 16. 15. Deut. 8. 24.</note> fed for forty years with Manna raining down
from Heaven in the wilderness: and that they might depend on
Providence for their daily provision, when he forbad them to take

they gather'd double which<note n="h" place="margin">Exod. 16. 24.</note> corrupted not: How when they mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined

plenty of<note n="i" place="margin">Num. 11. 16. 20. 31, 32.</note> Quailes flew to them as fed the whole Nation till their
very lust was surfetted; and they had no more will then hunger to
them; How <hi>Moses</hi> Rod did strike a living stream, a River that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd
that people and their cattle out of a<note n="k" place="margin">Num. 20. 8. 11.</note> Rock: How in the midst
of lightning and thunder God himself promulgated his Law<note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> to
the whole Nation audibly at once: How his glorious presence shew'd
it self in all necessities upon the Ark, in which the Tables of the Law
were laid up: How the waters of the river<note n="m" place="margin">Jossh. 6. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Jordan</hi> fled from that

                     <hi>Jericho</hi> without any other battery, any
other force but that the Ark was there, fell down before it.</p>
                  <p>But to name no more, If these be true; that power by which these
were wrought, was great enough to give that Law, require obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to it, and reward it, and to punish all transgression according
to the tenor of these Scriptures: that is, it was God; and he that
wrote those Scriptures must have had communication with, and bin
inspir'd from, God to write them. But,</p>
                  <p>2. whether they were true or no according as they are recorded
in those Scriptures, that whole people from the greatest almost to
the least must know; because they are recorded as all don, not only
in the presence of them all, but as the objects and the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their senses, every one; so that if they were forg'd, not
one of the whole Nation could be ignorant of it. And then,</p>
                  <p>3. If they knew them forg'd all; that<note n="o" place="margin">Num. 2. 32. Num. 11. 21.</note> 600000. men, besides
their wives and families, should endure this <hi>Moses,</hi> having brought
them forth only into a wilderness, there to lay such a heavy Law,
and so severe a yoke upon them, with such penalties annext to every
least transgression, and adjure them to observe it on account of all
those prodigies that had bin wrought among them, and upbraid
them with stiffneckedness, rebellion, and appeal to their own senses
for the truth of all this, and record all to posterity in this Scripture,
cause all to be read before them; and that they should bear all
this from him they knew so impudent a deceiver, and conveigh
that Scripture and the faith of it to their posterity, ground their so
strict, so chargeable Religion on that book, which they were certain
had no word of truth in it: this sure transcends belief and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility.</p>
                  <p>Tis certain therefore, since the Jews of that age did perform the
services requir'd, and in performing them according as that book
directs, did teach their children the great works that God had don
in their sight, therefore they believ'd those Miracles and Scriptures.
And since it was impossible that they should be deceiv'd; if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
them, they were true: &amp; their posterity receiv'd from them the
faith of this, and so deriv'd it on, that neither Gods dread judgments,
nor mans cruelty can yet shake it. Now had they not bin don, and
on that account conveigh'd; when ever they were broacht, and that
book first appeard, the men of that age must needs know their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
never had perform'd such services, had such a book read to them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40114:15"/>
constantly, nor told them of such Miracles that had bin wrought:
and therefore it was impossible that they could have believ'd it had
bin so from <hi>Moses,</hi> if it had bin true that it had first begun to be
taught in their own time, or in theirs with whom they liv'd. And
this discourse must be of force concerning every age, if we ascend
until we come to that of <hi>Moses</hi> wherein all was effected. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, they had also that perpetual Miracle in the High Priests
Pectoral, the Oracle of <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> that did keep alive
their faith and strengthen it: and they had Prophets constantly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling,
as from God, things that were somtimes suddenly to
come to pass, and somtimes not till many ages after, the event of
which depended often on the will of those that would not of some
hundred years be born; others on Gods own immediat will and hand:
and therefore none but God could look into, foretel, and bring to
pass all those events. Now such were <hi>Jeremies</hi> predictions of the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>Now if all this be true, he that did these must have communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with a power above all that we account the powers of Nature;
such an one most certainly as can perform whatsoever he in this
book promises, inflict what e're he threatens; such as is Divine.
And since he wrought all these, on purpose to evince he came com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission'd
from that Divine power, brought these Miracles as seals
of that commission, that we might believe him, therfore whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he delivers must be embrac't by us, as we hope for those blessed
rewards that he proposeth, and on pain of those eternal torments
if we do not; of both which it is not possible to doubt if these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
be true.</p>
                  <p>2d<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Since the most and greatest of these must be don but once;
he could not be incarnated, and born, and live, and preach, and

every place, to convince every man by his own senses; to all those
that did not see the matter of fact, therefore faith of all these must
be made by witnesses. And</p>
                  <p>3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, If we can be sure the witnesses that do assert a fact under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it exactly, if the things be palpable, and they must certainly
know whether they were really don or no; and if we can be sure
too, that they are sincere, will not affirm that which they do not
know, and do not lye, their testimony of it must be most infallible:
because it is impossible such witnesses can be deceiv'd, or will deceive.</p>
                  <p>4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>. The witnesses in this case, the Apostles and the 70 Disciples
(for I'le name no more) must needs know most perfectly: for they
not only saw the Miracles, but were<note n="b" place="margin">Luc. 1. 14.</note> instruments &amp; parties in some
of them; sent to cure diseases, cast out Devils, and knew whether
all this were in earnest. And most certainly they saw (as all the
Jews did too) Christ crucified, his heart pierc'd with a spear, and
his body buried; and whether they did see him risen, handle him,
eat with him they knew. And if they might mistake in his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet the fiery tongues, if such did light on them, they must
needs see; and whether they themselves, who spoke no Languages,
could then speak Tongues, it cannot be but they must know. In
these there is no possibility they could err, unless they did it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:
but then 'tis as impossible that they could do it wilfully, if
they were sincere and honest, such as would not lye.</p>
                  <p>Now that they were such, I might urge their simplicity and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
without disguise, not covering their own errors; men who
seem'd to live as well as preach against all artifice, and to have no
design on any thing but the amendment and salvation of mankind.
For he that can suppose it possible that they were otherwise, men
of art and finess, that they contriv'd the story, must needs know;
First, that such would not seal their falsehood with their blood;
design no recompense to all their travels but contemt, and hatred,
persecutions, prisons, whippings, wounds and death, to be the
scum and the off-scouring of the world; lay out their lives against
their conscience to preach that <hi>Jesus,</hi> who did only call them out
to be a<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>spectacle to all the world,</hi> just such as Malefactors when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to fight with, and to be devour'd of wild beasts. Their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
are too known to stay upon: S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> own catalogue of his
for five whole verses 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. is such, that to sustain them only for
this end, to put a cheat on mankind; count a so laborious, vext,
torn, miserable life and an infamous death gain, so the fable might
be beleiv'd: to think they could do this, is sure as great a madness
as to do it. But yet I will suppose that possible; that those who
wove the fable pleas'd themselves so infinitly with the expectations
of imposing on mankind, as that those hopes could make mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and death it self look lovely to them. But</p>
                  <p>Then 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> that all and every of them should be of that mind, that
amongst so many that bare witness of Christs Miracles and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
not a man should discover the cheat; that when their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors
did with arts of torment as it were examin them upon the
rack, they should work not one single confession out of them;
that no ones courage should be broke, nor have a qualm so far as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40114:17"/>
to acknowledg how it was, disclose the plot, lay open the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy,
the whole mystery and the contrivance of it: When of
twelve Disciples one was so false to betray his Masters person at a
vile rate, yet that all of them, and many more, in a feign'd story
of his Miracles should be so true to one another, that no engin of
mans cruelty ever could screw out the sacret, not one should betray
the forgery and be a <hi>Judas</hi> where he ought to be: no not that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
whose concern it was, whose treason to his Master had bin ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
had he bin an impostor: yet that he should stir no least su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion
of it, but should burst, choakt with his greif because he had
betray'd innocent blood: This, if he knew it had all bin impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
must be most stupendous.</p>
                  <p>But yet we will give them this too, that vainglorious hopes of
drawing in the world to follow them, might make all of them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
in secresy against all attemts of cruelty; or if some weak
brethren did perchance discover, we may not have heard of it. But</p>
                  <p>For them 3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> to begin their preaching at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is yet more
strange. To hope to draw men into a perswasion, and to bottom
that perswasion upon Miracles, and a Resurrection don amongst
them there; where if discovery were made it must be made, and
where it could not but be made if there were fraud. For to relate
and write those works with every circumstance of persons, place,
and time, where they not only could examin every circumstance,
but where they rather then their lives would find them false, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else would, this must needs discover it. They preach them
to the face of the whole multitude and of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and tell
them they were don before their eyes, somtimes 500 and somtimes
5000 being by and the <hi>cheif Preists</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Doctors:</hi> so
that 'twas most impossible they should not know if they were true or
false, as sure as there was never a Jew in all the Land, but knew
whether there were a darkness over all the land when Christ was
crucified. Now if these were forg'd to hope to draw <hi>Jews</hi> out of
their Religion with apparent forgeries, which they knew
such, speaks these Apostles men so far from art to manage a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of changing the Religion of the world, that they were mad
beyond recovery and president.</p>
                  <p>But let us give them that too. Yet 'tis certain 4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi> that the
Jews, if any such were wrought on by them, must be much more
stupid to believe them upon the account of such things don in all
the country, in their Cities, and the Temple, before all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when they could not choose but know they were not don, if
they were not don, but were fain'd all. For what ever might be
motive to Christs Followers and his Apostles, with the certain
danger of their lives to forge the cheat, what possible temtation
could there be so great to incline <hi>Jews,</hi> the most stiffnecked people,
the most stubborn in Religion in the world, to embrace a faith
which nothing but the Cross and shame and misery attended, and
which they must know false too? Had they so great lust to dye,
as for that to bid farewel to their <hi>Moses,</hi> their Religion and their
Law? It is impossible had they not known the truth of those
things, that in waters of affliction, in Jerusalem, <hi>ipsis persecutionum

the Fathers call it, they would ever have bin baptiz'd into Christ.</p>
                  <p>Yet suddenly in one day at one sermon of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <p>Neither was this a first surprize of Christianity, as it had seiz'd

came into it, receiving the Religion with the loss of all that was dear

writings, preaching on, and doing wonders also, very many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are recorded by Historians as converted almost wholly. And
the truth of it is evident, since nothing but almost whole Nations,
nor yet they but as buoy'd up by the wonders and the graces of
Gods spirit, ever could be able to endure, or be sufficient to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the Swords, the Flames, the Lions, and the other numberless
tortures which the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> and above all
<hi>Trajan</hi> in that first age rag'd with, till they made their Cities, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages

frighted with the multitude of murder'd Christians, did advise
with him about relaxing his edicts, as he himself<note n="g" place="margin">l. 10. epist. 97.</note> assures us.</p>
                  <p>It was the same the next age, when the power of Miracles<note n="h" place="margin">Just. Mart. dial cum Tryph. Judaeo p. 247, 302, 311. Iren. l. 2. c. 56, 57.</note> yet

(some<note n="i" place="margin">Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpt. ex Quadrat. Apolog. ad Hadrianum apud Euseb. l. 4. c. 3.</note> liv'd till near that time, who rose up with him at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection;)
when these<note n="k" place="margin">Just. Mart. Apol. 2. p. 98.</note> books, (writ by the will of God to be
the pillar and foundation of mens faith in after ages, as saith<note n="l" place="margin">Iren. l. 3. c. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>

the whole earth. And this is as notorious as that men do now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40114:18"/>
that they are Christians, and that these are holy Scriptures.
Therefore I shall need to go no further.</p>
                  <p>Now among so many myriads who on the account of all these
Miracles (whate're they were) suffer'd themselves to be converted
to the faith of Christ, and then as if they car'd for nothing but
Religion and their Bibles, for them bore the loss of goods, and
life it self, and engag'd their posterity to do so also; that not one
of these should know whether indeed any such miracles were
wrought, if any were restor'd to life or no: (for if they knew, then
they were true:) and that among so numberless a crowd of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who by assuming to speak languages, raise the dead, work
signs, drew in those Myriads to Religion and the stake, and went
before them, gave them an example both in faith and death; that
not one of all those should believe either the Miracles or himself
that did them: for if any one that did them did believe them,
since he knew who did them, they must needs be certain: but not
one of them to know it, sure is such a thing as neither could be
don nor be imagin'd.</p>
                  <p>He therefore that requires strict evidence in things of faith
which cannot bear it, he that calls for Mathematical demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor will believe on easier terms, yet is so credulous and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary,
that he can believe so many things which by the nature and
the disposition of mankind I have demonstrated not possible,
which yet must be true, unless these Scriptures be from God: 'tis
plain he does not seek for certainty, but for a pretence of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving;
would fain have his Infidelity and Atheism look more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable,
and is not fit to be disputed with but to be exploded.</p>
                  <p>But if these Scriptures be from God, then whatsoever they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
(with modesty I may conclude) is true. And therefore
when S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke Acts</hi> 1. 1. declares his <hi>former treatise contain'd all that
Jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up:</hi>
since Christ before he did ascend taught every thing that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
to be believ'd and don in order to salvation, and more too;
therefore if his Gospel did contain all that he taught, and did, since
it did not contain all absolutly, it must needs mean it contained
all that was necessary, or it must mean nothing. And since the
same S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke</hi> in the beginning of that Gospel does affirm he wrot it,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 4.</note>
that <hi>Theophilus might know the certainty of those things wherein he had
bin instructed;</hi> 'Tis plain he avers that the certain knowledg of all
those things wherein the having bin instructed made <hi>Theophilus</hi> a
Christian, might be had out of the Gospel: and when S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> says
here, that <hi>the Holy Scriptures are able to make us wise unto salvation
through faith which is in Christ Jesus,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John in his 20 chap.
v. 31. <hi>that tho he had not wrot all the things that Jesus did, yet those
that he had wrot were written, that we might believe that Jesus was the
Christ the son of God, and that believing we might have life through his
name;</hi> 'Tis evident the Scriptures say that what was written was
sufficient to work that belief which was sufficient to life and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as far as the <hi>credenda</hi> do concur to it. And when S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> in
that verse that succeeds my text, in most express particular words
sets down the usefulness of Scripture in each several duty of a <hi>man
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40114:18"/>
of God,</hi> or Preacher of the Gospel, both for <hi>Doctrine</hi> of faith, for
<hi>reproof</hi> or <hi>correction</hi> of manners, and <hi>instruction unto righteousness,</hi>
and tells you Gods express end in inspiring it, and consequently
its ability when so inspir'd was, <hi>that the man of God might be made
perfect,</hi> throughly <hi>furnisht unto every good work</hi> that belongs to his
whole office; 'tis most certain that what is sufficient for that office
to <hi>instruct, reprove, correct</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> in, must needs be sufficient to
<hi>believe</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> in for all men: <hi>i. e.</hi> what my text affirms, they
<hi>are able to make us wise unto salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might call in Tradition universal to bear witness to this truth
for holy Scriptures, if having once demonstrated that they are
Gods word, when that does affirm it, and bears witness to it, there
were need of any other. And this I dare boldly say, that if the
Scripture did say as expresly, that the Pope had a supremacy or
soveraignty over the whole Church, or that he or the Roman
Church were infallible; their definition, or the living voice of
their present Church, a most sure rule of faith, as it doth say Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<hi>is able to make us wise unto salvation,</hi> those Articles would
suffer no dispute, it would be blasphemy or sacriledg to limit or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
them by distinctions, when those sayings of the perfectness of
Scriptures are forc'd to bear many. Then we should have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of the obscurity of those books; if those articles were either
in the Greek or Hebrew, they would never say the Bible were not
fit to be a Rule of Faith, because the Language were unknown to
the unlearned, and they could not be infallibly secure of the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
were they there they would account them sure enough,
who think them plain enough already there, and that we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them because, <hi>Thou art Peter, Feed my sheep,</hi> and <hi>Tell the
Church,</hi> are there.</p>
                  <p>And for him that shall affirm, all necessaries that must make us
<hi>wise unto salvation</hi> are not in the Scripture, 'tis impossible to give a
rational account how it should come to pass that some are there,
the rest are not.</p>
                  <p>It must be either on design, or else by chance. Now 1. That
God should design, when very many things that were not necessary
were to be written, that the main and fundamental ones should be
omitted: and when of the necessaries most he did design for Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
then He should not suffer the Apostles to write the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of them: and yet what he would not suffer them to write, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
that the Trent Fathers (who I hope have perfected the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue)
should write all: of these since 'tis not possible to give
a reason, 'tis not therefore rational to affirm it was upon design.
But</p>
                  <p>2. If he shall say it only happen'd so by chance, he does affront
both Scriptures and Gods Holy Spirit, who, as they affirm, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
them for this very end, to bring men to the faith and to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
But there is no place for chance in those things that are
don in order to an end, by the design, impulse and motion of the
infinit wisdom of Gods Holy Spirit. He certainly does most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
reproch his Maker, who can think it possible, that what
he did design expressly and on that account alone to attain such an
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40114:19"/>
end by (namely that men should believe and be sav'd) and inspire
it for that purpose, should yet fail, not be sufficient for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
And sure if it be sufficient it contains all necessaries, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it were deficient in the main; yea so clearly also, as that they,
for whose salvation they are intended, may with use of such me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
as are obvious and agreed upon by all men, understand
them: for otherwise they could not be sufficient: if men could not
be instructed by them in things necessary both to faith and life,
they could not <hi>make them wise unto salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I must confess the Scripture labors under a great prejudice against
this doctrine, from the different sense and interpretations that are
made of it, even in the most fundamental points, by them that
grant it is the word of God; when yet all use the same means to
find out the meaning, and no doubt they seek sincerely after it.
But yet I think it evident this happens not from the obscurity of
Scripture, since it is not only in the most express texts; but also if
you should suppose the doctrins were as plain set down there as
words can express them, yet there are such principles assum'd into
the faith of different sects, as must oblige them to interpret diversly
the same plain words. I am not so vain as to imagin that no places
are obscure in Scripture, and I know that learned men have arts by
obscure places to confound the plainest, just as the Philosopher did
motion. Neither am I so perverse and singular not to think that
universal practise and profession of the Church does much assure
and confirm explications of Scriptures, whether obscure or plain.
But this I say, that the diversities of explication come, as I now
said, from the diversity of principles or rather prejudices, and that
this only is the cause of it I thus demonstrate.</p>
                  <p>First in the <hi>Socinian,</hi> who interprets all those Scriptures, which
the Catholic world hath still apply'd to the Divinity and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Christ, that I name no more points, otherwise then the
Church did alway; and I affirm he does it, not because he thinks
the words do favor his interpretation, but because his principle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
it; namely this, To admit nothing into his faith but what
agrees with that which he counts reason, which in a <hi>Socinians</hi> faith
is judg of all points in the last resort. And I mean reason upon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
principles, and thus I prove it. <hi>Socinus</hi> speaking of Christ's
satisfaction, says the word is not in Scripture,<note n="r" place="margin">Ego quidem etiamsi non se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel sed saepe id in sacris moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is scriptum extaret, non id circo tamen ita rem prorsus se habere crede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. Socin. de Jesu Chr. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatore parte 3. c. 6. operum tom. 2. p. 204.</note> yet if it were there
very often I would not believe it, because it does not consist with
right reason, that is, with the arguments that he had brought
against it drawn from human principles. And therefore he there
adds; those things which 'tis apparent cannot be, (<hi>i. e.</hi> that appear
such to him who judges by the principles of natural reason, which
yet cannot judg of supernatural and infinite beings,) tho the Holy
Scripture does expresly say they are, yet must not be admitted; &amp;
<hi>idcirco sacra verba in alium sensum quam ipsa sonant per inusitatos
etiam tropos quandoque explicantur:</hi> and for this reason we make use
of even unusual tropes, strain'd figures to explain the words of Holy
writ to other senses then the words themselves import. And so he
therefore serves that great variety of words by which the Scripture
does express Christs suffering <hi>for our sins,</hi> in our stead, as our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40114:19"/>
against the universal notions of those words, not only
which the Church of Christ, but which the Jews and which the
heathen world had of them. And when his reason told him that
Christ could not be <hi>God one with his Father,</hi> that he was so far from
having any being from eternity, as that he was not at all, till he
had a being from the Blessed Virgin; Therefore when the Scripture
saies directly<note n="s" place="margin">John 10. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>I and the Father are one,</hi> he must strain it to this
meaning, are of one mind, we agree in one: altho S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John</hi> avert
that, by<note n="t" place="margin">1. John 5. 7. The Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one. 8. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Blood, and these three agree in one.</note> distinguishing those two expressly. Yea worse, when
to prove that Christ had a being e're the world was made, we urge
from the first Chap. to the<note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 1. 10, 11, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> what S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> produces from the
<note n="x" place="margin">Psal. 102. 25, 26, 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Psalms,</hi> and does apply to him most particularly. <hi>Thou Lord in
the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth and the Heavens are
the works of thine hands; they shall perish, but thou remainest, and
they all shall wax old as does a garment; and as a vesture shalt thou fold
them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy
years shall not fail.</hi> They explain it thus: that God by Christ will
at last destroy these Heavens, and this Earth, and change them,
according to that saying in the Psalms; which altho the Apostle
produce at length, as it stood there, both concerning the <hi>Creation</hi>
and <hi>destruction</hi> of the world, yet he intended only to apply this last
to Christ. And tho he say as well of the same Lord, <hi>Thou Lord in
the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are
the works of thine hands,</hi> as, <hi>thou shalt change them;</hi> yet he meant no
more but that this change God would effect by Christ. It is not
possible that the text can give any the least countenance to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.
The different explication of this Scripture does not
come from the obscurity of any words in it; for in the <hi>Psalm</hi> they
and we understand the same words in the same sense exactly: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that we differ here, is not from any thing in the words quoted,
but is wholly from the Principle. And we may not wonder, for
the plain sense will not sute with their Hypothesis.</p>
                  <p>There are no other that are instanc'd in as differing from us in
points of faith but the Romanist. I know not whether they account
those differences to be in things necessary to salvation.<note n="y" place="margin">The reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of this supposition might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated if there were any need of it.</note> If that
be true that they allow (for what cause they know best,) some
that are reconcil'd to their Church to communicate with ours,
that is, join in our worship, and by doing so own the profession of
our faith in distinction to that of others, or at least espouse the
scandal of the owning it; Then one would think they must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that there is nothing in our worship don that is unlawful, nor
omitted that is necessary, nor any thing Heretical profest, at least
that there's no scandal in the owning that profession. For if there
were, they did allow them only to profess and act gross sin, which
certainly they would not do. So that poor Protestants when they
are pleas'd to give leave may be no Heretics, and therefore there is
nothing of it self in that profession faulty. But yet on the other
side since we see they call us Heretics, and when they have no power
over us, damn us to Hell fires, and when they have had power,
damn'd us to the fire and fagot also; sure they think the differences
to be in things necessary. But yet the account is easy, how not the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40114:20"/>
obscurity of Scripture, but a Principle or prejudice does cause this.
For we are bound in conscience to grant they believe their own
Principles. Now 'tis a Principle with them, that their Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
erre, and therefore that their present faith and consequent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
practice was their faith and practice alwaies. That it may
appear so, they must seek for countenance from Scripture: and if
any thing there seem to thwart their faith or practice, they must
smooth and disguise it, that it may look friendly. And 'tis most
certain if the Scripture should be never so express against them,
whilst they think it is not possible that they can err, they cannot
think it possible Scripture can mean what it pretends to speak.
'Twere easy to make instances. As first for invocation of the Saints
departed, which with them is a point of faith,<note n="z" place="margin">L. 1. de Sanct. Beatit. c. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Bellar.</hi> and <hi>Cochleus</hi>
produce that of the Psalms, <hi>I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from
whence cometh my help.</hi> Psalm 121. 1. and altho the text directs that
looking up expressly to the <hi>Lord that made heaven and earth.</hi> v. 2.
and tho it be a Principle with them, that on those everlasting hills
there were no Saints in <hi>Davids</hi> time that could be invocated, they
were all in <hi>limbo</hi> then they say; yet as I said, they would have
countenance from Scripture, and for want of better they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
forc'd to interpret those words, <hi>I will lift up mine eyes unto the
Hills,</hi> thus, <hi>I will invocate</hi> the Saints. Now will any say 'tis the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity
of this Scripture that does hinder Protestants from seeing
the bright evidence of this argument, and not rather that it is the
weak foundation of this practice that does make the Romanists seek
to build it on those mountains? So among those several texts
which in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Nicen general Council are produc't for adoration
of the images of Christ and of the Saints, and are expounded to
evince it, none is plainer then that which I produced now from
<hi>Bellarmin.</hi> I shall give one or two examples from the Psalms:<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 27. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Thy
face, Lord, will I seek:</hi> and,<note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 4. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord, list thou up the light of thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
upon us:</hi> and again,<note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 45. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>the rich among the people shall entreat
thy face:</hi> therefore David thought the picture of Christ was to be
ador'd. It is their own<note n="d" place="margin">Concil. tom. 18. p. 295.</note> conclusion from these texts, and they
have no better for it. Yet they saw the doctrine in these so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
as that with great opposition to great Councils, and more
bood-shed I think then yet ever any doctrine hath bin setled with,
it was impos'd. Yea more, the first experiment of the Popes power
over Soveraign Princes was on the account of this same doctrine:
when for opposing Image-worship <hi>Gregory</hi> the 26d excommunicated
the Greek Emperour. Pope<note n="e" place="margin">Sigon. de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gno Ital. ad an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num 712. l. 3. p. 94.</note> 
                     <hi>Constantine</hi> for the same cause indeed
had 14 years before don so to <hi>Philippicus,</hi> but he did not go much
further, whereas <hi>Gregory</hi> absolv'd the Emperor's subjects in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Dutchy from their Allegiance; commanded them not to pay
him any tribute, nor in any wise obey him; whereupon they<note n="f" place="margin">Sigon. de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gno Ital. ad an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num 726. l. 3. p. 103.</note> kill'd
their Governors, and<note n="g" place="margin">Leonis impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium respue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, ac solen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni sacramento se Pontificis vitam siatumque in perpeluum defensuros, atque ejus in omnibus rebus autoritati obtemperaturos jurarunt. Ita Roma Remanusque Ducatus à Graecis ad Romanum Pontificem pervenit. Sigon de regno Ital. ad an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum 727. l. 3. p. 105.</note> swore obedience to the Pope. And this
was the beginning of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peters patrimony, and it was thus gotten
by this doctrine, which they saw so cleerly in these Scriptures;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40114:20"/>
when they cannot see the contrary in those plain words, <hi>Thou shalt
not make to thy self any</hi> whether <hi>Graven image</hi> or idol it matters not,
since it follows, <hi>nor the likeness of any thing which is heaven above,</hi> &amp;c.
nor in those where God takes care expresly that himself be not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship't
by an image <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 15. and then judg if 'tis obscurity or
plainness that makes them see or not see doctrines in the Scripture:
rather if it be not meerly the necessity of prejudice. So again we
differ in the meaning of the 14th chap. of the 1. of <hi>Cor.</hi> where we
think S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> asserts and argues, yea and chides against all service
in an unknown tongue in the public assemblies saying all must be

that which is perform'd there in an unknown tongue does not<note n="i" place="margin">V. 6. 14. 16. 17.</note> edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
says he there: yet to justify this practice they must make it have
a different meaning, which no Fathers countenance, but which

                     <hi>Paul</hi> apply it most directly to the

there's nothing in the text obscure that makes us differ, but the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
had by little and little grown upon them, till it became Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
and so grew into their faith: and then since they believe
they cannot erre, they must expound Christ's words so as they may
not contradict their practise; because that would overthrow their
Principle.</p>
                  <p>But the Church that builds upon no Principle but Gods word,
can have no temtation to pervert or strain it, since what ever does
appear to be the meaning of it, that their Principle must needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
them to believe. And therefore if it say <hi>This is my body,</hi> we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it; if it saies too after consecration it is<note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>bread,</hi> we believe
that also: and because it therefore says 'tis both, we so believe it one
that it may be the other: which since both say it is impossible that
it can be substantially, neither hath God in express words told us
which it is substantially; therefore seeing when he calls it <hi>body,</hi> he is
instituting his <hi>Sacrament,</hi> there's all reason in the world he should
mean <hi>Sacramentally;</hi> since 'tis the most proper meaning: and by
consequence 'tis bread <hi>substantially,</hi> as all waies of judging in the
world assure us. Here's no stress on Scripture, as there is no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
to serve; when as the other makes us differ, not in Scripture
only, even where 'tis plainest; but tradition too. For the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
and evident sayings of the primitive Fathers are on every head
of difference, as much the matter of contention as the texts of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40114:21"/>
Scripture are; as it were easy to demonstrate if that were my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
So that it is meer deceit to lay our quarrels to defects in Gods
word, and particularly to its obscurity, which a man would think
were evident enough from this that <hi>Children knew it.</hi> The last thing
I am to speak to.</p>
                  <p>And that from a child thou hast known the holy Scriptures, which are
able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ
Jesus.</p>
                  <p>I cannot pass this, that it is S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> observation, that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
was nurst up in the Scriptures from his childhood. Yea and
since his Father was an Heathen, he must have bin taught them by
his <hi>Grandmother Lois,</hi> and his <hi>Mother Eunice,</hi> whose faith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi>
speaks of 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 5. Children</hi> therefore then, and <hi>Women,</hi> and they
sure are <hi>Laics,</hi> read the Bible. Yea and since they knew it, they
must read it in a language which they understood: and we know
where that is unlawful now. If we consider the first prohibition
that appear'd in that Church with Synodical autority against such
mens having any Bibles in their own tongue, we shall find it was
immediatly upon the preaching of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> one of whose do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
it was,<note n="q" place="margin">Vsser. de Christ. Eccl. suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. c. 6. §. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Scripture was the rule to judg of faith by: so
that whatsoever was not consonant to that must be refus'd.</hi> This they
preach't in France and over Europe in the latter end of the<note n="r" place="margin">c. 8. §. 1.</note> twelf
Century: and that Council which forbad their having of the Bible,
we find lately put forth by the frier<note n="s" place="margin">Spicileg. tom. 2. p. 624.</note> 
                     <hi>D. Achery</hi> as held at <hi>Tholouse</hi>
in the beginning of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century. It seems they apprehended
then their doctrines hardly would abide that touchstone: and they
therefore had no surer, more compendious way for its security then
to prevent such trial, taking care men should not know what was
or what was not in Scripture. And it is not possible for me to give
account why in their catechising they leave out all that part of the
commandments, <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self any graven image,</hi>
&amp;c. but this only, that they dare not let the laity compare their
doctrine and their practice with that Scripture. But tho it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
they might conceive some danger if the whole Scripture
should be expos'd, yet in those portions which the Church it self
chose out for her own offices, the <hi>little Lessons,</hi> and <hi>Epistles,</hi> and
<hi>Gospels,</hi> those sure one would think were safe: no, not their <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Breviary,</hi> nor their <hi>Hours of the Blessed Virgin</hi> must they have
translated in their own tongue; as that<note n="t" place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> Council did determin.

and their sacred offices are martyr'd. To see the difference
of times; 'twas heretofore a <hi>Pagan Dioclesian,</hi> a strange prodigy of
cruelty, who by his edict did command all Christians to deliver up
their Bibles or their bodies to be burnt: 'Twas here his <hi>Holiness,
Christs Vicar,</hi> who by his Bull orders all to give up theirs, that is, all
of it that they will allow them, and their prayers also, that they
may be forthwith burnt, or themselves to be excommunicated, that
is, their souls to be devoted to eternal flames. And whereas then
those only that did give theirs up were excommunicate, all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
shun'd them as they would the plague; and multitudes,
whole regions rather gave themselves up to the fire to preserve their
Bibles: now those only that have none, or that deliver up theirs,
are the true obedient sons of that Church, and the thorough Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics.
I know men plead great danger in that book: it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
as the source of monstrous doctrines and rebellions. I will
not say these men are bold that take upon them to be wiser then
Almighty God, and to see dangers he foresaw not, and to prevent
them by such methods as thwart his appointments; but I will say
that those who talk thus certainly despise their hearers; as if we
knew not Heresies were hatcht by those that understood the Bible
untranslated: and as if we never heard there were rebellions among
them that were forbid to read the Bible. For if there were a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
among them that had it in their own tongue, so there was an
<hi>Holy League</hi> amongst those men that were deni'd it. While those
that had the guidance of the subjects conscience were themselves
subject to a forreign power, as all Priests of that communion are.
How many Kings and Emperors have there bin that did keep the
Scriptures from their people, but yet could not keep their people
from sedition, nor themselves from ruine by it? In fine when
God himself for his own people caus'd his Scripture to be written
in their own tongue, to be weekly read in public too, and day and
night in private by the people; and when the Apostles by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> indited Scripture for the world, they
did it in the language that was then most vulgar to the world:
what <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> thus appointed as the fittest means for
the Salvation of the world, to define not expedient, as the Holy

                  <p>But to leave the controversy and speak to the advantages which
may be had from early institution in the Scripture; 'tis so evident
that I need not observe how 'tis for want of principles imprest and
wrought into the mind in Childhood, that our youth is so licentious.
And 'tis not possible it can be otherwise, when they have nothing
to oppose to constitution, when 'tis growing, and to all the temta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
both of objects and example; no strict sense of duty planted
in them, no such notions as would make resistance to the risings of
their inclination, and seducements of ill company: and they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
follow and indulge to all of them. And in Gods name why
do parents give their Children up to God in their first infancy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
him so early a possession of them? as if they would have Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to take seizure on them strait, as if by their baptizing them so
soon, they meant to consecrate their whole lives to Gods service,
make them his as soon as they were theirs, as if they had bin given
them meerly for Gods uses? And they therefore enter them into a
vow of Religion almost as soon as they have them: why all this?
if accordingly they do not season and prepare them as they shall
grow capable. Why when they are but newly born their children,
do they take care they shall be regenerate and born again Gods
Children? if they do not furnish them with necessaries, educate
them into all the qualities and hopes that appertain to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods children, as well as they do to that of their own. That
parent which not only, like some delicate ones refuses her own
breasts to her own infant, but provides no other to sustain it; that
does only wash her babe from it's first blood and uncleanness to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it the more handsom prey to wolves and tigers in the desert, is
more savage then those tigers:<note n="l" place="margin">Lam. 4. 3.</note>

take no more care, but expose them forthwith to such
lusts and conversations, as are much more wild and savage then
those beasts in the comparison; to which they cannot choose but
be a prey. They strive indeed, they say, to educate them into men
betime, that is, make them conversible and bold: and since for
that they must engage them into frequent company, where they see
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40114:22"/>
and hear mens follies, that I say no worse; by that means they
come to have their understandings stor'd with nothing but the
Modes, and sins of conversation; fill'd with froth and puddle; men
betimes only thus, as they have forwarded their inclinations to,
and got an early understanding and experience of, those vices, which
one would think men only could be equal for. But by this means
the mind, that only part that makes us be men, is not only not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,
but dwarft. They do not only still continue children in
their understanding as to any thing that's real and solid; but the
hopes of reason are destroy'd in them, and its growth kill'd, by
turning all its nurishment to feed the beast part; and the Christian
is quite starv'd. There needs no other cause be given for the most
part, why so many men have no Religion, own being Liberti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es,
and profess vice; for want of education they have nothing in them
that does check this, for they had no principles of a Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stil'd
into them. And if at any time it comes to pass that they think
it is their interest to take upon them the profession of some Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
they therefore, since they have no Principles nor rules to
judg by, are most apt to choose to profess that Religion, which is
like to be most gentle to the courses they have steer'd, and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in. Now that men hope to find such an one, (whether by
its constitution I shall not enquire but,) by its practice is but too
apparent. Accordingly when they go over to it, they carry with
them, and preserve in it the vices of their no Religion; and by
consequence they went not over seriously for Religion: and are
therefore so much worse now then when they own'd no Religion,
that they do their wickednesses with certainty of easy absolution,
and so hopes of salvation; and by this are likely to be made two-fold
more children of Hell then before: and let them triumph in
such conquests. There's nothing in the world that contributes so
much to this as mens being not acquainted early with, instructed
in, those Divine rules and obligations to piety and vertue, which
this book the Bible does afford. If men had bin season'd first with
the knowledg and the sense of duty, with the comforts that are in
it, with the apprehensions of great blessings that attend it; and
the mischiefs that are consequent, indeed essential to impiety and
vice here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their minds were furnisht with examples of both,
which this book abounds with; and their hearts too rais'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
of far greater blessedness in a life hereafter, and with the
belief that both that blessedness and life shall have no end: and
were made sensible also of strange dreadful torments that await the
breach of duty, which shall also last for ever: if these impressions I
say, did prevent all other, and take up the mind, and had in them
the stamp and character of <hi>God,</hi> and so there were a reverence and
awe of him wrought in them, and they lookt upon him as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in all this; how it was his word that said it; and these senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were grown into the very habit of their mind; as it would not
be easy to corrupt or soften such, so 'twould be much more difficult
to shake them, since their faith is founded on <hi>the rock of ages.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Holy Scriptures carry in them such an obligation of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

of Penitents, of Christians that had sin'd
against their solemn undertaking and profession, so to actuate their
Repentance and to mortify their lusts and inclinations, and by
that prepare them for an Absolution on Good-friday Eve: but they
also were much earlier employ'd upon the Catechumens, that were
Candidates of Christianity, as by which they did express their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

their<note n="f" place="margin">Tertull. de Poenit. c. 6. &amp; de Bapt. vid. Menard. p. 136.</note> scrutinies, their strict examinations to try whether their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
were real and sincere. So nice and so severe a thing
they thought it to become a Christian. The man was to be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
and die into the very name. But now, God knows, as for the
former discipline for Penitents one Church hath lost it, and the
other hath debaucht it into Pageantry, and taught it to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and bolster mens continuance in Sin, and minister to vice.
So for the other discipline too, if that did import that Baptism hath
such engagements in it, men in every Church live now as if they
either never had been Christian'd, or had never known, or had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
forgot the obligations of that Sacrament; the thing which
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> reproves here by his question, <hi>Know you not</hi> &amp;c. And which
therefore 'tis impossible there can be a more proper time to call to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40114:24"/>
your Remembrance then this is, before you are to celebrate that
death you were baptiz'd into. Now to inform such he disputes
here very closely. The sum is this: <hi>They that are dead to Sin cannot
live any longer in it.</hi> Now as Christs Death was a death to Sin, <hi>for
in that he died, he died unto Sin once</hi> v. 10. i. e. there was an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
in that death of his to put an end to all the powers of Sin:
which being so, it was impossible he could dye more then once;
but must be alive always afterwards to God. So in like manner
whoever is baptiz'd, he is baptiz'd into the likeness of that death v. 5.
namely into a death to Sin; inasmuch as by solemn profession and
express undertaking he do's die to it, for he renounces it; and if he
answer that his undertaking, do's so really: and really as Christ died
once, so as to live always afterwards to God; engaging himself to
keep Gods holy will and commandments and to walk in the same
all the days of his life. So that the words suggest these things to be
discours'd of. 1. Christs death was a death to Sin. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> They that
are baptiz'd are baptiz'd into that death, namely into a death to
Sin. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> They that are baptiz'd into that death are to die as Christ
did, i. e. to die to Sin once, so as to live always afterwards to
God.</p>
                  <p>1. Christs death was a death to Sin, i. e. there was an efficacy in
Christs death to put an end to all the powers of Sin. And here I
mean not that extrinsic efficacy of his death, as it confirm'd the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of the Gospel, whose rewards and punishments engage us
against all those powers; nor as his blood did also purchase grace
whereby we are enabled to resist them, but the direct influence of
that death tends to destroy all the power that the Devil, World, or
Flesh had either to command us or condemn us. The Scripture tells
us that <hi>by Death he destroy'd him that had the power of Death,</hi> i. e. <hi>the
Devil Heb.</hi> 2. 14. Christ tells us he hath <hi>overcome the world</hi> for us
<hi>John</hi> 16. 23. and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> says by his Cross the <hi>World is crucify'd to us,</hi>
and assures us that <hi>God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,
and a Sacrifice for Sin condemned Sin in the flesh that the Righteousness
of the Law might be fulfill'd in us</hi> Rom. 8. 3. Which place discovers
how all was effected, namely as he was a Sacrifice for Sin: and that
not only as that Sacrifice did consecrate him to, and install him in a
power to pardon Sins upon Repentance, and so whomsoever by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of that motive he took off from serving Sin, from them he took
away the guilt of it: but as that Sacrifice did take away the guilt of
Sin from us by <hi>bearing it in his own body on the tree,</hi> the direct conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of which as to its tendency and efficacy is, that <hi>we being
dead to sin might live to righteousness.</hi> And in both these manners<note n="g" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>by
his stripes we are healed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not mean to entertain you with the controversy that there is
on the account of these two Schemes, concerning the effects and
uses of the death of Christ. Only I cannot choose but wonder why
it should be said to be unjust in God to lay upon him the iniquity of
us all: so as that he bore death as the punishment due to sin by
making satisfaction for us Sinners. For I would gladly know to
whom the wrong were don in this, that makes the injustice, and on
whose part it was unjust: not on his part that made the satisfaction
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40114:24"/>
sure. For whether it be wrong to force an innocent person with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his consent to suffer for the guilty I shall not dispute. But here
Christ <hi>gave himself for us Tit.</hi> 2. 14. and had <hi>power</hi> to do so <hi>John</hi> 10. 18.
And having power to lay down his life, and power to take it up
again, if he had so much love and pity for lost mankind, as to lay
it down for three days to prevent their everlasting death and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
no justice certainly, nay no self-love forbids this. Much less
was there wrong don to them, for whom the satisfaction was made;
unless eternal redemtion and eternal blessedness purchas'd at such
dear rates with such infinite kindness be accounted injuries. Nor
yet was it unjust in him that did receive it: for none charge it upon
that account. That death which all confess Christ did justly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to, God most justly might accept; since he could so dispose it,
as not only by it to work the Salvation of those whom it was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
for, but also the advancement of his humane Nature, that
did undergo it, to the highest pitch of glory, to <hi>all power in heaven
and earth</hi> Phil. 2. 9. and withal thereby <hi>declare his own Righteousness</hi>
Rom. 3. 26. and work the honor also of his other glorious attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.
And therefore if there had bin no injustice (as they say)
altho Sin had bin pardon'd without any Satisfaction; much less
could the receiving this be a wrong to him. Indeed it seems as if
there had bin no right don him by it, because he furnisht all that
makes the satisfaction, and he could not receive it therefore, since
he gave the value to it. And 'tis most true in compensation of
rights of real possessions, and such as can be satisfy'd no otherwise
then by that which we call restitution. As for example in a debt,
be I never so willing, 'tis impossible I can truly restore or satisfy a
debt in any part with what the creditor do's furnish me to do it with:
for that is really his extinguishing and forgiving it, and not my pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But 'tis not so in compensation of the rights of estimation,
or of honor, which are satisfy'd by that which we call reparation.
The man that had brought up a false report of me, and lessen'd
my just reputation and esteem, but yet repents upon his death bed,
and would fain repair my honor, sign a recantation, but hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
then to make it with, nor strength nor skill it may be to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
it: tho I furnish paper pen and ink, write the form and hold
and guide his hand to sign it, and explain the marks too of the
witnesses, and publish it, which makes the very matter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;
yet he truly satisfy's. The case here also was a case of
honor; there was no restitution to be made to God, from whom it
was impossible we could take any thing, or make him sustain any
real loss: but we had don that which tended to his dishonor infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely.
For when God had made man in his Image, righteous, and
Lord of all his creatures, built for immortality of happiness; and
as in order to his Government of the whole Universe he put rules
into them to guide their workings, so he gave man laws to direct
him how to use the other creatures regularly, and to steer himself
in order to attaining his own ends of blessedness: so least he should
transgress those laws, and so disorder and deprave himself, and the
whole Government indeed, if there were neither check nor fear
upon him; he did therefore add a Sanction to his Laws, decreed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40114:25"/>
death the penalty of each transgression, and God knows that
could not be but death eternal; for it was not possible we could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
and rescue our selves out of it if dead once. Now if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
men did slight this mound, and broke out into all excess
of licences, so as to discompose and vitiate the order, the whole
frame of things, not only using other creatures to irregular ends,
and so abusing them, but themselves also, disturbing the whole
kind; their vices forc'd them to invade other mens proprieties and
and liberty and life, and consequently to expose their own; no
one thing could be safe, their coffers, and their beds, and their
breasts too were broke into and thrown open, and having broke
the Government thus far, they also set up other Governors, fram'd
new Gods, and forgot him that made them, and gave all their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to those forg'd usurping Deities, and worship't them with vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
and vices; so far as that they lost the very rules of vertue, and
the principles of honesty were quite debauch't. Things being thus,
it is impossible that any thing in the world can be more reproachful
to one then this is to God: for what can so much tend to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of an Artificer, as that his workmanship should by no means
serve those ends, which it was made for; but the direct contrary to
all: design'd to work the glory of their Maker, and their own Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
happiness; and instead of that they work out nothing but their
own destruction and eternal misery, and their Makers disservice:
and what could more reproach the wisdom of the Maker? Or
what can so much tend to the dishonor of a Supreme Governor, as
to have his Autority slighted, his laws broken, trampled on, and
for any trifling, least occasion, as if it were don contemtuosly, his
threatnings all despis'd, his person libel'd, and before his face his
homage, worship, Throne given to the meanest, vilest of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to his basest Rebels? If God suffer this and cannot help it,
where is then his power? If he can, and will not, where his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
how do's it appear he is displeas'd at Sin, or do's indeed not
like it? He is aware the Sinner cannot chuse but make such Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of him, for he told him long since,<note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 50. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>these things hast thou don,
and I kept silence, and thou thoughtest wickedly, that I was such an one
as thy self.</hi> At least as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> asks the wicked Jew, <hi>thro breaking the
Law dishonorest thou God?</hi> For so it is: <hi>the name of God among the
Gentiles is blasphemed thro you</hi> that pretend to his service, but live
wickedly, which makes them think your God is not a God that do's
require good life. Now if he do not vindicate himself from these
aspersions, and his laws from violation, his autority from contemt,
how is he just to himself? or how a righteous Governor? 'Tis true
he knows to vindicate himself, and make appear he is an holy God,
a righteous Governor; namely if he but execute his laws. But then
alas, mankind must perish for evermore, and so the whole design
of the creation, (which was made for man to serve God with it,
and to praise him for it, to be religious, and be happy,) had bin
lost, and still the wisdom of the Maker had bin question'd. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Son, who is the wisdom of the Father, is to take flesh, and
be made man to teach vertue once more, and assure immortal
blessed recompenses to it, and then suffer death, the dire expresses
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40114:25"/>
of Gods detestation and abhorrence of Sin, what ever he should
think fit for vindication of his laws and his autority, his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and holiness; and upon condition that he would receive to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
and to blessedness those that sincerely would believe, repent of
all their evil deeds, renounce them heartily, and faithfully endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
to obey him, he would fully satisfy for the dishonor man had
don him.</p>
                  <p>And truly when he bore the sharp inflictions of the wrath God
had for Sin, as certainly he did, for otherwise scarce any malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
but did meet death with more alacrity and courage. The two
Thieves, that suffer'd with him, did not entertain the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of it with such agonies, nor cry out so with the pain of it, nor
so soon sink under it. It was the sense of this which made his blood
run out in clots as it were flying from that sense: it was the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of the guilt imputed to him, and the wrath which he knew
was due to it, and did apprehend must fall on him in such degrees
and by such measures, as might shew how God detested Sin; it was
this that did make him apprehend his God, who was himself, was
gon from him, since he left him so long lying under it, as if he had
not yet exprest that detestation full enough. Now if we consider
that it was the Son of God that did and suffer'd all this, we must see
more of Gods attributes exalted to a greater height of honor, then
by mankind's either suffering or performing what the Law requir'd.
We see his Justice satiate it self in infinitely richer blood then mans,
the blood of God: but we see Mercy triumph against Judgment in
that very blood. He could have shew'n his detestation of Sin other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
even in the Sinners punishment, and so demonstrated his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and justice; but it was impossible that he should otherwise
shew mercy at these rates, by crucifying his Son who was himself,
that he might spare Sinners. Meer pardon had bin no such kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as to let us see, that God would do all this and suffer so that
he might pardon us. So that mankind forgiven and in glory had
not bin so great an evidence of his compassion, nor in torments so
great an evidence of his holiness and detestation of iniquity. He
had such compassion of us as inclin'd him to deliver up his Son to
torment, that he might shew mercy to us; yet all that compassion,
tho his bowels yern'd so over us that he would shed his blood for us,
could not incline him to forgive Sin without such an instance of his
detestation of it; nor yet with it but to such as will forsake their Sins.
For how should he appear by those inflictions to detest Sin, if he
should accept the Sinner that amends not? give his pardons and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to one that will not part with his iniquities? To such Christs
sufferings are the Copy of their expectations; he do's let them see
how he detests, and will for ever plague Sin unrepented of, who
thus torments the imputation of it on the innocent the blessed Son
of God. So that Christs sufferings not only are a perfect vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the honor of Gods person, and his Government as to Sins
committed, but the most astonishing caution against committing
them, that can be imagin'd. With us the Law is satisfied by the
offenders suffering, somtimes in effigie, if we execute his picture,
any thing that by the fright of the example helps to guard the Law
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40114:26"/>
from being broken. But see here an example, which to make, cost
God the life of his own Son, which to make dreadful he provided
all the Agonies imaginable, to assure us, he that spared not his own
Son, will not spare the guilty: neither can the Sinner possibly be
able to endure that to Eternity, which his Son, the Son of God
sunk under presently. 'Tis not a satisfaction that will give us leave
to enjoy our vices, and atone for us; a price that will buy off the
guilt of all our Sins, and let us have them. The satisfaction of this
infinite value looks at vindication of Gods Honor, and his Laws,
and serves the ends of Government, and assures the Sinner, which
amends not, that he must for ever perish. And thus this Sacrifice
for Sin condemned Sin to death by his own death. Which death,
that we would imitate, we did engage in Baptism: which brings
me to the second thing, Whosoever <hi>are baptiz'd into Christ Jesus, are
baptiz'd into his death: (i. e.)</hi> that which the efficacy of his death
did work to, that by Baptism we did engage our selves to. Now as
to this.</p>
                  <p>1. Christs death was, as we have now seen, undertaken for the
death of Sin. Now Baptism imports the undertaking the same
thing; it being as <hi>Oecumenius</hi> upon this place do's say, a Baptism un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that death <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Because when we are baptized, we
do most solemnly profess and undertake to die to Sin, renounce the
Devil <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and put upon our selves the strictest obligations in the
world to do this. That Baptism from its institution was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
with express engagements to this in the very form of it, I could
prove out of that office in all ages that have any extant of it, in the
rest out of express testimony of<note n="i" place="margin">See Just. M. p. 93.</note> Fathers thro every one to the
Apostles. Which so universal practice makes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Hieroms, Primas.</hi>
and others explication not seem strange, when they expound that
good profession <hi>Timothy profest before many witnesses 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 12. to
be that in Baptism. However 'tis sufficient evidence that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter,</hi>
when he says that the<note n="k" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Baptism that saves us,</hi> is the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the

the stipulation (which is both) <hi>of a good conscience towards
God,</hi> do's as much as say there was in Baptism an obligation entred
in that form of Law, that stipulation was, with questions an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to them.<note n="m" place="margin">Vide Nicet. in Orat. 40<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Greg. Nazian. Tom. 2. p. 1041. mihi.</note> For they were askt, and they did answer: Dost
thou renounce? I do renounce. Dost thou forsake? I do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And he that at Sacrament says that he do's this with a good, sincere,
and upright Conscience, hath the Baptism that saves. But the
importance of the Rite may be best known from them that us'd it
first, and whence it was deriv'd, even from the <hi>Jews:</hi> who when
they did initiate a Proselyte into their Covenant, did it with that
Ceremony in this manner; when any man desired to be of their
Religion, and they had by several scrutinies examined what the
motives were of his conversion, what his aimes; if they were hopes
of any thing of this world, they refus'd him; least his conversion
should die or change as quickly as his worldly hopes or desires.
But if they saw all reason to believe he was sincere, then they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to him all the Commandments, laid before him the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in keeping them: if this did not affright him, they explain'd
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40114:26"/>
to him the mysteries of their faith, and the Commandments again,
together with the punishments that were allotted to transgression,
the Rewards to them that did observe them. After all which if the
man continued stedfast in his purpose, they circumcis'd him, sprinkl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own blood on him as a ceremony to affright him into the
Observance. And one would think it were sufficient engagement
to have sign'd his resolutions in his blood, and seal'd to them with
Circumcision, as the <hi>Targum</hi> words it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and carried
the impression of his promise in his flesh to his lifes end. But as if
Baptism had obligation beyond that (and it hath most certainly
with those that are baptiz'd into the death of Christ; for there the
blood of sprinkling is Christs blood, the blood of God:) but with
them also: after they had don this to the man, he was no sooner
cur'd of the wound of his circumcision, but they put him (having
by him three Witnesses) into the water, and as he was there in it,
read to him once again all the Commandments, and if he did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
his resolutions still to keep them, they baptiz'd him, and he
was admitted thus into their Covenant, the Conditions, and the
Hopes of it. And by Baptism they did admit the children also, if
the three Magistrates of the place would undertake for them, they
should be brought up in the Jews Religion. And this lets us see 'tis
the assuming to keep Gods Commandments, to give over sinning,
to die to that, and to live to righteousness, to all holiness and
vertue. And with what strength of obligation this was understood
to be perform'd by the Ancients, we may perceive in that, as if
there either really were, or at least analogically, whatsoever gives
solemnity or force in Law to an engagement, so as that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
inviolable; that they word this with. They seem to think
it was an oath; <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls the Answers <hi>Verba Sacramenti.</hi> So
they might call a vow made with hands lift up, as that was.<note n="n" place="margin">Nicet. in Greg. Naz. Orat. 40. n. 57. p. 1087. Tom. 2.</note> They
were to do it before many Witnesses for more assurance, in the face
of the whole Church. Yea that profession too was registred in the
Church records always: and<note n="o" place="margin">De Symb. ad Catech. l. 4. c. 1. Tom 9. pag. 1030.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                     <hi>Tertullians</hi> ring <hi>Signaculo lavacri—quo fidei pactionem interrogatus obsignat:</hi> yet the meer allusion does
assure us, they intended to convince us, that as in Covenants
amongst men, when there's no one Ceremony wanting of all the
formalities and ties of Law to make a compact sure and not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinded
or avoided, then performance of Conditions only will serve
turn, and is necessary; so this Sacrament puts all the same necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
upon the baptized. And it is no wonder therefore if the same
<note n="s" place="margin">De Poenit. c. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> word that men are <hi>intinctione alligati,</hi> tied from Sin by
it. Nay more S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> says, we are held from it by the bonds of
Death, for here he says, <hi>we are baptiz'd into Death to Sin,</hi> as if he
did suppose us no more able to have any motion to it, then a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kass
hath; yea shut up sequestred from the practice of it as it were
in the grave, buried with Christ, or as Christ was in that Death.</p>
                  <p>'Tis plain this Scripture does suppose a baptiz'd person dead to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40114:27"/>
Sin, as truly as they are suppos'd dead, who are buried: for the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
represents a burial upon that account, and signifies the
bonds or obligations, that by Baptism are put upon a Christian to
restrain him from Sin, are in moral speaking of like force as those
bonds and swaths, in which they wind up dead men, grave-cloaths
that do bind them hand and foot in natural speaking, are of, to
restrain from motion; and a Christian, that hath burst all these
engagements, and walks in the way of Sinners, that courts plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and embraces lusts, pursues the world, or runs to the excess
of riots, is a great prodigy in manners, as a corps that had broke
his coffin, thrust away his grave-stone, and that lapt up in his wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-sheet
should yet come and converse, and practise all the offices
of life, would be a prodigy in nature. And therefore 'tis not strange,
if our Apostle press hard and suppose that they never do again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to live to Sin, to which they were already dead and buried
with Christ, (for they that are baptiz'd into the death of Christ,
are:) they were so to die as Christ, that is, to die to Sin once, so
as to live always afterwards to God, having engag'd to keep Gods
holy will and commandments, and to walk in the same all the days
of their life: the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> thing that I was to speak to,</p>
                  <p>That Baptism does bind us so to die to Sin, as that we never live
to it again, <hi>i. e.</hi> be given up to it, so that it come to have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of us, and that we obey it in fulfilling of its lusts, and go on in
a known deliberate habit, in a course of its repeated acts, is the
thing my text is brought to prove: for in the verse before he says,
<hi>We that are dead to Sin,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>How shall we yet again live to it?</hi>
That cannot be: for they that are baptiz'd, <hi>are baptiz'd into the
death of Christ,</hi> a death like his, <hi>who in that he died to Sin, died but once,</hi>
v. 10. but ever afterwards <hi>he lives to God,</hi> and cannot die again: <hi>So
also reckon yee your selves to be dead to Sin,</hi> v. 11. He therefore that is
truly dead to Sin, must be so dead as that he cannot live to it, for
then there would be a necessity that he should die to it again, which
can no more be, it should seem, by the importances of Baptism,
then that Christ can die again. We read indeed of those that <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify
to themselves the Son of God afresh, Heb.</hi> 6. 6. but he dies not for
them again, <hi>there remains no more sacrifice for sin;</hi> which words
being said of those who being once by Baptism inlightned fall
away, and do not persevere to their lives end, makes it look fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
as if it were meant of every one, that after having undertaken
this in earnest do's relapse to Sin so far, as that it lives in him, and
reigns over him again. In the race that is set before us he that runs
with all his might and heart may stumble and fall, but 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that he can wilfully turn back again, walk contrary in full
cariere. Our Savior seems to state the question perfectly <hi>John 13.
v.</hi> 8, 9, 10. where he tells S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, that
they <hi>that were washt, were clean wholly, save their feet,</hi> need only have
them afterwards washt; but they had so much need of that, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they <hi>had no part in him.</hi> The Traveller that had cleans'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and had preserv'd his body carefully from all defilements, let
him do his best, his journey yet must needs foul his feet, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'twas the custome always there to wash them. So in your Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40114:27"/>
here, those that have by Baptism bin cleans'd (for so the
Author in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Cyprian</hi> expounds it, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> from this verse
proves the Apostles had bin baptiz'd) and according to the vow
there made renounced sincerely, rid themselves of all the gross un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
habitual courses of their life, yet their conversing with this
Earth will certainly contract such sullages, that if that which is
typ'd and meant here by <hi>my washing of your feet,</hi> be not don to
them, however they have bin baptiz'd into me, they can have no
part in me, no benefit from me. All of you, my Apostles, must be
cleans'd from your ambitions, your contentious pride, which puts
you upon frequent strifes <hi>whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Some of you from the fury of your passion and revengeful heats,
that would needs <hi>call for fire from heaven, Luke 9. 54. Peter</hi> in one
night (some think in this that he was washt) did also find there was
occasion that his arrogant presumtion of his own strength, how <hi>tho
all should be offended, he would not;</hi> but <hi>would die</hi> for his Master
<hi>Math.</hi> 26. 33. should be washt away: his negligence and carelesness
in duty also, watching not even in temtation, when he saw his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
by him in an Agony, <hi>v.</hi> 40: his wrath so great as that it made
him draw his sword and wound without autority: and beyond all,
that evil temper of his mind, that made him thrice deny his Master,
Savior, God, for fear of danger; all these must be washt away. In
fine, whatever passions or affections to ill things, or single acts that do
surprise men in their course, all these, tho only he that washt us in his
own blood, can wash away and cleanse us from; yet these evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may be in the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in the baptized: but continuance, life,
dominion cannot, he supposeth. If these be, the washing of the
feet does not cleanse these, and there's no other after-washing: for
<hi>he that is washt must not need, save to have his feet washt.</hi> So that he
that is washt, however carefully he walk, he will contract some
dust and some foul spots it may be, but he will not rowl himself,
nor wallow in the mire. At least Christ seems to think they would
not; he would not imagine men would live in constant opposition
to such obligations of eternal consequence, and of their own as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming;
and after they had ty'd themselves with their own vows,
yet live most dissolutely, letting loose themselves to all the things
they had so solemnly abjur'd: indeed pursuing them as if the vow
were on the other side, as if they had renounc'd Religion and the
God of it, and by their actions did all they could to exorcize and
conjure out of them the holy Spirit and the whole Trinity, into
whose possession they were given in their Baptism: As if indeed
their bodies were sprinkled to those purposes the Heathens bodies
were in the Solemnities of the infernal Gods; to consecrate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
them to those foul Fiends, and their fouler deeds. And where
it is not thus, yet those divine engagements are not half so sacred
with them as the promises of their debaucht converses, or the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnations
of their folly: they break them without any least relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy
in sport, in the intemperances of their mirth they drown
them; and with the least puff of scoffing or blaspheming breath
blow of all those necessities this Sacrament does put upon them;
and however S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> call it <hi>death</hi> and <hi>burial,</hi> their Sin lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40114:28"/>
all Gods obligations to piety, and triumphs over vows and
oaths, and murders resurrection to new life. I must confess I know
not what it is, but it is plain now adays few men seem to consider
there is such a binding sacredness in Baptism, such things they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
were promised in their names when they were Infants by their
Sureties, who, they think, may be concern'd to mind them that
they take good courses: but sure this cannot be interpreted their
own act so formally as to expose them to such dismal guilts, as
breach of vows and perjury, with all aggravations possible, when
e're they fail. They cannot think it the same thing as in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of the first ages, who had first perfect conviction of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
miserable state of Sinners, and that out of that there was no
refuge but in Christianity, which not only offered to relieve, but
make them blessed to Eternity, upon which assurance they repented,
wept, and beg'd to be admitted into it, and took upon them all the
Rules of it with all obligations to keep them; and this out of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
understanding and deliberate choice, full resolution. Such
was the case of the first Christians, but theirs does not look so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credly.</p>
                  <p>Indeed if any do believe they can come off from all as from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
put upon them under age, that those vows were but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
made for them in minority, and will not hold against them:
then they might do well to be ingenuous and plead this, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the renunciations that were made for them, cancel and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
all. So we read the men of <hi>Congo</hi> (when their land was first
discovered by the <hi>Portuguez</hi>) were easily perswaded into Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and baptiz'd in great abundance; but when they found it
did require some strictnesses, they had no mind to bear, that they
must leave their Heathen practices, particularly their multitude of
women, they came back to the Church, renounc'd what they had
don, and return'd back to their indulgent Heathenism. For why,
they knew not how to reconcile the Christian vow with living in
the open breach of it, they were too honest for such practices. Now
such an obligation is most certainly Essential to Baptism in what
age soever 'tis administred. For that being the rite of entring the
new Covenant, and a Covenant being a mutual contract, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
agreed on and contracted for on both the parties that do co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
of which that Sacrament is the Seal, it is impossible, but
from the nature of the thing it must oblige them that receive it to
the performance of all that the Covenant does require on their part.
And this obligation was still entred even when Infants were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the way of vow or solemn promise. 'Tis not<note n="t" place="margin">Epist. 23. ad Bonifacium.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Austins</hi> age
alone which calls that custom ancient: but <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the second
Century assures us, Infants promis'd by Sureties; and we saw the
children of the Jewish Proselytes had undertakers. And evidently
<note n="u" place="margin">See Deut. 29. <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11.</note> by Gods own prescription children entred Covenant with him;
for they were circumcis'd at eight daies old, and that is call'd so
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14. and that by that rite they did undertake to keep their
whole Law, is most certain: for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> assures us 5. <hi>Gal. v. 3. I testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
to every man that is circumcis'd, that he makes himself a debtor to do
the whole Law.</hi> So here the rite hath that importance; the Sureties
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40114:28"/>
do but answer what it stands for, and if the infant does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the vow at present, so he is not to perform it for the present,
it is an obligation in relation to future life, then he will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it, when he is to keep it. After the leisures of Nature, when
the Age of temtation and knowledg are come, then it will be of
force upon him when it is of use to him; but 'tis entred at the
present.</p>
                  <p>And that none may think its being made for them by others in
their name, and their consent not had, lessens the engagement,
give me leave to call to your remembrance 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, how that was made
up and supply'd with all solemnity of obligation possible in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
For as from the beginning upon those that were baptiz'd
when they were of Age, the Apostles, and then afterwards their
Successors, by solemn laying on of hands and praying did invite,
call down the H. Ghost, who hover'd there over the laver of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
to hatch the new creature, as he once mov'd on the face of
the waters to warm them into the first creation; that so his
strengths and graces might be added to their vows: so when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
were baptiz'd, this was deferr'd for this end, as our Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
<hi>that when they come to years of discretion, and have learnt what
was promised for them in Baptism, they may themselves, with their own
mouth and with their own consent, openly before the Church, ratify and
confirm the same, and also promise, that by the grace of God they will
evermore endeavor themselves faithfully to observe and keep them;</hi>
which they do there upon their knees: whereupon that grace is
pray'd for for them, and they blest by those, whom God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to bless in his name; that so they who just then are grown
able to be taught all the debaucheries of youth, warm'd into the
desires and the strengths of vice, might have not only this check of
their own vows fresh upon them, but the effusions of the H. Spirit,
those living Rivers in the inwards, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John</hi> expresses, that may
quench and wash away those unclean heats.</p>
                  <p>3. To express more the inviolable Sacredness of those obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which in Baptism were entred, and to let us see they were
baptiz'd into the Death of Christ, from the first times, they did
immediatly make them, that were baptiz'd, partakers of the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols
of that Death. For from that Sacrament they proceeded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the other, the Lord's Supper: of those that were baptiz'd
after they were of age we can derive that practice quite from
<note n="x" place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Apol. pag. 47.</note> 
                     <hi>Justin Martyr;</hi> which being don so universally to them, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
gave occasion to the doing it to Infants after Baptism, and
then they found a text for it, and made that universal also. But
tho that be justly chang'd, yet after Confirmation we proceed to
that; and often we repeat the use of it: now that we renew in the
Lord's Supper what we did engage in Baptism, when we entred the
new Covenant, is evident. Christ calls the cup there in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke
the new Covenant in his blood,</hi> and in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Mark, this is my blood</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
that blood of the new Covenant. The words relate to those
<hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 8. where it is also said this is <hi>the blood of the Covenant;</hi> for
God dd seal his Covenants still with blood. <hi>Whereupon neither was
the first Covenant dedicated without blood. Heb.</hi> 9. 18. that was its
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40114:29"/>
Sanction. Now the Sanction of a Covenant is some Rite, which
being celebrated in the name of those that covenant, does oblige
them to stand to, not to rescind the agreement; which that Rite
was contriv'd to do (supposing that the most effectual way) by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precating
mischief on the person that did break it. The usual
way was either killing of a beast, the blood of which they pour'd
out, or in some Nations drank, or else they did dissect and tear the
victime and either swear over, or pass thro between the parts; by
one of these significative Ceremonies implying a severe commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>So be it don to him that breaks this vow.</hi> And all these the
Heathen, who are full of the Examples, seem to have deriv'd from
Gods own practice, who appointed <hi>Abraham</hi> to do so, when he
went to make a Covenant with him <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. and his meaning in
such Rites he hath reveled by <hi>Jer. 34. 18, 19. the men that have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed
my Covenant, even the Princes, Priests, and all the People that
have past between the parts of the Calf</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, I will
make those men that Calf, or as that Calf, which they did cut in
twain, and pass between the parts thereof, <hi>i. e.</hi> I will divide and
separate them among the Nations. For the wishes of all this that
Ceremony did import. But more expresly there in <hi>Exod. 24. 6.
And Moses took the half of the blood and put it in the Basins,</hi> for the
Peoples part, <hi>and half of the blood he sprinkled on the Altar,</hi> as on
Gods part, <hi>and then he took the book of the Covenant,</hi> v. 7. <hi>and read it
in the audience of the People.</hi> Now that Book, especially in the four
foregoing chapters said on Gods part what he requir'd of them and
what he would do for them: and the People said on their part, <hi>All
that the Lord hath said we will do, and be obedient,</hi> v. 7. Upon which
undertaking on both sides <hi>Moses took the blood and sprinkled both the
book and all the people, Heb. 9. 19. saying, this is the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
which the Lord hath made with you concerning these words</hi> i. e.
thus both parts of you oblige your selves in figure to make good
your Articles, In shedding this blood on the Book the Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture,
he, for whom it is impossible to fail his word, yet conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
to use this rite, by which those men that covenant devote
their own blood to be shed, if they should fail: and in its sprinkling
on you all, you also wish, if you perform not your part, which you
promis'd, that your own be so poured out. This is shed as your type,
and 'tis your giving earnest that your own is forfeit, when you fail
in your Conditions. For that these wishes were imply'd all in that
Ceremony, and not only at the first sealing of the Covenant, but
meer Repetition of it, when 'twas only read again before and to
them and their children, <hi>Moses</hi> tells them; <hi>All you are here this day</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">

Covenant</hi>

                     <hi>and into the execratory oath,</hi> into the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations
which are signified in those divided Sacrifices and that
Blood-shedding, the Sanctions of that Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Now what that Blood and those divided Sacrifices were to that
Covenant, that Christ sacrificed, his body broken and his blood
shed was to ours: and is therefore call'd, <hi>Heb. c. 10. the Blood of the
Covenant</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, with which it was ratified and hallowed) God
no more engaged in faint types, in the blood of goats and calves,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40114:29"/>
but in the blood of God, with that he ratified, hallowed the new
Covenant. And when our Savior calls the Sacramental cup <hi>the new
Covenant in his blood,</hi> and <hi>the blood of the new Covenant,</hi> it must have
the like importance, the broken bread must be as the divided Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
the wine poured out, the Covenant Blood: by taking which
we much more properly may be said to pass into the Covenant, and
into the oath and curses of it, then the Jews were said by <hi>Moses</hi> to
do so at the meer Repetition of theirs, or indeed at the first making.
For that blood was not sprinkled on us as theirs was, but drunk in;
we thus by our own act and deed devoting our selves to those curses
if we fail, yea taking earnest of them into us.</p>
                  <p>The sum is this: Our Saviors words of this cup being the very
same with those in <hi>Exodus,</hi> demonstrate that this Sacrament is a
renewing of our Gospel Covenant with Sacrifice. The doing that
is the assuming to endeavor to observe all the conditions of that
Covenant with a most solemn vow or oath, and under curses; the
tenor of those curses is, Let that light on me if I fail, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on the federal Sacrifice. Now that Sacrifice was Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the ceremony of it was his body torn and his blood poured out,
in a word, all those bitter agonies which we there commemorate,
and which that Sacrament does represent. It signifies therefore
that we there renew our vow of Baptism, assume faithful Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Obedience to all the Gospel do's require: which if we do not
faithfully endeavor, and where we transgress repent, but fail wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
we wish that all the agonies of Christ may be our portion.
This is the Tenor of those our performances.</p>
                  <p>And now consider, I beseech you in the fear of God, with what
strange multiplied arts of managery Almighty God pursu'd you thro
all the stages of your life to seize on you, &amp; scare you, that you might
not be a prey to vice and to the Devil. How in your first Infancy
he took early possession, and in the soft tenderness of that age (a
temper the most capable of impression) set his seal upon you,
markt you for his own, that so the first thing you should come to
understand might be, that you already were engag'd to him and
to his service, not only <hi>Sanctitatis designati</hi> in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> design'd
and set apart for, consecrate to holiness; but in a solemn vow of it,
sworn to Religion and the keeping of Gods Commandments. So
that the sense of these great obligations might prevent not only
any first essays of vice, but even the first inclinations of the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
or body. We know whose fault it is, if children be not season'd
in this manner. Now when by means of careful education pious
principles have taken up their yet untainted understandings, when
their minds are stor'd with images of good things, and their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
wrought into an awe of God and reverence for Religion,
and to an abhorrency of vice; least constitution ripening, curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
inciting, edging it, example drawing in, encouraging, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
pushing forwards, Youth that is not setled steddy, hath
not firmness nor experience, might yeeld to, at least not break the
first assaults, which for the most part are the most impetuous: that
age was call'd upon to come, and solemnly upon their knees before
the Congregation to renew their vows. Which could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40114:30"/>
the sense of all their obligations, and make new and strong
impressions of their great concern of fearing God and being cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of all Sin, and more and more excite and actuate their care
in the performances of dutiful obedience. And truly besides those
assistances and blessings we might hopefully expect to reap in that
rite from the praiers and benedictions of Gods Officers of blessing;
besides this, at that time when the mind had not bin yet defloured,
the meer shame of violating what we had so publicly, so holily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
and sworn, must needs be a strong curb to rein us in from evil.
Our heart would have fail'd us, if we had attemted any; for our
very blushes must have call'd away the blood from thence to rise
against the thing we had so solemnly renounc'd and bid defiance
to. Yet more to strengthen us we were thenceforwards yearly call'd
upon at frequent solemn seasons to renew all in a more engaging
Ceremony, in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, where with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated
preparation in the most tremendous Symbols we again
made oath,<note n="y" place="margin">Plin. Epist. ad Trajan.</note> 
                     <hi>that we would not deceive, wrong, or oppress any, bear
false witness, kill, commit adultery, or steal, or covet:</hi> and all this
with the most astonishing circumstances possible, doing it in
the blood of Christ that was shed for Sin, as it were shewing to our
selves the cursed consequences of it, how it tore his body, spilt his
blood, and could have no less expiation: so to make it look more
dreadful to us. And having don so, taking in those pledges of that
expiation into us, as it were expressing we receiv'd them on those
terms we had resolved there; and no otherwise expected that they
should be salutary to us, then as we endeavoured to observe them.
And to do thus hath bin our constant practice, and this I must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
we are designing now, preparing for, and the more to affect
our own selves with a real intimate sense of all this, that Passion of
our Savior must be represented to us; Christ crucified before our
eyes. We consecrate a day to shew our selves that infinite indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
God Almighty hath to Sin, which could not express it self in
softer easier ways, then in the Agonies and bloody sweat, the Cross
and Passion of the Son of God: and shew our selves that infinite
love of his to Sinners, that inclin'd him to do all this for, accept it
in the stead of those that faithfully would cleave to him and leave
their sins: and to give more pungency to all this, that it may touch
livelier and pierce deeper, we intend to entertain the celebration
with the humbling and afflicting of our own souls; and all this to
actuate, give life and vigor to the resolutions that we are to take
upon it. For while our hearts will be yet wreaking with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions,
we intend in that blood to renew again our vows, and
this we do from year to year, and mean to do now. Now sure we
think we are in earnest when we do thus: we do not tie these sacred
bonds upon our selves, as <hi>Samson</hi> did teach <hi>Dalilah</hi> to do on him,
only to try our own strengths on them, and to serve us to break thro.
And therefore in Gods name that we would now begin to try in
earnest whether we could keep them, and that whosoever vows thus
would first set himself against that Sin, which constitution or his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
makes his sorest enemy, that if he chance to come neer an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of it, he consider, I have deeply sworn against thee, I have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40114:30"/>
made a Covenant with my God and with my eies, and with my ears,
and bound them from pursuing their careers over the invitations,
that have hitherto crept in at them, and betrai'd me; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
a temtation do's come towards thee, bethink thy self, that
'tis the Devils harbinger, and that he himself is not far off, but is
there laying trains for thee, and however kind his address be, he
hath a dagger at thy heart, and a chain at thy feet, which he is
then come from below to get thee into out of all thy vows; and a
dungeon in Hell for thee. Do not therefore treat with it, but call
up all thy resolution and thy oaths; for otherwise thou dost betray
thy self, and it is plain thou hast no mind to keep them, that thou
didst not take them with that meaning. And truly any one would
think so, that consider'd but mens vows and conversations: how
they first vow cleanness in the Laver, which the Holy Ghost did hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and then make their whole lives to be but wallowing in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,
and make that filthy, which that vow had cleansed. And
then they swear amendment at the Altar, dip those oaths in blood
to make them solemn; and strait mind and contrive nothing else
but how to vomit up those Oaths and that Blood. They seem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Sacrament to have some sorrow, or at least some thoughtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
about their Sins; but yet not resolving perfectly to part with
them, they bring them with them to that Sacrament, set them at
Christs table, as it were to feed on that body which they crucified,
make them imbrue their hands in that blood which they shed. And
this is the return they make to that blood shed for them. They
bring them and their vows against them both together to the Altar,
and they leave their vows there, but they take their Sins back with
them, and serve them still. Now does eternal ruin look so lovely
to us, as that we will break thro all oaths to get at it? Is't worth
the while to be at once false to God and our own blessedness? Do
vows so straiten us, that we cannot endure the obligations to be
happy? In Gods name be at last more true to your own Souls:
consider what I say, and the Lord give you understanding.</p>

cavilling question of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
who seeing him converse familiarly, accept the
friendship of an invitation, sit and eat with open
noted Sinners, and (which was as bad a name
amongst them) <hi>Publicans,</hi> ask his Disciples why
they and their Master do what they know was
forbidden and unlawful? To whom having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
that he did converse with them only in order to their cure,
(now a Physitian, that goes to visit his sick Patients, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
blam'd for going to them because they are sick,) he further ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies
himself by an account of Gods own mind and dealing set
down in the Scripture, of whose meaning, if they had not taken
notice hitherto, he bids them now go learn it. For God tells them
by his Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> that he prefers acts of mercy, doing good
to others, before any Ceremonies of his Worship, tho himself or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
them, whether Sacrifices or whatever others. For <hi>I will,</hi>
says he, <hi>have mercy and not sacrifice.</hi> Therefore Christ did but
comply with Gods own will, when he accepted of an invitation
from such sinners, merely to have the better opportunity to invite
them to repentance and to heaven; and in doing so did but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
the acts of highest mercy in the world, the doing everlasting
blessed good to souls, before obedience to such ritual precepts, as
forbad converse with the unclean and sinful.</p>
                  <p>I need not here observe, that the negation is but comparative,
and means, I will not have Sacrifice, but Mercy rather, yea I will
have Mercy and not Sacrifice, where I cannot have both; or that
by Sacrifice also is meant all Ceremonies of Gods Worship, altho
instituted by himself, and those not taken by themselves and mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
external Acts and void of the inward zeal and devotion that
should spirit them, but taken in their best states; yet God will have
works of Mercy rather. And that doctrine is, it seems, worth
learning and attending to: for so in the text there is besides the
proposition it self <hi>I will have mercy and not sacrifice,</hi> also the insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its usefulness in those words, <hi>go and learn what that means.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:40114:31"/>
I shall not break these into other parts, but raise some Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the subjects of my discourse. And</p>
                  <p>First since God compares two sorts of things here in the text, and
says he will have, or is pleas'd with one and not the other, which
other yet 'tis plain that he was pleas'd with and would have, for he
commanded them; 'tis evident he does imply, that as these, call'd
here Sacrifices, were grateful to him, as they were obedience to his
precepts; so the other therefore, which he does prefer to those,
they must be good and acceptable to him in themselves, not only
as they are commanded. Some actions therefore have an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sic
honesty, are of themselves, in their own nature morally good
and well-pleasing to God, as some also are the contrary.</p>
                  <p>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> Of all that are so in that manner good, those of Mercy are
in an especial manner such, <hi>I will have mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> Of all acts of mercy those are best and most well-pleasing in
Gods sight, which are employ'd in reducing Sinners from their evil
ways: those were such our Savior is here pleading for. And</p>
                  <p>4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi> 'Tis onely the opportunity and the design and hope of doing
good to Sinners by reforming them, that can make familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with them excusable and lawful: I mean, where no duty of a
relation do's oblige to it. Christ himself had no other plea to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
his eating with them, but that he intended it as a mercy to
them, as his opportunity to call them to repentance, All these we
see flow naturally from the words.</p>
                  <p>First, some actions have an intrinsic honesty, are of themselves,
in their own nature morally good and well-pleasing to God, as some
are the contrary. When I say they have an intrinsic honesty and
are in nature good, I mean the rule of them is intrinsic and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to the agent, is indeed his nature, and by consequence their
goodness is as universal and eternal as that nature. Now it is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that hath had Advocates as ancient as the great <hi>Carneades</hi>
and the Sect of the <hi>Pyrrhonians,</hi> that in nature antecedent to all
laws and constitutions there is no rule of unjust or just, good or
evil, honest or dishonest; and that nothing of it self is one or other,
but as our concerns or interests do make it to our selves, to prosecute
which is the only inclination and the only rule that nature gives us:
or else, as the public interests incline superior powers to prescribe
them, whom it is our interest also to obey. Accordingly we find

<hi>nothing is unreasonable that is useful.</hi> And the <hi>Athenians</hi>

are just in that degree that they are necessary. And then as necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and interests do chance to vary, good and just must change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their contrary; and as different countries and persons cannot
but have opposite rules and mesures of necessity and usefulness, so
they must of just and honest: thus the laws of Vertue serve, like
Almanacks, but for such a latitude, and a different elevation of
the Pole quite alters them, and makes them good for nothing. A
pleasant sort of good and honest this, which any wall or dike, that
divides Provinces or Countries, can give boundaries, lines, and rules
to, so as that it shall be vertue and right on one side, vice and error
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40114:32"/>
on the other: as if those principles of good and evil, which seem
planted in us, and the world calls natural, were nothing else but
prejudices taken in from early conversation; as dogs learn (they
say) the skill of chase. And it were great pity, if this age, which
so much needs the patronage of such a principle to give counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to their licentious practices, had not also found out some,
that reestablish and plead for this. But I shall not give you or my
self the trouble to advert to them, but shall onely briefly lay the
grounds of the contrary truth, which is so plainly set down here in
the text: for if God himself tho he had constituted both the acts of
Mercy and the acts of Worship, so that whatsoever goodness law or
constitution (tho divine) could give, both had, if yet he shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and will have one much, rather then the other, 'tis because
there is some difference in the things themselves. For he that sees
and judges as things are, if he shall judge one better, then it is so,
and that by some rule antecedent to that judgment, that is, from
the nature of the thing it self, which is the reason why he judges of
them diversly, and constitutes, and wills them differently. So that
God supposeth, that there are some actions of themselves, and in
their own nature morally good; neither is it hard to prove it. And
tho, if we but view'd mans nature in it self, whether made by God
or chance and atomes it matters not, we should see sufficient
grounds to count his actions laudable or blame-worthy, as being
morally good or bad, according as they are directed by, or deviate
from that rule: yet in my first proposal of the thing, I shall make
bold to take in God as the contriver of mans nature, and all other.
Now when the great Creator of the Universe had made it up of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
variety of beings in an excellent order, 'tis most certain that
He being a most wise agent made each being for some end, which it
was to attain, unless it were made in vain: but ends are not attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but by operations suited and proportion'd to those ends. The
operations of a simple element will not reach the ends of life, or
sense, or reason; as in artificial things we cannot use a ball to cut,
or Coulander to carry water in, and therefore as it is the business of
each art to take care, that their tools and all their productions be
wrought so, that their very make may fit them to work out these
uses they are made for: so in Nature, Gods art, it was therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
he should frame each several being so, as that the nature of
it should be as it were a rule to it, to regulate the manner and the
measures of its workings, that so they might tend orderly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
towards those ends, which he design'd their operations to
work out, and in their courses might comport with one anothers
motions; and by doing so contribute to the ends and uses of the
whole. For if the nature of each being were not such a principle,
causing some to move in one way, some another, fitting this for
one use, that for others: or if in their motions, or their other
actings they should deviate from the rule of nature, they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be sayd to be those beings, neither would they make a world,
but Chaos, routing always and confounding one another. But
while they do observe that rule, act and are mov'd according to
their nature, and by doing so fulfil their uses, and work out the ends
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40114:32"/>
of their creation. So we see they are the preservation of the world,
and consequently they must needs be truly, what God saw they were,
when He had made them all, very good. Those of them indeed
that are determin'd by their nature to one course, which they can
neither err from, nor discern that they observe, not morally good;
because there is no place for vertue, since there is none for choice in
such determinations. But then there is a creature that hath faculties
to understand and chuse, and which hath principles imprest upon
him, that inable him for apprehension, judgment, and discourse
of reason, and by consequence who is onely able, as to understand
himself, so also to find out the nature and the uses of the rest, and
therefore who alone is capable and fit to be the Lord of them, and
was made so, and hath therefore ends above the ends of all the rest;
whose nature also, as the others were, (there being the same reason
of them all) was a law to it self, to regulate his actings, even all
his apprehensions, judgings, reasonings, and his choices. Now if
he also do not turn aside from the line of direction, which his being
do's incline him unto, in pursuance of the aims of a nature that is
rational and was made for society, his actings must be good, that
is, fit for the uses, which he was design'd for, and it is not possible
that they can fail his Makers ends, and consequently must be well
pleasing to his great and wise and good Artificer, since so they ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
the goodness of the workmanship. But yet if he neglect and
violate the laws of his own being, and as he corrupts himself, so also
being Lord of other creatures, if he employ them not to their own
uses, but abuse them, make them serve irregular and vitiated pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
this male-administration cannot but renverse the state of
things. Thus acting he not only puts himself by those ends he was
made for; but defeats God of his aims in the creation of the rest,
by putting them to uses that despite him meerly, stand in perfect
opposition to his wisdom, holiness, and goodness, all his attributes,
and work out nothing but disorder and destruction, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
are bad and most displeasing to their Maker, and since these
(as the other good ones were) are don discernedly and with delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and choice, they are therefore morally so. So that actions
of men in themselves, and by the rules of nature, may be morally
good and well pleasing in Gods sight, or the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Yea which will follow from the premises, and which I only toucht
before, altho there were no law of a superior being, which requir'd
that man should live conformable to his own nature, and to those
impressions and notices, which in his making have bin stampt upon
him, to direct and regulate his actings, yet his very nature, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
made or hapning, being such a rule to all his works, would
have the reason of a law to him: for as with them that grant such a
Superior and Creator, that very supreme being, tho he be Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
can do all things, yet there are such things, that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for him to do, they are so bad, and all his actions are most
infinitely good, not by reason of a conformity to the precepts or
prohibitions of a law; for none such can be set to God, but merely
as they are conformable to the most infinite perfection of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
So abstracting from all law of a superior being, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40114:33"/>
man in his own nature as a rational sociable creature, and
relating to the place and station he fills in the Universe, his actions
would be good or bad by disagreeing or conformity to that; and
he that acts in opposition to it, is as mischeivous, yea as unnatural
a thing as if one of the Elements of the world, or any cheif ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
of its making, should have chang'd its operations, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
not be it self, but the disorder and the pest of all the other.
We seem indeed astonisht seeing heavy bodies to put off their nature
and ascend, and we rack principles to find out causes: when the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
man, that acts daily against his reason, is the same constant
prodigy: the man, that pours down streams of intemperance, until
they mount into the throne of reason and quench the little spark
that's seated there, is as unnatural a thing as a stream climbing up a
wall, and every Sinner is as much a monster as a stone falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
do's as much against his nature, reason; is indeed a greater
monster. For when those other things do leave their nature, 'tis
either from some violence in the efficient; if water mount, 'tis by
the force of engine or some other pressure, or, as some say, from
violent impulses of a final cause: 'tis for the preservation of the
whole community of natures; for if it be to avoid vacuities, it is so,
and it do's against its own inclination, onely for the strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
there is for the benefit of the Universe: but the wicked man,
that lives against the dictates of right reason, his own nature, is
urg'd to it by no violences but those of wilfulness, is pusht on by no
engine but a naughty heart, nor hath he any higher ends that make
impulse upon him, but he is onely passionate for unworthy ruine,
violent for an unreasonable destruction.</p>
                  <p>The Heathens were so sensible of Natures obligation in man to
live virtuously according to reason, that they call'd the doing so

                     </gap>, as if there had bin an engagement to it in his very

                     <hi>Arrian</hi> upon <hi>Epict,</hi> tells

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>thou hast destroy'd the man in thee
in having not kept nature's word, but broke the promise, which thy very
being made for thee.</hi> As if mans nature undertook as solemnly he
would be virtuous, as the fire's nature does assure that it will burn.</p>
                  <p>But we who profess also to believe, that God made man in his
own image, consequently must needs grant, that so far as he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
on him the likeness of that nature, whose perfections, as they
are most infinite and immutable, so they are a necessary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
rule of goodness to those beings that are transcripts of
his being, so far therefore he hath planted in us rules of good,
which since they are deriv'd from our supreme Lord and Creator,
must have the force of law to us, and are that which the Scripture
calls the <hi>Law written in our hearts,</hi> whose dictates (howsoever slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vain men think of vertue, that it is but an emty name, or at the
best but politic contrivance without any real grounds in nature)
have yet their causes as eternal, are themselves as immutable, not
onely as mans nature, but as Gods, of which mans is the draught and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40114:33"/>
image, and are justly call'd participations of those forme of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that are in God, of which they are the prints; and amongst
them none more lively then the rule of Mercy, the thing that God
do's prefer here, when he sais, <hi>I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice.</hi>
Whence we observ'd, that amongst all those actions, which have
an intrinsic honesty, and are of their own nature in themselves mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
good, and well-pleasing to God, those of Mercy are in an
especial manner such; the second thing I was to speak to, <hi>for I will,</hi>
saith he, <hi>have Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word here <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies benignity, and by it is meant all
love and kindness, the exercise of the habit of mind, that disposeth
a man to do all the good he can to every man, in what condition
soever. Now to prove that human nature hath implanted in it
principles of universal kindness, and propensions to have friendship
to, have pity on, do good to one another, I shall not urge what
<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 17. 26.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>God made of one blood all the nations of the earth,</hi>
tho certainly in that one kindred there be an obligation to the dear
affections of near relatives. But if all would grant that one blood, it
would, I fear, prevail not much, for now adaies nearness of kindred
is not apt to make close friendships and concernes for one another,
if an interest chance to interpose: however one blood, when it is
divided so and scatter'd, hath not force to warm and spirit strong
affections or to cement much.</p>
                  <p>But this I will take confidence to urge, that in the latitude of
creatures none is born with so much need of mercy, as a man: none
wants so many helps to be brought forth, none leaves the parent,
that did bear it and should nourish it, in so weak and helpless a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
(I speak as to the generality,) 'tis merely others pity and
assistance that they live: and then if mercy, others help be the most
pressing and the first necessity of humane nature, the return of
mercy, pitying and helping others is the first and the most pressing
obligation on that nature. To go forward; as this state of infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
demonstrates nature did intend him for society, since without
that 'tis not onely most impossible that he can be that rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ever can exert the faculties of speech and the discourse of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which yet 'tis plain nature hath fitted him for; but also most
impossible that he can be brought up to be so, when he is so, 'tis so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
alone that still preserves him, and 'tis onely mutual good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
that preserve society. <hi>Nam quo alio tuti sumus quam quod mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis
juvamur officiis,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca l. 4. de Benef.</hi> c. 18. and mans life
subsists, is furnisht and rose onely by commerce of kindnesses, by
helping one another: take him single, and what is he but the prey
of any beast almost? <hi>vilissimus &amp; facillimus sanguis,</hi> the cheapest
blood and easiest to be spilt. Those creatures that are born in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts,
and born for them, are all arm'd, but nature gave no strength
to man besides the kindness and assistances of other men; take
away them, by which alone it do's subsist, and the whole kind must
perish. But so far you labor to take them away, as you believe not
to be good, kind, merciful, and assisting is not a thing of it self ill
and unnatural, which it must needs be; and the contrary most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
when as nature hath provided onely that, as instrument of its
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40114:34"/>
security and preservation. So far is the accursed principle of self
interest and of mans just right to do what e're he lists to others,
howsoever mischeivous it be, if he conceive the doing of it useful
to himself, from being any principle of nature, that the first voice
of nature teacheth us the direct contrary. And whosoever he be
that is, I will not say unjust to others, but not kind, friendly, and
apt to do good to them; he that hath regard for onely self,
and mesures all by his own inclinations and interests, is such a
thing, if nature onely judg of him, as ought to have bin expos'd
when he was born, and to have no pity shew'd him, when in teares
and in his blood he cri'd for it; he should be still abstain'd and sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from, as one whom Nature her self excommunicates, as one
who is no part of human society, but the proper native and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
of the desert. But he that is unrighteous, who by worng whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of violence or fraud or but of debt makes his own satisfactions,
that to serve his uses and occasions dares take, or but detain from
others what is due to them, and supports his pomp and plenty with
that, which of right ought to cloth and feed others; and so eats
the bread and drinks the tears, and, may be, blood of Creditors;
he that is so unmerciful as to be thus cruel, tho Almighty God were
silent, even Nature would her self prosecute such a person with her
out-cries, as we do fire, when 'tis broke out and rages, for he is all
one; fire also spreads and seises all it can come near, whether mans
or Gods house, to make fuel for it self and to encrease its blaze: so
that the other should be lookt upon with the same dreads and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency,
for he is the same disorder in the frame of Nature, and
in this the voice of Nature is the voice of God, which is our other
medium to discover what is natural. Now since we have declar'd,
that natural vertue is in man the imitation of God, is as it were the
workings off of those forms of goodness that are in him, and the
lines and rules of it are but the lineaments of his perfection, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> will
be easy to evince, that the rule for mercy is a most important law
of Nature, since the practice of it is so natural to God himself. Now
to prove this, passing by all other methods of probation, I shall
content my self with that one declaration of himself he made,
when he proclaim'd himself<note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 34. 6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and
gracious, long suffering and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping
mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity transgression and sin, and that
will by no means utterly cut off the guilty,</hi> (so I understand it out of
<hi>Jer. 46. 28.) will not make a full end, a clear riddance of them, when
I visit.</hi> God seems here to have taken flesh in his expressions e're he
was incarnate, that he might have words to phrase his goodness in:
and he had bowels of mercy before he was made man, and yet all
this, he says, are but the <hi>back parts</hi> of his goodnes <hi>Exod. 33. v. ult.</hi>
but that of it which we meet with in his dealings with the Sons of
men, as we see it <hi>à posteriori,</hi> and in its effects here: but the face
and glory of it was so bright and dazeling, that he tells his friend
there <hi>Moses,</hi> that 'twas not possible for him <hi>to see it and live.</hi> Yet
now S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>God hath given us the light of the knowledg of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God in the face of Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 6. Indeed there was Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
of mercy, and more too; humanity was taken in, that God
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40114:34"/>
Almighty might be able to bestow more then himself, and all that
he might shew compassion on us men. It seems, O Lord, thou
wilt have <hi>Mercy,</hi> yea and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> too. If thou require such an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
as the Sacrifice of thine own blood and of thine own Son,
that thou mightest have mercy on us; and then let men dispute,
that vindicative justice is essential to God, that sin and its punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are annext by as unchangable necessity as Gods Attributes are
to his being, and that by the express exigence of his nature he no less
necessarily executes it, then the fire burns: we may well be content
it should be so, when this strict necessity, if such there were, did
but make way for, was subservient to the ends of infinite Mercy,
and by that demonstrates, that benignity, compassion and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
are much more the inclinations of his nature, and if he
intended man in any thing his image, sure he did in mercy;
therefore do's our Savior charge us, <hi>be yee merciful as your heavenly
Father is merciful,</hi> who as he had no other reason to create the
world, so 'tis most certain, that he had no other reason to redeem it.
That Oeconomy was intended as the means of mercy to poor Sinners
in reducing them, which is the Mercy my third observation speaks
of, which was this; that of all acts of Mercy those are best and most
well-pleasing in Gods sight, which are emploi'd in the conversion
of Sinners: that was such, for which our Savior is here pleading,
when he saith, <hi>I will have Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here I mean not such conversions as they are emploi'd about,
who compass sea and land, not so much to convert men from the
evil of their waies, to the true real practice of Christianity, as to
convert them to their Church: to which men would not go so fast,
but that by the debauch of all good Christian discipline, there are
such easy absolutions to be had, tho men be not converted from
their evil waies; for it is impossible to find a Church or a Religion
in the world, which men may sin so hopefully and comfortably in,
as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it now stands. But these busy Agitators of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
besides that they convert not men to Catholic Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but to a name, and indeed faction, have made <hi>Catholic</hi> a word
of party: if they should multiply, we should soon find, they would
have Sacrifice, not Mercy. I do not mean their Host, that <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium
incruentum,</hi> bloody Sacrifices, we know, are a main part of
their doctrine and their practice, who have us'd to turn whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
into shambles for their Church's sake, and make bonfires with
burnt-offerings of their fellow Christians. But waving these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,
those the proposition speaks of, are such, as reduce Sinners
from their evil doings, to the universal faithful practice of all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and all piety.</p>
                  <p>Now of all acts of Mercy, that those, which endeavor this, are
best, Nature herself would judg: since they do aim at reinstating
man, the crown of all her workmanship, in the integrity and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Nature, which is his own true perfect state, and is therefore
the most proper and best for him, as relating to that state. But
God, who beyond that design'd to make man, who had faln from
his own nature, to <hi>partake of the Divine Nature,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> saith
2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. and in order to it <hi>call'd us to glory and vertue,</hi> v. 3. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40114:35"/>
but account that kindness, which endeavors the recovery of
Sinners from corruption and misery, to the state of vertue, and so
on to glory, and to be partakers of his Nature, as a kindness that is
in great degree Divine. And certainly, if acts of Mercy be, as we
have seen, so well pleasing to God, 'tis certain, that the acts of
greatest Mercy must be most well-pleasing; and it is as certain, that
those Mercies are the greatest, which releive from greatest miseries,
and invest with highest blessedness: but the eternal happy prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the Penitent, and the as infinite and immortal torments,
that await the Sinner, transcend all comparison with other things.
Both of them indeed were propos'd in Mercy, Hell it self was
threatned merely in compassion, to affright our passage, and to
make our entry inaccessible. 'Tis true it must be executed on the
final impenitent, that God may be true; he is engag'd in his vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to inflict it, and yet he scarce knows how to do it, or to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish:
<hi>How shall I give thee up, O Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee,
O Israel? My heart is turn'd within me, my repentings are kindled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>
Hos. 11. 8. Since thou wilt not do it, not turn, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,

it. Would you know the value of that kindness, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors
to reform such Sinners, it was worth the Incarnation of
the Son of God, <hi>the Word was made flesh</hi> purposely <hi>to call such to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi>
so my text saith, <hi>I came to call Sinners to repentance.</hi> But
to call them to it, Lord! out of thine own mouth we will challenge
more from thee; for thou didst answer to this very same reproch of
being a guest to one that was a Sinner, <hi>The Son of man came to seek
and to save that which is lost</hi> Luke 19. 10. not to call onely, but to
seek; and how, he shews you in the Parable, <hi>chap. 15. v. 4, 5. What
man of you having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave
the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he find it? and when he hath found it, he laieth it on his shoulders
rejoicing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sinner he hath straid into by paths, gon away from the
Shepherd of his soul, is a lost sheep; but yet when he is gon his
farthest, is in mazes, knows not which way to betake himself, then
this good Shepherd do's not onely call, invite to a return, or (as
the Father in the Parable) run to meet him in his coming back,
but goes himself to seek him, seems to mind the recovery of each
single one that's lost, and contributes as carefully to his return, as
if that one were all his charge, and the whole flock not dearer to
him then that sheep, <hi>he leaves the ninety and nine</hi> to seek that one,
and he seeks <hi>till he finds it,</hi> and then <hi>laies it on his shoulders:</hi> the
wandring sheep it seems had strai'd till it was weary, and had tir'd
it self with running from its Shepherd, so as that it neither could
come nor be driven home; but that too is provided for, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is carried: that none, how far soever he hath gon away,
may yet despair of coming back. This sheep had wandred to so
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40114:35"/>
great a distance, and to so much weariness, that he was fain to be
born back, when he was found. Yea and the burden was most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
for <hi>he laid it on his shoulders rejoicing:</hi> assure thy self he
will refuse no burden for thy sake, who was willing to bear the Cross
for thee; be but contented to be found by him, and he will carry
thee with gladness, &amp; the joy will spread it self to Heaven also, <hi>v. 7.
There is joy in heaven over one Sinner, that repenteth.</hi> The kindness,
that effects this, is worth a triumph in Gods presence among all,
God, Angels; it is worth a passion of the Son of God, it is fit to
make a joy in Heaven, and fit to make the Lord of Heaven descend
to earth, and to the grave for it. Nor yet content with having
don all this himself, he gave his Spirit to ordain and qualify a state
of men to agitate this onely work to the worlds end. For saith
<note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 5: 20.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul, <hi>we are Ambassadors for Christ, as tho God did beseech you by
us; we pray you in Christs stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not whether the Ambassadors are likely to prevail, in
what the Son himself hath fail'd; and whether Gods beseeching
us will do that, which his dying for us hath not yet bin able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
or whether they that come with the same Ambassy, have
not reason to expect the same unkind reception: for it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if that Message, which did cause <hi>Christ</hi> to be crucifi'd and his
Heralds martyr'd, which was so unwelcome, that they shed the
blood of intire. Nations almost to extinguish it, and lay'd wast
whole Regions to extirpate it, should not now be any whit more
grateful: for without all doubt men love their vices now as well as
ever, and indeed 'tis hard to love the men, that come to tear their
bosome inclinations from their heart, whose words are corrosives and
caustics, lances, sawes, and whatsoever other instruments, that serve
to mortify and to cut off; men that design to sower all their satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
they have in the world, by throwing in the thoughts of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
guilt and after torments, whom if they beleive not, they must
needs despise, and hate them for assuming so to check and censure,
lay such black dooms on their actions; if they do beleive them,
they must needs be tortur'd by them, feel convulsions, wracks
within at their discourses, and by consequence cannot much affect
them. 'Tis hard not to be enemies to them, who, tho they say they
come to treat a reconciliation, are Ambassadors of war, and whose
commission 'tis<note n="e" place="margin">Isaiah 58. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>to cry aloud, not spare, but lift up their voice like a
trumpet</hi> to proclaime defiance, sound a charge against them, and
to <hi>shew the people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins.</hi>
Now to be told of faults, to have ones bosome ript up, and the guilt
displai'd, was hardly ever acceptable; good counsel, admonitions
and reproofs never have bin welcome, and then how should they
be so, whose office 'tis to bring them, and who are, as the Wise
Man saith, <hi>Ordain'd to reproving.</hi> But 'tis as unhappy sure, as 'tis
unreasonable to dislike the greatest kindnesses for being such; if
mercy shall be thought to merit hate, because it is the highest mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
what then shall oblige? The poor man does not scorn the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that is sent to cloth his nakedness, or the food that is bestow'd
upon his croaking, clinging bowels, tho the very almes betoken
and discover the necessity, he hath yet no malice to his Benefactor
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40114:36"/>
therefore: but the perishing naked soul thinks, he that labors to
releive her wants, upbraids her with them, and the invitations
therefore to the <hi>Supper of the Lamb,</hi> the offers of the <hi>wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
of the <hi>robe of Immortality provoke her.</hi> Men allow the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
yet to tell them of those maladies, that have guilt in them,
and receive prescriptions from him of such methods of severity and
discipline, as few would go thro to Heaven, and all this endears the
man: but he that shall attemt an application to the vice, which is
the cause of all this, to remove which is the onely possible way to
secure from relapses, and the certain way to health and life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
he is judg'd a mortal enemy, as if there were nothing in the
world so dear to men as their sins are, no kindnesses, but what are
shew'd to those, are grateful; that were true love that would see
them, let them perish everlastingly, and not speak to them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them; as if all benefaction to the soul were injury, and the
mercies, that have in them Heaven and Eternity, were meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiances.</p>
                  <p>But how irksom however such conversations are, as by admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or whatever other methods aim at the recovery of Sinners,
they are the onely conversations with them that can be justified.
For, which is the fourth and last thing that I am to speak to,</p>
                  <p>'Tis onely the opportunity and the design and hope of doing
good to Sinners, by reforming them, that can make familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with them excusable and lawful; I mean where the duty of a
Relation does not oblige to it.</p>
                  <p>And first, I will not give my self the trouble to find out a law of
God among the <hi>Jews</hi> forbidding to converse at all with Heathens,
and by consequence with open Sinners, which might give occasion
to this question of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> since S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> tells <hi>Cornelius
Acts 10. 28. Ye know, that it is an unlawful thing for a man, that is a
Jew, to keep company, or come unto one of an other Nation:</hi> and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior,
when he would prescribe the distance, which his censures were
to make men keep, from any refractory Sinner, words it, <hi>let him
be unto thee as an Heathen or a Publican,</hi> as supposing they were not
to company with those; and in the Text he also reckons the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of that distance from all Sinners as a duty, calls it <hi>Sacrifice,</hi>
and justifies his doing otherwise by this plea onely, that he came to
them <hi>to call them to repentance.</hi> But if a command be call'd for, we
have several, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 11. Now I have written to you, not to company,
if any man, that is call'd a brother, i. e.</hi> professeth himself a Christian,
<hi>be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard,
or an extortioner, with such a one no not to eat,</hi> and the like: 2 <hi>Thess.
c. 3. v. 14. If any man obey not our word, note that man, and have no
company with him;</hi> adding <hi>v. 15. Yet count him not as an enemy, but
admonish him as a brother.</hi> The Converse is therefore lawful onely,
as an opportunity of admonition. For</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if it be lawful otherwise, I might ask, for whom? not
for the Clergy-man most certainly, whose calling it is to admonish,
and he is false and trecherous to his office, as well as his company,
if he do not, who is set God's Watchman, to give notice of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching
dangers, &amp; who is responsible for every soul that perisheth
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40114:36"/>
for want of warning; nor the Magistrate, who if he see vice, by his
office is as much oblig'd to punish it, as the Clergy-man to preach
against it. He also is <hi>the Minister of God to execute wrath,</hi> as the
other is to denounce it, whose easiness is much more baneful then
the others silence, and makes all those faults, which by not punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it does encourage, and by that is more unmerciful to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
then arbitrary tyranny, and is guilty of that blood it does
forbear to shed; and as not for these, so not for any one, since re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
and admonitions have bin the duty of every person from the
beginnings of Religion <hi>Lev. 19. 17. Thou shalt not hate thy brother
in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor, and not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
sin upon him.</hi> Silence then in Gods esteem is enmity, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
perfect hatred; and indeed to labor to preserve a man from
perishing eternally does look like kindness: but if this kindness be
too sower, and sullen for this present age that will not bear corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
and in opposition to Gods judgment calls that hatred, looks
upon it as a provocation and affront, and answers it with a defy,
and with the retributions of a mortal injury; yet there are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, which God hath made as fences merely to secure our
virtue, charging both in general of Sinners: <hi>My son, walk not thou
in the way with them, refrain thy foot from their path</hi> Prov. 1. 15.
and also in particular of almost every sin: <hi>Make no friendship with
an angry man, and with a furious man thou shalt not go; least thou
learn his waies, and get a snare to thy soul,</hi> Prov. 22. 24, 25. and
<hi>look not upon the wine when it sparkles:</hi> and <hi>sit not by a woman</hi> &amp;c.
so that merely to converse with these sollicitations to sin is the
breach of commands, which commands if they should be onely
methods of security, not rules of express duty, yet not to observe
them is to slight the onely Antidote Gods wisdom could prescribe
against contagion, and that man, that do's so, do's assume to
guard himself, and so devests himself of the protection of Gods
Grace and Holy Spirit; and then, if he fall, he is not onely guilty
of the fault that he commits, but of wilful contemtuous refusal of
the means of preservation from it, of design indeed to make the
sin unavoidably to himself: for such familiarities express, that he
desires to be engag'd in the necessity of sinning. For he that does
invite the danger, and converse, and play with the temtation, can
have no other ends, but to be ensnar'd and taken.</p>
                  <p>Now judg of your selves, I pray you, whether he that do's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
to pluck out the right eye, if it offend, and cut off the right
hand and foot, that with such torment to our selves we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave
our selves of those so useful organs, whether for the ornament
or the necessities of our being, if we find that we shall be betrai'd by
them, and who requires it on this penalty, that otherwise we shall
be cast with both ours eies, and hands, and feet into Hell fire; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be likely to excuse the conversation with those objects, that
engage our eies, and poyson our souls thro them; or else will allow
me, by thrusting my self thus into temtations, to lay violent hands
upon sin and destruction, who commands me to cut off my hand
rather then touch vice. Or else will he give me leave to run into
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40114:37"/>
the snare, who bids me cut my foot off rather then be taken; sure
he suppos'd we would be willing of our selves to divorce and tear
our selves from the allurements and occasions, who thought it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
to prescribe such easy remedies as to avoid them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of us, that when the allurements shall surprize, or force
themselves upon our senses, we tear out the organ rather then yeild
and be overcome. Or he thought at least, that altho the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of my vices are grown dearer to me then mine own eies, their
converse more useful and more necessary to my satisfaction then
my hand or foot is to me, yet to pluck out, cut off, and cast all
from me.</p>
                  <p>But were I proof against temtation, and perfectly secure from
the contagion of such conversation, yet 'tis</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, less excusable in respect to Gods concern then any
other. To sit and see vertue not onely violated and deflour'd with
loose unclean discourses, but like <hi>Thamar</hi> then thrust out of
doors, despis'd, Religion scoft, and turn'd in ridicule; all that is
Holy laugh'd at and profan'd, and Gods Lawes vilifi'd, his Word
burlesqu'd and droll'd upon, his Name blasphem'd and himself
raill'd, curst, renounc't, yea and deni'd a being; and hearing this,
I do not say to find delight and entertainment in this sort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
for none, but those that are of reprobate minds, can do that
possibly, take pleasure in that which hath nothing in the world to
recommend it, but the boldness of the villany: but to sit patient
without any least sense of resentment, as one that had not any least
concern for God Almighty's honor or his being, is ingratitude to
such a bulk and brutishness of guilt, as is beyond the power and art
of aggravation, or indeed expression. It was not onely death
by Gods Law to dishonor or blaspheme his Name, but at the hearing
it, tho but in repetition by a Witness, all the <hi>Jews</hi> that were in
hearing were oblig'd to rent their garments, as their Laws assure
us in their <hi>Talmud.</hi> Yea we find the Courtiers in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 36. 22.
coming with their cloths rent to King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to report the
words of <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> an Alien, who but in a message from his own
King had spoken sleightly of their God; and the High Preist,
whom it was forbid to in most cases, in such did it. And one would
think that it should rent our hearts, of which the other was but a
Symbolic Ceremony, and implied that duty. To hear one slight
tho but by inadvertency a person, whom some one or other of the
company hath the least relation, or but any little obligation to, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
that person by the laws of honor indispensably to call for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
To touch the reputation of a Mistress, or what's worse,
and own'd to be so, ought, they say, to be no otherwise then fatally
resented: and these are accounted such just causes of mens indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that a man that's unconcern'd, will take it for a glory to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
in them, and he that never had the honor to be drunk in the
man's company, will venture to be kill'd and to be damn'd for him
in such a quarrel: Therefore every man, unless he do design to
quarrel purposely, does think himself bound to forbear offences of
such kind in company, where any one's oblig'd in honor, or by
rules that men have set it, to take notice of it. Now tho it were
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40114:37"/>
prodigious insolence to urge in parallel to this, that it should seem
that God Almighty is not thought so much a friend to any, none
have such relation to him, nor on any account have reason to be so
concern'd for him, or for his honor, that men should forbear him
in their company: yet it seems dreadful after such plenties of his
blessings, Miracles of kindness in stupendous rescues and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances;
where, to pass by all those Mercies that concern Eternity,
his temporal preservations have contested with our provocations,
and overcom them, and so often that they have out numbred all
our hours, and all other numbers, but our sins: that these endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
should not yet be able to oblige us so far, as to move us, when
we hear his Laws or his Religion, or his Word and Name, or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
dishonor'd, to desire them to forbear that God, that hath bin so
kind to us; or if that be judg'd unmannerly by the Sword-men, yet
at leastwise by uneasiness and by withdrawing to assure them, that
we cannot bear the hearing it. God did once say in a severe
threatning determination,<note n="f" place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>Those that honor me I will honor, and they

things.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE address of this text is not ordinary; they use
to be directed to men for their instruction and
practice: but this do's treat with God, seems to
prescribe to and appoint him: and now not to
excuse this by a plea, that since men have bin
deaf to all addresses from this place, that have
bin made unto them, 'tis time to change the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod;
and seeing we cannot persuade men, try
if we can in that sense of St <hi>Paul</hi>'s words persuade God: but to say
for our selves when human wisdom cannot find expedients for us,
and our distresses are beyond the succors of their power or their
counsel, 'tis fit then to betake our selves to God, to plead with the
Lord, and never let him rest; and when the help of man is vain, to
to cry out, <hi>O be thou our help;</hi> and with holy confidence, <hi>thou shalt
arise and have mercy upon Sion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed addresses to God use to be made otherwise, in a petitionary
form at least; and it would seem much more to become us, if we
humbly beg'd, <hi>Arise, O God, have mercy upon Sion:</hi> yet this here in
the Text is such a form as does need nothing else, but faith in the
Petitioner to make it acceptable. There is some difference in the
reading of the latter verse, the one version rendring, <hi>for why? thy
servants think upon her stones, and it pitieth them to see her in the dust:</hi>
the other thus, <hi>for thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favor
the dust thereof:</hi> yet this is easily reconcil'd, <hi>they think upon her stones,</hi>
indeed with sorrow for, acknowledgments of their demerits, which
did call down this calamitous condition, and being passionately
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40114:38"/>
thus affected with the sense of it, they willingly receive, contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>2. That tho God is not alwais minded to succor his own <hi>Sion,</hi> yet
he hath set appointed times for that.</p>
                  <p>3. That when the Sons of <hi>Sion</hi> are affected towards her as the
Text expresses, then is usually Gods season for deliverance, his
time of mercy and of shewing favor, then the appointed time
for it is come; and then we may take holy confidence, and in
full assurance of faith say, <hi>Thou shalt arise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First of the <hi>Stones of Sion,</hi> and those <hi>in the dust. Sion</hi> was, we
know, either the City of the King, where there was the seat of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the thrones of the house of David,</hi> Psalm 122. 5. or else it was
the mountain of the Lords house; and so the stones of <hi>Sion</hi> are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the stones of the seat of Judgment, of the Throne in the dust,
or the stones of the Lords house, the Sanctuary there. Both these
therefore might be treated of, and I shall speak to both, but more
particularly to the later. And those stones may be either taken
naturally, as they are the stones of a material Sanctuary; or else
mystically, in that sense they often have in Scripture, which sais,
<hi>we as lively stones are all built up a Spiritual house.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5.</p>
                  <p>1. The stones of <hi>Sion</hi> the material Sanctuary in the dust the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
thought an object for so much pity, that some Psalms are but
the Liturgies of his pious resentments upon that occasion. <hi>Psalm</hi> 74.
is full herein, <hi>Think upon Mount Sion, where thou hast dwelt; lift up thy
feet, that thou maist utterly destroy every Enimy, which hath don evil
in thy Sanctuary, Thine Adversaries roar in the midst of thy Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and set up their banners for tokens: they break down all the
carved work thereof with axes and hammers, they have set fire upon thy
holy Places, and have defil'd the dwelling place of thy name even unto
the ground; yea they said in their hearts, let us make havock of them
all together.</hi> It is not many years since this was our complaint, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
both the house of God and of the King, the Church and
Monarchy, as if the life of one were bound up in the others life.
We saw Gods honor, at least the place where his honor dwelt, laid
in the dust; nor was it suffer'd to stay there, the stones of <hi>Sion</hi> not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40114:39"/>
allow'd to find a place for burial in that dust, which is the common
grave: the Church it self had not a Monument, nor the tombs a
sepulcher; but the very ruins were disquieted, the rubbish troubled,
and the stones and dust suffer'd a deportation, us'd as if men
thought with them to build a Sanctuary for those Sins that demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht
them, and make a Refuge for their Sacrilege. 'Tis true, to
many this seem'd no sad spectacle, nor would it now to such, as
think any occasional room, of the lowest name and usage, might
do as well for the uses of Gods service. Strange! when there was
never a Religion in the world, that did acknowledg any sort of
God, but would allot some place peculiar to his worship: with
them whose deities were Sicknesses, the Feaver had its Temple.
Yea and stranger, in a world that does devote set rooms to every
use of nature, of convenience, and of pleasure; the recreations
have a place made for them, and the meanest instruments of sport
have so; meals have one, and feasts have another, luxury hath its
offices, State hath many; chambers, antichambers, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
places, merely because there may be so many rooms of
which there is no use, for that is Pomp: if God should not have
one too, for all uses that relate to him, to meet us in with all his
train of Angels, and to bless us, and to entertain us with the food
of heaven, with himself. But whether men desire it so again, yet
so it lately was; and when his table was remov'd, his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
too was laid aside, and the Sacrament become as desolate as
the Altar, Gods houses &amp; his mysteries too in the dust, <hi>God did arise.</hi>
I cannot chuse but see that we have no such object of resentment
now, but how much farther off it is from being thus at this time, and
how much less apposite to our condition at this present, the discourse
is so much greater demonstration of what my Text affirms, that
when Gods honor is affronted thus, and his house vilified and ruin'd,
then the time for favor, the appointed time is come; and when
the stones of <hi>Sion</hi> are thrown down into the dust, his Servants
humbled too into the dust with sorrow and resentments, then God

                  <p>It was so also, if we look upon the Stones of <hi>Sion</hi> in their mystical
and figurative sense. Now altho every sincere Christian, every one
in whom, on the foundation of a true sound faith, an holy life is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructed,

S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Eph.</hi> 2. 20, 21, 22. The ends for which 'tis call'd so, seem indeed
more lively represented in the parallel resemblance of a natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Rom. 12. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 12. and that body the body of Christ
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 23. or that of which he is the head <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. from which all
Christians do receive their life and motion, their increase and
strength, no otherwise then as they are united and tied by joints and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40114:39"/>
nerves to one another and that head <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. and have all one
Spirit also 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. Of all which expressions as one end is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
such unity in the profession of their faith, and communion in
Gods public worship among Christians, as there is unity and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
between the several parts of one same person, that their union
in it should be so strict, that all their assemblies for it should make but
one body with one spirit; so another end is to assure that as in one
same body there are several parts for several uses, without which it
could not be an organiz'd, complete animal body, so in the one
body of Christ the Church too there are<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 5, 6.</note> several ministeries, offices,
and powers, some more noble, others more inferior; and the whole
body may as well be all eie, as each member in the Church a Seer,
every part be tongue, as every man a Teacher: S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> from that
Analogy deducing a necessity of several parts, and their subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
also in that 1 <hi>Cor. 12. v.</hi> 28. and accordingly, saith he, God hath
set several orders, <hi>first Apostles, after Prophets, Teachers, helps</hi> or
ministerial offices, <hi>and governments;</hi> without which governments
and which diversity 'tis as impossible it can subsist, as for a body to
see without an eie, or speak without a tongue, consult, direct and
call it self without a brain or understanding. Yet this same is
exprest all in the other body of a building, which my text relates
to; for <hi>Eph. 4. 11. Christ gave also some Apostles, and some Prophets,
some Evangelists, some Pastors, and some Teachers, for the perfecting
the Saints,</hi> compacting &amp; holding Christians together in assemblies
for Gods public worship; <hi>for the work of the ministry, for the edifying,</hi>
or building up <hi>of the body of Christ.</hi> Now this embleme to the body of
a building (as the other) is a type of Unity, but yet of several and
subordinate stations in the Churches unity. For stones however excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
squar'd &amp; fitted, are yet no parts of the structure, till they be
cemented to the rest that lean on the foundation; the number possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
may make a heap, but not a frame until they be dispos'd and
order'd in their several stations; for there are such in this body
also, every hewn stone cannot be a pinnacle nor corner stone: so
in the Church all are not capable of the same ministeries, offices, or
powers. And yet we may remember when it was so; all assum'd
all, seiz'd the offices, usurpt the powers, executed all the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
all subordination was demolisht, order broken, Governments
under foot, <hi>the stones of the Sanctuary pour'd out in the top of every
street,</hi> as<note n="e" place="margin">Chap. 4 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Jeremy</hi> laments; the <hi>Vrim</hi> and the <hi>Thummim,</hi> stones that
gave the heavenly Oracles, lost in ruins. Now then God to make
good the promis'd method of his Providential mercies, when it was
thus, when these stones of <hi>Sion</hi> were in the dust, the Ephod and the
Priests thrown into it, and the Priesthood and the Fathers of it, the
the whole life, with all its offices and powers dying, almost all that
could continue it being laid in the dust, and <hi>Sions</hi> Enimies expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the expiring of the Order: then the appointed time was
come, and God not onely did himself arise, but made a resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Church too, and from the dust these stones were again
most miraculously built into a Spiritual House.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but acknowledg that the breaches which this desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made were not wholly made up, nor were well cemented, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40114:40"/>
as uncemented breaches use to do, decai'd more and more daily;
what arts were us'd to keep them open, yea to widen them, by
whom, for what ends too, is so evident I shall not touch it. But 'tis
sure we had not much face, had no great appearance of the bodies,
that the Scripture represents the Church by: for in those that were
before broke off from her, there was no subordination, nor no order,
nor no unity; every broken &amp; divided piece of ruin took upon it self
to be the entire building, the whole body; every Faction was Christs
Church, each Assembly was his flock, his Congregation, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was onely a Spiritual riot. And when things were dispos'd
thus, then at once to break down all the poor remainders, he that
takes his place to whom Christ said,<note n="f" place="margin">Matth. 16. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou art Peter, and on this rock
I will build my Church,</hi> who yet, as not content to thrust Christ out
from being the alone foundation, <hi>then which none can lay another
true one 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 11. would be the <hi>chief head stone in the corner</hi> also,
<hi>on which whosoever should fall, shall be broken; but on whosoever it shall
fall, it will grind him to powder</hi> Matth. 21. 44. He, I say, in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of that success attemts this on the Reformation, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
on this, as they thought, tottering Church, to lay her
stones all in the dust. And truly such the instruments emploi'd are,
that humanely speaking it must seem impossible to be avoided.
For in Gods name, under the Autority of Religion, with the
greatest Sacredness that can be, they contrive the bloudiest, most ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious,
most inhumane murders, treasons &amp; assassinations imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
make the holy Eucharist the bond of their confederacy in
those so tremendous villanies, Christ's bloud becomes the very obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
both to commit, &amp; not confess them; for which end they say
and swear even at the point of death, and upon their Salvation
prov'd and confest falshoods. Now what security or guard can man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
have against such, whom no ties of Religion or humanity have
any force on? Whether these be the doctrines of their Church, tho
that be true in most part, yet it matters not to them who are to be
massacred, if they be the constant practices, and if they have such
guides of conscience as can satisfy, and thereupon engage the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that must effect them to those practices. How they do that, I
must confess, seems strange; for they yet look upon those actions, as
for which they would have absolution, therefore sins. For tho there
have bin dispensations sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> permitting them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
swear, subscribe, and do what else should be requir'd of them,
so as in mind they did continue firm, and us'd their diligence to
advance the <hi>Roman</hi> faith in secret; yet such dispensations might be
intercepted, as those were in 1580. and brought to King <hi>James</hi> in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and so might discover plots if they were us'd to give them
in all such occasions: besides that they would stare the head of
that Church in the face, betray his being privy to, and abetting
those designs of bloud, which now, if they miscarry, they can cast at
first upon some private Desperado's, and then after lye &amp; laugh them
out of mens belief. Such dispensations therefore being not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
still, they took other ways. For seven years after, <hi>Sextus</hi> V.
offering by the Bishop of <hi>Dunblain</hi> to that King a marriage with the
<hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> if he would become a Catholic, as he call'd it,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40114:40"/>
and join with them against the<note n="g" place="margin">Jesuits Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tech. l. 3. c. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>English;</hi> and this being mightily
resisted by the then Lord Chancellor, which made that ineffectual,
and who was their constant adversary, Father <hi>William Chrichton,</hi> who
had somtime bin the Rector of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> at <hi>Lyons</hi> and came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>Dunblain,</hi> sollicited one <hi>Bruce,</hi> who also had bin brought
up by the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and who was the <hi>Spanish</hi> Agent then imploi'd for
ships there (which that Duke intended should be join'd with, and
assist in their Armada) sollicited him very oft for mony to procure
the murder of the Chancellor, which he had contriv'd by several
ways; but being still deni'd, at first because his mony was not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
to him for those purposes, he could not justify such disbursment;
another time because, as to the sin, it was all one to kill a man with
his own hands, or to give mony to procure it; and that he for his
part was a private person, and had no Autority over the life of any
man, and less over that of the Chancellor, who was a chief man in
the execution of the Justice of the Land: and afterwards because
the question was about advancement of Christian Religion; now this,
he thought, would ruinate the same, in as much as men went about
to promote it by murder to the great scandal of all. But finding
himself still importun'd more, he demanded of the Father, whether
in good conscience he might consent to that enterprize, or whether
he could dispense therewithal; to which the <hi>Jesuit</hi> repli'd, that
he could not, but that the murder being committed, and he
coming to confess himself unto him, he would absolve him of it.
It seems they thought they had no further power then. Now
<hi>Bruce</hi>'s answer, tho not much concerning my part in this subject,
yet it was so honest, and the consequence so strange, that I shall
not pass it. He repli'd, sith your Reverence acknowledgeth that
I must confess my self of it, you also thereby acknowledg that I
should commit a sin; and I for my part know not whether, when I
have don it, God would give me grace and inable me to confess it:
Besides I verily believe, that the confession of a sin, which a man
hath don of set purpose intending to confess himself thereof, and
to have absolution for it, is not greatly available; and therefore
the surest way for me is not to put my self into such hazard: so it
ended. But he ran into another hazard; for the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>
dying, and the Count <hi>Fuentes</hi> Nephew to the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> in his
place, <hi>Chrichton</hi> accus'd <hi>Bruce</hi> before him, that he was a Traitor,
because he would not disburse mony to cause the Lord Chancellor
to be slain, and the process had its course, he not denying the thing,
and after fourteen months affliction was at last onely releas'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repair of his good name or damages.</p>
                  <p>But passing by this, it seems they had no other snare to draw
them in, could give them no assurance then, but in that hopes of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
absolution, which prov'd insufficient; for they found themselves
ingag'd in, and must wilfully commit crimes at the point of death,
of which they could not live to be absolv'd. I do not instance in
the perjuries of Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> tho with horrible execrations. He
cry'd mercy after; saying, that he had not thought they could have
prov'd the contrary: and he might have absolution. But <hi>Tresham,</hi>
just when dying, did deny on his Salvation things concerning
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40114:41"/>
                     <hi>Garnet,</hi> which he had confest before, and <hi>Garnet</hi> did himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
too after, yea and several others of their own persuasion unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable
persons also swore. The same words are now current
in the mouths of those that suffer, notwithstanding the express
Oaths of their Complices: as if they thought the vertue of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
were such, as that when men confess'd themselves of their
intended villanies, it absolv'd them of them e're they did them, and
of all the sins they should think needful to commit in the effecting
them. Yea more, if they should discover or confess ought tho
dying, then that vertue of the Sacrament retir'd, the absolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
void &amp; unuseful, the Sins recoil'd upon them, of which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it made them innocent, which gives them confidence on their
Salvation at the point of death to deny matters of known fact,
which 'tis not imaginable that they could do on any other, save
on that account. And that it is so, I have one irrefragable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of one executed lately for a murder of that kind in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
which is assur'd by persons of best credit in that Nation, who tho
upon flagrant evidence condemn'd, deni'd the fact at his death on
his Salvation with deep execrations as he at the place of execution
went to be turn'd off; but it pleas'd God that the rope brake pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
and he soon reviv'd, but in the greatest horror in the world;
for having with such desperate execrations deni'd his own delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
fact, and renounc'd his Salvation, he openly acknowledg'd
the falsity of his former asseverations, and own'd his being really
guilty of what was charg'd upon him; and blessing God for giving
him those moments by so strange a way to disburthen himself of
such deliberate wilful perjury, declar'd that his Confessor, when he
absolv'd him, told him, if he did discover it, that absolution would
not profit him, &amp; that he should be damn'd; but if he did not, then
he was forgiven. Such monstrous practices are made good &amp; sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
as they contribute to the laying our poor <hi>Sion</hi> in the dust; for
we have ever bin the mark of all their mischeifs. Since <hi>Pius</hi> the V.
Bull, it was observ'd there never past four years all Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>

and Church; and in the first years of King <hi>James</hi> not four months
<note n="i" place="margin">Proceed. R.</note> without Treason: &amp; they go now by the same rules, &amp; in the same
methods, with the same Oaths, &amp; the same Sacraments administred
to the same purposes. And just as they, somtimes designing open
force, &amp; somtimes private treasons &amp; assassinations; somtimes try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the softer pleas of Liberty of Conscience, toleration to do it,
yea altho it be but partial, an Indulgence to our own Sects, any thing
that may contribute to the breaches of our <hi>Sion,</hi> &amp; may keep them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen:
which 'tis said (whether in earnest or to colour Blacker pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
&amp; hide designs more violent) is now spoken of, and they hope
for, and hath still bin pleaded for, as the birthright of each Christian,
as instated on them in the very charter of their Christianity. But yet
to speak to that too, I neither find the word in Scripture, nor the
thing, as most men take it, for the Liberty of Action: and besides
this, whatever Arguments there are that press it, they can be no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for the Romanist, who never grants it; for either they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
or they do not; if not, why do they urge them? if they do,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40114:41"/>
why do they not allow them? if they can see no force in them, then
they must not use them; if they can, they must be wrought on by
them: unless to be the onely men that may do wrong and resist
reason, be their grant and Charter. But not to evade onely, I allow</p>
                  <p>1. That Christ came down to settle his Religion, plant the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith without a grant from, or the leave of Secular Powers;
when he commissioned his Apostles to conveigh the Gospel thro the
world, they did expect or ask no Pass-port from the several Princes,
but in opposition to the Magistrates and Governors and Kings,
against whom he promis'd them to justify and bear them out, they
preach'd it. I allow too</p>
                  <p>2. That he autoriz'd and gave right to Christians, as such, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
for Gods Worship and Service according to the rule of his
Religion, whatever prohibition, threats, or persecution they
should meet from Secular powers on account of doing so. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the<note n="k" place="margin">Acts 4. 5, &amp;c.</note> Apostles and their Converts did so, and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi>
gives it in charge to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> not to forbear doing so for any
fear or suffering whatsoever,<note n="l" place="margin">Hebr. 10. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>not forsaking the assembling of your
selves together, as the manner of some is.</hi> Now he that does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
that they shall do so, notwithstanding any opposition
from the Secular Powers, gives them right to do so, tho in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to those Powers: for all must have a right to do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and accordingly the Christians of the first Ages did meet for
Gods Worship against all the edicts, all the persecutions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Emperors. But</p>
                  <p>3. Tho our Savior by this grant seems to pass by those Powers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded,
or at least not taken notice of, when he gives their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Privilege to meet in public full assemblies (such as those of
Christians ought to be) without their leave, yea and against their
orders, yet does not this grant diminish or intrench upon their safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the least: because the onely men he gives it to are such, as can
design or do no hurt to any Government. For Christ conferr'd this
privilege merely on the account of that Religion which he insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
and to men as his Disciples and Followers in it. Now him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so renounc'd all pretence to any Secular interest or power, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
such obedience to his Governors tho most unjust, taught such
subjection to all in Authority whether good or bad, Patrons or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Religion, nursing Fathers to his Followers or Slaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Executioners; and hath made all this so much the temper
and the constitution of Christianity, which condemns all enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
upon any rights of others, and much more of Princes, that
it is impossible that companies of such men, that is, of such Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
such to whom alone Christ gives the privilege of meeting,
can create a danger or a jealousy in any State: men that must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
assemble, but must not resist, act, or contrive against their
Governors, but die, if they and laws will have it so, for that their
meeting. So the Primitive Christians did: so 20000 in one day at
<note n="m" place="margin">See Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol. on Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas day. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceph. l. 7. c. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Nicomedia</hi> for assembling. But men whose Principles or former
practices upon their principles have any thing that tends to sedition
in them, especially if they have us'd such meetings to foment it;
or tho they did not that, the other also, till they can give such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40114:42"/>
as will satisfy the state, of which the State is to judg, can no
more by their Christian birth-right, by Christs whether grant or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of assembling for Gods Worship, claim a privilege of such
assemblies, then notoriously sinful, scandalous Christians, or then
open Heretics can by vertue of that same injunction claim the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of the public Assemblies till they satisfy the Church: for the
Church may excommunicate these, and the State may restrain
those others, and they have no right or plea in conscience against
it. The rights he gave were given to men so far, as they should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Religion which he instituted; he gave no more privilege
to the seditious, then the scandalous. He did not by requiring
such assemblies for religious Worship mean to weaken the security
of Governments, which his Religion is above all other institutions
fram'd to settle and establish: which therefore by the grant of
Christs Religion, as well as by a right inherent in their office, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
may take care to provide for by restraints of that kind, not
at all examining mens pretension, whether their Religion or their
Principles be true or false; for that were endless and to no effect,
every mans Religion and his Principles are true to himself; but
onely if they tend towards commotions, or give cause of jealousy,
which still Governors must judg of. Which if they cannot satisfy,
they can plead no Privilege, to which they have no further right,
then as they free themselves from such suspicions. In fine they
cannot claim this on account of Christianity, since Christianity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of nothing, that is prejudicial or gives fear to Governments;
but is the basis of Obedience, the cement of Society, Ecclesiastical
and secular, it compacts all the Stones of <hi>Sion,</hi> of the House of
God, and of the seat of <hi>David,</hi> of the Sanctuary, and the Throne.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> place <hi>Romanists</hi> (and 'tis the same of
every other Sect of men, so far as they abet such Principles, or have
ever shew'd themselves in prosecution of them,) but <hi>Romanists</hi> for
instance at the present, who by all ways of assurance have convinc'd
the world, the most destructive Tenets, to government most abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the state of Christianity, are their Principles, &amp; their Faith;
as namely by the general dictates of their Schole-men, their allow'd
Theology of their Canonists: their allow'd Laws of a shole of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Councils and some general their allow'd Rule of Faith: of
their Popes their infallible Judg; and what's worse by multitudes of
practices the most inhumane that were ever heard of, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet, however call'd on or accus'd, retract or sentence; but still
justify and practise them. Since they therefore know themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of claming Toleration by the Laws of Christianity, we can
interpret them to mean no other thing by claming and endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, but to get more opportunities to destroy the Government
both of Church and State, to widen and to make more breaches in
the gaping, tottering walls of <hi>Sion,</hi> tumble down her stones into the
dust, and make their dust their grave. Nor need I discourse, how o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
turn these mercies into gall and bitterness; to contrive for
parties and widen their own interests, and the breaches of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
the outcry for liberty ending alwaies in its denial of it
to all besides themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:40114:42"/>
Such is our prospect of the stones of <hi>Sion;</hi> it looks fatal, but it
hath this Argument of comfort in it, that when <hi>Sion</hi> is in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that it is usually Gods time of mercy and of shewing favor,
then <hi>the appointed time for it is come,</hi> the next thing that I am to
speak to.</p>
                  <p>That this is ordinarily Gods time of appearing to shew mercy, is
notorious from <hi>Davids</hi> challenging his aids elsewhere upon the
same account <hi>Psal. 119. 126. It is time for thee, Lord, to work,</hi> or it
is time for Thee to put to thine hand, <hi>for they have made void thy
Law.</hi> And we shall find a reason for this way of working in that
prayer of the same King <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 1. 9. 26. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Help me O Lord my God; O save
me according to thy mercies, that they may know that this is thy hand,
and that thou, Lord, hast don it.</hi> When our distresses are beyond the
succors of means power and counsels, if deliverance come, we must
needs know 'tis from above. The Prophet speaks of men, as apt to

                     <hi>sacrifice to their net, and burn incense to their drag</hi> with which they

Nation fast and pray, and she adventures, and God gives her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
with the King, and he reverses all; and the whole Nation on
that very day it was to perish is secur'd, and the design returns
upon their heads that plotted it, on all their Enimies. I need
name no more, but there is one pregnant one, on which there lies
an imputation from great men: I mean, when throout that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
their Religion was so persecuted, that it was almost extinct,
false Heathen worship planted in its place, possessed the Temple
and the Sanctuary, and all was profan'd by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes:</hi>
the state so lively propheci'd of by the Prophet <hi>Daniel.</hi> Now when it
was thus, &amp; there was so universal a defection, as already had subvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the whole Government, Religion, and almost the whole Nation,
God stirs up the Spirit of the <hi>Maccabbees,</hi> &amp; on that day three years
that all was profan'd, 'was again purified and they deliver'd. I
instance so, least that which<note n="s" place="margin">L. 1. de Jure Belli c. 4. §. 7.</note>

rightful King: for after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death, the first that got posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it, was the King of <hi>Egypt.</hi> It was after violently taken indeed
from him by the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Jews</hi> gave up themselves to the
protection of <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Great; but he gave it in dowry to the
King of <hi>Egypt</hi> with his daughter, &amp; so parted with all right; &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
right the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> could be suppos'd to have, <hi>Antiochus
Epiphanes</hi> had none of that, as being not a lawful King of any place,
usurping from his Nephew the right Heir: and with all injurious
angry violence, when he was driven out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the attaques
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and enters it, and sets up all the Heathen Exercises and
Religion, and forbids Gods Worship; ravages and spoils and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
all refusers, till the <hi>Maccabbees</hi> oppos'd his fury, and till <hi>Judas</hi>
three years after, as I said, restor'd all, having fought against a
violent Aggressor, not his rightful Prince; and he is by <hi>Grotius</hi> made
the very man, that typ'd out <hi>Christ,</hi> and was seen by the Prophet in
<hi>Isaiah 63. Who is he that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
Bozra?</hi> to which he makes <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> answer, I that defend
Gods Worship and the true Religion, against <hi>Antiochus</hi> and all his
power, and to save my People cast my self upon extremest hazards.</p>
                  <p>Once more, when <hi>Caius</hi> Emperor of <hi>Rome</hi> had sent <hi>Petronius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Syria,</hi> charging him to make war on the <hi>Jews,</hi> and by all utmost
force to make thew condescend to let his image, the statue of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
I mean, be set up in their Temple at <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> when
he came into <hi>Syria</hi> to their Country, met him several thousands,
several times with supplications and entreaties to divert him, if
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40114:43"/>
they could from doing it. But he declaring his Commission to
them, let them see it was not possible for him to contradict the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror;
and they declar'd also, since he durst not transgress the
commands of the Emperor, he must not think it strange, if they
durst not transgress Almighty Gods command, resolving to endure
whatever should be inflicted on the, rather then violate that.
Doing this often, and in multitudes, <hi>Petronius</hi> askt them whether
they did mean on that account to fight with <hi>Caesar,</hi> and make war
against him, they repli'd they would not fight, but they could die
on that account, and prostrating themselves and offering their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
throats, shew'd their readiness to entertain their death, and
this for four daies together, and neglected all their husbandry, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
not to till their land or to provide for life, when they had
once determin'd thus to die. Upon this <hi>Petronius</hi> undertakes to
write to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and dissuade him from the enterprise; but <hi>Caius</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
that his letter with another, which commands <hi>Petronius,</hi> for
the punishment of his not executing his commands, to kill himself,
resolving also to exterminate the Nation: but before his letter
came to <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Petronius,</hi> the notice of the death of <hi>Caius</hi> came.
Thus God did then preserve both him and them, tho at that time
a Nation guilty of the death of Christ; yet in a cause, wherein they
were resolv'd to suffer any thing rather then disobey Gods Law so
grossly, he was pleas'd to spare them, and continue to preserve
them.</p>
                  <p>As for the Christians, I might instance in the care God took soon
after most expressely and miraculously to call them all out of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
when the <hi>Romans</hi> were preparing to sit down before it, and
destroi'd it utterly, and in all the persecutions, particularly that

bloud of those that differ from them. And indeed the <hi>Arrian</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
were most barbarous;<note place="margin">Constantius</note> yet when had don all he

when shortly after <hi>Valens</hi> the same again, himself repenting of it,
did revoke them, &amp; lastly <hi>Theodosius</hi> restor'd them and establisht all.
And tho afterwards God let the <hi>Goths</hi> continue both the heresy, and
somtimes the persecution, for above two Ages in our western world;
yet since that, for the last thousand years, the name of <hi>Arrian</hi> hath
scarce bin heard. But I have said enough to shew, such is the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
method of Gods Providential workings, when <hi>Sion</hi> is in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
provided that the Church have not deprav'd it self as 'tis a
Church, model'd it self by worldly principles and powers, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
rules or doctrines which are not consistent with those of Christ.
There are few instances to be produc'd, I think, where any Church
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40114:44"/>
hath bin destroi'd, whole constitution hath preserv'd this temper,
tho her wicked and ungracious members may be cut off: at last, as
<note n="z" place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 10</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> tells, <hi>after it hath suffer'd a while, he will strengthen, stablish,
settle it.</hi> And if we look upon the low condition of our <hi>Sion</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with these instances of Gods procedure, may we not take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to hope, that the appointed time is come? For is it not
time for Thee to <hi>arise,</hi> O Lord, when thy resting place is destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
And thou, O Christ, who art the Rock on which the Church
is built, is it not time for thee to awake, to rise, rebuke the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests,
break the waves that break into thy Church, and threaten
as if they would swallow all that's built on Thee, the Rock of Ages?
It is most certainly, provided we have those affections, which the
text sets down here, as the diagnostics of that time; of which in
the last place.</p>
                  <p>The first is this, <hi>thy servants think upon her stones</hi> with sorrow

that if they should arrive at that height to abhor Gods Statutes, break
all his Commandments, merit all his curses, and he should inflict
them, and yet they go on still to walk contrary to him, and he
overtake them still with plagues, yea and this thro all the stages both
of sin and punishment, and each stage of punishment seven times
multiplied <hi>v.</hi> 18, 21, 24, 28. so as to leave no more place for access,
yet if then they confess their iniquity, and <hi>their uncircumcized hearts

<hi>the punishment of their iniquity v. 41. I will not case them away, neither
will I abhor them to destroy them utterly, and to break my Covenant
with them, v. 44. but will remember my Covenant, and I will remember
the Land, v.</hi> 42. and remember <hi>Sion</hi> also, if we have the like senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for <hi>Sion;</hi> if her low condition, if her stones in the dust truly
humble us into that dust, and make us from the heart acknowledg,
<note n="a" place="margin">Neh 9. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou, O Lord, art just in all that is come upon,</hi> and hovers over us;
<hi>for thou hast don right, but we have don very wickedly:</hi> for we have
walkt unworthy of the opportunities thou hast afforded us, have

the Kingdom of God hath had no Obedience, nothing but Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion

Prophets, Prophets that should daub with untemper'd mortar, such
as never will cement the stones of <hi>Sion,</hi> or build up a Church; that
we, who have debaucht the Reformation, should quite loose it.
The present time does certainly suggest the practice, which is set
aside for great humiliation, and the occasion does require it; both
the commands and the necessities too of the Church expect it;
&amp; God also calls for mourning, &amp; for stricter applications to him on

behalf of <hi>Sion:</hi> and then they that do not answer all these calls by
doing somthing more then ordinary do not think upon the stones
of <hi>Sion,</hi> neither does it pity them to see her in the dust, 'tis certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not time for God to arise in their behalf, they are sufficient to
divert his preparations for her. No O Lord, <hi>we will put our hands
upon our mouths, and our mouths into the dust, and acknowledg righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
belongeth unto thee, but to us confusion of face, as at this day;</hi>
and we resolve to humble our selves under thy correcting hand how
sharp soever, and <hi>take pleasure</hi> in it too thus far, that dost shew by
thy castising us thou hast not given us over as incorrgible, but hast
taken us into thy care, and discipline, and managery; and on
that account thy rod comforts us, our correction is joyous, <hi>we take
pleasure in the stones of Sion, and we favor,</hi> love <hi>her dust;</hi> the other
Symtom.</p>
                  <p>They prize her reliques, wht is standing of her; and since 'tis
on their account, namely thro their demerit, that she is so low and
weak, they are more tender, love, and pity her more in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
which they brought her into; will do what they can to raise
her, <hi>pulverem ejus evehere cupiunt</hi> in the <hi>Tigurine</hi> Translation.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true indeed the stones of <hi>Sion in the dust</hi> are apt to become
<hi>stones of stumbling and rocks of offence, as</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> saith of the <hi>chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
stone</hi> of <hi>Sion,</hi> Christ hmself 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8. whereat many stumble
and fall. We had fatal experience how when once the building
was disorder'd, the subordination broken, the Church offices and
powers thrown down, on the one side <hi>Sion</hi> strait became like <hi>Babel,</hi>
every one almost spoke a strange language, and so built by himself,
built up, divided Faiths, and Churches, and Religions; on the other
side that broken tottering State made many run away as from a
falling Church, take shelter in another: and what the Cross of
<hi>Christ</hi> was to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Cross of his Spouse too was to many
pretended Christians, a ground to renounce her. They no sooner
saw their Mother wounded, naked in the dust, but they concluded
her fit to be buried, and ran from her as from the house of death;
as if in the noblest way of sufferings to follow Christ could look like
the mark of being Anti-Christian: and the yet unsettled state of it
is made great use of for the same intents, her stones are laid on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to be stones of stumbling and to give occasion of falling.
And truly 'tis to be confest, that since the bonds of Government,
which kept men under discipline, were unloos'd, and since the
Churches Ministeries and her Powers are cut so short, that they are
not so effectual to the ends of their institution to work out a strict
Christian life, as were to be wisht; and since men are divided so by
claims of several Churches, and by fearful expectations also, both
the Coversations and the Faiths of men too are grown loose and
dissolute: and 'twas not the least Stratagem of our Adversaries to
contrive men should be such as could, while they continue such,
find Sanctuary no where but in their Church, at their Altars; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have but to come to be absolv'd of all. But truly 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
barbarity in us, when 'tis on our account, by our demerits,
for our punishment, that she is distressed, that fears and dangers
press upon her, then to sleight her: if when we see our Mother
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40114:45"/>
gasping, then to throw dirt at her, make her mouth her mouth be stopt with
the reports of her ungodly offspring, the reproches of a pointing
Scorner, that shall cry, see how her Sons behave themselves, how
little love or pity they have for her. He favors her stones that
beautifies and guilds them with inscriptions of Religious actions;
this, if any thing, will raise them and repair her. And truly'tis to
be expected from the men that do pretend to have the pity and the
sorrow that is due to their Mother, whom the powers of Hell seem
arm'd against to ruin her, so far as she's disabled, should themselves
supply to themselves what is wanting: if her discipline be loosen'd,
and she have no strong ties on mens actions, we should do her work
upon us, put obligations, fetters on our selves. 'Tis probable this
very state of <hi>Sion</hi> in the text was that, which <hi>Nehemiah</hi> labour'd to
repair, and see how he effected it <hi>c.</hi> 9. after a most solemn fasting
and confession and bemoaning, rather of their guilts then sufferings,
in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> himself, the Princes, and the Priests and Levites, and he
rest of all the People with their Wives, their Sons and Daughters
that were come to understanding, <hi>entred into a curse and into an
oath to walk in Gods Law, and to observe and do all the Commandments
of the Lord our God, his Judgments and his Statutes, v.</hi> 29. Here was
a cement would compact the Stones of <hi>Sion,</hi> the whole building
against all assaults whatever, seat her in her perfect height and
beauty. It is not he loves her, who curses them that laid her in the
dust, but he who enters such a curse of serving God; 'tis not he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
her dust, who wishes, talks, or swears on the Churches side, but
he that humbles himself daily in the dust in her confessions and
Prayers, he who binds himself with such an obligation to worship
and serve God faithfully, as she prescribes: this will help to raise
her, make her visible in the lives of her Children; and when the
dust of <hi>Sion</hi> shall have a more perfect Resurrection in this world,
and this of Christ shall as his other body rise out of the earth, it will
be comfortable to each one that put his hands to the repairs, that
did but fit one stone to it, that would not let God rest till he had
establisht our <hi>Jerusalem</hi> again a praise in the Earth. Then God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
would be importun'd, prevail'd upon to put it in the hearts
of those men, whose part 'tis to secure our <hi>Sion</hi> and repair her
breaches, to build by a true line and level, make such an establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as may be fitted not to the satisfying parties, factions, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests,
or any human appetites, but the just obligations or Religion;
not build weakly, fearing, as it were, the Churches strength should
aw men in their practices, &amp; that the weapons of her warfare should
gall their vices, besides that their own strong holds may be still able
to hold out, and not be beat down by her forces: for this were to
model the structure of <hi>Sion</hi> to mens own, and to their sins conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience.
But to build her up so, as that the profession and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of true Religion may be preserv'd safe, and Gods Worship kept
intire; that upon our one onely foundation, the rock <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi>
we may be built up with <hi>a lively faith into an holy life,</hi> all cemented
by Charity, and all divisions be made up, and we may with one
heart and one voice meet and join in giving Glory, Honor, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>

or stumbling blocks in any Christians course: and therefore in my
text <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is such a conscience, as does not induce the
man himself to any sin against God or man, and a life that is not
led into it; a conversation that is according to such a conscience, is
that which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> aims to have, and which that we may have, all
such <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> we must endeavor to remove, which what they are,
I told you, was to be my first inquiry.</p>
                  <p>And the first is error of judgment, which makes an erring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
such a one as gives false information of duty, which either
tells me that I may or must do that which God's law or some other
law in force upon me saies I must not do, or else tels me I must not
do that which I may, or am perhaps bound to do. A rock of offence
this, upon which many men do split, and make ship-wrack of a
good conscience; and which is worse error of judgment, call'd by
some new light, is such a light indeed, so plac'd between the rocks
as must needs guide the Mariner upon them, make it necessary for
him to be wreckt; for in this case sin lies on the right and the left
hand, which way soever he does turn, he falls upon it. For first if
this man act against his erring conscience, he sins, altho the Law
of God do not make the act sin <hi>Rom. 14. 14. to him that esteemeth
any thing unclean, to him it is unclean;</hi> altho S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> saies there, he
knew it was not in it self unclean, yet so it was to him, and that to
such an height, that the man whose example wrought with any
one to eat against the perswasion of his mind <hi>destroieth him</hi> v. 15. 'Tis
therefore a destroying sin to do a thing against the express judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the mind. And all the reason in the world; for since good
or evil do not, nor can move the will as they are in themselves such,
but as apprehended, and according to the notion we have of them in
the mind: 'tis certain therefore every motion of the will to good or
evil, consequently every good or evil action must be formally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
such from good or evil things not in themselves, but in the
apprehension of the mind; that is, according as our consciences di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
to us they are good or evil. And indeed no law of God or man,
no rule of duty can be appli'd to us but by the mediation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
for till that tell me such a thing's commanded and my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
it is to me as if there were no such command and it were not my
duty, for till then I am not conscious it is, know nothing of it. This
alone therefore does propose and apply duty to us; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whether that which it proposeth be my real duty in it self or no,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40114:46"/>
yet I must needs look on it as so, as having no direction in the world
besides what to do or forbear, but what my conscience some way
instructed tells me, God or my Governors require: while therefore
that does absolutely tell me such a thing is unlawful whether it be
so or no, while that perswasion lasts, the soul yet judges it unlawful,
and consequently if the heart embrace it, then it does deliberately
embrace unlawfulness, which tho it be not in the thing, is yet in the
choice. I like and follow that which in my judgment is vicious,
and be it in it self what it will, 'tis so to me; 'tis evident the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and actions pursue vice, when they pursue that which they
cannot look upon but as vice. And therefore S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> saith<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>what
soever is not of faith,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is contrary to the persuasion or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of lawfulness, <hi>i. e.</hi> in other words, what is against conscience <hi>is
sin.</hi> Conscience therefore is the rule from which it is sin to recede.</p>
                  <p>But you will tell me, where the conscience errs, the rule is false
and crooked, and so must not be follow'd; but the rule of this rule,
God's Law, and not the conscience, must be obei'd. Good counsel if
it could be follow'd; for certainly if the man know what God's Law
does require of him, in that case his conscience does not err; if he
do not know what God's Word requires, how then can he follow it
against that which his conscience tells him God requires? and it is
sure if the man should suspend his action, or have reason not to act
according to his erring conscience, he never can have reason to act
according to a conscience well inform'd: for it is plain his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
does as much propose the error as his duty, as it does the
truth; the man as really believes the one is to be don as the other,
and hath no reason to make difference, and therefore if at any time
he must follow his conscience, he alwais must, and t'will be sin to act
against it, be it what it will.</p>
                  <p>But then you'l hope it will excuse to act according to it. No alas,
this is but the other rock, it is sin too to act according to it. The
proofs are very pregnant <hi>Gen. 12. 17. Because of Sara Abraham's
wife the Lord plagu'd Pharaoh with great plagues and all his house,</hi>
namely those that had commended her before him <hi>v.</hi> 15. and so
had contributed to the offence. On the same account he plagu'd
<hi>Abimelech</hi> Gen. 20. 17. altho in the 6 <hi>v.</hi> God saith, <hi>he knew Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech
did it in the integrity of his heart,</hi> and tho <hi>Abimelech</hi> did plead
the same to God, he did it innocently <hi>v.</hi> 5. yet in the 9. <hi>v.</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulates
with <hi>Abraham, what have I offended thee, that thou hast
brought on me and on my Kingdom a great sin.</hi> Again St <hi>Paul</hi> affirms
of his own nation <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2. that it was out of <hi>zeal</hi> to God and his
Law they persevered in infidelity and opposition to Christs doctrins,
yet for that very opposition he affirms, that they were <hi>hardned</hi> and
design'd to everlasting perdition. And Christ saith of the same <hi>Jews
John</hi> 16. 2. that <hi>the time would come, when they that kill'd his Apostles</hi>
and Ministers <hi>should think they did God service,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>think
they offer'd an oblation.</hi> The error was so strong, it made the sin
look like Religion and Attonement, yet that zeal and conscience
was plagu'd with <hi>wrath that came upon them to the uttermost,</hi> even to
an utter extirpation: or to restrain our selves to our Apostle, he
saith of himself <hi>v.</hi> 1. of the foregoing chapter, <hi>I have liv'd in all good
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40114:47"/>
conscience before God until this day,</hi> and therefore when against
Christ's reformation he defended the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Law, and persecuted
the opposers of it, he did all out of a good mind, according to the
dictates of his conscience, sincerely what he was perswaded that
he ought to do; and now if conscience could excuse, here was
enough of that, a good Conscience, and could his fiery persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by vertue of that conscience be christian'd holy Zeal? could
his pure heart make his bloody hands undefil'd? Oh no! 'twas
<note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>blasphemy, and persecution, and injury,</hi> for all 'twas conscience. If this
seem strange, that acting thus according to the conscience should
make men such sinners, since all facts are estimated cheifly by the
heart that they proceed from, by the good or bad mind they are don
with, that is, by the conscience of the doer; we must know, that where
the error is not the effect of any carnal prepossession or principle,
but truely error, there the sinfulness in this case lies not altogether
formally in acting so according to their conscience, unless first the
conscience take up perswasions &amp; give sentence without a sufficient
inquisition, when there is the least appearance of a danger that 'tis
plain such a perswasion may engage us in a state of sin, we must exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
strictly, and this seems the case of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Abimelech;</hi>
they were glad to think <hi>Sarah</hi> was <hi>Abrahams</hi> sister, therefore made
no close inquiry, were content with his once saying so, and on
that account, altho the one and afterwards the other took her in
the innocency of their heart, the text saith, they committed a
great sin, for which God did plague them. Especially <hi>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>
                     </hi> if men
have bin call'd on to consider, had the opportunity of means of
conviction, such as God will judg sufficient in their circumstances,
then retaining those perswasions, following such an error gives it
that which is equivalent to wilfulness, makes the guilt. This was
the <hi>Jews</hi> case and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Pauls,</hi> tho <hi>Moses</hi> Law were given by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
confirm'd by wonders, and by such a constant series of Gods
most immediate dispensations, as might give them just cause to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it was their certain duty to adhere to it, yet when God judg'd
Christs works together with the Prophecies that went of him, had
given a sufficient testimony to his Reformation, the <hi>Jews</hi> resisting
that, tho out of zeal to God, and in obedience to his Law and to
their Guides the Priests and Sanhedrim, were harden'd to excision
for it; or if, as 'tis most certain, they were leaven'd into aversation
to Christs doctrine by their expectation of a pompous <hi>Messiah,</hi> his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
did not serve their sensual ends, 'tis to be fear'd the same do's
influence the more sincere and erring party of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
yet S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> also, tho out of a good conscience doing so, esteem'd
himself the<note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>chief of sinners</hi> for so doing. 'Tis the too hasty taking
up, or the too obstinate retaining this erroneous conscience, makes
the sin it does ingage into be so exceeding sinful; therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
whoever lets their conscience be surpriz'd by prejudice, or
warmth of mind, much more ambition, pride, revenge, or inciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
discontents and disobligation, reputation of a party, interest, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
if these or any sensuality tho but lurking indiscernably (<note n="c" place="margin">Jer. 17. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>for the
heart is deceitful above all things, who can know it?</hi>) have given any
tincture to the heart and pufft a passion into conscience, or if in the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40114:47"/>
uprightness of their heart they took up their perswasions, yet if they
retain them in the least on any such account, or else however if they
do not hearken to, examin any calls or means, which God does ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by his Providence or Ministers offer the opportunities of, for
their conviction, specially if by seeing good and wise men do judg
otherwise, they have any cause to doubt, and yet persist still, and
retain the error, it is this that spoils the Conscience, so that while
it errs it does ensnare the man, entangles him in a necessity of
sinning, leads him into such labyrinths of guilt that whatsoever he
does, he offends: if he do what his erring conscience dictates to
him, then he sins against God's Law, if he forbear, he sins then
against God's Vicegerent, his own Conscience; there is the guilt
of his deed, here the guilt of his heart, which does oblige a man to
follow that which it is sin to follow, and which makes him, he must
and ought to do that which he must not, ought not to do.</p>
                  <p>And then the onely application to such a Conscience is to advise
the laying it aside, to rectify the error; good counsel this indeed,
but hardest to be taken in the world. For that a man may set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to rectify, he must know himself in an error, and if he know
that, he hath not an erring Conscience; this when it is such strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the man does not so much as doubt of his opinion, and while he
does not doubt, what temtation can he have to think of rectifying?
especially if men are perswaded that their Conscience is directed by
such Guides as cannot err. We cannot but remember how the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of all Laws and of all rights sacred and secular, sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and rebellion, and such other dreadful consequents as we must
not remember, being dictated by conscience, undertaken on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Religion were esteem'd the characteristics of a godly side;
nor are we suffer'd to forget, how the same things undertaken on
account of holy Church make Saints and Martyrs: for let not men
pretend these are not Doctrines or directions of the Chuch of <hi>Rome.</hi>
There is no one of the rebellious parties, but it may with much more
truth and modesty affirm they are not theirs, since they have not
declar'd them so authentically; and if we are not sure these are
their doctrines, 'tis impossible to know that they have any, for none
of their doctrines have a greater attestation. If som few declaring
their opinion to the contrary, shall against the declarations of the
Tenets of their Scholes, and the directions of much greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
their Casuists, the rules and practice of their whole law, the
determinations of particular and general Councils, make
them not to be their doctrine, then no Church hath any doctrines.
Now, if as one side of these pretend some to a Divine Light within
themselves, some to the Divine Spirit speaking in the Scriptures for
their Guide, so the other plead the public Spirit of the Church
speaking at least in the Assemblies of their general Council most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly,
and consequently all of them must judg it is impossible
their Guide can err; how is it possible to prescribe means to rectify
the errors of such Consciences?</p>
                  <p>But should I pass these guilts of the first magnitude, to which 'tis
wonderful a Conscience can be debaucht, and err into them, should
I mention one that's common to all of them, violating the Laws,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40114:48"/>
disturbing the Peace of the Government, unhinging the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it by illegal meetings to disseminate their principles, and
make more errors, and more separation, wider breaches. I shall
not tell these, that the Church no where gives a privilege to any to
assemble not for Gods own worship, from whose principles or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
the State hath reason to expect commotions or sedition, the
diminishing their secular Powers, or endangering their persons, and
on that account forbids them. Sure I am, there is no one word in
the Gospel for it, and I leave all the mentioned parties, Popish or
the other, to consider whether they have bin so innocent as not to
be suspected justly? and would onely ask each party of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it alone have right to act according to its conscience thus and
otherwise against the Laws, so that all others, what sincerity so'ere
they act with, have no privilege? or whether it be the Christians
birth-right, and due to all others? If any party say, that it alone
hath right, besides that all the rest will never grant this, nor have
reason for it, and so all must quarrel; yet if they do say so, sure
there's nothing else but truth or confidence of having it, can make
them judg so: but since every the most erring conscience does and
must beleive the truth is with him, he hath the same reason, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
must be endless, &amp; this state of conscience is just the Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
state of war; besides that this pretence of any single party for
it self makes war with the hypothesis it self of liberty of conscience.
But if they grant all other Sects to have just right to act according
to their conscience, then those that really believe the doctrine of
their Church is true, their ways blameless, and the statutes which
restrain the liberties of the Recusants and the Dissenters are all just,
those of them also that have sworn obedience to these statutes, and
those Magistrates and Governors too that are bound by oath to the
execution of them, and to take care of the peace of their Subjects,
and hold that, as 'tis, a duty and an obligation in conscience on
them: these, I say, have just right too to act according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
also, and by consequence to execute the Laws upon those
others; and then, I am sure in conscience, and according to the
very rules of all these men of liberty, those have a right to take
away their wild and dangerous liberties, and by the very Principles
of all these Dissenters are as much bound in conscience to restrain
them, as they think themselves bound to use those liberties accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their conscience. Yea these are bound in conscience to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all their Governors to put restraints upon them; because to do
so is for them to act according to their conscience, or if they think
(as 'tis not strange if they think contradictions) that they have a
right in conscience to contend for this with Governors, who yet
they acknowledg to have a right too to restrain their liberties,
(since all, as themselves have granted, have the same right,) there
must needs be endless quarrels and contentions both with Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
and with themselves, and just of all sides, in which each
hath right, which is another contradiction also; and so still this
state of conscience will be the Leviathans state of war, and must
dissolve all Government, as being inconsistent with it. Whether
any consequents in prospect or design can make this state of things
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40114:48"/>
allow'd and eligible, or how far Governments can properly secure
themselves, if it be allow'd, which yet 'tis certain that they have a
right to do against the clamorous pretences of all conscience what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
as to Church Laws: yet how far they can, I say, secure
themselves against such sorts of men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

treason ever hatch'd or thought of, were not, nor are suffer'd by the
Guides of their conscience, by their Pastors neither their Supreme
one nor their particular Confessors, to give assurance of their civil
obedience and allegiance to their own Prince. But in <hi>France,</hi> after

People, since 'twas a Kingdom, practic'd) all the Clergy, those
Directors of the consciences of that Nation, were so far from

to raze out what of it was drawn and registred in their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,

a right judgment in all things, together with a hearty resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not to suffer any principle or interest so to engage him to
a practice or opinion, but that, if God will please to shew him
light, he will follow it strait, and utterly forsake those paths,
to which he was misguided by the error of his mind, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to act accordingly as well as he can. Now such a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath a promise,<note n="d" place="margin">John 7. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>If any man will do his will, he shall know
of the doctrine, whether it be of God,</hi> or not. Besides this, I say,
let him thus exercise himself, when any thing offers it self to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and gets this holy advocate of its side, brings conscience to
plead, then I will search and examine strictly that same action, first
undress it quite, see what it is naked by it self, and then ask not what
fine motives, what good end it hath, but where the rule is for it. If
it be in things merely Spiritual, then what Law of God; but if in
other things, what Law of man, what just subordination to Gods
will is there for this action? For laws, not zeal do make the rules for
Conscience: for Conscience being nothing but a full perswasion,
judgment, dictate that a thing is either duty under obligation, is
according to a Law that does command it, or else is unlawful, is
against a Law. If Conscience shall tell me such a thing I am bound
to do, but I have no Law of God or man for it; or else such a thing
I must forbear, it is a sin, absolutely unlawful, but truly I can
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40114:49"/>
bring no Law in force against it, sure I shall easily reject the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
of this Conscience, for it talks contradictions: for nothing
can be unlawful, but what is against a Law. If, tho there be not
express Law to forbid or command, yet I see grounds that stagger
me, and several hard things which incline to my opinion, this does
not make the erring Conscience: for that is dogmatical and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and must have law, doctrines and grounds of probability;
those onely make a doubt, the next offence I mean to name.</p>
                  <p>An offence this, that whosoever stumbles at, does fall into the
lowest pit, for <hi>he that doubteth, is damn'd if he eat</hi> Rom. 14. 23.
Now the state of a doubting conscience is this, either the man in
himself really believes the thing he does consult of is forbidden, but
yet seeing the example of some man he hath esteem for, or else
hearing some good probable grounds to the contrary, does enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
some doubt whether it be so bad, and upon that without being
resolv'd, yea thinking still it is a sin, yet ventures on it: in this
case tho the man may have some hopes it may not be a sin, yet
judging in himself it is, and choosing notwithstanding, it is plain
he does not onely venture at, but chooseth sin, and therefore sins.
This was the very case of the weak Christians in relation to eating
things offer'd to Idols, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> there speaks of. Or secondly, if
he do not absolutely in himself judg it a sin, yet really do's doubt it
is, and without endeavoring to be truly satisfi'd by all appointed fit
means, does it howsoever; this man does as much as resolve I know
not what it is I am about to do, I doubt 'tis sin, but I resolve to do
it, tho it be so. Now this is a wicked resolution, and the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
action must be so too: it is as much as saying, I resolve to
venture Gods displeasure, rather then loose the satisfaction of that
action; now whatsoever otherwise the action be, yet such a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
stains it with a vicious tincture, by infusion of that wicked
purpose.</p>
                  <p>To bring this to our own concerns, if my lawful Superior com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a thing by an establish'd law, which yet either by some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
place of Scripture, or by the silence of Scripture, or some infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of my own from others having put that action to an evil use,
or the infusion of some Teacher of whose holiness I have an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
I doubt whether I may do it or no, and cannot satisfy my self,
in this case, if the man that doubts comply, without acquiring any
satisfaction, do it merely too because he will not be obnoxious to
the penalty of law, 'tis clear he does it with a doubting conscience,
and so sins; but if he thus discourse, (which is the proper <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> for
such a conscience to remove this offence) I am sure God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to obey the lawful commands of my lawful Superiors,
now am I sure this is not lawful? No, that I am not, for I onely
doubt; why then I must needs also doubt it may be lawful, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I must needs doubt God hath commanded me to obey them in
this, and then if I refuse I must needs do that with a doubting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
for if the thing be lawful, I am sure I sin in not obeying,
and I doubt it may be so, and so not doing will have the same guilt,
which by not doing I endevor to avoid.</p>
                  <p>Now if whatever the action be, as long as I know not certainly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40114:49"/>
whether it be lawful or unlawful in it self, I shall have equal guilt
in the refusal (altho there be no scandal or contemt) as I can fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to my self in doing; and if I cannot satisfy my doubt my self,
since I have then no other way to seek for resolution, but from
those whom God hath set over me, shall not the reasons and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of my Superiors, the example of all those that are obedient,
weigh as much with me as the opinion of some whom I think holy,
or some little color which can onely make me doubt? If I be not
sure it is unlawful, and am perfectly assur'd of my duty to my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
this certainly ought to suspend my other doubt, and in so
doing I am sure, I take far the more probable and safer course;
and he that does so, cannot have the guilt of a doubting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
for the resolution of that was clean another thing: I doubt
there may be sin in it, however I will do it, whereas this man that he
may take the safest course to avoid sin, resolveth thus, merely for
fear there may be guilt in my refusal, I do that which otherwise
truly I would not do.</p>
                  <p>I cannot pass by this reflection here, how there will come a time,
when it shall be more tolerable for the erring or the doubting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
notwithstanding their sad consequences, than for those
that <hi>hold the truth in unrighteousness:</hi> the one sort of these have
some checks at sin, they doubt and they demur; the other sort
sin merely because they would please God, and offend out of
zeal; but the other sin because they will sin. If actions law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
otherwise will make up an indictment to our condemnation,
don but with a doubting mind, what guilt and what damnation is
there in those that are undertaken against known command and
present full conviction? that muster up and recollect all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
guilts, which when they were divided, did make actions
so ruining; at once they defy God and their own heart: if <hi>he
that doubts is damn'd if he eat,</hi> tho what he eat were lawful to him,
what will become of him that eats to surfetting, and knows that
such things call for condemnation? with what face can he blast a
deceiv'd honest Heathen with his Gods, who in the face of God,
and of all Laws, in view of a believ'd hell, and in despite of heaven
and of his own conscience that suggests all these to him, yet by
frequent intemperances makes his belly his god, and by uncleaness
that new testament idolatry, sets up as many idols, as his foul
heats find objects, and by dishonesty and frauds serves covetousness,
which is idolatry? They, who defy their conscience thus, are in
the ready way to a reprobate sense, the last offence that I will
name.</p>

to speak out of parable, there are no principles of virtue planted in
them, no labor us'd to make impressions of Religion and the fear
of God, the sense of duty, aversation to all vice; but as far as
conversation, with example of all lewdness, can have influence,
they are bred and fitted for the Temter, and when they and temta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are grown up, it is no wonder if they tast, then swallow down
the bait, and so are taken: then they get to themselves principles,
that may stop the mouth of natural conscience; either Religion do's
not mean so strictly, or against the strictness they oppose the custome
of the age, or honor, or the like, and these together with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations
of sin do clean take off the aversation, and so by degrees
the sense, the mind first leaves to be afraid and startle at it, and
then leaves to check at it, and having don this long, the custome
stupifies the conscience, and makes the sins seem necessary to them,
and they cannot be without them, and the absolute necessity makes
them conceit them little sins, and in a while no sins at all: stick
not to say, those terrors Clergy-men do talk of, are but Mormo's,
but religious spectres. We have this daily experience, that loosness
in practice quickly grows into irreligion in heart, that they who
with all might and main do long resist the power of Godliness, do
at last proceed to cast off even the very form, and they who would
not receive the love of the truth, but did prefer the satisfaction of
their humors, prejudices, passions, lusts before the doctrine of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

take pleasure in others committing them, from which they have no
pleasure, can enjoy nothing but the villany of being glad that
others are debauch'd and vitiated, this recommends men to them.
And truly now I have no words for them, they do outgo expression;
I may apply that which the<note n="g" place="margin">Psalm 14. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith of the fool, <hi>in his

not let his Deputy be there, not suffer conscience his Vicegerent to

then conscience will revive, and be their <hi>worm that never dies;</hi>

                  <p>And now I can prescribe no exercise will remove this offence,

                     </gap> to keep the conscience
tender; then it will be sensible of every the least touch of guilt,
check at whatever we shall do amiss. Conscience is the eie of the
soul, now tenderness is a disposition very proper to the eie, it is the
tenderest part of the whole body; and if the conscience be right,
that is so of the soul: the smallest spill or mote is restless agony to
the eie, it never leaves to force out tears, both to bewaile the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to wash away the cause. I am sure our Savior calls a sin
of the least size or guilt <gap reason="foreign">

make the conscience as restless, fret into lamentings, prick passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
for repenting sorrow. The conscience of Converts always does
so, <hi>Acts 2. 37. When they heard this, they were pricked in heart;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this is the necessary constitution of Soul for them that ever
hope to have their conversation holy: he whose eie is not tender,
'tis not useful; if it be not sensible of spills that get into it, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be sensible of objects, such a callum as will make it not feel,
will make it not see; and when it cannot perceive pain, then it
cannot direct or light: and so the conscience, if it feel no grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
from thy vices, it will never boggle at them; but when it is
tender as the eie, then it will rowl and weep, if any thing disturb
it, 'twill be restless till it free it self. Let other Souls be tickled,
when they feel the pleasures of a sin; but, Lord, let my heart
smite me, then the stroke and smart may make me fly the cause.
Let sin, that and cruel Serpent, sting, stab, wound me thus; for then
it will make outlets for its putrifaction, it will draw tears to cleanse
me from it self: and sure after the bloud of Christ, there is no
other laver to wash away the foulness of my sin, but that which
gushes from those wounds of spirit, nothing else will quench the
power of it. This tender conscience will preserve the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40114:51"/>
pure, if its respects be universal, if its cares reach to the
whole latitude of its object, if it be <hi>void of offence both towards God,
and towards man,</hi> which shews the extent of its obligation, and is
my next consideration, of which in a few words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Void of offence towards God and towards men,</hi> a conversation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable
in all things that relate to God or man, both these must
be join'd: the Honesty without the Godliness is but Heathen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
and the Godliness without honesty but Pharisaical Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy.
'Tis just that which our Savior describes and sentences
<hi>Matt. 23. 14. Wo unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for ye
devour widows houses, and for a pretence make long praiers; therefore
ye shall receive the greater damnation:</hi> as if their long and earnest
praiers pull'd down nothing else but woes and condemnation on
them, and their more religion gain'd them but more hell. The
one of these for all his honesty, if he have not piety, he is without
God in this world, nor shall have any thing of his heaven in the
other, whose life did not look thitherwards, but aim'd no further
than a conversation that was regular betwixt man and man. The
other, the dishonest man, notwithstanding his Godliness, shall be
without God in the world to come; for sure he is not fit to live with
God in that, who is not fit to live with man in this: who will not
behave himself honestly, must not think he can live religiously;
nor can that help him towards Gods rewards, that does but help
him to the greater condemnation. So that they must be join'd,
and our conscience must be <hi>void of offence towards God and towards
men;</hi> and that not onely as the objects of our duty, but the rules.</p>
                  <p>That Gods Law is the rule of conscience, that we are bound to
do what he commands, I think I need not prove; in this I have
onely to wish, our practice were as orthodox as our opinions. But
that man can oblige the conscience, that laws however just of our
rightful Governors are a part of this rule, and we are bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to observe what they would have us do, many men doubt;
there <hi>bene qui latuit, bene vixit,</hi> a close offender does not sin, and
if they come not under the lash of the Law, they think the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
hath no whip for these offences; yet Scripture is express
<hi>Rom. 13. 5. Wherefore you must needs be subject, not onely for wrath,
but also for conscience sake.</hi> again 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 13, 15. submit your selves
to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, for so is the will of God.</hi>
I do not here set down that humane Laws oblige the conscience
immediatly, it is enough for me they do it by Gods constitution,
that what we do so is for his sake, and 'tis his will that we should do
it; and then he that does not obey, he breaks the will of God, and
so does that which a good conscience must needs tell a man he
must not do. I know some have found out a subterfuge, that
onely passive obedience is required in conscience, not active; and
tho this interpretation would secure the Magistrate, for men must
not rebel against that rod, which they are bound to submit to: yet</p>
                  <p>1. 'Tis strange a man should not be bound in conscience to obey
the Law, yet should be bound in conscience to suffer for the not
obeying it. What reason for this difference? Sure if either, 'tis most
reasonable to escape the punishment, if he can. But</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:40114:51"/>
2. What sense will they make S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> speak, * <hi>wherefore ye must
needs be subject, not onely for wrath;</hi> if <hi>wrath</hi> mean punishment, as
it certainly does, and <hi>be subject</hi> signify submit, not actively, but
submit to punishment, as they will have it, then it means, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a man must submit to punishment not onely for punishment, or
for fear of being punished, but also because he is bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to bear the punishment: now 'tis indeed impossible that a
man ought and is necessitated to submit to the penalty of the Law
for fear of the penalty of the Law, be bound to suffer a thing for
fear of suffering that very thing, or that he may escape that very
suffering, which he is bound in conscience too to suffer. These are
contradictions. But of the active obedience the sense is plain: we
must obey their just Laws, not onely that we may avoid their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
which we shall suffer if we obey not, but because we are
bound in conscience to obey. All the Apostles instances also being
of active obedience, and the whole reasoning of the place evincing
it, might serve for further evidence, but this shall suffice me for
proof; and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> truly seems to take in these here in the text, for
amongst several things laid to his charge, some against God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as <hi>prophanation of his temple</hi> v. 6. he was accus'd of being also
<hi>pestilent,</hi> a <hi>mover of sedition</hi> v. 5. to all which he answers in my text,
that he was so far from prophaness in Religion and his duty towards
God, and from sedition in the State, that he did exercise himself
in this alone, in laboring to <hi>have a conscience void of offence</hi> in all
things, by God or his Governors commanded.</p>
                  <p>And this president of our Apostle, every one that hears me knows,
the true sons of this Church always follow'd, both in doctrine and
in practice, even to the Martyrdom not onely of their persons, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
but of the Church it self. Not like those holy Church-men
who account themselves exemt, no subjects to the secular powers;
nor those others, who withdrawing their obedience in all things
which they do not like, do seem to own no powers but themselves,
are Subject onely to their own minds.</p>
                  <p>Now he that does thus exercise himself <hi>always,</hi> (which is the
onely thing that I have left to speak to,) is in that state of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
perfection, which the Travellers to Heaven, while they are
upon the way, can arrive at: for that must needs be a good life,
which is regulated by a good conscience; for if a conscience do its
part, do neither err nor doubt, but is tender in all, in a word, if
it inform truly in all duty, and thou doest accordingly, thou doest
all thy duty: therefore all good life is call'd by the name of a <hi>good
conscience 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 19. and plainer <hi>Hebr. 13. 18. We trust we have a
good conscience, willing in all things to live honestly,</hi> sincere endeavors
to obey in every thing, a conscience that is right in every thing,
not boggling with it, accepting the persons of duty, (being very
consciencious in some things, but taking liberty in others,) and
being so <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>always,</hi> not by fits, having onely Paroxysmes of
Religion, now and then very consciencious, otherwise loose enough,
but to be so in all respect, and at all times: this was the sum of all

                     <hi>Pauls</hi> endeavor, he had no stricter aims, this was the height of his

Yet why should I call it his exercise, when it is his enjoiment? 'tis
his ante past of heaven it self. The applauds of an honest unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
heart that is conscious to it self of this in earnest, they shed
comforts into every state of life, beyond all that the earth can give,
they shed the <hi>peace of God that passeth understanding.</hi> If my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
be clear, let my condition be never so overcast, I live in
shine; let them be troubled with afflictions, or with sad expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who understand no delights but carnalities, whose souls are
married to some little comforts of this world, adversity indeed
sweeps all their joys away at once; but he that understands the
comforts of a good conscience, and knows where to find them,
and who hath a treasure of them in his breast, will soon be able to
allay the other sadnesses. What can I want, if I have a continual
feast, and such is a good conscience: let all the world look black
upon me as long as I have light within me, and in that light can see
a pleasantness upon Gods face. Yea it is this indeed must make
prosperity contentful, when to the candle of the Lord, the light of
his countenance also does add its shine; when I have no ill remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,
either as to the possession or to the enjoiment; when my
heart assures me I did neither get it ill, nor use it ill, 'twas truly Gods
gift to me, and I strive to make it an instrument of my service to
him. This is transfigur'd prosperity, but without this, for all the
hurry of mens pleasures, something will now and then rejolt worse
than surfets, and come up bitterer than the gall of ejected riots,
and they shall find their great provisions are but variety of nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seousness,

at rest in his possessions, to the man that hath nothing to molest him, hath
hath prosperity in all things;</hi> and if he have the sting of conscience
to imbitter it, which will be sure to stir at such a time, alas! how
unconceivable a sadness must then dwell upon that soul, that can

a time say with<note n="i" place="margin">Esaiah 38. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Hezekiah, Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee,
how I have walk'd before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and
have don that which is good in thy sight,</hi> then if God do not send a
message of fifteen years, yet he will add to him an everlastingness
of years of joy; if his days do no return, nor the Sun mount back
again to give him a more full noon light, he shall be taken to the
fountain of eternal light. Oh let me have that light, that will
enlighten the sad approaches of the dark grave; that, when I am
going to make my house in a black lonely desolate hole of earth,
will be like the day spring of immortality, like the dawn of heaven,
and such glimpses will break in thro a clear conscience. 'Twas
that which made the Martyrs run to the fires of execution as to fires
triumph, and they look'd upon their flames as on <hi>Elijah</hi>'s chariot's

the Sphere of Martyr's Heaven, and whose brightness did prelude
and expire into Glory.</p>

                     <hi>shecina,</hi> say the <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctors, will
not rest upon a sad person, that is, God will not
be especially with him, nor will his holy Spirit
keep him company, that is, a solitary Mourner:
and indeed we often find in Scripture, that when
the Prophets would invite Gods Spirit down upon
they did heighten themselves with mirth; <hi>but
now,</hi> saith Elisha, <hi>bring me a Minstrel, and it came
to pass while the Minstrel plai'd, the hand of the Lord came upon
him. And he said, thus saith the Lord, 2 Kings</hi> 3. 15. as if the Music
had inspir'd him, and his soul was tun'd into Enthusiasme; and so
also 1 <hi>Sam. 10. 5. thou shalt meet a company of Prophets coming down
from the high place, with a Psaltery, and a Tabret, and a Pipe, and a
Harp before them, and they shall prophecy: and the Spirit of the Lord
will come upon thee.</hi> Yea and as God would not dwell with them,
so neither would he let them keep him company, they were not to
appear before him sad <hi>Deut. 12. 7. And there ye shall eat before the
Lord your God, and ye shall rejoyce:</hi> and therefore God hath no worse
expressions for unclean Sacrifices, than <hi>the bread of Mourners,
Hos. 9. 4. They shall not be pleasing unto him, but their Sacrifices shall
be as the bread of Mourners,</hi> and as the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>those Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
for their carcases shall not come into the house of the Lord.</hi>
Yea he would not let those Melancholly people keep others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in his service, but there was <hi>porta lugentium,</hi> a gate for Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to enter by themselves into the Temple-service, as if the mirth
were among their precepts, and to be sad were to be defil'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.
But it is not so with us in the Gospel, where <hi>the</hi> onely <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of God is a troubled spirit, a broken and contrite heart he will not
despise;</hi> but <hi>the bread of Mourners</hi> shall be the <gap reason="foreign">

he will never turn away his face, and a few penitent tears are the
scope and the fulfilling of all the <hi>Jewish</hi> purifyings, <hi>and the Spirit of
the Lord moveth upon the face of</hi> these <hi>waters;</hi>

                     </gap> he flutters
and hovers over them, and as he did out of the first waters, so out
of those tears he hatches a new creation, they being the very first
effects and signs of life in the new creature and the new birth also,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40114:53"/>
natural to both; Infants and the Child of God also are born weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and crying, this being the very first throw in regeneration.
Yea so far is this sorrow from displeasing God, that it is the great
engagement to him to give us comfort both here and hereafter,
and it is put amongst Christs first beatitudes here, <hi>Blessed are they
that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words present either a bare description of persons, or withall
involve a duty, the being <hi>Mourners.</hi> Secondly import a designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their condition, that they are <hi>Blessed.</hi> Thirdly they give the
reason and the manner of that condition, <hi>For they shall be comforted;</hi>
so that mourning may be doubly understood, either as a duty, or
as an aphorisme: in the later case <hi>mourning</hi> is taken not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
at all, but onely Christ looking upon his Disciples who were
in the worlds esteem in a sad low condition, he does encourage
them, that notwithstanding their unequal estimate, yet they are in
a blessed condition, for they shall be sure to be comforted. And
thus first it may be as an appendage to the former aphorisme, in
that he had by the assurance of a reward encourag'd them in the
entertainment of poverty and calamities, had advanc't the lowly
into heaven, and enrich't the patient poor with the inheritance of
a Kingdom, those that were poor in Spirit, content with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
and then this follows, <hi>blessed are those that mourn, for they
shall be comforted;</hi> as if it were after this manner: but what if our
calamities do grow upon us, and we are not able to bear them with
an even mind and a serene countenance, but they cast us down, we
greive and mourn under them and cannot be comforted? yet even
for this condition there is promise, Christ is so far from breaking
this <hi>bruised reed,</hi> that he confirms and strengthens it; the greivous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our calamities shall not exclude all hope of ease, neither
shall our weakness and infirmity exclude us from the number of the
<hi>blessed:</hi> he will neither impute our want of courage, that groans
and faints under the burthen, provided that we be not heated by
it into impatience at his dispensations, nor chaft into wrath against
them that lay it on us, tho we do mourn, if we do not vexe, we are
<hi>blessed;</hi> neither will he suffer our calamities, when he hath tried
and purg'd us by them, quite to oppress us, but how greivous soever
they be, they shall find multitudes of comfort, even the comfort
of mitigation, for to that Gods faithfulness is engag'd 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 13.
God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be temted above that ye are
able; but will with the temtation make a way also to escape, that ye
may be able to bear it.</hi> Secondly the internal comforts of Gods
grace 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 3, 4. God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father
of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforteth us in all our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations.</hi>
Thirdly the comfort of a joyful recompence, even here
for the most part, <hi>John 16. 20, 21. I say unto you ye shall weep and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but the world shall rejoyce; and ye shall be sorrowful, but your
sorrow shall be turned into joy. A woman when she is in travail,
hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is deliver'd of
the child, she remembreth no more the anguish for joy that a man is
born into the world.</hi> Our afflictions may be throws, but they
shall end in birth, and have the ease and joy of a delivery;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40114:53"/>
and therefore our Savior said of himself <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Luke 12. 50. how
am I straitned?</hi> as a woman in child to accomplish his Baptism,
that Baptism of agony, sweat and bloud; or certainly however
an eternal recompence of joy hereafter, <hi>everlasting consolations,</hi> as
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> saith 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 16. When instead of this hunger and thirst and
tears <hi>the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and
shall lead them unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow,
nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain:</hi> Rev. 7. 17. and 21. 4.</p>
                  <p>And first we learn hence the compassion of our Savior, who hath
indulg'd us the infirmities of our nature: he hath not made our
weak affections to be sins, but hath shew'd us a way to make them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
towards blessedness; God that was made flesh remembers
that we are but flesh, and does not require of us to be insensible, it
is not a vice not to be a stock, such as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> requir'd their wise
man should be, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, no greif, nor no sense of any external cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;
tho you thrust his hand into the fire, it must be no more to
him, than if you burn his staff; for his body is but his organ, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
no part at all of him: but Christ requires no such hard
tasks of us. Had he deni'd us our tears, and forbid us the ease of
mourning in afflictions, and made weeping to be cowardise and sin,
it had bin <hi>a hard saying,</hi> we had had reason to have thought ourselves
severely dealt withal: but he gives us leave as it were to love the
dear things of this world, a little to weep when they leave us, if
we do not love them so as not to love our brother and our God,
leaving them if the world leave us, and when by calamities our
comforts are taken from us, by frettings and vexations throwing off
our God from us, repining at him, and casting his commands away,
of not envying, not returning, provided in our tears we have
humble perfect submissions and resignations of our selves, throwing
our selves down at his feet, and from our very souls saying,<note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>it is the
Lord, let him do what seemeth him good:</hi> then Christ he yeilds to the
tenderness of our nature, and provided we mixe no gall with our
tears, no bitterness with our weepings, no murmurs nor no
grumblings with our groans, he pardons all our weaknesses, and
makes our mourning to be but as a call and invitation to him to
come to comfort us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly from the diversity of comforts that belong to every
great greiving calamity here, we learn the munificence of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior,
who does with such infinite advantage return our afflictions;
he did himself suffer so many sorrows, and found they were so hard
to bear, that for every greif we patiently endure he renders a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
comfort, and of those some Divine, the last Eternal. Thus
does he reward not our virtues onely (for it is no command of ours
to be greiv'd,) but our mischances, our inflictions: he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
thy enimie's malice to thee with multiplied and eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations,
yea he does thus reward thy ease; for such it is to mourn
in crosses, our greifs boil out at our eies, and ease their swellings
by those eruptions of tears, yet this very ease does he comfort us for,
and makes those tears, which for the present do refresh, to be the
rivers of Paradise, the fountains of the waters of life; teaches us
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40114:54"/>
the constant vicissitudes of greif and joy; sorrow and gladness
so receive one another constantly, that in this life they that <hi>mourn
shall be comforted,</hi> they that<note n="b" place="margin">Luke 6. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>laugh shall weep.</hi> Laughter hath in it
self more than the tears of sadness, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the
hurries of delight even in the very wicked weary themselves into a
dulness, and die into a sadness; the intemperances rejolt in bitter
risings, and the more forc't and violent the delight is, it is but like
the raising the pendant weight, which by how much you lift it up
one way, it drives it self so much on the other side; yea in the better
sort of Christians the frollicks of these pleasures here below, tho
not sinful, do for the most part end in thoughtful sadnesses, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
regrets, not onely in that such persons, when they come to
themselves, find themselves estrang'd from God, and from devouter
duty; a deadness is upon them, and they must take pains to wind
themselves up again: but if with any conscionable care they look
into themselves, they shall discern that little loosnesses and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and prides and such other companions have insinuated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and crept in with the frollicks; matter for humiliation and
sorrow, if they mean to recover the true inward Religious content
which never springs with such a stream, as from these serious and
retir'd reflections; they that so <hi>mourn</hi> shall find comfort. Thus the
Aphorism also hath much truth in order to the two lives, that here
and that hereafter.</p>
                  <p>2. This Aphorism also thus taken bears the full sense of that
frequent saying, wherewith people us'd to comfort one another
concerning these crosses, <hi>you are happy you have your sufferings
in this life;</hi> which sentence, tho it be not true in the full lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
as thoevery man that suffer'd here had a crown therefore
laid up for him; for afflictions may be vengeance for sins, which
if they do not reduce us, as many are not better'd by their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
why then they do encrease their score, enhance their
reckoning, and tho they be the very beginning of Hell here, yet
they do also heat Hell seven times more for them, and their
very sufferings make them suffer more hereafter, than if they had
not suffer'd here: because such sin against Gods last method of
reducing them. Tho this be too frequent truth, yet also there
seeming some sufferings allotted to every man, as he that hath had
no cross here, needs to look well to his tenure by which he holds his
inheritance, since God hath said,<note n="c" place="margin">Hebr. 12. 6, 8.</note> 
                     <hi>he chastens every son whom he
receiveth; and if ye be without chastening, whereof all are partakers,
then are ye bastards and not sons.</hi> So also he that runs on in the race of
Piety that is set before him, if he do meet with sharp stakes and
stumbling blocks that hurt and gall him, yet if he starts up and
goes on, he may look upon these as good evidences of his sonship, and
security that he hath drunk his cup, and the dregs are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
for him; and thus both from this text, <hi>blessed are they that
mourn,</hi> especially in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Lukes</hi> expressing it, <hi>blessed are ye that weep
now, for ye shall laugh; and wo unto you that laugh now, for ye shall
mourn and weep,</hi> Luke 6. 21, 25. and most clearly from <hi>Abraham</hi> to
the rich man <hi>Luke 16. 25. Son, remember that thou in thy life-time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivedst
thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40114:54"/>
is comforted, and thou art tormented,</hi> or as<note n="d" place="margin">See Cypr. l. 3. Test. ad Quiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num c. 61.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> may signify
<hi>rogatur, now thou Dives art the beggar, Lazarus is begg'd of;</hi> where
you see clearly a portion of good and evil things seeming appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
to every man on earth, each hath his good and evil things,
and he that hath receiv'd the one may well look for the other: this
clearly points out a vicissitude of good and evil, of comfort and of
torment.</p>
                  <p>Wee learn hence the unequitable mistake of those men, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
and gape for all good things in both lives, <hi>quadrigis caelum peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
they would go to heaven in triumphal chariots, and in smooth
and broad ways sleep themselves into bliss, have two Paradises, all
ease here and heaven hereafter: and even just such is that also of
them, that make a calm prosperity here, to be a sign and seal to
them that they are in the right way to heaven; thus <hi>Turcism</hi> shall
commence the onely true Religion, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> shall dethrone
<hi>Christ</hi> from his own purchas'd right hand of God, for he hath the
more purple sword; thus succesful iniquity shall advance into piety,
and sin by growing predominant, by becoming powerfully and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
sinful, accumulate into virtue. No, my Brethren, the
comfort is promis'd not to them that have it here, but to the
<hi>Mourners,</hi> take heed least the <hi>Blessings</hi> you receive in this life be
call'd <hi>your good things,</hi> or <hi>your consolations,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 24.</p>
                  <p>I shall give you one sign whereby men may be able in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to discern, whether they do esteem, and make them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
such; God gives the good things of this world for uses, not
to terminate our desires, as things of themselves good: onely He
himself, who is the supreme, the last good, can be so; all other
are design'd for ends, that do at last look up to him, and are and
ought to be subordinate to that last highest end. Health is given
to enable us to employ our selves in the actions of some honest
calling, for our own maintenance, for the good of others, and for
the service of God, and carrying on the works and ends of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
so wealth or the provisions we acquire and enjoy, and
every other good thing of this life. Now he that thwarts this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or subordination, that lays out his desires on the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that minds them for their own sake onely, and the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he himself receives from them without looking further, these
are his ends apparently, and so his <hi>good things</hi> which he rests in;
which if God permit him to enjoy, he therefore hath his <hi>good things,</hi>
and hath no great reason to expect and look for other. Now how
miserably does this man delude himself? for this is to preferr the
present moment before the following eternity: it is as if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo
should wish for a fair spacious womb, and chuse to spring
and leap there for its nine months, rather than to live a pleasant
age in a variety of full delights, and so it may but dance in the
womb not care to be deliver'd into a dungeon, and born a fetter'd
slave: it is to chuse the riot of one meal, one good feast, and to
starve the whole remainder of a mans life; yea it is worse, it is to
love a pleasant moment more, than he fears eternal Hell, or loves as
eternal Heaven. And this will be discern'd, (and is by most of
them that live in jollity) when they come to die; when they must
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40114:55"/>
bethink themselves of going hence, and have not consider'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a place, nay have all reason to beleive they have no place
provided, but that which God<note n="e" place="margin">Matt. 25. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;</hi>
when they shall think in sad earnest, I have liv'd a pleasant
life, and never have deni'd my self an appetite nor thwarted a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
nor yet hath God deni'd me any thing, but Providence hath
suffer'd every thing to serve my inclinations, and to gorge my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites;
but I am going now where these unruly appetites, that I
have so indulg'd, will infinitely grow, and where all satisfaction
will be impossible, and my desires will be my endless torment.</p>
                  <p>3. This Aphorisme also by pronouncing a present blessedness to
the Mourners, lets us see the advantages they have above other
men in their journey to Heaven. Delights for the most part they are
but the baits and the sawces of sin: by these the Devil and the World
and our own Flesh temts us to iniquities, and keeps us fast glew'd in
them; this is every mans experience, yea the most innocent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
they are at the best avocations from Heaven, and from
better things; they entertain and hold our thoughts upon fading
objects, that will never profit us, if it happen that they do not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ruin us: whereas the causes of mourning, calamities, yea and
the passion it self they beget virtues in us, a whole chain of them;
for <hi>tribulation worketh patience, patience experience, experience hope,
Rom.</hi> 5. 3, 4. yea indeed they <hi>make us perfect and entire lacking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
Jam. 1. 4. as if to be rob'd and spoil'd of all things were the
sure way of wanting nothing, not a vertue certainly, these deep
waters of affliction and these tears of ours, that raise the stream,
they drive and waft us to our God,<note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 78. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>when he smote them, then they
sought him and enquir'd after God early;</hi> a storm will make a Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
pray, and when the tempest beats him down upon his knees he
will lift up his hands to Heaven; the Heathen Seamen fled to the
true <hi>Jehovah,</hi> when they were ready to suffer shipwrack <hi>Jonah</hi> 1. 14,
16. yea they do not onely drive but wooe us to God, they are
temtations in the sense of bait also, <hi>I will allure her and bring her into
the wilderness,</hi> saith God <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 14. when I have made her solitary,
put her as in the desert, brought her into the very place of dragons,
this shall be my allurements, my inticing wooings of her: and not
to loose the experience of this, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Chrysostom</hi> hath given it in the
frequent example of men of most effeminate, loose, dissolute lives,
yet by a cause of mourning, by the loss of a bosom wife, of a dear
onely heir they become (at least for that time of greif) strict and
severe; how do they banish all soft delights, no curious provision
for the flesh, but more than Philosophical abstinence almost to the
pining of themselves, watches and silence, quiet and humble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
of themselves, unspeakable meekness, huge commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all that are afflicted, these are their passions and their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises;
for a while they so contemn the world, think it so little
worth their moiling for, that now it is not worth a wish; in that
time should a fire seize on all they had, or a spoiler run away with
all, it would scarce divert a thought or eye to it from their sad me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly
object, they look upon all guilded pomps and soft plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
as cloath'd with the same dark sable that themselves have on,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40114:55"/>
they are almost ready to betake themselves to the wives sepulchre,
running to inhabit that chamber of death, and again to marry
themselves in that cold bed the grave; so easily will mourning
wean us. In this dimness of anguish, and darkness as of the shadow
of death, we should not run to hugg and embrace gloworms, but
prostrate our selves in this dust and ashes, and with sad serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
set on mourning, which shall bring me to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the words as of a duty.</p>
                  <p>And first of the duty in general: now the mourning here being
oppos'd to them that laugh in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke,</hi> the thing forbidden in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be all foolish lightness in conversation and manners, all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
loosness and wantoness, all uncomly behaviors or jestings, all
freer recreations that beget or are accompani'd with any of these;
and the duty be in part the same with that in the <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>if any things be grave, think on these things,</hi> saith he there, gravity
being the very garb of a Mourner. Not that I would have this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to exclude all recreation, which also according to the persons
with whom it is, may be innocently light; as with children serious
toys are no sport for them. But</p>
                  <p>1. Recreation must be such as may cherish health and strength,
and unbend the mind by diverting it; for to weary my self by my
refreshment is to contradict the very aim of it, to make my recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
need another sport to refresh me after the toil of my laborious
idleness: and therefore also</p>
                  <p>2. It must be moderate; otherwise it does exchange with my
calling, and my refreshment becomes my emploiment: and</p>
                  <p>3. It must be innocent; I must not make it my sport to offend
God; it is too dangerous a recreation to jest with and provoke the
Almighty, to play with sin, and to sport away a virtue is of too ill
consequence: and the duty of the text saith also it should be.</p>
                  <p>4. According to the condition of my person, somwhat grave,
not so extremely light and vain; and if you would by these exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
the usual delights, first all freer revelling, which if they be in
pleasures of the tast, end frequently in intemperance, are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with foolish discourses, very oft prophane; and with swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
idle and bitter jestings at those which are present, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions
of those that are absent, whence proceed quarrels and the
like: they are also full of apishness in the process of them below the
gravity of common sense, much more of a Christian, a member of
the Son of God: we should find these, I say, to jarr with more than
one of the former requisites of recreation. Some other sorts are
oft the instruments of infinite vanity, the great engines of lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viousness
and lust. Wanton Songs and unchast books, these very
things they put a fucus upon sin, and they dress iniquity with all
the adulteries of possible art, that they may the more enticingly
prostitute her: here are young souls ensnar'd by these, to whom
the very description of sin is invitation and conquest. <hi>Do not sit by
a woman that is a Singer,</hi> saith the wise Son of <hi>Syrach;</hi> and if inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
beauty be irresistible temtation, if it do at once assault both at
the eyes and ears, charge the soul with charms at both those ports,
how then shall the very pleasure of that temtation, the wantoness
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40114:56"/>
it self be resistible, when it comes drest with harmony, when it do's
melt the imagination into the soft looseness of its own smooth airs
and gentle warblings? How shall they escape when they see sin
cloath'd in all the flowers of Rhetorick as books present, when they
see the example of men temting to it and learn the method, when
they see it acted, and the delight of it exprest with all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of sinful art, with very prurient words, and committing lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
Some others, as great gamings, (not that I condemn the
thing in general) when they are us'd with much appetite, either of
the sport it self or of the price, they become immoderate, too much
time is spent upon them. And <hi>Causinus</hi> saith, did a man commit
no other sin, but conversing a good part of his life with kings and
knaves of cards, being invited to the conversation of Angels, yet
were it no small offence. But besides that they are the nurses of
anger, they dictate ill language, and they are the apprentiship of
cursings, oaths, and blasphemy: so that if you put all these toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
you shall find that by all these recreations we do but bait and
temt our sins, we do the Devils work against our selves; and we that
know our strength is not miraculous, that find how oft and easily
we fall, are bound in conscience to avoid those things which we
find are occasions to us of sin: and if you would instead of those
impressions, which the vain pleasures of those recreations do leave
upon your desires, entertain and heighten these few considerations
to your selves, it might a little bridle.</p>
                  <p>1. A Christian is a mourner, my blacks, my dark sad veils are
are spread over me; and should I see a woman in that habit, and,
while it was new, go to revels, sing obscene catches, and spend
much of her time in gamings, what would I think of that woman?
Why even the same strumpet, lewd thing is my soul, that in the
days of her mourning does thus luxuriate. And is it not a sad thing
that a Christian, (a very serious name, that) a man, that hath
the delights of heaven to refresh himself with, that hath God to
converse with, should not yet know how to pass his time without
these lighter vain follies, which yet he would be loath to do before
a man of quality and discretion; yea that he cannot refresh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
without sinful delights, that he must go take a walk in Hell to
divert himself for fear he nauseate upon Heaven?</p>
                  <p>2. All the holy Angels, that so great cloud of witnesses, they look
upon me acting these my impertinent ridiculous follies, and it do's
break off their melody; they mourn to see me, a Christian, a man
that should be one of them, thus foolishly passing my irrevocable
time, idly spending my hours of repentance, and vainly throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away my possibilities of Heaven, and doing this so unseemly,
destroying my self with lightness and to no purpose.</p>
                  <p>3. How many now do mourn in their state and expectation of
miseries, and with sad yellings bewail their lost hours, and the sins
which their lightnesses and recreations drew upon them, the curses
and ill language of their gaming, the fornications of the lusts which
their songs and dances did provoke them to, and the intemperance
of their revels, and the idle words of all of them in general, of
which yet our Savior saith we must give an account? and have I not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40114:56"/>
reason to fear the same expectations and woes? and then had I not
better be a little more serious and grave, put on the strictness and
severity of a Christian here, unless I can resolve, so I may but sing
wantonly here, not to care tho I howl in hell eternally, so I may
but revel and drink here, let the never-dying worm for ever gnaw
upon the very marrow of my soul, and Gods fury drink up my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and my self for ever suffer the perpetual thirst of feavor, <hi>dwell
with everlasting burnings,</hi> and rather than I will put on black and be
a mourner here, I will be thrust into the land of<note n="g" place="margin">Matt. 8. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>utter darkness,
where there is weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I will now descend to the particular exercises of this duty, of
which I will name but two: the first is to bewail and mourn for the
calamities that befal or are impendent on a Church and State, or
any member of it, either others or our selves, without considering
whether this be like to be our case or no; I onely put it in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
as a duty, and a particular exercise of this in the text: whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
any judgment do befal a Land, to be truly humbled and sadded
by it, and to compassionate any one that is afflicted by it, and as
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> bid us <hi>Rom. 12. 15. to weep with them that weep.</hi> Now to
move us to this, he that is not affected, he declares plainly, that he
is no fellow-member of him whose sufferings he does not partake in,
nor a part of that Church in whose judgment he is not humbled;
for saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>if one member be afflicted, all the rest suffer with it:</hi>
and experience saith it too, and then shall the body of our Head
Christ, a whole Church be wounded and maim'd, have its last death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pangs
upon it, lie strugling and gasping, and we unmov'd at this,
have the same full delights, and tast them too, feel no gripes, no
sympathy of convulsions, and shall we yet think our selves mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of that body of Christ? Oh no, we hold not of the Head our
Savior, we have no communion with him; for if we had, we should
have communion of sufferings, a fellow-sense. There is no such
convincing sign as this in the world, this flowing from the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of greif; for greif cannot properly be but for an evil that is
some way annext and proper to our selves, <hi>de malo conjuncto;</hi> for as
appetite is implanted for the use of him in whom it is implanted, so
it is not proper to it to have any aversation to evil, except it be
some way evil to him whose appetite hath that aversation, and to
greive at misery I must some way conceive it to concern my self.
Now then as he that does not conceive himself a member of a
Church, nor a fellow member, nor any way relating to it, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
truly greive; so he that does not greive, declares no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with it, he is another thing, a member quite cut off or dead,
and so stupid and insensible. Such a judgment doest thou pass upon
thy self whoever doest not mourn, outlawest and excommunicatest
thy self, neither belongst to Church nor State, nor yet to Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. As thou hast no charity to thy Brother, nor to thy afflicted
Mother; so neither hast thou any love to God, whose glory tho it
be asserted by the punishment of a sinful Land or Church, he is also
still dishonor'd by the sins which do then reign, and to which he does
permit for the most part the punishment of sin, and that power and
authority or discipline which divisions in the Church cut short, hath
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40114:57"/>
for its consequent all unbridled looseness and profaness, Blasphemy
and Atheisme; the calamities of a State are embitter'd by all sorts
of licences that grow when Government is weakn'd: to see a whole
Land mourn with the dark purple of its bloud, all which bloud as it
is the punishment of that Nation, so it is the guilt also to see the
wickedness of a Kingdom plagu'd with the ruin of many thousands
of men's lives and thousands of souls too that fell in actual iniquity,
and yet to think that this plague is the greatest wickedness of all,
arm'd with the most crying sins that are, that the very punishment
must call for punishment and revenge of it self, and help to make
up the measure of judgment, that the sentence of desolation may be
irreversible and utter, to see two inundations overflow the Land,
two abysses of bloud and guilt, and <hi>one deep calling upon another</hi> to
meet and swallow us and bury us in their graves of sin and deep ruin;
yea to see iniquity become impudent and sin triumphant, which is
the great sign of utter ruin as it was to the <hi>Jews,</hi> an omen worse
than Comets or Blazing-stars, &amp; the dismal voice of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
yea and in this ruin too I do not see how any will well free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from guilt; for if they be the ruiners they are the great spoilers,
the sinners if the ruined; they have contributed to make those others
the sinful inflicters: and if in all this there be not matter for a little
mourning, if God dishonor'd, souls destroi'd, lives perishing, Church
ruining, and nothing but sin flourishing, and ourselves not unguilty,
and if this be not an object for our tears, we are the most unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
most obdurate creatures in the world, <hi>Niobe</hi>'s stone is not fit to
be our embleme, for that stone could sweat tears; we are more rock
than that which <hi>Moses</hi> struck, whom the rod of God cannot make
weep, we are next degree to <hi>Lucifer</hi> himself, for onely Hell is sure
at ease to see its company increase.</p>
                  <p>3. Lastly this not mourning in the judgment of a Nation is a sin
which God does most heavily characterize and threaten, <hi>Amos 6. 1,
6, 7, 8. Isaiah</hi> 22. when the Prophet had describ'd how it should be
in the day of desolation <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. then because they did not do it, see
the judgment <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14. yea this very thing, that men are insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
is as it were the very last judgment on a Nation, and the sign of
utter rejection, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16. 5, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>But how can this duty of mourning consist with those so frequent
Gospel-Commands to rejoyce in utmost afflictions? <hi>James 1. 2, 3.
Count it all joy when ye fall into diverse temtations, knowing this, that
the trying of your faith worketh patience:</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> most often. 'Tis
true indeed we are to rejoyce in them, because they are Gods me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of bettering us; by them he does purge ad cleanse us, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 4.
4, 5. and <hi>c. 1. 25, 27. Redeem'd with judgment, even with the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that I shall execute upon them.</hi> But then</p>
                  <p>1. What reason have we to mourn also that we are such foul
sinners as to need such ways of purging, that Christs death should
not have motive enough in it to turn us from iniquity, that
his bloud should not be sufficient laver enough to wash us but
our own must be pour'd out also, that our air should be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
that nothing but an universal conflagration can purify,
that we should be such refractory stubborn persons, whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40114:57"/>
but wounding will do good upon, nothing but ruin will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce?
But then</p>
                  <p>2. How are we more to mourn that this very method should not
be able to reduce us, that we will run upon lashes, swords and deaths
to sin, that in the midst of judgments and against them too we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
iniquity, that every stripe does encrease our reckoning, add to
our iniquities, &amp; no possible method left to reduce them whom cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
will not make sensible; but our villanies grow up with our
sufferings, and our sins are fatned by our bloud, as the land is.</p>
                  <p>Yea lastly how are we to mourn that to the rest of our sins this
also is added by us, of not mourning at our judgments, but using all
possible means to prevent it, to lay a sleep the sense of any judgment
that is upon the Nation, to be so far from bestowing one hour of
sadness upon those so grand motives to it, that they do all they can
to keep it from them; and if those judgments happen to some, they
look upon it carelesly, as a thing that does not concern, rather as a
matter onely of rejoycing; if to others whom they wish well to, they
search out wine and vice to quench and to divert the memory and
thought of it, to drown sad news in sadder sin; this is to labor
hard lest sadness and a virtue should creep upon me, to search out
means to assist me to keep Gods last method from doing any good
upon me: this is one cause of greatest judgment <hi>Isaiah</hi> 5. 11, 12,
13, 14.</p>
                  <p>The second and indeed the great exercise of this duty in the text,
is to mourn for our sins; and</p>
                  <p>First for the infirmities of our nature, that stain that we were
born with, that engagement to death that we brought into the
world with us, and which is a clog and weight upon us throughout
the whole course of our lives to disable us from doing our duty as
we ought.</p>
                  <p>Secondly for the sins of our habits, whereby we have advanc't
those infirmities into customs, made a covenant with that death to
which we were born engag'd, and our whole practice is the exercise
of those things whose wages is death eternal; or if we are not gon
so far in vicious customes, yet for the gross foul acts which men
sometimes commit, those unkind stabs and wounds to our own souls,
those cruel self-murders, these all are to be daily mourn'd for.
Now I shall onely name a few reasons why we should mourn, and
so stir us up to it.</p>
                  <p>1. Because onely in this and in relation to this is greif of any use
at all: God and Nature, they say, made nothing in vain; now if
it were not for our sins greif would be almost in vain, a certain sign
that this passion must be emploi'd upon our sins, <hi>ut propter hujus
tantum sublationem sit concessa,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> For does any
man loose a child? why if he greive to death will his mourning
raise him? Is thy Estate taken from thee? why thou art sad upon
it, but will thy tears recover it? But hast thou sin'd, and dost thou
truly mourn and greive for it? why thy tears do wash away thy sin
and blot out thine offence. So that mourning being every where
else preposterous and unprofitable, was clearly intended to be spent
upon our sins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:40114:58"/>
2. What ingratitude is it to thy Savior not to find in thine heart
to mourn for those sins for which he did die; the Son of God did
sweat, and pray, and cry, and shed a torrent of bloud and water,
and suffer death for those very sins of thine and mine which we
think so slightly of, that we will not shed a tear for them? O my
Brethren, if there is in us any love of that our Jesus, or indeed of
our selves, we would now transplant the Agonies, and make them
ours, and sweat out a few drops of sorrow to cure us of those feavors
of our sins.</p>
                  <p>3. Yea it is a very trouble to our God that we do not greive, he
mourns to see that we will not mourn, <hi>Hosea</hi> 13. 14. when God had
complain'd before of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> what a <hi>foolish child</hi> it was that it did
not repent; he tells them there, that if they had don so, <hi>I would have
ransom'd them from the power of the grave,</hi> (not I will, for the very
next verse contradicts that) <hi>I would have redeem'd them from death,
O death, I had bin thy grave, O grave I had bin thy destruction; but</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<hi>is hid from mine eies: (repentance</hi> we read, but the word bears
and the sense requires <hi>comfort,</hi>) as if the eies of the Lord were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
full of tears, because <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s were not, and he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
comfort, if <hi>Ephraim</hi> did not mourn: and if we do not mourn,
God will comfort himself some other way concerning us to our greif,
<hi>Isaiah 1. 24. Therefore thus saith the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, the
Mighty one of Israel, ah! I will ease me of mine adversaries,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
the very word before <hi>I will be comforted by reason of mine adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
how? <hi>why I will avenge me of mine enimies.</hi> Ah my Brethren
when God is to be comforted by his vengeance upon us, when he
can find no ease but in our ruin and destruction, and that he calls
his comfort in relation to the non-mourning impenitent, where
shall we find ease and comfort then?</p>
                  <p>And then methinks this should scare us into the use of this, fright
us out of that stupid lethargy in sinning, which does so dull us in it,
makes us so senseless of it and the danger we are in by reason of it,
that we cannot bestow one day in weeping, mourning, and fasting,
no nor indeed an hour of serious sadness upon an age of sin, a whole
life of iniquity: the very next step of this into which we shall be
sure to fall, is the greatest sin and judgment in the world, it is that
spoken of as a character of the foulest Heathens, <hi>Ephes. 4. 18. 19.
Having their understandings darkned, being alienated from the life of
God thro the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness that is in
their heart; who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viousness,
to work all uncleaness with greediness:</hi> rather because of the
brawny hardness of their hearts, which are become callous, insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of any admonitions, stings and greif, but dead to all sense of
sin, and having put off all fear of it; and who these are he tells you
in the next words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, such as when they do the foulest
acts, are not toucht with any greif for having don them, but like dead
members of the body that are forsaken by the vital spirits, if you
lash or prick or lance them, they feel no pain: even so these whose
consciences are retir'd &amp; a sleep, they do not mourn for any of their
foulest actions, which is the very height of impiety; for such do strait
<hi>give themselves over to all filthiness to work all uncleaness with greediness.</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:40114:58"/>
This is the effect of not mourning, and then how do they deserve
and provoke this judgment, who if at any time their conscience
begin to twinge them for any of their sins, they presently divert
their thoughts, lest the mourning in the text should creep upon
them, and they should grow sad? These men dread their virtue,
they are afraid of becoming pious, and to avoid the way to heaven
is their design and contrivance; they come not so near duty as the
wicked in hell, have not so much repentance as the damned have;
for there is sorrow for their sins, <hi>weeping and wailing and gnashing
of teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I should <hi>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>
                     </hi> encourage those that do thus mourn, but the text does
that sufficiently, they are <hi>blessed, and they shall be comforted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First they are <hi>blest</hi> for this mourning, it is the great effect and
sign of this Spiritual life; that man's sickness hath not yet kill'd
him, who is sensible of it, who greives by reason of the anguish of
it, and he is not dead who feels the weight of it and mourns for it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly if it be true, it draws such a train of virtues after it,
as it made S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyce that he had made the <hi>Corinthians</hi> sad,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9, 10, 11. and then this very same verse will assure them of the
comfort hereafter; for all the Gospel-promises are assur'd upon the
terms of repentance, which this Godly sorrow is the first link of,
and does draw after it: &amp; then if there be any comfort in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of myriads of Saints and Angels, if we dare take Christ's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if he had any tast who suffer'd so many mourning fits, that
liv'd a life of tears here, that often wept but never laught, yea a life
of horrid suffering, and yet thought those comforts a full glorious
recompence to him for all those sufferings, and therefore may well
be to us for a few tears; if there be any joy in the beatifical vision
and in heaven, they shall be comforted that mourn, when as I told
you out of <hi>Revelations, all tears shall be wip'd from their eyes, there
shall be no more trouble, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor pain.</hi> And yet
this is but the Negative part of their eternity of bliss, which to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
is to be as God, and to enjoy is to be one with him.</p>
                  <p>And O thou Blessed Jesu, the eternal Lord of all those comforts,
be favourable unto us thy servants, that turn to thee with weeping
and with mourning, that do with hearty bewailing for our hardness
desire thee to teach our souls with some compunction for those ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
that did put thee to death and would ruin us, to break our
rocky hearts, that they may stream out tears for those our sins
which shed thy bloud, and would cast us into eternal wailings;
and as thou hast humbled us into the dust, and prostrated our very
souls unto the ground, to grant unto us to sit down in that dust and
to bewail our own demerits, which our very ruin can neither
equal nor amend. O suffer us not to be so obdurate, as to prove
unmoveable by all thy pressures, insensible of our own miseries and
sufferings, and such as amidst the pains of sin do still retain the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and the obstinacy, and then at last by these thy methods and
our greifs recover us from the follies of our lives, close our eyes
and withdraw our affections from the temting lightnesses and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of our conversations; and fix our thoughts and appetites
upon thy serious comforts, those heavenly refreshments after so

OF THE CLEANSING POWER
Of Christian HOPE.</head>

                     <q>Every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself
as he is pure.</q>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OPE is of all others the most active passion, setting
all the rest of them and the whole man on work;
for who would ever do or desire any thing, if he
did not hope for some good by it? It is this hope
alone that employs all the men and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
of the world: it is the wings of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and Actions, carrying them thro the
greatest difficulties with courage and alacrity,
with Confidence and an unwearied Constancy, <hi>Ad bonas spes perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax
animus est.</hi> Never will a man leave so long as he does hope,
and of all hopes that of the Christian should be the most active; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it aims at the highest good, in comparison of which all other
good things are but shadows. For what are the pleasures of earth
to the things of God, not worthy to be the expressions, no nor the
foils of them? Now we see the greater the hopes, the more active
men are in the pursuit of them; for who is there that will take so
much pains for a Cottage, as for a Crown? And is it not then a
wonder, that of all Hopes yet this Hope of Heaven should be the
least effectual in the minds of men; and of all pleasures those of
God should least invite, and least imploy us? For what one is there
that does not with more eager and constant industry pursue the
hopes of profit or the hopes of pleasure, than he does the hopes of
Immortality and of Blessedness? How few are there that do not
spend more time and more endeavors, take more and longer pains
in their Sports than in their Religion? which could not certainly
be, if they had not surer and greater hopes of joy from their sports,
than from Heaven; for the greater hope would certainly set them
the more on work. No, Heaven is a thing of no tast, carries no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
no pleasure in the meaning of it; for if it did it would employ
them in the gaining of it, and every one that <hi>had this hope, would
purify himself as he is pure, Matth.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
                  <p>If the inheritance of the Kingdom of God were, as some were
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40114:60"/>
upon earth, entail'd, so that do they what they will, they could not
be put by it, there were then some reason not to wonder, wherefore
we see men live in the broad way to Hell and yet then hope to come
to Heaven: and certainly nothing but such a perswasion as that
can possibly lull men into such a wretchless security as they are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
with, in a thing of this eternal consequence. For if we should
examin them, the most sinful wretch of them all hath hopes to be
sav'd, yea he would not be able to stand under the burden and the
horror of his own killing thoughts, if he should but once despair of
that: so that hope he will, and yet if he believe one jot of Scripture,
it is impossible for him to hope it. For that bids him not<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor theeves, nor cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the
Kingdom of God.</hi> So that he dares not not hope, and yet if he do
but ask himself, he knows he cannot hope: and what then makes
him do it? Certainly the opinion that such and such the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is entail'd upon, and be they what they will, they shall have
Heaven. But alas! they are mistaken in the nature of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
we may read of many that were cast off, and the Heir must
be a servant as long as he is a child, if he do not obey, no hopes of his
arriving at his inheritance when he is come to age. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John</hi> here will
dash all those vain hopes, and will tell them as they cannot justly
hope, for none such as they can be possest of that inheritance; and
therefore 'tis to no purpose for them to hope it. So also that they
do not indeed hope; for if they did ever expect to arrive at Heaven,
they would not run on in a course, that leads a clean contrary way.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle here propounds five Arguments to exhort them to
the study of Piety, to press after Holiness, and to leave off their
courses of sin. I shall name them backwards. First in the tenth
verse if we be Christians we not onely will not, but <hi>cannot sin.</hi> Yea
secondly we are indeed <hi>Children of the Devil,</hi> if we do <hi>v.</hi> 8. Neither
thirdly have we any <hi>Communion with Christ</hi> possibly, or interest in his
<hi>Righteousness v.</hi> 6, 7. Nay fourthly they destroy the very <hi>end</hi> of
<hi>Christ's coming into the world v.</hi> 5. Lastly in the front of all these
neither can they hope to enjoy any of those glorious promises, that
God hath made to his Children, those of giving them glory and
immortality; <hi>For he that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself as he
is pure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the handling of these words I shall shew you what it is to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
himself. Secondly what kind of purity he is to strive after, <hi>as he
is pure.</hi> Thirdly what the Hope of a Christian is, <hi>this Hope.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
how that Hope does set a man on purifying, <hi>He that hath this
Hope purifies himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the first what it is to purify I shall onely name, it is to cleanse
from all mixture of pollution, and how far it is to extend, is set down
by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> upon the very same grounds with those in the Text,
<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse our selves
from all filthiness both of the Flesh and Spirit:</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>James</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">James 4. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Cleanse
your hands you sinners, and purify your hearts you double-minded:</hi> and
they both mean thus much; that for external actions, Christian pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40114:60"/>
tho it will admit of slips and failings, yet it is not consistent with
continuance in any known sin. And therefore <hi>David</hi> tho he were
said to be <hi>a man after Gods own heart,</hi> and that he did that which was
right in the sight of the Lord, (the very description of pure) yet
it is added <hi>save in the matter of Vriah.</hi> For first it never does ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any filthiness of Flesh, but must be universal; and it is in this
true what S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>James</hi> saith <hi>c. 2. v. 10. Whosoever shall keep the whole law,
and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all:</hi> God had before affirm'd
the same expresly <hi>Ezek. 18. 10, 11, 12, 13. If he beget a son that is a
robber, and that doth the like to any one of these things, and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd
his neighbours wife, hath oppressed the poor and needy</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall he
then live? he shall not live, he hath don all these abominations, he shall
surely die.</hi> So that in Gods sight he that hath don any one of these
things, he hath don all these abominations: for it is plain, that
those he had not don he abstain'd not from, because God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
them; for then he had abstain'd from that which he had
don, God had forbidden that; so that his abstinences are not inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
but squeamishness or fear. Either he does not like them,
or he dares not do them for some worldly reason; and he does not
onely let God see he can abstain for such considerations as these,
but will not for his Promises or his autority. He values these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the mode or fashion of the world, or his respect to some other
person, or any little interest or humor.</p>
                  <p>2. Neither does this purity admit any filthiness of the Spirit, we
must purify our hearts; and for internal purity the rule is, that to
abstain from outward actions of sin is not enough, but the heart
must be cleansed also: this is proved already. And indeed to deny
my flesh the pleasures of the flesh, and yet to let my mind dwell
upon them and enjoy them; not to commit them, and yet suffer
my soul to do it, is to transplant the sin, to make my soul act the
deeds of the flesh, and my very spirit become carnal. This is at
the best to give God the worst part of my services, and the Devil the
best: my heart and soul the Devil enjoies; God hath nothing but
a few outward abstinences. What a mixture is here, how far from
purity; God and the Devil join'd together, and the Devil having
the upper hand, the better portion?</p>
                  <p>Thus in general, but to tell you what kind of purity we are to
strive after, I shall touch at some few Scripture wordings of it.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Holiness.</hi> For <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> are often join'd 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1. Having
these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness
both of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of the Lord.</hi> Now
the true notion of holiness consists in a setting apart, or discrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from other things or persons. And therefore holiness of life is
the observing that peculiar different form of life, which God hath
commanded those whom he hath call'd, not being conform'd to
the fashion of the world. As S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>James</hi> saith pure Religion, not to
live after the common manner of men, common and holy being
every where oppos'd: so that when God is said to call us to holiness,
he requires us to consecrate our lives to his service, to look upon
our selves as things sacred. Hence Christians are call'd <hi>living Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
holy to God</hi> Rom. 12. 1. <hi>Temples of the Holy Ghost</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 19.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40114:61"/>
and all names of Holiness are set upon them to shew how strict a
necessity lies upon us to separate our selves from all carnal wordly
uses and defilements.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Pure</hi> are exprest by <hi>Virgins 2 Cor. 11. 2. For I am jealous
over you with a Godly jealousy,</hi> that is, as a strict careful Parent over
his beloved maiden daughter, so <hi>that I may present you as a chast Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to Christ.</hi> Every gross impurity deflowers the soul, and when it
sins it plays the strumpet. And if a bride, that on her wedding day
should play the harlot, and give away that Virginity which she had
but then promised to her Husband, would certainly not dare to
stand the wrath of her furious Bridegroom that should catch her in
her villany: how wilt thou meet the jealousy of thy Spouse, when as
thou spread'st thy self to every temtation, committest perpetual
whoredoms with the World and flesh, and doest continually act
disloialty in the very eyes of his glory? Certainly the same jealous
care and earnest desires that are emploi'd in seeking a wife that is
not vitiated, this very expression of <hi>Virgin</hi> does direct us to make
use of in watchfulness over our selves, that sin do not devirginate
us, that we do not present a strumpet to Christ for his Spouse; but
that he may find us Virgins at the Marriage of the Lamb. Yea
that we may see what kind of ones also, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> expresseth their Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Ephes. 5. 27. not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy
and without blemish.</hi> For as every gross Sin does deflowr the Soul,
and make it no Virgin; so every lighter fault is a spot upon the
cheek, a wrinkle in the forehead in Christs eyes. And if chastity
shall be severely guarded out of a respect to future hopes of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
which there is no hopes to be successful in, if that be blasted;
if to please a Suiter the glass shall be consulted with, every stain
shall be adorn'd, cover'd, made a beauty-spot; and all methods
(sometimes more then honest) us'd to keep the forehead smooth,
the cheek full and plain, not content with the Lords workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
upon them they will outdo their Maker, and create to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
beauties that God and Nature never did intend them: if
men do avoid wrinkles in a Bride, as they would do a Deaths-head
or <hi>memento mori</hi> in their bridal bed, can we then think our selves,
whom every day bespots, and stains, every hour adds such wrinkles
to, whose souls have more of those furrows than our lives have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
who are indeed onely bundles of deformities, besides our
gross whoredoms; can we, I say, think our selves a fit Spouse for
Christ? Is he the onely Bridegroom to be thus provided for? Can
we have confidence to present a Strumpet to him for a Bride, and
care not that he find us Virgins at the Marriage of the Lamb? Or
can we expect any thing but an eternal divorce from him, whom
we have thus us'd.</p>
                  <p>I have given you some expressions by which you may judg what
kind of Purity we are to aim at: I shall come a little nearer that of
the Text by one or two more.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> are exprest in Scripture by <hi>White Raiment,
Revel.</hi> 3. 18. a <hi>White Robe, c.</hi> 7. 9. for the<note n="c" place="margin">Rev. 19. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Fine Linnen is the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness
of the Saints,</hi> as it there follows. Now the reason of this
compellation is, it is call'd <hi>Raiment</hi> because it is to cover our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40114:61"/>
and our shame; for our sins are accounted such. In Gods eyes
every wicked person is the same thing as a deform'd creature with
his nakedness shamefully uncover'd and prostituted. This is clear
out of those places <hi>Rev. 16. 15. least he walk naked, and they see his
shame. Rev. 3. 18. Buy of me White Raiments, that thou maist be
cloth'd, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear.</hi> For that
it is call'd <hi>Raiment,</hi> and <hi>White Linnen</hi> because of the Purity. White
is the purest color, the least spot or stain is immediatly discern'd
upon it: and if it be upon Fine Linnen, makes it presently cast off
by them, whose glory it is to be neat and clean, it shall no more
come neer them till the spots and stains be wash'd off. And Oh
that we had but this pride for our souls, that we were but as ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
to have our immortal Spirits neatly deckt when we appear
in Gods sight, as our putrifying carkasses when we go in company:
that when we slip or fall, and when a spot does stain this Linnen
even of Righteousness, that we would instantly wash it in our tears
and the bloud of Christ, the laver that is prepar'd for this Linnen,
for<note n="d" place="margin">Rev. 7. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>they made their garments white in the bloud of the Lamb:</hi> and
that for the time to come we would be but as careful of keeping it
neat; of preserving it from stains, as we are of finer linnen.
And God himself makes use of our pride in that kind to be our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
<hi>Jer. 2. 32. Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her
attire? yet my people have forgotten me dayes without number.</hi> And
sure I am, the expression of <hi>Fine Linnen</hi> aims at a great degree of
Purity, when it calls that careful conscionable duty the<note n="e" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>walking
worthy of the Christian calling,</hi> whereunto we are called, even the
walking diligently in all the Commandments of God; calls I say,
this Righteousness <hi>fine linnen clean and white:</hi> for it is the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of that pure clothing that we shall be drest in at our
wedding with Christ, it is our spousal linnen when we go to meet our
Bridegroom <hi>Rev. 19. 7, 8. The Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his
wife hath made her self ready, and to her was granted that she should be
arraied in fine linnen clean and white,</hi> to teach us that we should be
always as careful of our ways, always drest in mind, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd,
as if we were to go and meet our Bridegroom. Yea it is the
expression of that pure Clothing, which we shall be cloth'd in
Heaven with, where we shall be <hi>pure as God is pure,</hi> perfectly holy:
<hi>Rev. 3. 4. Thou hast a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled
their garments, and they shall walk with me in white;</hi> to let us see
that this expression by which our Righteousness is call'd <hi>white
clothing,</hi> requires us to have our conversation in Heaven, even
while we are here; to make our lives here but as a preparation to
that Marriage-feast, to be but the time of dressing our selves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand. For we must array our selves in <hi>fine linnen,</hi> the very same
dress in which we must walk with Christ; for, <hi>they shall walk with
me in white,</hi> saith he: yea 'tis his own dress also, for the garments
of <hi>Christ, Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> in the Mount was<note n="f" place="margin">Mark 9. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>white shining Raiment.</hi>
Holiness is transfiguration upon earth: so that this compellation
from our daily diligence in the cleansing and the keeping of our
linnen does direct us to the same diligence in neatness of our souls,
and requires of us such a Purity as with which God is pure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:40114:62"/>
4. <hi>Purity</hi> it is called <hi>light,</hi> as also <hi>sin</hi> is called <hi>darkness</hi> Rom. 13. 12.
<hi>Put ye off the works of darkness and put ye on the armor of light:</hi> and
<hi>Matth. 5. 16. Let your light so shine before men;</hi> and that very fitly,
because nothing so pure as light, so clear as shine and noon-day, it
is the most pure of all visible creatures, it is not possible so much as
to sully shine or to spot the light; the foulest dung-hill that it can
shine upon, does not at all defile it; you may put out the day, but
you cannot stain it. And truly no expression comes near the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Light, for it is so clean as it is set to express the very Holiness
of God himself, 1 <hi>John 1. 5. This then is the message which we have
heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is Light, and in him is no
darkness at all.</hi> And therefore while our Piety is called <hi>light,</hi> it
teaches us that we labor to be <hi>pure as he is pure;</hi> the kind of Purity,
which how it is, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>James</hi> hath set down <hi>c.</hi> 1. 17. where he explains
this very expression, <hi>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from
above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom there is
no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</hi> They are Astronomical
expressions belonging to the Lights of Heaven: God is not like
them that change oft; not like the Moon that hath its tides of
light, now full, and then dark; nor is he like the Sun, he hath
not any <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Tropick,</hi> who when he is come near to us and makes
summer, then turns back again and goes fromward us: neither
must our Light have any such, our Holiness must have no Solstice;
our Devotion sometimes mounting with a bright and holy flame as
it would breath up into Heaven it self, sometimes fainting and
sinking as it would expire and die: now our endeavors strong and
violent, we strive, pant and climb; afterwards we slacken and go
backwards. Neither yet a waning Moon, Holiness ebbing and
flowing, now increasing, then again decaying; which tho it be
sometimes glorious with a full shine, is yet otherwhile the darkest
part of the whole Firmament. It must not be so with our Piety,
sometimes at a Sermon, or before a Communion, or upon some
sharp rebuke of Gods in an affliction, cross, or other occasion very
high and shining; but then again at another time like the New-Moon
no light at all; the Devotion is sunk and extinct, and our
vanities possess us wholy. No fits of Purity, Paroxysms of Piety,
that come like the heats of agues now and then, but with great
intervals between, will serve the turn; but it must give a constant
shine. Devotion must be a fixt Light, such as is not variable and
turning; and so this expression shews how we must purify <hi>as he is
pure,</hi> with kind, I say, not with degree. For the Text does not
mean that we should be as pure as he; to aim at such a virtue were
Rebellion, and the hopes of such a Purity were <hi>Lucifers</hi> Ambition,
and would throw us down to Hell. Neither yet pure as he is pure,
without any mixture of spot or stain. For while we are made up
of a mixt composition, we shall never be so pure, neither is any such
exacted of us. All the meaning is, if we have hopes to be like God
hereafter with glorious likeness, we must endeavor also to be like
him here; and that is don by endeavoring after Purity, forasmuch
as God is pure.</p>
                  <p>Here is then an efficacious motive for us to labor after Purity, it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40114:62"/>
makes us like God. To be a Child or a Son in Scripture is the same
thing as to be like, or do such works as the other does: <hi>Ye are of your
Father the Devil, and his works ye do,</hi> John 8. 44. and what in one
place is said<note n="g" place="margin">Matt. 5. 45.</note> 
                     <hi>That ye may be the children of your Father which is in
heaven,</hi> in an other place is, <hi>that ye may be like you Father.</hi> For
whatever the Children of a Natural Father be, Gods Children must
be like him, or they are not his; and the way to be so is but to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
after Holiness, to be still amending by little and little, daily
cleansing out some sin or other: he vouchsafes to call this <hi>purifying
as he is pure,</hi> he calls such a person like him and his Child.</p>
                  <p>But secondly whose Children are they and like whom, who go on
still in their courses of wickedness? and if they do not grow daily
worse, as few there are that do not, yet they never think of growing
better, if we should examin them by the expressions we have given.</p>
                  <p>And take them first to that of <hi>Light,</hi> by which we saw a holy
Conversation was stil'd, we shall in that see the sad condition of a
wicked person, his life is all darkness: that sore Plague of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
which three days made intolerable, is still upon the Sinners Soul,
nothing but night about him. And indeed nothing else befits his
deeds of darkness, as sins are call'd; which how glorious and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
soever they seem to him, the onely modes and gallantry, yet
alas the splendor of them is but like the shine of lightning, full of
horror in it self, and makes the darkness of the night also more
irksom. And what can these men, that have no light, whose deeds
are all the deeds of night and darkness; what can they expect but
to be <hi>cast</hi> at last <hi>into utter darkness, where there is onely weeping, and
wailing, and gnashing of teeth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. If we take them to the other expression of <hi>White Raiment,</hi> how
will they whose open exemplary sins do strip them and expose them
naked, have reason to be asham'd, and to cover themselves with
their own confusion, as with a clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e? How wretchedly stupid is
the heart of this People that glory in their shame, that count their
sins the onely gaudy bravery? when as poor souls <hi>they are miserable,
and poor, and naked,</hi> Rev. 3. 17. There was no such disgraceful
thing as to have the uncomly parts of the body laid open to publick
sight: so <hi>Hanun</hi> us'd <hi>Davids</hi> Ambassadors, whom he thought Spies
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 4. which was occasion enough for a war upon them. And
God expresses <hi>Isaiah 20. 4. He shall lead away the Egyptians Prisoners,
naked with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of Egypt.</hi> And you
may see what God threatens to adulterous <hi>Israel, Isaiah 3. 16, &amp;c.</hi>
and much more at large in <hi>Ezek. 16, and 23. that she might be laugh'd
to scorn, and had in derision,</hi> and might be an infamous woman. And
in one place he threatens to discover her by throwing her cloths
over her head. Now I have shew'd you that Holiness is the onely
Virginity, and sin is the Souls whoredom; and the expression that I
have in hand tells you that Holiness is the onely garment, and the
openest of sinning is the Souls nakedness; which if you put together,
you will see, that a profane person, an open sinner is the same scorn'd
thing, as a whore with her cloths over her head, a bare strumpet
acting naked lewdness in high ways, with her unexpressible filthiness
expos'd in publick to eyes and shame. And is such a thing as this fit
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40114:63"/>
to go to God, or to be a Spouse of Christ? No his Bride must be
arrai'd in <hi>fine white linnen,</hi> that is the <hi>righteousness of the Saints,</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note> and
<hi>without holiness no one shall see him: For he that hath that hope, must

                  <p>
                     <hi>This Hope.</hi> What Christian Hope is: it is a patient and a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
expectation of the performance of all Gods Promises. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
expectation it is <hi>Rom. 8. 25. if we hope, then do we with Patience
wait for it.</hi> Comfortable it must needs be, because of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of its object, Gods Promises; all the comfort of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
are the very ground of it, <hi>Rom. 15. 4. That we thro patience
and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope:</hi> and it is therefore
call'd <hi>Coloss. 1. 23. The hope of the Gospel.</hi> Whatsoever mercy is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the whole Gospel, Remission of sins, and everlasting
Blessedness, all those rich and precious mercies which that does
propose, and which God himself thought to be the most temting
baits to allure us, even all these our Hope does fly at. You may find
them every where scatter'd; the Resurrection from the dead
<hi>Acts 23. 6. I am accus'd of the hope and resurrection from the dead;</hi> and
<hi>c. 28. 20. For the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</hi> Secondly
Eternal Life, <hi>Tit. 1. 2. In hope of Eternal Life, which God that cannot
lie, promised before the world began.</hi> Thirdly the Glory to come,
<hi>Rom. 5. 2. We rejoyce in hope of the Glory of God:</hi> and <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. it is
call'd the <hi>Hope of Glory.</hi> Yea the being like God himself in the
Text, <hi>We know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him,</hi> and
then it follows, <hi>and he that hath this hope purifieth himself as he is
pure;</hi> as also <hi>Tit. 2. 13. That blessed hope, the glorious appearing of
the great God, and our Savior Jesus Christ.</hi> All these the Christian
does with joy and confidence expect <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
                  <p>And here you may see the price of your calling, whatsoever
<hi>good things God hath prepar'd for them that love him;</hi> and they are
such,<note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9.</note> as <hi>neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, neither can enter into
the heart of man</hi> to comprehend. Yea whatsoever good things he
hath prepar'd for himself, his own glories, all these he hath set out
to bait our hopes with; these are a Christians most assured expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Whosoever thou art, that art a careful Soul, and with strict
Religion followest after Holiness, thou maist securely give the
Scoffers of the world and the wicked leave to call thee miserable, to
deride thy strictnesses and thy austerities, to say thy mortifications
do make thy life sad and uncomfortable: alas! they do not see the
Hope that is laid before thee, such a Hope as made thy Savior<note n="k" place="margin">Heb 12. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the cross and despise the shame.</hi> They look upon thy strict per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
but they do not look upon thy expectations, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
not the Crown of those performances: for if they did, they
would not certainly think the present momentany pleasures of their
sins could countervail that Crown. Be the hardship what it will, it
is a comfortable Hope, and that sufficiently confirm'd to us; full
of assurance it leans upon the whole Trinity, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 21. That our
hope might be in God.</hi> and <hi>Tim. 1. 1. Our Lord Jesus Christ our Hope.
Rom. 5. 5. That we may abound in Hope thro the power of the Holy
Ghost.</hi> The Power of the whole God-head ingag'd both to secure
and to support our Hope. <hi>A blessed Hope</hi> Tit. 2. 13. a Hope that is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40114:63"/>
enjoyment. And if it be a blessed Hope, what will the possession
be; if there be happiness in the expectation, what will there be in
the fruition? O purify your selves and come and see: which
brings me to the last part, how this Hope does set a man on puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying;
for <hi>every man that hath this Hope, purifies himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to declare and prove this to you I shall do two things. First
prove that this is such a Hope, as hath in it motive enough to set a
man on purifying. Secondly that he that does not purify, cannot
have this Hope.</p>
                  <p>1. This Hope hath certainly motive enough to set a man on pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying:
had we laid the hopes of heaven near our hearts, were our
thoughts but once set and bent upon the joys above, we would easily
perswade our selves to set upon the mending of our selves. What
will not hope do? All the emploiments of the world do but serve
this passion; <hi>They that plow, plow in hope,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> because the
heavens promise them a season of harvest; tho they do frown in seed-time
and storm against their labors with inundations of tempest,
or freez the earth into an untam'd hardness, till it become iron as
their instruments, yet will they melt themselves or they will thaw
those frosts, and toil as if they would vie drops with winter clouds, in
showers of sweat as well as rain, merely because they hope to reap.
And they that plow the sea are yet more slaves to Hope; for they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
death with all its terrors for the hopes of a gainful venture, they
do charge thro a shower, a deluge of waves that do assail them with
foaming wrath, and sustain an inundation of billows that fall like
Gods swelling cataracts, as if they came from heaven out against
them, and are fearless when they are but an inch remov'd from an
Abyss of ruin that gapes like hell; men of confidence, hard as those
rocks which they despise for hopes of a little profit. And what shall
we say to the poor Soldier, who for hopes of rags and roots will
charge fire, whom the promise of, God knows, a thin salary will make
to run into as great a storm and tempest of flame, as the Seaman
does of water, even into a shower of death? The most active of our
passions either submit to Hopes, or owe their violence to an activity
deriv'd from them. Do not men bridle in all their desires, and the
furies of their passions to the peevish will and liking, and become
perfect compliance to the otherwise intolerable humors of one
whom they hope to please, or from whom they hope for some inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
or preferment? And the Tragedies of Ambition, which
useth towade thro a sea of bloud and sin, that does scorn Relations,
defy God and its own Conscience, reverse States, and confound all
rather than miss its aim, are but the issues of a most uncertain Hope.
And then, my Brethren, would not the Hopes of Heaven be able
to do somthing with us, when the Hopes of a little know not whats,
will do all this? Would we not <hi>sow to the Spirit,</hi> where the harvest
is Blessedness? Would we not <hi>war against the Flesh,</hi> when he that
overcomes should have a <hi>Crown immortal and incorruptible?</hi> Would
we not comply with Christ and please him to get his inheritance,
and have some ambition for the Throne of God, if we did but hope
for these, as we do for the other? Yes my Brethren. I will give an
example of one, who slighted all the most glorious satisfactions of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40114:64"/>
the most swelling earthly hopes, and when he had every thing
brought to him that ambition could gape for, yet threw off all upon
these onely Hopes, <hi>Hebr. 11. 24, 25, 26, &amp;c. When he was co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> to years,</hi>
when he came to the age of understanding the honors of a Court,
and when his appetite was grown ripe for the delights that do attend
one, and he fit for the enjoyment of them, and the opportunity of
them thrown into his hands by being taken in Son of the Crown,
and so Possessor of all the advantages of pleasure which such a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can afford: and when on the other side there was nothing in
the other scale, but the sorrows of a low vassalage, and the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of a hard slavery; nothing but a brickiln to be set against the
Palace, and instead of the rich variety of earthly entertainments
not so much as<note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 5. 16.</note> straw to make their brick of; that he should chuse
the afflictions; and as if his will were not alone engag'd that way,
but his understanding also led, that he should esteem that wanting,
that contemtible condition, the <hi>reproach</hi> of Religion <hi>to be greater
riches than the treasures of Egypt.</hi> And indeed the very reproach of
Christ is greater riches, riches I shall carry with me to that great
Tribunal at the dreadful day, that will be the great Kings Badge,
his Livery upon me when I stand before his Throne, when all the
spangles of your pomps shall be faln off and look as gastly to the
wicked as their own sad carcasses or sadder expectations: as if there
were more shine and splendor in the dirt, which scorn does throw
into the face of Piety, than in the Pomps of Wealth. Now this
must sure be from some strange consideration. Why all was upon
this score, <hi>he had respect to the recompence of the reward,</hi> he hop'd for
<hi>better things:</hi> what's the Son of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter to the Son of
God? or the succession to the Crown of <hi>Egypt</hi> in comparison with
the possessing the Inheritance of Heaven? 'Tis true the treasures of
that Crown may furnish me with the aims of all my appetites,
what'ere my heart or what my lust can wish that will get me the
opportunity of having, it will allow me all those pleasures which
all the world gapes after, riches to procure for them; whatever cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity,
or emulation, or sin does long for, they will prostitute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me. But what are all those satisfactions in comparison with
the joys of God? Is there delight in the full affluence of those en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments?
Hath God indulg'd pleasure to those things which he
hath allow'd to wicked <hi>Egypt?</hi> and shall I think he hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
greater pleasures for his own self, and for those he intends to
make happy with him? Now let me have Gods delights, Heaven
I do assure my self hath the more advantages, and therefore there
I chuse. And so he chose rather the afflictions of this world, for
he had an eye to the recompence of the reward; and by this we are
sure, if we had hopes, we should make other choices than we do.
If a sin come to temt me drest with all its pleasures, and cloath'd
with all the bewitching arts it can put on, or fancy paint it out
with, if at the same time I can but look up to my Hopes, bethink
my self of the rewards of Religion, and recollect that there are no
such pleasures in the sin, as there are prepar'd for me, if I abstain
from it, shall I not then reject and scorn the temtation, think it
impertinent and foolish, and wonder it should be so unreasonable
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40114:64"/>
to desire, or think me so vain as to grant upon score of pleasure in
the commission, when I am sure of greater if I do not commit it?
Shall I not have reason to believe the sin very unkind to me, when
it allures me with some little delight, and I must part with all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
for it? No surely nothing can withdraw him, whom a
Christians Hopes do entertain. But because temtations are apt to
prevail, where there is no appearance of danger, to come a little
nearer to you, that you may with terror see that none can have
this Hope but they that purify, which was the last thing, I shall
onely ask thee, whosoever thou art that hopest to have thy sins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
thee and to have Eternal Life, upon what grounds thou
hopest it? We have no reason to hope for any thing, but what
God hath promis'd. Now hath God any where promis'd that thou
particularly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>alt be sav'd? Certainly no. What then? why dost
thou hope? if thou canst, answer me. Because he hath promis'd
to the<note n="l" place="margin">Matt. 5. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Pure in heart, that they shall see God,</hi> he hath given assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to them that <hi>repent</hi> that they shall be forgiven; and I how
sinful soever I have bin, yet I am penitent, I endeavor to purge
out that old leaven, to cleanse my self, I am resolv'd not to allow
my self any of my vicious inclinations or my customes, I'le strive
against my petty sins, and my soul is humbled in me, and therefore
have I Hope. If thou canst answer thus, thou hast indeed good
grounds, thou hast prov'd that thou maiest hope: but withal thou
hast prov'd also that thou dost purify, and upon that score dost hope.
For if thou didst not repent, and amend, and purge thy self from
thy filthy wickednesses, thou must then know, that the same God
that seal'd all his promises with the bloud of his Son, did also repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and seal these threatnings in his suffering, <hi>Without holiness no man
shall see God.</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">Luke 13. 3.</note>

                     <hi>Go ye cursed into

sins, dost any of these deeds of the Flesh, I shall onely ask thee, are
not these threats as true, and as much to be believ'd as his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises?
And if thou dost believe them, how is it possible that thou
that liv'st in any of those courses which these threats belong to,
canst have any hope? When God hath so solemnly declar'd thou
shalt have nothing but everlasting ruin, how darest thou, how canst
thou hope for Heaven? This is the same thing as to think to
anchor on the billows, or to lay foundations in a wave and on a
storm; to hope in threats at least in opposition to all Scripture and
to all promise, to wage war with the Gospel, and resolve to have
them both against, and in despite of God: and that certainly will
very little avail thee. No he that does not amend cannot hope;
for he that hopes must needs purify himself.</p>
                  <p>And now should we apply this to the careless Sinner, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40114:65"/>
first not onely what sad character S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> does give of men in
that condition, how it is the description he gives of the Heathen,
and he joins it with other most comfortless expressions, <hi>Eph. 2. 12.
without Christ, strangers from the Covenant of promise, having no hope,
and without God in the world:</hi> but also look upon the experience,
how to be in a lost desperate condition in relation to so eternal a
consequence as the world to come imports, is such a thing as none
was ever able to stand under the consideration of it; one hours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
sinks them for ever: we could not bear the weight of it. <hi>Judas</hi>
did chuse all the sad issues of it hereafter rather than the passion
here, thought it easier to go meet Gods fury than despair of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and when he saw he had no hopes of pardon, he ran to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
No we are resolv'd we must hope to be sav'd.</p>
                  <p>2. Consider that it is impossible for the wicked man, while he
continues such, to hope: he cannot chuse but know that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
concern him not, they are conditional, they are made onely
to them that repent and believe, and God knows that he hath not
don yet; so that nothing but the threats belong to him. And
then how shall we reconcile these considerations, if we put them
both together in the Sinners mind? How shall they be at peace
and not tear one another and the soul? It is impossible to endure
not to hope, and yet 'tis impossible that man should hope; and if
this contest happen when he goes to die, then his own thoughts
will drag him down to the Abyss with more violence than the
fiends. Sure 'tis a very sad consideration to think that men that
know the wretchedness of being hopeless, that dare not not hope,
will not yet industriously and piously set upon the performance of
that condition on which they may hope, will not purify that they
may have reason to expect the promises. And it is more sad to see
that men, who never purge themselves from filthiness of Flesh or
Spirit, but go on in their sinful courses, and consequently know,
that while they are such they cannot hope, yet will in despite of
that knowledge hope, and do notwithstanding all think to come
to Heaven. Certainly while a man goes on to sin, to hope for
mercy is presumtion in him, and so another sin added to the rest;
yea 'tis a disbelieving of Gods threatning, an affronting him in his
veracity, an imputing falsehood to his menaces, and a putting
himself almost out of the possibility of repenting. For he that do's
hope for Salvation in the condition he is in, hath no temtation at
all to change his condition, but is likely to go on confidently and
hopingly to eternal perdition: it were a mercy to such a person to
be struck into despair, that he may be taught the wretchedness of
his condition and hurried out it, in which as long as he does hope,
there's no reason to expect that he should leave it, but by becoming
hopeless in it may be frighted from it, and the gates of hell is the
onely probable means to let that man into the way of heaven.
O the Christians Hope! it is the <hi>hope of righteousness</hi> Gal. 5. 5. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but holiness and righteousness can give a man ground
for it. And certainly, my Brethren, it is such a Hope as would
countervail the trouble and the pains of reforming our selves.
What will not a man undertake, which he can but hope to go thro,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40114:65"/>
and is assur'd of a large recompence for doing? and surely Heaven
is worth the endeavouring after, and that blessed Hope worth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
our selves for. For it was worth the death of the Son of
God; Christ was content to be crucified to compass it, and cannot
we be content to purify our selves for it? Will you see what hope
can perswade a man to do? See <hi>Abraham</hi> to whom God promis'd
onely the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that not to be enjoied by himself
nor by his Son, but onely by the Posterity of <hi>Isaac</hi> his Son, and his
Promises were further off than Heaven; yet after that, before
<hi>Isaac</hi> had any Posterity, when he was but a child, God<note n="s" place="margin">Gen. 22. 2.</note> commands
him to go and sacrifice his <hi>Isaac,</hi> and go to cut off all hopes of ever
enjoying it, yet<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 4. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>against hope he believed in hope,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul, and
he that had receiv'd the promises</hi> of God, <hi>offer'd up his onely begotten
Son</hi> Heb. 11. 17. <hi>i. e.</hi> having entertain'd and embrac'd the promise
of a numerous seed and people that should spring from him, and
having no other Son but this from whom they should spring, nor
possibility in nature, nor promise above nature that he should have
any more children, but a plain<note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 22. 17, 18.</note> affirmation that this People, to
whom the Promises belong'd, should come from <hi>Isaac;</hi> yet having
once truly hop'd that God would perform his promise, he absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obei'd that command of Gods resolving to kill the Son, on
whom all those Promises depended. And now my Brethren, there
is no such puzles in our Hope, nor no such hard thing requir'd of
us, no Sons to be sacrific'd but onely a few vices, no doubtful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext
promise of a <hi>Canaan</hi> onely, but plain assured Heaven: and
then had we but the least degree of his hope, as we have infinitely
greater reason, how would we sacrifice any thing to Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?
how would we offer up a lust, and think a sin a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for the hopes of Heaven? and he that had <hi>this hope,</hi> would
certainly <hi>purify himself as he is pure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is but now the Church hath celebrated the Ascension of our
Lord Christ, and the great Proposal of the Angels <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 11. to all
those Disciples that beheld him going up to Heaven and gaz'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him so wishly, was that <hi>they should see him come again.</hi> Now the
particular comfort of that coming so again is, <hi>when he shall appear,
we shall be like him 1 John</hi> 3. 2. and the hopes of being so S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John</hi>
thought a sufficient motive to set every man on purifying, and that
himself: for this lustration cannot be perform'd by Proxy, and be
remitted to another; for even our Saviors Righteousness will not
be imputed unto those, who will have none besides; he redeems
and saves none but them whom he has sav'd from their sins.</p>
                  <p>Reveal, O Blessed God, some of thy Glory which thou hast pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for them that love thee, some of that blessed Hope of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
calling to our hearts, that it may stir our desires and longings,
and heat them into hopes; and that we having the hopes of seeing
thee, may purify, and may escape that day of fire, which shall melt
the Heavens, and purge those glorious bodies which are not pure in
thy sight. Behold, O God, we tremble with horror of thy dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Judgment. The Angels are not clean in thy sight, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphims
cover their faces, what then shall become of us vile filthy
Sinners, whose daily impurities have so defil'd both our souls and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40114:66"/>
bodies, that we are but one mass and heap of uncleaness. Blessed
God, we know that as long as we continue such, we cannot hope to
see thee in mercy; we know that if we <hi>repent not,</hi> we <hi>shall all perish;</hi>
we know that if we <hi>live after the Flesh, we shall die</hi> eternally; we
know that <hi>neither fornicators,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall have any inheritance.</hi> O let
this knowledg apply it self to our hearts and consciences, that the
terrors of it may fright us from the vain hopes that we do cherish of
being happy, notwithstanding we go on in our sinful courses, for
alas those hopes will perish with us; and that those terrors may so
work on us to set upon amendment. Cleanse and wash, we pray thee,
all our impurities in the bloud of thy Son, bury them in his grave,
never to rise hereafter, and melt our hearts into repentant tears,
that so our hearts may become purer. O thou that didst cleanse us
with thy bloud, baptize us with thy <hi>Holy Spirit and with fire,</hi> that it
may purge out our dross and filthiness, and be an earnest to us of
that glorious Purity, which we shall have in Heaven, seeing thee as
thou art, and becoming like thee, where we shall sin no more, but
for ever serve and praise thee.</p>

VIII.
OF THE HIDING PLACE
From Indignation.</head>
                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>Isaiah 26. 20.</bibl>
                     <q>Come my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
doors about thee; hide thy self as it were for a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
until the Indignation be overpast.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>PON the Eve as it were and the Vigils to the day
of Indignation, when we cannot but look upon
it as ready to be pour'd out on us in a full stream,
when we see destruction make close approches
to us, work round about us, and punishment
like our sin lies at the very door, ready either to
enter in upon us, or seize us if we offer to come
out; to offer at a way to prevent all this, that
should discover to you a safe retreat from those threats that pursue
this Nation in general, open a shelter from the present storm, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chuse but be seasonable; yet such a thing the Text do's venture
at, and if God himself knew the best way to keep off his Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from us, then here it is; for he prescribes, <hi>Come my people, enter
thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thy self as it
were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I do divide the Text, I shall tell you in what sense I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
those words, <hi>Enter thou into thy chamber and shut the doors about
thee,</hi> which if it be not according to the immediat and literal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of them, is yet such as is justified by a parallel place of
Scripture dictated by our Savior himself, and will afford us most
wholesom observations. I take them in the sense they have <hi>Matt. 6. 6.
But thou, when thou praiest, enter into thy chamber and shut thy door,</hi> so
that here they will be the form of prescribing praier: in dangerous
and sad times, when if thou<note n="a" place="margin">Isaiah 8. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>look unto the earth, thou shalt behold
nothing but trouble, and darkness, and dimness of anguish,</hi> why then
lift up thine eyes to Heaven, go to thy Praiers; in times of change
when thou knowest not which way to betake thy self, go to the
Closet of thy devotions, take off thy thoughts from these sad objects
here below, and fix them on the comforts of Religion, divert thy
thoughts from the occasions of discontent, and employ them in
meditations upon God, in converses with him, in contemplations
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40114:67"/>
of his Promises and joys; in one word spend thy time in Praiers and
Devotions.</p>
                  <p>That's the sense; the parts are 1. A perswading invitation, <hi>come
my people;</hi> wherein are the persons invited, <hi>my people,</hi> secondly the
invitation, <hi>come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Here is that they are invited to, set down by way of counsel,
and that hath several branches.</p>
                  <p>1. Enter thou into thy chambers.</p>
                  <p>2. Shut thy doors about thee.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Hide thy self,</hi> with the duration of it <hi>as it were for a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and secondly the end of this and all the rest, that the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation
may pass over them; <hi>until the Indignation be overpast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the handling of them I shall take this course, first from the
first general I shall speak somwhat of the persons invited; that have
this compellation <hi>my people,</hi> and giving you some reasons of it.</p>
                  <p>From the second I shall observe that in times of storm or any sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the onely way to withdraw our selves from the violences of
discontents and troubles, is to retire to praiers, and the onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
then is in the Closet-exercises of Devotion.</p>
                  <p>3. From the next part, <hi>hide thy self,</hi> that Praiers are in sad daies
the onely great security, and the devotion-chamber a sure hiding
place from Indignation.</p>
                  <p>4. From the duration, that the sorrows of the afflictions, which
God does suffer to fall upon his own devout People, they last but
<hi>for a little moment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. From the last there is none of Gods Indignation in them, all
that overpasses them.</p>
                  <p>First of the compellation my People, <hi>come my People.</hi> Now God
may speak to those here for two reasons; first to shew us that in the
times of storm and of the breakings out of indignation God invites
none to courses of security, puts none upon ways of safety, do's not
take care of any but those that are his People, and those in whom
his People are concern'd, as Kings, who are the nursing Fathers of
his Church; as for others let them take their own courses, look to
themselves, but come ye, <hi>come my People. My People</hi> is a word that
includes relation, and wherein it do's consist you will find from the
correlative set together with it in the very making of the Covenant,
<note n="b" place="margin">Jer. 31. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>I will be their God, and they shall be my People;</hi> they who take God
to be their Lord, and assume to become his obedient liege People,
such have indeed a right and title to his Protections: to provide for
and take care of them it is his office, he undertook it in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and not to do it were to renounce his compact, which he
bound himself to with an Oath, which 'tis impossible for him to do.
But as for others, they have no plea to these. Can Rebels claim
protection, and such who renounce relations, that put themselves
off from being his People, expect that he should look after and take
care of them, be their Guardian and Security? The different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of these two sorts of People in relation to Gods caring for
them in time of judgment you will find <hi>Mal</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18. In the
times of undisturb'd abundance and of full prosperity, when the
God of this World is good to them that serve him, when the Lord
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40114:67"/>
lets men alone, and the ungodly thrive, then indeed his protections
are not much regarded, but wickedness &amp; wealth seem the strongest
security: but when God sends his Indignation abroad, and when
his Judgments sweep away those confidences, then this will be a
comfortable consideration, come what will come I have one that
hath writ me in his note-book, in his <hi>Book of Remembrance,</hi> to put
him in mind that he is to provide for me: and when the most flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
ungodly shall be stript of all his hopes and trusts, no least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
from them, nor can he look for any from the Lord, God hath not
so much as directions for him here, he hath no part, not in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
is not invited to his Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>els; then have I one that will
make me up amongst his Jewels, have the same cares of me as of his
peculiar precious treasures, and calls me to security, <hi>Come my People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or secondly <hi>my People,</hi> to let us see what arts of invitation God
does use to perswade us to take good counsel; he gives us all the
compellations of kindness, and speaks us as fair as possibly, not to
do him a courtesy but to be kind to our selves. In other places,
when he hath no design upon them, then he cries to <hi>Moses, thou</hi>
and <hi>thy People</hi> Exod. 32. 7. but when he would do good unto us,
when he would entice us to be safe, then <hi>come my People.</hi> So he
does elsewhere use all the titles of love, and cloths his invitations
with the wordings of our most known Courtships, that that which
useth to prevail with us, may do his work upon us. So in the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
5. 2. Open to me my love, my dove, my spouse, my undefiled;</hi> and
the whole book is but the Arts of Divine wooing. Strange that
the heavenly Bridegroom must court so much to be receiv'd by his
Spouse! Good God! that thou must be forc'd to give us good words
to prevail with us to be good unto our selves, that we must be
sooth'd, temted, and flatter'd into preservations and mercies, that
we should refuse remedy and Antidote unless it be guilded; that to
lie hid in times of Judgment, and to escape Indignation is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
enough to us, but we must be woo'd to do so: safety it self
must speak us fair or we will none of it, and God must flatter us into
the places of security, <hi>Come my People, enter into thy chambers,</hi> the
next.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Enter thou into thy chambers.</hi> Whence we did observe, that in
times of storm and calamity the onely way to withdraw our
selves from the violences of discontents and troubles, is to retire to
Praiers and Closet exercises of Devotion. If I should go to prove
this, I might read you the whole book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> the Psalter being
but <hi>Davids</hi> Liturgy in time of sadness, the service and the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his sorrows. To tell you that he says, <hi>In my trouble I will
go call upon the Lord</hi> Psal. 18. 6. and <hi>when I was in trouble I called
upon the Lord</hi> Psal. 120. 1. or again, <hi>for the love that I bear unto them
they take now my contrary part, but I give my self unto praier</hi> Psal. 109. 4.
this would be to no purpose, for the whole book is but doing this.
And indeed to do it, is the best counsel God himself do's give, 'tis
that he do's invite us to in such a discourse, <hi>come my people, enter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the comforts of it, I shall enclose them in the application,
which shall pass by that strange mistake that is in some men, who
seek to quench the sorrows of calamity by the entertainments of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40114:68"/>
sin, to divert sad thoughts by vicious company, to refresh themselves
with the jollities of iniquity, to choak the remembrance of their
afflictions with riot, and drown it in excesses. Alas, 'tis not go
abroad unto the open lodgings of intemperance and to the Inns of
pleasure, but <hi>come and enter thou into thy chambers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And secondly it shall omit that very near as great mistake of
them, who in times of impending calamity busy themselves with the
cares of the world, whose hearts are then especially set on thriving,
and they immerse themselves in the wayes of gain, looking on that
as the thing that is to be their great security, and that they shall
provide against all sad events by that. Strange! that in the time
of pungent troubles, when they are encompassed with misery, to
run into the thorns and briars, as our Savior calls them, should be
our onely hopeful refuge and retiring place, that men should be
then most griping after that, the cares of keeping which, and the
fears of loosing it are the onely great things that make calamity
grievous. He, who then makes himself Master of possessions, gives
pledges to Affliction. Shall I then put my self further out into the
world, when Gods discretion bids me <hi>enter thou into thy chambers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thirdly I apply directly to the calamitous, however destitute
and unhappy. When thou art brought at once low enough for pity,
but so unhappy as to be scorn'd, ruin'd, and contemn'd too, come
here, and pour out thy soul into the bosom of him, who thou art
sure will not refuse thee, nor turn away his face from thee, but
stands here to invite thee with all the compellations of love. Here
thou mayst lay open thy case to him that had so much kindness to
thee as to die for thee, and mingle thy own tears with the bloud of
God that was shed for thee. To have any friend whom to impart
thy griefs to, is in good measure to unlade and emty thy self of
them: thou hast here the most faithful bosom of thy Savior, whom
thou mayst behold in the same postures of affliction that thou thy
self art in, out of affection to thee and suffering for thee, in Agonies
of one and the other, sweating as much with heats of love to thee as
of pain for thee, hanging down his head upon the cross with lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishments
of kindness and of weakness, and his arms stretch'd into
the posture of receiving thee to his embraces, and his side open'd,
not onely to shed bloud and water for thee, but to receive thy tears
and give thee passage to his very heart. Come then my People,
come to me; if thy sad expectations be like plummets at thy heart
and weigh it down, yet lift up thy heart together with thy hands in
assur'd confidence that that kindness, which did thus express it self,
will never fail thee. If notwithstanding this, the pressure make
thy thoughts to sink and thy soul to grovel, let it be but a bowing
down in submission to my will, who certainly know what is best for
thee: come then and give thy self up into my hands, as into the
hands of a faithful Redeemer. Now the devout soul doing so, by
often betaking himself to God upon these occasions, becomes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his Maker, and in all discontents he will strait run
to his Acquaintance there to disburden himself; and in all fears
thither he hasts for shelter with the very same complacencies that
our Savior says the young one does to the wings of the hen at the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40114:68"/>
approach of danger: there the soul nestles, and is hugely pleas'd
with the apprehensions of its comfortable warm security. By fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
converses of this kind and other practices of Devotion, and
Meditations on the mercies of his providence and his protecting
kindnesses, besides the glories of his Preparations towards his future
Estate, the soul mounts up to great degrees of confidence and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie
with God: and God does use, when a heart does thus ply
and follow him and become intimate with him, to reveal himself
also to that heart in the midst of his devotions; when he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
with the Lord, he will breathe into him the inspirations of
Heaven, and with soft whispers speak peace close to his heart, break
in upon him with flashes of joy, warm him with gleams of comfort
which ravish the soul with delight in the emploiment. Hence
grow strange intercourses betwixt them, the Lord pours in of his
Holy Spirit, that bond and ligament of God and the soul, that
maintains perpetual commerce between them; they do nothing
but close and mingle as it were, till the heart mount up to those
extasies that we read of in devout persons, that entertain themselves
to miracle in the enjoyment of those Contemplations, which these
exercises do afford them. The heart then melts no longer in the
tears and sorrows of affliction, but with the dissolvings of love;
when thro excess of complacency in God and in his joys, the soul
hath a kind of impotency of Spirit, so as it cannot contain it self
within it self, but as a liquid thing hath its overflowings, and is
poured out into the bosom of the beloved, and by an outgoing
faints from it self into an union with the Object of its affections.
And the Soul that by the practices of Devotion is brought to be thus
affected, hath not onely fulfill'd the counsel of the Text, retir'd
into his chambers, but is also brought into Gods chambers, so the
Spouse in the <hi>Canticles</hi> expresses <hi>c. 1. 4. The King hath brought me into
his chambers,</hi> and <hi>c. 2. 4. He brought me into his banquetting house,
and his banner over me was love;</hi> and in <hi>c.</hi> 3. 10. she describ'd the
bed-chamber whether she was brought, <hi>the midst whereof was pav'd
with love:</hi> and all this means but the entertainments of devout Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations.
And Christ in the Parable concerning importunate
continuance in Praiers saith it<note n="c" place="margin">Matt. 7. 8.</note> opens the bed-chamber door and
gets in thither. And then, my Brethren, what need I be troubled
how the world does go abroad, when I am entertain'd in Gods ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting
house, and in his bed-chamber? It were easy for me to
produce instances of them that were so taken up with the joys of
Devotion, that they had scarce any thoughts for any thing besides,
they even forgot that which was most necessary to their being, it
made all other passions to languish, they had no appetites for other
things, at least there was no vigour in those appetites, onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied
desires from which the soul was quite retir'd, and minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Object of their Praiers, being as it were in trance and
swoons of Devotion. Neither is this any strange thing or without
reason, that the Soul that loves should be so employ'd about and
bent upon the Object of those desires, as to neglect all other of its
offices, so impetuous in serving them that it abandons all its other
business, attends no faculty but that which is engag'd upon that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40114:69"/>
Object, does not so much as lend it self to any outward organ, feeds
and advances onely that affection, but leaves the rest to decay and
languish, and being destitute of soul to die. Just so, if the love of
those Contemplations which Devotions afford take possession of the
heart, it becomes heartless to all other functions, careless and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid
to every thing besides; the Soul is so wholly bent upon the
Object of those impatient desires, that it does not animate any
other inclinations, they have no spirit in them, but are weak and
faint, neither can they employ the heart so as to make him mind
them: but just as the enamour'd person, that may be call'd and
waken'd into some other business, but let his thoughts alone, and
they run to his desires, there they unite and center. And to a
Soul that is thus taken up, what's the world, or the miscarriages
that are therein? Are there fears abroad? They do but make me
then withdraw into my chamber, where there are all these joys.
Does judgment threaten an utter desolation, make solitude about
us, and drive us into<note n="d" place="margin">Psalm 44. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>the place of dragons,</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi> words? I will
retire that way into Gods bed-chamber. Is the dimness of anguish,
and darkness as of <hi>the shadow of death</hi> coming upon the Land? yet
I am sure, that in the little Oratory there is the light of Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
Does Calamity rifle all, plunder the very bosom, breasts
and bowels; the bosom of its dearest guest, the breasts of their dear
burden, the bowels of their daily food, and rob necessity? Yea,
but how stands my Praier-chamber? It is not quite so ill, if they
have left me the food of immortality, the Body and Bloud of Christ;
it cannot plunder me of my Devotions, and there is always blessed
entertainment in Gods banquetting house.</p>
                  <p>If these comforts do seem too subtil and too notional for any,
tho this do happen merely by being unacquainted with the things
that give them, and I have shew'd you the way how you may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
arrive at them, of which this is the sum. The devout Soul
receives in times of discontent not onely liberty, but invitation to
go and bemoan his case to him that hath God-like compassions for
him, so much love to him as to die for him, and to cast himself
with confidence upon such a kindness, submitting to his all-wise,
all-loving will. These submissions are secondly rewarded by him
with the great contents of having Gods will don upon him, with
the comforts of finding that it is indeed best for him. And sure I
am there are that have experience, that never any sad thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to them, but they found that it was for the best. Thirdly
the custom of this repairing to God, and giving themselves up to
his guidance, begets a great acquaintance, an intimacy with the
Lord; he reveals himself and his comforts to that soul: it do's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
strange refreshings from enlightnings, breathings, inspirations,
evidences, and assurances, even tasts of promises and preparations.
Lastly the contemplations of these, and familiarity with God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
transcendencies of love and joy, which when they are once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd,
their desires languish to all other things, they seem low
and of base alloy, and consequently they take no content in them,
being swallowed up by the other.</p>
                  <p>Yet let others lower souls take the comfort of this consideration;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40114:69"/>
when things are so, that if they look into the world they can see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
round about them but the prospect of trouble, and if they go
on, besides the loss of all the opportunities of Religion, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
of their whole life will but serve the ruins of an hour, that they
have provided onely for spoil, heap't up for rapine, and gather'd
but a prey; when the affliction of such an hours consideration shall
have made them forget all their prosperity, so that in the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of things they cannot find one occasion of comfort: why then
those hours they have spent or shall go and lay out on devotion and
the service of God, they shall be sure will turn to their account, both
here as to the preservation of those opportunities and of their
Church; for sure if God be likely to be mov'd to the continuance
of them, 'tis to those that will make use of them, and 'tis for them,
(for what should others do with them, that do not value them nor
use them?) and will also turn to their account hereafter. That
Praiers and those other exercises go up for a memorial to God, as
the Angel told devout <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and prepare them mansions there,
when they shall be divested of all other habitations, and that with
<hi>Mary</hi> here is the better part that cannot be taken from them, that
when their Riches have forsaken them, taken the adverse party,
and gon to their enimies, these will stick by them, go along with
them even up to Gods Tribunal, and take their part at the day of
Judgment, when nothing dares appear for them but Christ and
Piety. Oh my Brethren, when you or I have spent one hearty hour
in humble zealous devotions, the hopes of the issues of that hour,
the confidence that God hath heard your and my Praiers, and
do's accept this our service, and will eternally reward it, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
thus, tho we be not able to raise our selves up to those heights
of joy and love and complacency before recited, yet those lower
hopes and confidences have more comfort in them than all the
hours of pleasure in my life; for what have I of that, when the
frolick's over. I may as well look for the footsteps of an impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
on the water whose gliding streams instantly smooth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or search for the tracts of birds in the yeilding air that shuts
and closes up it self in a little moment, as seek for relicts of joy
after the pleasure is past: alas the delight did vanish with the
laughter, and the comfort died as soon as the smile, the very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
of them is perisht, and there is nothing of them left alive,
but that now all is don, I am never the better for them. But the
comforts of my devouter hours shall never die, but when I go to
die my self, will be like life and immortality to me. O the strange
acquiescencies of soul in the Consideration! the few hours that a
man hath spent piously, how they will calm death, assist in agonies,
and releive from pains! how such a Soul anticipates his Heaven!
The truth is, to such an one death is welcom, and life, tho it have
on it <hi>the shadow of death,</hi> is full of comfort. For when all the world
about is <hi>Egypt,</hi> a devout man, tho he have but his chamber to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to, and his doors be shut upon him, he lives in <hi>Goshen;</hi> when
the consuming fire did run upon the ground throughout the land,
there was no storm in <hi>Goshen Exod.</hi> 9. 26. and when flashes of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
do burst in upon other persons, 'tis calm in the Praier-room.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40114:70"/>
When the destroying Angel had overrun every house in <hi>Egypt</hi> with
death, when there was nothing but carcasses and crying in each
dwelling, there was not one sick in <hi>Goshen Exod.</hi> 12. 30. When a
thick darkness dwelt upon the Nation, the <hi>Israelites had lights in
all their dwellings Exod.</hi> 10. 23. and when a sad dark cloud does sit
upon Gods Countenance and pour down inundations of tempest on
a people, yet then his face does shine in the Closets of devotion,
there he breaks in and does reveal his comforts; God is so there, as
his Angel was at that time, a Pillar of light to them, and of cloud
to those others, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 20. and when in this their pilgrimage he
takes off their chariot-wheels, <hi>v.</hi> 25. that they drive heavily, prest
with the weight of afflictions and the heavier incumbrances of the
World, striving against the tide and torrent of troubles, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring
nothing but rubs and crosses, and having on no wheels,
none of Gods comforts to bear them up, they march heavily till at
last the waters overwhelm them: when as to those others the waters
were a wall on the right hand and on the left; and to the devout
persons the troubles of their times, by making them retire into their
chambers, prove an occasion of security, which brings on the next
observation from the words, <hi>hide thy self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence we draw, that Praiers and the exercises of Piety are in
sad days the onely great security, and the Devotion-chamber a
sure hiding place from trouble. And indeed where else should we
take shelter, but in our Sanctuary? Where should we seek for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
but at the horns of the Altar, where we offer up the incense
of our Praiers, and the lifting up of our hands is as the evening Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice?
I have told you to retire thus into your chambers is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Gods bed-chamber, and where is safety to be had, if it be not
there? Is there not full quietness and calm in the Lords with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
rooms? Not to tell you that <hi>David</hi> plac't his Rock, his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress,
his Castle, his every word of safety upon this foundation:
not to reckon up an infinity of places besides <hi>Psalm</hi> 27. 5. and 61. 2,
3, 4, 5. I shall onely say, that 'tis impossible for any Sermon to say
better what I have to say for him that betakes himself to these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
rooms and nestles there, nor more pertinent to a time of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and distress, than the 91. <hi>Psalm</hi> hath spoke <hi>v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, &amp;c.</hi> and to which 'twere vanity, if not Tautology to add.
Should I labour to evince this further, I could prove strangely to
you, that good hearty devout Praiers are in time of danger a Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
even to a Miracle. Security from the fury of men, when single
Prayers did resist an Army, when <hi>Moses</hi>'s hand lifted up in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
slew more <hi>Amalekites</hi> than the armed hands of <hi>Joshua</hi> and
all his Regiments stretcht out; for <hi>when Moses lifted up his hand,
then Israel prevailed</hi> Exod. 17. 11. Security against the storm of
Gods assault; for a Praier of <hi>Moses</hi> is call'd a standing in the breach
against the Lord, when he came to destroy the People by a plague,
<hi>Psalm</hi> 106. 23. so God said <hi>he would destroy them, had not Moses his
chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrathful indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
least he should destroy them.</hi> They are terms of war, and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the desperatest act of Valour which war hath occasion for;
when wall and rampart could not resist the storm of shot, but the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40114:70"/>
Assault made its way thro stones and bulwarks, then must courage
become the Rampart, maintain the breach, and repulse the Assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants.
This is the danger and the glory of Valour, and this very
expression do's Scripture make use of to declare the force and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of a zealous Praier. When Gods indignation had storm'd the
People, when it had made a gap, a breach to enter and overrun
them in a moment, and the Angel with his sword drawn was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulting,
had began his deaths, in steps <hi>Moses,</hi> arm'd but with
single Praier maintains the breach, and turns away the Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Neither was this all, for it did not onely beat off his fury, but
assail'd him also, as it were took God captive, and held him that
he could not fall upon them. For in the 32. <hi>Exod.</hi> 9, 10. he cries
to <hi>Moses, it is a stiff-necked people, now therefore let me alone, that
my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them in a
moment:</hi> let me alone Hebr. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>dimitte me,</hi>

deprecationem tuam à facie mea,</hi> Chald. Loose me, and let me go,
suffer me, let me alone that I may destroy them; do not pray to
me, thy strong desires are as bonds and cords upon me, loose me,
and do not hold me: I can do nothing if thou pray, my arm of
power, my stretcht our arm is held in, it is restrain'd by thy strong
cries, thy violent sighs they cool my wrath that it cannot wax hot
against them, thy zeal it is irresistible; do not therefore make use
of it, do not hinder me, do not pray now, let me alone, <hi>and I will
make of thee a greater Nation;</hi> I will bribe thee to silence, because
my fury will not withstand thy Praiers; if thou maintain the breach,
I shall not take this People now by storm: be hir'd then to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
<hi>let me alone.</hi> But <hi>Moses</hi> he would take no bribes from God,
but he <hi>besought the Lord his God,</hi> as it follows there, and the sudden
effect of his Praier was, <hi>the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to
do unto his people.</hi> Here's the power of a fervent Praier, it hath a
kind of force on the Almighty, a force that he does seem as it were
afraid of, &amp; would have prevented; and so does often, warning his
Ministers the Prophets,<note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 16. cap. 11. 14. cap. 14. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Pray not for this people,</hi> I will not have you
pray least you should prevail upon mine indignation and overcome
my anger. And see then if you can find out such another security;
many defences may be made which will hold out against the fury
of men and their arm'd indignation, but notwithstanding those
defenses they lie open still to Heaven, no walls or bulwarks to be
made against that; upwards they are all gap and breach, and God
may storm them where they have no works. If we be strong enough
to keep out all our foes, we are not fortified to keep out plagues,
have no guard against Gods hand, his arrows fly over any defences.
But behold here defences against his Indignation, a line which he
cannot enter; Praiers will keep him off, and in the chamber of thy
devotions thou maiest hide thy self from the storms of Heaven:
when God turn'd Engineer, this was the direction he gave to keep
out himself, <hi>Come my people enter into thy chamber, and shut thy doors
about thee, hide thy self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall not stay to give you the qualifications of the Praiers that
are likely to prevail, how first S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>James</hi> saith<note n="e" place="margin">James 1. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>we must ask in faith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40114:71"/>
doubting,</hi> not wavering in our purposes, praying for what we
esteem the truth, but not resolv'd if things should otherwise suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
whether we should not comply with them; and how secondly
when we are to pray we must be such, as God hath not resolv'd
against, and so he will not hear us: but now returning to my
subject.</p>
                  <p>Now briefly to apply this, and here I will not say this Counsel was
indeed intended for days of persecution, &amp; that not so much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the malady, as in the nature of the prescription, when he that
will go to his praiers must indeed enter into his chambers, and hide
his devotions too as well as himself; if thou desirest at such a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to secure thy self, enter into thy Closet, being not permitted
to go into the Church: but this I will say, that even then when the
Altar is no Refuge, and the Temple wants a Sanctuary, and the
Holy of Holies an Asylum, even then the Closet will give shelter.
Devotions are a kind of Omnipotent Securities, they are shields
against the arrows of the Almighty: if for want of praiers to make
up the breach it come to pass that a people is destroy'd, and God
saith 'tis for that as much as for the demerits of their guilt <hi>Ezek. 22.
29, 30, 31. The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised
robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy; yea they have oppressed
the stranger wrongfully, and I sought for a man among them that should
make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land that I
should not destroy it, but I found none: therefore have I poured out mine
indignation upon them, I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath,
their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord God:</hi>
if the performances of it be a making good the gap against his
wrath, methinks it should a little move us in all our exigencies to
stand upon our guard, to know our own strengths, and not lazily
to suffer our selves to perish, when we may contend and strive with
God to save our selves. Or if the line of destruction be stretcht
out upon our Nation, if it have filled up the measure to the height,
that God have sworn tho <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were among his
people, yet should they save but their own lives, that is, their
Praiers should not prevail with him for an impunity unto the land:
however if we our selves desire in that great spreading ruin yet to
escape, to lurk so that the Angel of destruction may not find us out;
here is a place of Gods own choice to hide thee in. His fury will not
search there for thee to destroy thee, where his own self did bid thee
to retire for safety. He that commanded thee to enter into thy
chambers, did not mean to come there to seek thee out to ruin
thee; he that bid thee shut thy doors, intended that the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should not call in, but should pass by thee, which the Text do's
tacitly promise in the last words, <hi>until the indignation be overpast.</hi>
Some of the storm may fall upon a devout man notwithstanding
all his careful Praiers, but there's no anger nor no fury in that
storm; that he reserveth for the wicked, those who do take no care
for the averting of his wrath, but resolve to enjoy their pleasures
and their sins, till indignation overtake them, and sweep them
and their delights away at once. To these indeed every affliction
is vengeance and judgment, and their fiery trials here are but tasts
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40114:71"/>
and prelusions of Gods fearful wrath and fiery indignation; but to
the careful devout souls they are but the strokes of love, chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a father, there is no indignation in them;<note n="f" place="margin">Hosea 2. 14.</note>

OF THE REST TO BE OBTAIN'D
By them that labor and are heavy laden.</head>
                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>Matth. 11. 28.</bibl>
                     <q>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and
I will give you rest.</q>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ERE there no other difference betwixt Law and
Gospel than what these words hold out unto us,
yet had we abundant reason to rejoice and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in our condition, who are invited to the news
of Gospel-revelations. The way that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
himself by Law was by lightnings and
thunders on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the Pomp of it was a
Mountain not to be come near unto, that burnt
with tempests of fire, things that were not onely mazes but omens,
that typified those storms and tempests that were to be the portion
of transgressors, that limn'd out that unquenchable brimstone, and
denounc'd that dire thunder of <hi>Go ye cursed into everlasting fire,</hi>
which is the sentence of the Law in its own rigour. Yea and besides
that blackness and darkness too, so that notwithstanding all those
lightnings and those revelations God was still in the thick cloud
and in the dark, and Christ might well say in the verse before the
Text, <hi>No man knoweth the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever
the Son will reveal him;</hi> and when he comes to do that, he does it
in another strain, with words of another nature, all invitation,
<hi>Come unto me all ye that labor.</hi> The strain of Gospel is not to thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us into obedience, but <hi>I beseech you Brethren by the tender mercies
of God;</hi> and tho there be laboring and burden in the words, yet
those are the effects of Law, and there is ease and rest for that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
and those burdens in the words too, and to them it is the
Gospel that invites us, and it is Christ that gives them; for it is he
that saith, <hi>Come unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These words the Church makes use of for her call unto the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords body, and certainly it is impossible that they
should signify with greater Emphasis than upon that occasion, when
he does bid you come to him, that is, to the communication of his
body and his bloud; for <hi>the bread which we break is the communion
of the body of Christ.</hi> You come to him not onely for the emty kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a visit there, but to partake of his body and his bloud, all
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40114:72"/>
the redemtions, graces, mercies, which he purchased on the cross.
If ever Christ do call with passion, it is sure when he pours out that
bloud for us and saith, <hi>every one that thirsteth come, Come unto
me all ye that labor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words are an invitation of Christ, in which we may observe</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>The Persons invited,</hi> All ye that labor and are heavy laden.</p>
                  <p>2. The invitation it self, <hi>Come unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The entertainment at this invitation, Rest; <hi>I will give you
rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the handling of these I shall shew, first who those persons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
are, who they are that are said here to <hi>labor</hi> and to be <hi>heavy

                  </p>
                  <p>2. What is meant by their invitation, <hi>Come unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. How those persons come to be qualified for this invitation, so
as to be invited, and none other; how the laboring heavy laden
persons are the onely fit persons to come to Christ.</p>
                  <p>4. I shall touch the advantages those persons shall gain by
coming. Of these, and</p>
                  <p>1. Who they are that are said to <hi>labor</hi> and be <hi>heavy laden.</hi> The
words express extremity of burden and labor under it, and weariness
by reason of that labor; they are translated, <hi>fessi estis &amp; bajulantes
onera</hi> Syr. <hi>labore attriti &amp; gravati onere</hi> by the Arab. And indeed
they signify pains such as to make us pant and blow <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> signifies. Now this excess
of pains may denote two things.</p>
                  <p>1. Either the sinner under that notion as a sinner; sins them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
being in Scripture exprest by words that signify labor, trouble
and weight, and therefore the word in the Text translates <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
which means all those, especially iniquity, <hi>Mich. 2. 1. Wo to them
that devise iniquity,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that devise labors; and the very
next words will warrant it, <hi>and work evil:</hi> it being a most familiar
expression with the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> the Workers of Iniquity, not
onely because it is some mens emploiment and trade, here lies their
skill, their managery, they are not Artists in any thing besides;
but the secrets of sin, the mysteries of filthiness, the Magisteries of
Iniquity, these they are Professors of, in these chair-men: but also
Workers of iniquity because it is their toil, they sweat under it, it
is the vanity and vexation of their lives, which are rackt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing,
contriving, and acting the sins of their complexions and
ambitions. Will you see our Saviors sense of the vexing painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of sin: he calls your sins of the least size, <hi>peccata levia,</hi> as they
are esteem'd, motes in the eye <hi>Matth. 7. 3. Why beholdest thou the
mote that is in thy brothers eye?</hi> that is, why dost thou look so severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the light faults of others? Our escapes that we make slight of
they are of such a nature in themselves, as to cause the anguish and
fretting, that dust and splinters do in the tenderest part, the eye.
And if our souls were not all corneous, our consciences sear'd and
dead, we should with the same impatience bear them as our eye
does dust, with restlesness work against it, never quiet till it force
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40114:73"/>
out tears to wash away the dust. Yea worse than that, for the
word which we translate <hi>mote</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies a spill of wood, a little
shiver or splinter, a thing absolutely insuppportable to that part,
which if suffered, does not onely threaten it with intolerable pains,
but with absolute extinction. And truly every one of our slighter sins
is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a shiver in the eye; and then the grosser iniquities
will bear both the words of the text, of labor and burden, and are
in the same verse by our Savior entituled to an expression that hath
enough of both, even a beam in the eye: <hi>And considerest not the
beam that is in thine own eye,</hi> that is, thine own vaster crimes. Every
design'd and gross wickedness is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a thing whose agony
is as much beyond imagination as endurance. For how shall the eye
bear that which the shoulders must sink under, which onely pillars
can support? Yet such is that burden; and therefore the expression
is frequent of bearing iniquities;<note n="a" place="margin">cap. 2. 24.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> says it of Christ, <hi>He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
bears our sins,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> said it before him <hi>c. 53. 11.
For he shall bear their iniquities</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, bear them as a great burden,
as the word expresses, and as event did more express, a burden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
which made the Son of God to sweat bloud, and roar, and
sink, and die. 'Tis true there are of those that do delight in life,
onely because it is the opportunity of sin, it hath no more pleasure
in it than is spent in vanity or iniquity, without that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> life would be a burden, they would labor under it; all their
other time is wearisom and perisheth, and notwithstanding in our
Saviors character they are the onely drudges, yet in their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
they are the onely light hearted creatures, the onely persons
whose life is but various ease and diversified pleasure. Yea and
the onely great prejudice they have against Religion is, it makes
men heavy, sad, and melancholly, hangs plummets upon the soul,
plucks down the thoughts and countenance, and does that which
no burden can effect in them; whom weights do but exalt, elevate,
and in their own expression a load of sin and drink, that sinks their
bodies to the earth, doth but heighten imagination and delight.
Alas these men do no more discern the true labor of their own sins,
than they do the ease and the refreshments of the pious souls. They
see his fasts and abstinences, but they discern not how he feeds upon
<note n="b" place="margin">Psalm 63. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>marrow and fatness,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> saith, and finds all the words of their
luxury in his religious performances, how he <hi>tasts of the heavenly
gift, and of the powers of the world to come,</hi> Heb. 6. 4, 5. how he hath
the antepasts of blessedness. These men do not consider that the
pious mans weights are as the other bucket, which the heavier it is
the faster it lifts that up that is against it: a burden theirs like that
of wings, that does but poise their flight and help them up to
Heaven, whereas their own lightness shall sink them into the deep
of that pit that hath no bottom. 'Tis true indeed those very sins,
that make our Savior stile the man a laborer, are in other places
called <hi>sleep,</hi> as if they had the ease of rest, as if to him that were
wearied with duties of calling or devotion, to take vicissitudes of
sinning would be a soft refreshment and a pleasant reward, as if a
little return of iniquity would restore him, as sleep doth the weary
laborer. And how shall we reconcile these expressions? Shall we
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40114:73"/>
attribute them to the unhappy contradictions of this thing sin,
which is at once ease and pressure, sleep and yet heavy labour? or
rather shall we gather hence the extremely toilsom condition of the
sinner, whose very rest is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and whose refreshments tire, and
are most wearisom? where shall he look for ease, whose ease is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
and anxiety. Tho his life be all sleep, yet he is all that while
one of the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> here in the Text. And so those very wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
which are here called heavy burden, are in other places
called our own body, our selves. And what shall lighten him whose
very self is weight? What shall disburden him who is his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
pressure? Wretched men that we are, who shall deliver us
from these burdens of our selves? Burdens indeed with which the
expressions seem to labor as well as the sinner, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> We have
not words for them, the mineries, the Gallies, the Mill, or dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
are words of ease to the service of sin. No such slavery in the
world as his that is bound to serve his lusts and passions; he must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
thro all black designs and blacker hazards to attend am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
or to wreak ones malice or some hasty choler; adventure
upon rotteness, embrace a Purgatory but to please an itch; must
be the Martyr of his lust, run upon quarrels, qualms, head-ach,
hazard, desperate misfortunes to quench not thirst, but a little
custom. If you would see the labor that is in sin, behold your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
in the Garden; it made the Son of God to sweat like clots of
bloud, it squeez'd that very person who was <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, it made him faint,
not able to stand under that tree on which he was to bear the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
At such hard rates man buyeth damnation, as if he envied
himself ease in Ruin; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> he doth extremely labor, till he faint,
to get to Hell. Have you read in Scripture the pains and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
of a man possest by a Devil, how it speaks of such a one
that was intolerably vext and tormented, how the spirit rent and
tore him, &amp; often cast him into the agonies of death, &amp; from it did
revive him still onely to throw him back again into them? It were
no hard matter to shew that the Scripture does express every gross
Sinner to be one of these Demoniacs, to be possessed and inhabited
by a Devil, <hi>Matth. 12. 43, 44. When the unclean spirit is gon out of a
man, he Walketh thro dry places; then he saith, I will return to my
house from whence I came out, and he enters in and dwells there.</hi> And
what doth all this mean, but describe a person that after seeming
amendment returns back again to his courses of sin? Of such a one
the Devil saith, <hi>I will return.</hi> A wicked person is the Devil's house,
Sathan dwells there, and is not his house Hell? And then are not
all the miseries of <hi>Tophet,</hi> the torments of the vale of <hi>Hinnom</hi> in a
Sinner? Yea experience is fair enough for this, that the habitual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wicked person is a Demoniac. Look upon the wrathful angry
furious man, and you would think the man possest were but his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture:
his passion swels and tears him, he stares and foams, he cries
out and is not so innocent as to say,<note n="c" place="margin">Mark 5. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>what have I to do with thee,
Jesus, thou Son of God;</hi> for he hath to do with him in blaspheming
him with oaths and execrations, and his spirit rends not himself
onely, but the wounds of that Holy one of God, and if his passion
could speak plain, it would surely say his name also were <hi>Legion.</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:40114:74"/>
The debaucht Drunkards they have the Epilepsies, the falling sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
the dead Apoplexies of men possest, and there the Devil is
again enter'd into swine. The lustful person may find also a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of uncleaness, and an unclean Devil in the Gospel. And thus
our sins do treat us. And who then but wretched man would buy
damnation at so hard rates? who would <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, extremely labor,
tire himself till he faint to get to hell? as if he envied himself ease
because he is to go down the hill thither, that he may think he has
an easy descent, <hi>facilis descensus;</hi> he will therefore load himself
with a most heavy burden to make his passage the more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som.
Of what a profligated choice are we, that refuse Heaven
with ease, and chuse Hell, tho we must labor hard to get it.</p>
                  <p>Or secondly, letting the <hi>heavy laden</hi> stand as they do, in the
sense we have now given, we cannot excuse the Sinner from that
expression there <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; those that labor may signify such as groan
under the sense of that burden, such as labor to rid themselves of
that weight, that pant and blow after a liberty and ease from that
heavy pressure, under which they find themselves sinking into the
horror of that deep, the very imaginations of which doth cause
faintings of soul in them and Apoplexies of fear; that tire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to find out any way to escape from that eternal weight of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that is prepared for them below, and the weight of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and vengeance that hangs over them above, and from that
heavy burden, themselves, that sinks faster than either of the other,
outvying God's threats with multiplied accumulated iniquities.
The sweats of soul under the sense of the burden of sin, the labors
of mortifying the flesh and crucifying the affections, of putting the
body of sin to death, will justify this sense. The new Birth also
hath its pangs, and the Child of God, as he is not engendred by
weak purposes, faint resolutions, so neither is he brought forth in
a sigh or wish of mercy, there is a labor in it. In this expression
you may see the nature of repentance, the dawnings and first flashes
of that Catholic Duty; 'tis not that easy thing to change my mind
onely, and begin to believe. That that is not the best course I
have hitherto trod in, the way of Sinners not the safest and most
pleasant path, tho few of us will believe that: neither is it that easy
wish, I would I had not don this act; for when the pleasure's gon and
dead, the memory of it is so unsatisfying, if not loathsom, that a
man can hardly not wish it. Nor yet is it that easy desire of mercy,
that saying<note n="d" place="margin">Matt. 7. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord, Lord.</hi> The Penitent they are the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>; here
they are such as even faint under a sense of the horror of their sins,
whose hearts are broken and wounded with that heavy galling
weight of them. If I should gather up the racks and tortures, the
<hi>Occultum quatiente animo tortore flagellum,</hi> that self whip in the dark
rooms and recesses of our thoughts, conscience dealing with us by
the discipline of mad men, as knowing the sinner is not onely <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>

                     </gap> mad-man, the <hi>tacita sudant praecordia culpa,</hi> which
a Heathen can reckon up to us. And add to these the Scripture
expressions, the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the pains of travel, the labor of a woman
in child-birth, the agony of the Cross, and the pangs of death; the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40114:74"/>
word repentance would bear them all, and they would let us see
that the Penitent is truly one that labors under a very heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and so is invited here by our Savior, <hi>Come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly those that <hi>labor and are heavy laden</hi> may signify such as
groan under a burden of afflictions, and look upon them not as
chastisements onely but inflictions, and are even wearied and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
by them. Thus those judgments which God did by his
Prophets threaten to the Nations, are in those Prophets called the
burden of those Nations; and the cross and calamities are often
called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the <hi>labor</hi> in the Text 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. and generally all
the troubles and difficulties of this life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. of which death
is there made the rescue. And I need make no application of this
interpretation, the words <hi>labor and heavy laden</hi> do in these daies
sufficiently apply themselves; I shall onely tell you, that the whole
sense of those words sum'd up make thus much, Those that are
heavy burdened with sins, and the punishment of those sins, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and groan under the sense of both of them, laboring ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
to be rid and be delivered from both, these are bid to come
to Christ, which is the invitation, and what it means I am secondly
to shew.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Come unto me.</hi> And first in general the word used <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Come</hi> is not
onely a word of exhortation, but of great encouragement also in
the doing, so often used,<note n="e" place="margin">Matt. 21. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>Come and let us kill him, and then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
shall be ours;</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note n="f" place="margin">Cap. 22. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Come ye unto the wedding.</hi>
And indeed such is needful to the persons here spoken to, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring,
heavy laden: for them to take a journey, if there be not
the encouragement of some great advantage, it will not sound
like an invitation, but an infliction; and therefore our Savior be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the <hi>rest</hi> he promises, used animating words even in the very
call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Therefore the whole invitation <hi>come unto me,</hi> tho it be
used in the Gospel, and may very well signify come to me as to
a Teacher and Instructer, so <hi>Nicodemus</hi> is said to come to Christ,
and they are said to come to the light as that which was to reveal;
yea and that place in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 55. 3. whither our Savior do's much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect,
when he useth this expression, seems to import but so, <hi>Encline
your ear and come unto me, hear</hi> &amp;c. yea and may so signify in this
place, the words going before being <hi>all things are given me of my
father, and no man knoweth the father, but the son, and he to whom
the son will reveal him,</hi> it then follows <hi>come to me;</hi> as if he should
say, therefore if you desire to be instructed in the way to life <hi>come to
me,</hi> and tho you do labor under the load of many sins, yet I will
shew you a way how you shall find ease and rest, and that way fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
in the next verse, <hi>take my yoke upon you and learn of me,</hi> and ye
shall be sure to find rest: this is very natural, yet because to give
you rest is more than to shew you a way to it, and so may seem a
promise and a reward very apportioned to the duty, <hi>rest</hi> to <hi>coming;</hi>
therefore it is most probable that <hi>come</hi> doth not onely signify come
to me to learn your duty, but that the <hi>come</hi> should be it self a duty,
and so I shall consider it: and the expression <hi>come to me</hi> does in the
Gospel signify a twofold duty.</p>
                  <p>1. It signifies to obey and serve. Thus very often most expresly
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40114:75"/>
in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to come to God is to serve and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him <hi>c. 11. 6. For he that cometh to God must believe that God is, and
that he is a rewarder of them that seek him:</hi> and <hi>c. 7. 25. He is able
to save them that come to God by him,</hi> that serve God as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
and enableth: <hi>c. 10. 1. The sacrifices which they offered
year by year could not make the comers thereunto perfect,</hi> could not
perfectly cleanse them that served God by them, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and
the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verse there <hi>Let us come with a true heart,</hi> worship him with
unfeigned piety and obedience. And the sense will be fully clear
from the expressions that relate to it, <hi>Seek the Lord, draw near to
him,</hi> and then <hi>come to him.</hi> To <hi>seek him</hi> is to enter upon such a
course of life by which his favor is to be obtain'd, and what it is you
will see <hi>Isaiah</hi> 55. where when he had bid them come to him, that
they may do that he bids them, seek him <hi>v. 6, 7. Seek the Lord while
he may be found: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous
man his thoughts, and let them return unto the Lord.</hi> Deut. 4. 29, 30.
<hi>But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him,
if thou seek him with all thine heart and with all thy soul, if thou turn to
the Lord thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voyce.</hi> Nor indeed
can we seek God in any other path. The broad way, that goes
down the hill, can never land us in God's Habitation, Heaven;
and while we do go on in them it is not possible we should <hi>draw
near to God,</hi> the second, which is but to go on in the same paths.
And this expression is our own experience, it being the custom of
those that are averse to one another to avoid the sight one of the
other, but those that are friendly to seek each other, and delight
in drawing near and in society. Thirdly then <hi>to come to him</hi> must
needs be to proceed in those very ways wherein we sought him, till
we are in his favor, and to walk with him is accordingly to please
him: for so the LXX. renders <hi>Enoch</hi>'s<note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 5. 24.</note> walking with God, and
the Author of the <hi>Hebrews c. 11. v.</hi> 5. expresses that testimony which
the Scripture gives of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that <hi>he walked with God,</hi> and which the
Chaldee words <hi>he walkt in the fear of God,</hi> thus, <hi>he received the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
that he pleased God;</hi> and that very walking is the same word
with this coming <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and here also made the same; for <hi>v.</hi> 6.
of that chapter <hi>Without faith it is impossible to please him, for he that
cometh must believe,</hi> that is certainly; for he that pleaseth him must
believe, or else it doth not prove. <hi>To walk with God</hi> therefore in his
Laws, in his fear, and in his favor it is but the progress and the life
of this very thing, we are here exhorted to come unto him.</p>
                  <p>Now if this be to come to God, and coming to him be the end of
duty, thither we drive in our whole Pilgrimage of life and piety,
to arrive at our Countrey, to come to our Fathers house, to walk
with God, to enjoy his society is the very business and delight of
Heaven. Why then this duty of conversion and obedience, this
piety of life seems like its own reward, crowns it self. This coming
is like that they say of the moving of the Heavens, which being in
its own place, tho it be still in motion, is still <hi>in termino,</hi> every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of agitation is its own rest, and they have a most perfect acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escency
in that their turbination. And if to lead a good life be to
walk with God, it is to be in heaven here; and piety is a translation
upon earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:40114:75"/>
But secondly there is yet another sense of the invitation <hi>Come unto
me,</hi> and in that sense it is very often used by our Savior, even of
believing in him <hi>John 6. 35. I am the bread of life: he that cometh to
me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</hi>
Where <hi>he that cometh shall never hunger</hi> is he that eateth this bread
that giveth life, and <hi>he that believeth shall never thirst</hi> is he that
drin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eth, to let us see that eating him and drinking him, coming
to him and believing on him are all the same. So in <hi>v.</hi> 40. and 44.
<hi>This is the will of him that sent me, that every one that seeth the Son,
and believeth on him, should have everlasting life, and I will raise him
up at the last day. No man can come to me, except the Father which
hath sent me draw him.</hi> So <hi>c. 7. 37, 38. If any man thirst, let him come
unto me and drink: He that believes on me, out of his belly shall flow ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of living water.</hi> So that to come to Christ is to believe in him,
yet so as to obey him, and to frame our lives according to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
and example. For to come to him doth comprehend the
duty; we come to him to do, as also to believe in him must be to
do that which we cannot but believe he requires. This is clear
out of the forecited place, <hi>I am the bread of life, he that cometh to me
shall never hunger.</hi> It is not coming to the bread that satisfies, for
then would <hi>Tantalus</hi> no longer hunger or be thirsty, his hell would
be his meal; but doing that which people that hunger and come to
bread cannot but be suppos'd to do, even to eat. Why the same is
to believe; for if coming to him and believing on him be the same,
and coming to him signify not onely that, but doing that which
they that come cannot but be supposed to come to do, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
must be besides believing the doing that also which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but believe they ought to do. So that <hi>come to me</hi> here is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, devote your selves to my obedience, and trust, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
your selves on me.</p>
                  <p>And if this be to come to him, belief then is no longer expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but enjoiment; 'tis <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the highest sense, the giving us
the very substance of those things which we believe we shall receive:
it seems more than the evidence of things not seen, even the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
at them and vision of them. 'Tis, saith the Wise Man, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>the beginning of our cleaving to him,</hi> of our being glued and
fixed upon him, <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> 25. 12. And by faith we may both
<hi>tast and see how gracious the Lord is,</hi> how <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the word following
here, how sweet, how pleasant he is even to the eye and palate. If
to believe be to arrive to eat and drink, Faith is now all sense, as
verily as Christ is all enjoiment, all satisfaction, and happiness.</p>
                  <p>And to this happines <hi>they that labor and are heavy laden</hi> are the
onely persons that are called; which is the third thing, to shew how
this laboring and heavy lading come to be the qualification for
this Invitation, how it come to pass that they that are such, are
the onely fit ones to come to Christ.</p>
                  <p>And first, in the first sense as all those words do but signify the
grievous Sinner. These sins may in one sense given by Christ
be a qualification to this coming, because<note n="h" place="margin">Matt. 9. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>the whole need not the
Physitian, but those that are sick.</hi> Do not wounds require, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify
for a Chirurgeon? The corrupt habitual Sinner is full of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40114:76"/>
                     <hi>wounds, and swellings, and putrified sores.</hi> Does not weariness and
burdens dispose a man for ease and rest? The Sinner he is the
tired laden man, he therefore hath the most need of this Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which makes our Savior say, I came<note n="i" place="margin">Luke 5. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>to call Sinners;</hi> which
is no more than saying, I came to say <hi>Come unto me all ye that labor
and are heavy laden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence we learn the all-abundant kindness of our mercifull
Savior: he needs no other motive for his helping of us, but our want
of help: thou dost fulfill his own direction, when thou<note n="k" place="margin">Cap. 14. 13.</note> makest a
feast, invite not the rich, but the poor and needy. So here he
makes the onely cause of his invitation of us Sinners, our necessity.
Except he do invite us, we are miserable, must sink under a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
burden, and therefore he will call us to give us rest. <hi>David</hi>
was well acquainted with this Attribute, and therefore praies, <hi>Help
me, O Lord, for I am weak.</hi> Our want is argument enough to those
bowels, whose business is to extend and diffuse themselves. Yea the
Gospel expresses in that manner also; the Ruler there saith<note n="l" place="margin">Matt. 9. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>My

lay thy hands on her,</hi> as if our wants were nothing else but his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities.
Yea Christ himself hath taught us ground for this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
in the very Praier he hath taught us, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Give
us our bread:</hi> if it be ours, what need we go to beg and pray for it?
Why our bread? Why certainly because we are in extreme need of
it, we cannot live without it, therefore we go to pray for it; so
that want is possession in Christ's esteem, and when we are in need
then we may go to Christ and call it ours. He observes that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
here, when he makes our sinful misery the onely motive to his
Invitation, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then secondly in the second sense of the words those that are
affected with the sense of their sins, that groan under and are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and brought low with the weight of their iniquities, that
discern them to be truly heavy loads, and to be the true cause of
faintings and languishing of Soul, these are the onely disposed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to come to Christ in both the senses of that phrase of Coming.
First as it signifies to turn from their evil ways and walk in those
paths that lead to him. For as long as men apprehend no danger
in their courses, how can we expect that they should leave them?
While they onely tast the sweets and pleasures of sin, whilest the
Devil smooths and strews their way, and makes one temtation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
another, and by the perpetuated vanity makes one sin a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement
to another; so that none can clog, but each doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create,
and one iniquity refresh him whom another hath wearied:
how is it to be lookt for, that these men should quarrel with their
pleasures, and forsake these delights and advantages of iniquity?
Nay alas we see, when iniquity is become so cruel as to punish it self,
and sin is its own Executioner, as adultery, drunkeness, covetousness
and ambition oft are so just as to severely torture them that serve
them, if notwithstanding that we see men chuse and embrace those
sins that bring their Hell with them, are of such desperate appetites
as to long for torments, how can we hope that any will forsake their
sins before they find them toilsom burdens, before they begin to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40114:76"/>
see them in their own deformed infernal shapes, to discern their
hooks and prongs, their brimstone-flames and worm with which
they will eternally torment us? They must be scar'd and mated,
before ever they will forsake those things that flow with wanton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy
and luxuriant delight; and therefore we see very few ever
begin seriously to repent before their last death-beds, when <hi>the
evil day is come,</hi> then that time is <hi>in which thou shalt say I have no
pleasure in them, when the keepers of the house shall tremble, i. e.</hi> the
hands shall shake with guilt or with infirmity, with palsey or with
fear, thou wilt then hate their gripings, the bribery that they have
bin the instruments of: how will men contemn their former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
their full riots, and their draughts that overflowed like seas,
that had their tides and refluxes, <hi>when the grinders shall cease, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are few,</hi> when the mouth is toothless, as unable to chew
as the stomach is to digest meat; <hi>and the pitcher shall be broken at
the fountain, and the wheel at the cistern,</hi> the bladder ceases to do his
office, stopt up by stranguries or leaky with diabetes: punishments
that old age, and living faster than nature design'd, bring along
with it, very proportionate to that sin, if you understand it. Or
how will they hate the foul inordinacies of unchast beds, <hi>when the
grashopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail,</hi> rupture and hernias
and ulcers shall seize the lower ventricle. But these are all expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
that belong to that last day, and made use of by the wise
Preacher, that had tried the vanity and emtiness, and the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and burden of them, to make us take up a little sooner, <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastes
12.</hi> the 6 first verses. And <hi>when those that look out of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
shall be darkened,</hi> when the curtains of thy bed and of thy
eyes shall be drawn, and that utter darkness begin to represent it
self with which our Savior paints the lower region, when Hell from
below is removed at his approach opening her mouth wide to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him, whom the vast weight of his iniquity is ready to sink into
it; O then his sin is his greatest sickness, and his horror doth more
disjoint him than death it self. O for a little life-time now to spend
in piety, which before he counted the most unpleasant impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that could be, nor could be rectified till these apprehensions,
which onely sense will work in most too late, be wrought in him,
there being no other way to make us leave and come, but by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon death in the iniquity, which certainly is there, that
having bin a murderer from the beginning. In the second sense
as to come to Christ signifies to rest and devolve our selves upon him,
this laboring is a necessary preparative, it is the sense of our misery
without him that must drive us to him: the weight of that Legal
curse that lies upon us all that must make us run to him, that was
<note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>made a curse for us.</hi> Who would either value or fly to a Savior,
that is not first convinc'd that he wants help? Can you perswade
the mad man in the feaver to betake himself to the Physician? He
thinks you have more need, that counsel him. It is the drowning
man that clings and grasps, and when he sees himself ready to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
rather than want something to catch hold of, his roming
hand do's even catch that water that do's strangle him, and he do's
grasp his own ruin. Any rest to a falling man: and we never truly
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40114:77"/>
and seriously can depend upon Christ, till we thus apprehend our
selves sinking, and find our selves tired and fainting under the load
of our iniquities.</p>
                  <p>No nor secondly on Christ's part, will he receive any that are not
thus qualified. For will he, think you, forgive the sins of those
that do as yet love those sins? or will he strive to ease them of their
iniquities, that find no burden in them, but rather that of a full
pleasure? No surely he will not envy them so much their delights,
but let them enjoy their beloved ruin. Is it fit Christ should invite
those men who do yet cherish those sins that slew him, or that he
should receive into his bosom those iniquities that put him to
death? No certainly, till we can hate those sins which he could
die for, and till we find weight in those iniquities which he found
death from, till we labor under that which he sunk under, we have
no regard of his mercies to us, but renounce all relation to him,
and close with his mortal enimy, and cannot then hope to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by him. And thus you have the reason why these
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> are the onely fit persons to be invited by him, because till
we are so, we cannot truly come unto him, depend upon him; and
till we are so, we are not fit to be received by him.</p>
                  <p>And now for application. But what? cannot we truly come
til we find our selves to be <hi>heavy laden,</hi> till we <hi>labor</hi> and are tired
and wearied with iniquity? We see the perverse conditions of
man, whom nothing but misery can perswade to Heaven; Heaven
is no bait, tho it prostitute all its glories; Happiness is a word that
hath no musick in it; the pleasures with which God entertained
himself from all eternity, have no temtation in them compared to
those of sin: <hi>Come unto me</hi> is not an invitation till we labor; till we
find our selves perishing in our choice, ruined in those sins we have
embraced, we never will uncling, nor come to Christ: we must
have our happiness inflicted on us and be goaded into bliss. But then</p>
                  <p>2. Learn hence how willing Christ is to have us come to him,
when he makes use of Hell, not to punish onely them that will not
come, but to drive us to come to him. Had it not bin enough for
him to set before us life and death, and bid us take our choice?
No, he knows our blind and unadvised appetites would chuse the
guilt poison, the painted, the pleasant death, and make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with Hell; and therefore he lets us feel part of that Hell to
fright us, and yet then receives us. To force us to love ease he lets
us travel under the burdens of our own desiring, and yet after that
invites us to rest: he do's not onely accept them whose choice he is
not but refuge, when as he might reject us. You would none of
me, but chose weight, load, and labor; go and look for ease
thence. But alas! if I should bid you seek refreshment from your
pleasant sins, what comfort would you find, when you are tired
with those sins, and the pleasures of them do forsake you, and leave
you nothing but the stings and horror of the after expectations?
No no, come to me yet, I will receive you after all your refusals;
and tho you come to me but as to a last hold having nothing else to
trust to, tho you have already tri'd all other, and slighted me, you
shall yet be welcome: my pierced side is yet open to receive all of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40114:77"/>
you that will yet come, and let you into my very heart; my arms
are yet as wide as on the Cross, at their full length to take you into
their embraces. Ah my Brethren, Christ doth not send us back to
our beloved miseries when we come to him, but he makes those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
a part of his Rhetoric to invite us, uses our labour and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to perswade us to come, makes those burdens the indearment
of, and provocation to his ease, and Hell it self a part of his wooing.
And how will he receive and embrace us, who doth thus desire and
court us? The story of the Prodigal is hugely evictive of this, and
so indulgent, that it would almost invite a man to sin; but then it
do's far more invite a man, that will repent him of his sin, to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
of God's acceptance. He that had so villanously betraied his
Father's dearness to his own beastliness and ruin, to whom all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
would seem lost, and to receive him in again and to assist him
would be but to encourage him, and to furnish him for a return
back to the prodigalities of sin and to the former riots of iniquity;
yet when he do's repent, he do's obtain far more than he desires:
he is received to feast and bosom, is entertain'd much more than
the first born, and had he never gon away he had not bin so dear.
Do but consult the story <hi>Luke</hi> 15. When weary and fainting under
the burden of himself, which his languishing spirits were scarce
able to sustain, he came at last to himself, <hi>v.</hi> 17. and began to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that he chose to stay with husks, with famine, rather than to
go to daily plenty, and chose to dwell in the unclean, uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
company of swine before his Father's houshold, and then
strait to think of leaving that condition and society, and to resolve
on a return. When he began to put those resolutions into act, and
his impotent starv'd limbs would scarce serve his desires, at least he
was unable to make hast in the pursuit of his intentions, for he was
yet a great way off <hi>v.</hi> 20. yet then his Father had compassion, and
ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. His compassions did not
keep state, or stand expecting till his ungracious son should come
and humble himself, and deprecate and beg; but he ran to meet
him, and made far greater hast to receive and entertain, than the
other could do to be received; and as if the humiliations or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
had bin on his side, he fell, at least the impotencies of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
did vie with those of the others condition, for he fell on his
neck and kissed him. And whereas his repenting son did resolve
to become prostrate, and low in condition as well as posture, <hi>I will
go to my Father, and say unto him, Father, I have sinned before heaven
and against thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son, make me
as one of thy hired servants</hi> v. 18, 19. I dare not hope for favor from
any tie of nature which I have broken all; I do not beg thy kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as the issue of thy Relation, but as the wages of my labor; I
will serve for thy affections, and let me have it as the hire of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and endeavors: but 'twas enough it seems to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
thus lowly in earnest; for when he comes to act it <hi>v.</hi> 21. as
he had said <hi>I am unworthy to be called thy son,</hi> his Father cuts him off,
and calls for the best Robe, and for a Ring, and for the fatted
Calf, will not let him so much as beg to be a servant, but if he once
acknowledge himself unworthy for a son, he puts him strait in such
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40114:78"/>
an equipage as he may owne him in with credit, in the best Robe;
and he rejoyces, quickens and sets out his joy with Feasts and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sic.
Now saith <hi>Tertullian, Quis ille nobis intelligendus Pater?</hi> What
Father is this in the story? Why certainly 'tis God. No one so
much a Father, no one so compassionate, if the Sinner once come
to himself, as the prodigal son is said to do; for while he do's go
on he is indeed beside himself and in a fit: and when he has col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
sober thoughts about him, and do's compare his wanting
husks with the full plenties of his Fathers house, the unsatisfying
transient delights of sin, that have filthy toil and noisom drudgery
in the gaining, and instantly when they are gain'd put out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
are gon, and leave nothing but snuff or stink behind, offence
onely and trouble of mind; compar'd those with the gladsom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
of blessedness, with the comforts that are in all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of Christ, and the feasts of our Fathers mansion, Gods enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,
the glories he hath studied for those that love him, and
being satisfied these are the better pleasure, resolves to leave the
swine, his unclean beastly courses, and betake himself to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he shall then find this fiction experience, and God outdoing
all the Parables of himself. He will run to meet him that do's but
set himself to come in earnest, not onely, as the proposition saies,
accept his service, but prevent it; and however miserable, poor,
and naked he do meet him, as the Sinner is <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. he calls for
the best Robe, even the Robe of Christ's Righteousness to put upon
him, and puts a Ring upon his finger, he does espouse him to his
Son, he kills the fatted calf, makes ready the supper of the Lamb
for him, and it is the poor repenting Sinner's wedding supper with
his Savior. It is a chapter full of comfort to the Penitent, and
hath a greater advance for it than this story <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. The Sinner he
hath straied into by-paths, gon away from the Shepherd of his soul,
is a lost sheep; but yet when he is gon his farthest, and is in his
mazes, knows not which way to betake himself, then this good
Shepherd do's not invite onely to a return, or as the Father in the
Parable run to meet him in his coming back, but he do's go him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to seek him, seems to mind the recovery of each single one that
is lost, and contributes as carefully to his return, as if that one were
all his charge, and the whole flock is not dearer to him than that
one. He leaves the ninety and nine to seek that one, and he seeks
till he finds it, and when he finds it he laies it on his shoulders. The
wandring sheep was wearied it seems with straying, and had tir'd it
self with running from its shepherd; but this too is provided for,
he could not come home, therefore he is carried. It is not now,
<hi>Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden,</hi> I will not refuse
you. Nay when you are so lost in Labyrinths of guilt out of which
you can see no issue, when you have so labor'd in the paths of error
that you are not able to come home, if you will but be found, I
will seek you, yea and carry you home too. That no one, how far
soever he have gon away, may yet despair of coming home, this
sheep had wander'd to such a distance and to so much weariness,
that he was fain to be born back when he was found. And he laies
it on his shoulders rejoycing, was glad of such a burden. How
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40114:78"/>
willing is our Savior to find out a straied Sinner, when after such
long errors he do's seek him till he finds him, and carries him, if he
be weak and fainting; yea and rejoyces in that carriage, as if that
rest he gives the Sinner were such ease and refreshment to himself,
he joys in it! And that joy spreads it self to Heaven, for there is joy
in Heaven at that sight, and <hi>v. 10. There is joy in the presence of the
Angels of God over one sinner that repents. Heus tu peccator, bono ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
sis, vides ubi de tuo reditu gaudeatur:</hi> Thou poor disconsolate
Sinner, that liest groveling under the sense of the burden of thy
sins, thy soul sinking under that heavy weight, and sinking also
in the waters of thy fears, drown'd in thy sorrow, be of good chear.
Dost thou not think there is some joy in this estate of thine, when
it can make a joy in Heaven? Those tears assure thy self have
comfort in them; for God, and Christ, and all the Angels do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
at sight of them. And do not dread thy burden, if thou dost
truly labor under it, and dost but faithfully desire and endeavor to
throw it off thee. Dost thou not see him that laid the lost sheep on
his shoulders as ready to take thee up? He that would not reject
thy Cross when it was loaden with thy guilt, will not reject thy self
when thou art lighted from that guilt. He that would receive thee
on his shoulders when thou wast fainting under the burden of thy
sins, when that is cast away into the sea and buried in his grave,
will certainly receive thee into his bosom. He that would carry
thee to give thee ease when thou wert wearied with running from
him, when thou dost come to him and faint into his arms, will give
thee everlasting rest; a rest whose blessedness to understand were to
enjoy it, and to be able to conceive were to be infinite as it self is;
a blessedness which to behold is beatific. O cast away your burdens
and <hi>make hast, and come and see.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly learn hence the method you are to take in coming to him,
how you are to begin your journey. The first advance is by this
conviction of the burden and horror of sin, till this be in us we will
never move a step towards him. The Church hath taught us, when
she invites us to come to him in Sacrament, to make the first step
this confession, <hi>We be heartily sorry for these our transgressions, the
remembrance of them is grievous unto us, the burden of them is intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
And Christ hath told us here, that we must find the very
same things in our selves, an intolerable burden that tires and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
us until we faint, before we come to him; we are otherwise no
part of his invitation, will be no part of his retinue. And then
whosoever thou art that art so far from finding them intolerable,
that without them thy life is hardly tolerable, so far from burden,
that thy very days are burdensom that are restrain'd from conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
of sin, that dost account them thy delight, not weariness,
and art refresht, not tir'd with them, and canst not think of parting
with them: or if no very vicious company or custom hath brought
thee to this necessity and height of sinning, yet thou look'st upon
them as slight regardless things, mistakes and oversights that slip
from thee, all whose repentance is but <hi>Lord have mercy,</hi> and never
thinkest more of it, dost not apprehend that every such gross fault
hath an eternal weight in it, and dost not humble thy self under
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40114:79"/>
that weight; bethink thy self whether thou art yet in the way to
Christ, or whether thou indeed be called to come. Oh no, the
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> are the men; for thou especially that takest pleasure in
them, dost thou think Christ will call thee to do worse with him
than the damned do in Hell? There they indeed nourish their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
appetites, their lusts advance, but their lusts are their plague
and torment them, and they extremely hate and curse those things
which they do passionately desire. Now that habitual Sinner his
sins they are his emploiment, his delight too, he longs as those
other, but he satisfies also and finds pleasure in them: and then, if
those others be fit company for the Devils onely, canst thou believe
thy self fit company for Christ, that he should bid thee come to
him? No, begin to act thy Hell a little sooner, account them
here thy torments, hate them in time, perceive them to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
while they may be laid down, and then come unto Christ,
<hi>and he will give thee rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And evermore, O Lord, give us of thy rest, a rest from sin here,
and a rest from misery eternally. Yea, O Lord, give us to labor,
and to find trouble under that intolerable burden of our guilt, that
we may with eager hast fly to the refreshment, that we perverse ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate
Sinners, whom thy mercies cannot invite, our own miseries
may force to be happy: and tho our wickednesses are multiplied
into an infinite mass and weight, yet despise us not, when we fall
under them; for thou didst invite us to come, and bring all that
load to thee: despise us not, tho heavy laden; for thou thy self
didst bear this weight, and didst die under it. And O thou, who
didst thy self thus suffer by reason of this load, pity us that labor
with it, ease us of the burden of our former guilt, free us from the
slavery of our iniquity, from bearing any longer Sathan's loads;
then shall we at last sit down with thee in the Land of everlasting
rest, deliver'd from all weights but that eternal weight of glory,
and resting from all labors save that of praising thee, and ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
all Honor, Power, Praise, Might, Majesty, and Dominion to

Enimies, and the verse before names
them, and the Text shews us the means that they

                  <p>1. The Enimies here mention'd, and we may
account them three, if that which gives both aid and strength to,
fortifies our Enimy, be so; as sure it is. 1. Here is Death, which
sin arms with a sting and do's envenome it. 2. Sin it self, empower'd
and strengthned by the Law. 3. That Law also.</p>

                  <p>First I am to speak of the first preparations that are made against
us in behalf of our Enimies; and that is to shew you, that the Law

                     <hi>Cursed is he that continueth not in all things
which are written in the book of the Law to do them.</hi> And to this the
whole man is oblig'd, the soul as well as body: <hi>&amp; caro &amp; spiritus Dei
res est,</hi> saith <hi>Tertull.</hi> God made the soul as well as body, one's his
creature as much as the other, and the one hath as much reason then
to pay him honor and obedience as the other: if indeed the spirit
hath not much more to obey him in its own motions and actings,
than in those of the body, which are onely under it, and guided by
it. So that thoughts are criminal against this Law, as well as doings;
by them the Soul fulfils its part of the transgression, more it may
be than its own share, while it robs the Flesh, seizes its satisfactions,
and makes them her own against her nature. And indeed what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
part the Law is broken and transgrest by, 'tis transgression and
sin still, whether by the mind, for lust when it hath conceived
onely, sin is then begotten <hi>James</hi> 1. 15. or by the tongue, for <hi>of
every idle word we must give an account at the day of Judgment,
Matth.</hi> 12. 36. and <hi>by thy words thou shalt be condemn'd.</hi> Or lastly
by the works. So that according to the Tenor of this strict and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Law whatever we can do, or indeed whatever we do not is
Sin: besides commissions that are sinful there is still defect, and
so transgression in our thoughts, our words, and deeds even in the
best; and in not doing also there's omission, and so failing. But
besides this severe obligation of the Law to duty, upon this our
faileur there is a severer obligation</p>
                  <p>2. To punishment; for every sin is cursed, as we saw. Upon this
account <hi>the Law,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul, worketh wrath, Rom.</hi> 4. 15. we are
<hi>children of wrath, Eph.</hi> 2. 3. whose inheritance is destruction, and
who are of right to possess onely the sad issues of God's indignation:
for to this the Law condemns us all, by reason of our Sins; and upon
that account <hi>the Law</hi> is said to be <hi>the strength of Sin.</hi> Because by
force and vertue of this threatning of the Law, we that have sinned
are therefore liable and obnoxious to the condemnation of it. And
this I take to be the meaning of that place <hi>Rom. 7. 7, 8, 9, 10. I had
not known sin, but by the law; for I had not known concupiscence, except
the law had said thou shalt not covet. But sin taking occasion by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
wrought in me all manner of concupiscence: for without the
law sin was dead,—but when the commandment came, sin revived and I
died, and the commandment which was ordain'd to life, I found to be
unto death.</hi> The Apostle's drift here is not to evince how the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
begets sin, but how it makes sin condemning, begets
death: and therefore I believe they are mistaken who expound, <hi>sin
taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence,</hi>
as if it meant the Law onely prohibiting, but not quelling
sin in me; the more it was restrain'd, the more it wrought all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of concupiscence in me, especially since there was no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
assign'd to that sin in the Law; it took advantage thence more
powerfully to engage me in the pursuit of all my lusts, since thence
I might have hop't without any fear of punishment to pursue
them. For this seems perfectly to thwart his aim, which was
to shew us how the Law wrought condemnation, and inflicted death
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40114:80"/>
by threatning it. It seems to mean, I had not onely not known
sin to be so dangerous, but I had not known some things to be sins,
and by consequence condemning things, but by the Law: parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
I had not known concupiscence to be so, had not the Law
said <hi>thou shalt not covet.</hi> The next words do not seem intended to
declare how the Commandment work sin, that being brought in
by the by, as it were thus, but sin the corruption of my nature
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> had wrought in me all manner of concupiscence, all
actual lusts and wickednesses <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> got advantage over me or
strength against me by the Law: which he there proves, for <hi>without
the law sin is dead;</hi> not as to stirring in us by its sinful motions sure,
corruption would not fail to do that and more if there were no
check; but dead, had no strength nor power to condemn me. For
it follows, <hi>when the commandment came, sin reviv'd,</hi> got strength to
do that, <hi>and I died,</hi> was sentenc'd to death by it, <hi>and the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was ordain'd to life</hi> could I have obey'd it, <hi>I found to be
unto death</hi> by condemning me to death for my transgression of it.
For sin by the Commandment <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> getting advantage over
me slew me; not onely made me liable to death, but by its guilt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venoming
that death: for <hi>the sting of death is sin,</hi> which that it is,
and how it is so, is the second thing I am to speak to.</p>
                  <p>Sin is the <hi>sting of death,</hi> which I could make appear two manner
of ways in relation to two senses that may be given to the words,
both pertinent, and the one but the Anticipation of the other.
The first is this: Sin is the sting of death; 'tis Sin makes the
thoughts of death pungent and stinging; the wicked man cannot
think of his last dying day without horrors, the onely imagination
of a sickness stings him, because he is conscious to himself of sin,
and he knows that <hi>that after Death cometh the Judgment,</hi> and he
dares not think of beholding the face of his Judg with his guilt
upon him.</p>
                  <p>To prove this to you I shall not need to fetch any heathen Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
that call the Conscience of Sin a whip, a sting, a goad, a
lancing knife, things that gash and prick, and gall and fret, all
words of all kinds of terrifying punishment: but if there be any
gross customary Sinner that now hears me, I shall need no other
way of proof, but by appealing to his own conscience, whether,
when he comes hot from his iniquity, he dares entertain the thought
of dying. And why not? Alas he is too deep in arrears to venture
upon account with so impartial a Judg; books must be laid open
if he come there, the closet curtain sins, nay the bosom villanies
must be displaied, and every one receive his doom; he hath heard,
that all the<note n="b" place="margin">Luke 23. 30. Rev. 6. 16.</note> refuge of a deplored Sinner at that great and terrible
Day of the Lord is but to fly unto the Mountains to cover him, and
to the Rocks to hide him. A wretched hope; for how shall the Hills
hide him, whose iniquities are like Mountains? or how shall the rocks
cover him, whose rebellions are like <hi>the great deep,</hi> as the Scripture
words it? To such a person Death and Judgment are words of too
dangerous a sense, and it's easier for him (as many do) to resolve
there is no such thing as one of them, than to think of them, and
go merrily on in sinning. For tell me, what is the design of that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40114:81"/>
variety of iniquities in which thou dost ingulf thy self, that circle
of sins wherein one relieves and succeeds another? Sure by such a
perpetuity of diversified delights to stave off those severer thoughts,
which if there were an intermission of sinning, or a nauseating of
one sin for want of variety, would creep in, the noise of our riots is
not to please the ear, but to drown the barking of our consciences.
When the Sinner's candle is put out, if weariness in wickedness do
not at once close up his eyes and thoughts, if the dark solitary
night do but suggest some melancholly thoughts into him, how
do's he tumble up and down, as if he thought to role away from
his imagination? and he do's ransack his fancy, and call up the
memory of his past sins about him to entertain himself with all, and
keep out the torturing remembrance of that sad Day, which the
Scripture calls<note n="c" place="margin">Amos 6. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>putting far from them the evil day:</hi> for the truth is
he dares not give it place, least it should happen to him, as to a
man upon a pointed precipice, (as himself is indeed situated) to
whom the apprehension would be as mortal as the danger, and he
would tumble down for fear of falling. So here his sin adds such
sharps to the imagination of death, that he dares not entertain the
thought.</p>
                  <p>And if Sin be such a sting in the onely thought of death, that the
mere remembrance of it is insupportable, the use is very natural by
the frequent calling of death to mind to stop the current of sin.
For if the wicked cannot endure to think of death, he that does
think on it, cannot well go on to be wicked. Remember thy latter
end, and thou shalt not do amiss. I would give this counsel, Think
thou art to die while doing it. The original of the <hi>Turks</hi> Turbant,
which was but by continual wearing of his winding sheet, by wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
his head in his grave-cloaths to have always a shrowd and
death upon his thoughts; and the Philosophers defining their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to be but <hi>contemplatio mortis,</hi> are not such pregnant inforcers
of this use, as this practical apprehension of it. The man that liv'd
among the Tombs, tho he had a legion of Devils in him, yet <hi>when
he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,</hi> Mark 5. 6. The
sight of graves and conversation with monuments will make even
Demoniacks Religious, and is so far from thrusting Praiers out of
the Liturgy of Burial, that it brings the very Devils on their knees.</p>
                  <p>But there is yet another and a fuller sense of these words, which
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> repeats out of the LXX. translation of <hi>Hosea</hi> 13. 14. tho
not <hi>verbatim,</hi> for there insteed of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and signifies, <hi>O Death,
where is thy plea</hi> by which thou didst attaint men before God's Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal?
where is the right thou hadst over all men to seize and take
possession of them? what's become of the sentence that was award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee, by which all of us were adjudg'd to be thy bond-slaves?
where is that punishment which thou didst inflict upon us all, and by
it ruin us? To all these rights Sin did entitle thee, O Death; or
as it is here in the Text <hi>Sin is thy sting,</hi> whatsoever power thou hast
of hurting man, as the Scorpion's venom lies in his sting, that
power Sin hath given thee, and in that it lies: without Sin
Death were no plague, and it is this that makes Death insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:40114:81"/>
Now to prove this I need not urge more than what I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
said; for if Sin be a sting in the very thought of Death, much
more pungent will it be, when Death it self approaches: when the
Feaver shall lay hold upon the bloud, not onely to revenge the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
heats of that lustful or that riotous bloud, but to be dawnings
of those eternal Burnings which do await the Sinners, and shall do
more than represent unto thee the heats of that unquenchable
brimstone which is to be thy lot, and which already doth begin to
flash in upon thee. Which part of thee do's labor with the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
Feaver, thy Body or thy Soul? Alas the frost of the Grave
would seem to thee a Julip, a cool refreshment onely, if Sin did not
make thee look upon the grave as a downlet to that bottomless pitt,
which is the lake of fire that is not quencht. Nothing possibly can
keep an unrepentant Sinner, that on his death-bed apprehends his
guilt, from the horror of despair, from being his own Devil, and
suffering his own Hell in his own bosom upon earth. I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
this invincibly to you, that Sin do's, and nothing else
do's make Death most insupportable, when it approaches.</p>
                  <p>Now to evince this, my Argument is none other than our Blessed
Savior himself, in whose Passion the onely imputation of guilt
seems to have rais'd the greatest contradictions imaginable. If you
look upon him preparing for his Passion, it seems his onely and
most pleasing design; as he came into the world for that end, so
his whole life before it was but a Prologue to it, onely a walk to
mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> it was his extreme desire. <hi>I have a baptism to be
baptiz'd with,</hi> baptiz'd indeed with fire and his own clotted sweat of
bloud, yet this Baptism <hi>how am I streightened till, it be accomplished,
Luke</hi> 12. 50. He had longing throws after it, he did as much desire
it as a woman to be deliver'd of her burden. Nay it was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
he did lay plots that he might not escape it; for when a
glorious Miracle had broke from him, that did extort the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his Deity from Men and Devils, he charges these to hold
their peace, and bids the other tell it no man: one reason
of which was, least the knowing him to be the Son of God
should hinder him from suffering. He gives it himself <hi>Luke 9. 21, 22.
he straitly charg'd and commanded them to tell no man that thing,
saying the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected;</hi> now
should they know I were the Son of God,<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>they would not crucify the
Son of glory.</hi> You see what care he takes least he should not suffer:
and just before his passion he come in triumph to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with
songs and joy about him, as if Death were the onely pleasant thing,
and his passion so desirable, that he would go ride to meet it, which
he never did at any other time. And add to all this that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was the Son of God, to whom nothing could be truly insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable;
yet when this person comes to meet it, see how he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, <hi>his soul is exceeding sorrowfull,</hi> he fell on his face to pray
against it, and while he was in this condition an<note n="e" place="margin">Luke 22. 43, 44.</note> Angel from
Heaven came to <hi>strenthen him,</hi> yet he is still in an <hi>agony and prays
more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of bloud.</hi> Now 'twas the
sense of Sin upon him that made his bloud run out in clotts, as it
were flying from that sense; it was the apprehensions of the guilt
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40114:82"/>
imputed to him, and the wrath which he knew was due to it, did
make him apprehend his God (who was himself) was gon from
him, made him cry out,<note n="f" place="margin">Matt. 27. 46.</note> 
                     <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
me?</hi> Now to say that all this dread were from the mere apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of death, were horrid blasphemy; the meanest Martyr was never
guilty of so much weakness. No 'twas from the sense of the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that was upon it, 'twas because he was made sin for us; he was
<hi>a man of sorrows,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> because in representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he was a man of sins, for <hi>he bore our iniquities,</hi> saith the same
Prophet <hi>c. 53. The Lord had laid upon him the iniquities of us all,</hi> and
therefore <hi>he was oppressed.</hi> And so I have made appear, that Sin is
the sting of Death more than if your selves did feel it by an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
despair: for it is more that Sin should make Death terrible
to the Son of God, than that it should make it insupportable to you.
And therefore before Death seize you, and prostrate you into his
dust, this consideration may humble you into the dust and ashes of
Repentance; this I say, if Sin were a sting that made Death so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
to Christ, what will it be to us? If the apprehension
of it, when it came arm'd onely with the imputation of our guilt,
(for he himself<note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>knew no sin</hi>) was so terrible to the Son of God,
how shall we stand under it, when it brings all our own iniquities to
seize upon us? If he that was a person of the Trinity could not
bear the weight, how shall we sink under it? That which made
our Jesus in an agony, as if he meant to pour out his soul in his
sweat, and pray, and roar, and die, will certainly be to us most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
beyond sufferance. Alas! what then will be our hope?
We have certainly none, except we can by Faith and Repentance
rid our selves of this Sin, which is the sting of Death, and makes it
to be thus intolerable; which how it comes to pass I must now
shew.</p>
                  <p>2. Why, and how Sin is the sting of Death. Sin may seem very
properly to be call'd a sting of Death, for it was the Serpent that
brought Death into the World, and Sin was that by which he did
inflict it; now a sting is a Serpent's proper instrument, and a veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
sting it was, that could blast Paradise, and shed destruction
there where the Tree of life bore fruit. But that is not all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why it should be call'd the sting of Death because it makes us
obnoxious to Death, but it is that which makes Death a miserable
condition: as it is the sting of the Serpent that makes him a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous
creature, so it is that which makes Death destructive. For
were Death the expiration of that little spark in the moving of our
heart, and if our spirit utterly vanisht as the soft air, and were it as
the Atheist in the<note n="h" place="margin">Wisd. 2. 2.</note> Wise man says, <hi>we are born at all adventure, and
shall be hereafter as tho we had never bin;</hi> Death would be so far from
all sting, that it would be perfect rest, and the end of troubles:
but Sin makes it onely the beginning of sorrows, it changes the
very nature of death, by making that which seems to be the cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sensible function, to be the very original of the sensibility
of torments. Then the Sinner doth begin indeed to feel, when he
dies. Death were but the term of a miserable life, did not Sin make
it the birth of a more miserable life or death: I know not whether
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40114:82"/>
to call it; for it is of so strange a nature, that the very uniting of a
Sinner's body and soul, which is the onely thing we call life, God
calls death, <hi>Rev. 22. 13, 14. And the sea gave up the dead which were in
it, and death and hell,</hi> or the grave, <hi>deliver'd up the dead which were in
them,</hi> that is, the bodies to be joyn'd to the souls, <hi>and they were judg'd
every man according to their works,</hi> and in that case all are <hi>cast into
the lake of fire, this is the second death.</hi> Sin makes Resurrection to be
dying: and it must needs be so, because as afflictions are in this life
call'd death, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> saith<note n="i" place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>in Deaths often;</hi> so much more then
may those torments of hell be call'd death. So that in that death
that Sin engages to, it is necessary to live always, that we may for
ever die: and it must be so, because this makes us liable to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
indignation of the offended God, which we were not capable
of suffering, were it not a death of this nature. This is indeed
death with a sting in it, and it is the sense of this approaching that
wounds the dying soul; when it do's at once call to mind the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of its past life and the wrath that do's await it, when he recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
how sinful he hath bin, and withall how hateful sin is to God,
(so hateful that it was easier for God to send his Son to suffer death,
than to suffer sin to go unpunish'd) then his own expectations sting
and stab his very soul; for if God did thus use his own Son, how
will he use me, that have both sinn'd and trod under foot the death
of that Son by going on wilfully in my sins? Would you then, my
Brethren, find out a way to make death easy and familiar to you?
you must pull out this sting. The <hi>Jews</hi> say if <hi>Adam</hi> had continued
righteous he should not have died, but after a long happy life God
would have taken up his soul to him with a kiss, which they call
<hi>osculum pacis,</hi> he would have receiv'd that spirit which with his
mouth he did inspire, a kiss of taking leave here to meet in Heaven.
Wouldst thou have thy death to be the same thing? 'Tis but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
righteous with the righteousness of Christ, thro whom we
have this Victory here in the Text, the other part I am to speak to,
<hi>who giveth us the victory thro Jesus Christ our Lords</hi> where we have
those that are partakers of the Victory, and the means <hi>thro Jesus
Christ our Lord,</hi> and as to both these this I shall demonstrate over all
those enimies in order, who the <hi>us,</hi> and how the <hi>Victory</hi> is gotten.</p>
                  <p>First the Law. Now that <hi>Christ hath redeem'd us from the curse
of the Law,</hi> is said expresly, and that by his <hi>being made a curse
for us, Gal.</hi> 3. 13. and what that curse of the Law was, is set down in
the tenth verse, <hi>cursed is every one that continueth not in all things,
that are written in the book of the Law to do them;</hi> which no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Christ did ever or can do, and consequently all mankind lay
under that same dreadful curse, obnoxious to the wrath of God,
and the effects of everlasting indignation: but Christ by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
that curse and by that means satisfying that strict Law, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
an easier to be set us upon gentler terms, not perfect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinning
strict obedience, which was impossible, but instead thereof
the Law of Faith, obsequious Faith that works by love, endeavors
honestly and heartily, and where it fails repents, that is, grieves,
and amends, and perseveres in doing so. For as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> assures us,
<hi>we are not under the Law, but under Grace, Rom.</hi> 6. 14. tho we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40114:83"/>
the directions of it, the duty of it is most indispensable vertue
always; yet we are not under those strict terms of it according to
the tenor of that curse, but in a state of favor, under terms of
grace, where there is mercy, pardon to be had upon repentance
thro faith, and where there is encouragement and aid to work that
faith and that amendment in us. And thus far the Victory accrues
to all mankind; for all that will accept these terms of this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
Law of grace, the other killing strict Law hath no power
over them. For the Gospel was commanded to be preach'd to, and
its terms offer'd every creature under heaven, all mankind: a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
this, that could not be obtain'd, but by Christ's bloud; the
grace and favor of these easier terms for our obedience valued equal
with his life; for to take of this curse, <hi>cursed is every one that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
not in all things, that are written in the book of the law to do it,</hi>
these strict terms, he himself was made a curse: and 'twill be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a most unkind return, if that which he thought worth the
dying for to get us, we shall not think worth the accepting, slight
these blessed terms, and do not care unless we can be free from all
necessity of an endeavor, freed from vertue too as well as Law.</p>
                  <p>But secondly the Law being, as we have shew'd it is, the strength
of Sin in giving it a power to condemn us, that Law being taken
off, that power also cannot but be taken off from Sin, and by that
means the great strengths of that Enimy defeated. Accordingly
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> do's tell the <hi>Romans c. 6. v. 14. Sin shall not have dominion
over you,</hi> that is, it shall not have by vertue of the Law a power to
condemn you; <hi>for you are not under the Law but under grace,</hi> are in
that state where men are not condemn'd for every gross or heinous
sin altho too long continued in, but there is pardon to be had for
them that will but faithfully endeavor to amend, turn from their
sins, return to Christ, receive him and his pardon: and where there
is also help to do this, 'tis a true state of grace; so that unless men
will resolve to force their own guards that are set about them to
preserve them, and break thro the strengths of grace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
all the strivings of Almighty God's compassion and goodness
to them, and beat off the very victory that Christ hath gain'd for
them, refuse all the kind offers of the Law of grace, and chuse sin
with damnation, they are safe; <hi>There is now,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> saith, by
the Law <hi>no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, to them
who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. in
which words we have both an assurance that the strengths of Sin are
broken, and the persons too are partakers of the Victory, <hi>that are
in Christ Jesus:</hi> for as it is by him the Victory is gotten, so it is in
him that we must get an interest in it. Now <hi>to be in Christ,</hi> if, as most
certainly it doth, it mean here as in other places, where 'tis said of
Churches, housholds, and of single persons, then it means the
Christians: so in <hi>Gal. 1. 22, the Churches of Judea that are in Christ,
i. e.</hi> that have received the Gospel and the Faith of Christ; <hi>Rom.
16. 11. greet them that be of the houshold of Narcissus, that are in
the Lord, i. e.</hi> that are Christians; and the seventh verse, <hi>who were
in Christ before me, i. e.</hi> were converted e're I was. But it means
Christians not in judgment and opinion onely, but in life and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40114:83"/>
such as <hi>are in Christ</hi> by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> character and description of
it in the 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 17. If any man be in Christ he is a new creature,</hi> he
lives the life of Christ as a member does the life of that of which it is
a member, and so he <hi>walks not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
For as members live by the vertue of the influence of spirits from
the head into them and walk after its directions, so those that are
in Christ, his members, they must walk, live, act and practise by
the Spirit of Christ, guided not by carnal appetite, the lusts and the
desires of the Flesh, but by Christ's directions. Such they are who
have this Victory, <hi>to whom there is no condemnation.</hi> For as he adds
<hi>Rom. 8. 2. The law of the Spirit of life that is in Christ Jesus, sets us
free from the law of sin and death:</hi> and so there is thro him a Victory
over the third, last enimy Death: in which freedom from Sin and
Death two things are intimated.</p>
                  <p>1. That Sin the sting of Death is taken away, which being once
removed, Death is the softest thing that can be, 'tis but falling asleep;
so it is call'd <hi>v.</hi> 18. of this chapter, <hi>faln asleep in Christ:</hi> it is so far
from being hurtful, that it is the first great happiness that does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
us.</p>
                  <p>2. That Death it self also shall be swallowed up in Victory, that
we shall be recovered from its powers, and triumph over it in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of blessed life. For if we be in Christ, his members, and
so live the life of Christ; and consequently when we die, die in the
Lord: then tho the body be dead and corruptible, yet <hi>if the Spirit
of life that is in Jesus be in us, he that rais'd up Jesus from the dead shall
also quicken our mortal bodies by his Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 11. It is this life
in him that verifies the saying of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> Eph. 2. 6. <hi>He hath raised us
up, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ,</hi> as sure as if
we were already there: for there we are already as his members in
our head. And to the full and personal enjoyment of the blessings
of those heavenly places it is death that lets us in; that <hi>vale of Achor
is the door of hope</hi> and <hi>Canaan,</hi> the grave the avenue to God's right
hand: that death, 'tis but the Pascha in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Bernard,</hi> 'tis our Passover,
a repast of bitter herbs indeed, but at the going out of <hi>Egypt</hi> from
the house of bondage. And tho the body seem in death a piteous
despicable thing, <hi>sown in corruption &amp; dishonor,</hi> as<note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 42, 43.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> expresses,
yet death gives that a relation too to Christ: the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>
brings in the Lord calling His dead <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>cadaver,</hi> they <hi>my dead body
shall aris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> saith he <hi>c.</hi> 26. 19. So that the corps of a good person is
so far a member, that 'tis call'd the very body of his Savior, into
such a title Death translates it; to such not to live onely, but to
die is Christ. And sure if they that die in him, did live in him, (as
none can die there where they did not live at all) that is live as his
members, they that die in Christ must die his members. But in the
expression of the Prophet they do also die himself, and are Christ's
own dead body. Death to such is as it were transfiguration, and
do's not so much strip and make them naked, as cloath them, and
that with glory; the shrowd may seem but their white wedding lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
and their dress for the marriage of the Lamb. Whoever is a
faithfull sincere Christian, if Death seem to make approaches to
him arm'd with all his instruments of cruelty and terror, charge
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40114:84"/>
him as assuredly as a Prophet could to set his house in order, for
he must die; if he can say with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in <hi>Isaiah 38. 3. Remember
now, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect
heart and have don that which is good in thy sight,</hi> then if he have not
fifty years, yet he shall have a numberless Eternity added to his
life; and notwithstanding the dark solitude of the Grave to which
he is retiring, he shall have that which will accompany him to his
infinite joy: when he is torn from friends, and all his dearest things
do leave him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he shall not be alone, his faith and piety, his
vertues all go along with him, and appear for him at that tribunal
on the Judgment day. All his relations, even his bosom-guest, the
other half of his own soul forsake him, bring him it may be to the
grave, and tho they carry blacks upon them to refresh and keep
alive the memory of him, yet in a while take comfort and forget;
yet the true conjugal affections of an untainted, undefiled bed shall
go along, present the Soul white, as a Virgin that's unspotted.
And after this 'tis in vain to say his riches will forsake him, they go
not so far as the grave, afford nothing of themselves but the price
of a sheet and coffin. But then Charities will mount, Alms will
ascend as fast as the Spirit; the wealth one piously bestow'd will
meet him, he shall eternally possess that which he gave away, and
tho his place know him no more, they shall receive him into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
habitations.<note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 58.</note> 
                     <hi>Wherefore, my beloved Brethren, be ye sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,

these advantages of this life are the onely good things which

1. The nature of that state, and the certain satisfactions of it,
which King <hi>David</hi> did propose to, and assure himself of: <hi>to awake
up after God's likeness, and</hi> he knows <hi>he shall be satisfied with it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The sure means of arriving at this state, <hi>beholding of God's face
in righteousness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. His peremtory resolution as to the use of these means, <hi>I will
behold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. With the courage of resolution, which is taken up against
the almost universal practice and the as great contradiction of the
World, that generally minds far different satisfactions, I declare
publickly and confess, <hi>But as for me, I will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The nature and the certain satisfactions of that state, which
holy <hi>David</hi> in the Spirit did propose to, and assure himself of. The
state the Psalmist do's suppose expresly here: a state to which he shall
awake out of the sleep of death. For however some expound his
words another way; yet from his opposition of himself as to his own
expectations, to the men of this world as to their enjoiments, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
of them that they have their portion in this life, 'tis plain
he sets his not in this life; in that therefore which he says he
shall awake to. That state also which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> assure us <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. all
the Patriarchs did look for, &amp; which all the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> had
such a faith of, that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> were always from their first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
counted Heretics for their denying it. That I say there is such
a state now, after so much signal revelation, after so much miracle
of Resurrections from death, is not to be made the argument of a
discourse to Christians, who can be such no otherwise nor further
than as they believe and are assur'd of it. And it seems altogether
as absurd to undertake to treat upon the nature of that state, which
<note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 3, 4.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had a tast of it, says is <hi>unspeakable and not
possible to be utter'd;</hi> which he was so far from knowing after he had
bin in it, that he knew not himself in it, knew not whether <hi>he were
in the body or out of it,</hi> when he did enjoy that state: which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi>
when he had a glimps in our Saviors Transfiguration, &amp; in the asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
by reason of the light, attemted but to speak of it, it is
said<note n="c" place="margin">Luke 9. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>he knew not what he said,</hi> it put him so beside, out of himself.
And 'tis no wonder if we cannot pertinently discourse of it, if, as
<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9.</note> Scripture says <hi>it cannot enter into the heart of man to comprehend it,</hi>
while he is in this animal and mortal state. And indeed it were
the same thing as to comprehend what is the Incomprehensible
God himself; for 'tis the nature of that state that we <hi>awake into his
likeness,</hi> the Text says, and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John</hi> hath said the same more expressly
1 <hi>John 3. 2. Beloved, now we are the sons of God, and it doth not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
what we shall be; but we know that when he,</hi> or <hi>it shall appear,
we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</hi> I do not find it said
in Scripture of the Angels in what ever rank of Principality they
stand, that they are like God; rather to be like the most High is
believ'd that very ambition that destroy'd all those that fell. But
as when man was made out of the dust he was the onely crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that was said to be made after God's own image and similitude;
so after he is fallen again into that dust, when he awakes out of it,
he is that onely thing that is sayd<note n="e" place="margin">Cap. 15. 49.</note> 
                     <hi>to bear the image</hi> of the Lord
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40114:85"/>
from Heaven, to be like God. And 'tis not strange if that nature,
which God did assume to himself, come at last to be glorified
with some endowments which transcend all those of Angels; yet 'tis
said of them, <hi>they always see the face of our heavenly Father Matt.</hi> 18. 10.
To see God therefore as he is, do's seem more, than to see his face
continually, and is such a sight as if it do not causally produce a
likeness to God in us, which yet possibly it may, and the Schools
think it do's, yet 'tis certain that it consequentially proves 'tis abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary that we shall be like him, otherwise it were impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that we should <hi>see him as he is.</hi> Which evidently follows from
the Argument of our Apostle, <hi>we know we shall be like him, for we
shall see him as he is;</hi> so that such a sight of him is that which
either makes us or concludes us like God: yea and that to such a
degree that in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi>'s words we <hi>are made partakers of the Divine
nature, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 4. I shall not undertake to be interpreter to the
Apostles as to this expression, or to give the meaning of those words;
but whatsoever more it may imply, surely it signifies that those At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
that are essentially natural to the Divinity, as the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of his understanding, perfect rectitude and purity of his
will; and not to enumerate particulars, perpetual, blessed, infinite
delight in the unwearied, uninterrupted exercise of his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the utmost latitude of its comprehensions, and the undisturb'd
enjoyment of his holy will in all things, all this unchangeable,
because spiritual and immortal; of all these, so much as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
to a creature, man shall then partake of, be exalted
into: yea so far partake in all of it, as he is exalted into an estate
to <hi>see God as he is.</hi> And this is certainly enough to make good
<hi>David's</hi> expectations, that when he <hi>shall awake up after God's like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
he shall be satisfied with it;</hi> and truly 'twere great simplicity to
go about to prove so far as any one is like to him, who is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Eternal Blessedness: and so far as himself is happy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
is so, that he must needs be satisfied; for it imports a
contradiction at once to be happy and unsatisfied, since so far as
any person is unsatisfied, wants any thing that he would have, so
far he is uneasy and not happy; either sure unhappy in not having
it, or else most certainly unhappy in desiring it, which cannot be
in any one that <hi>is like God.</hi> But King <hi>David</hi> seems wary in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
here, <hi>when I awake up after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied
with it;</hi> as if he did not count them satisfactions at the present, to
the state and condition he was then in, or at least the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
he then had. And indeed S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> who tasted the joys of it,
says he knew not whether he were <hi>in the body or no,</hi> so that it seems
that half of him was not concern'd at all in those transports of
those joys: and it is no wonder therefore if most men, that never
had a tast of any thing but what is sensual and worldly, have bin
entertain'd onely with satisfactions of those appetites that rise from
body, have no apprehensions, or at least no relish for those other,
which not onely to enjoy but understand, men must be spiritual to
some degree; for<note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>they are spiritually discern'd,</hi> saith the Apostle,
and <hi>the natural man</hi> that hath no other guide but sense, or what is
wholly founded upon sense and imagination, cannot tast or fancy
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40114:86"/>
them with any life at all. Yet notwithstanding this how dim soever
and faint the images of those things were in <hi>David</hi>'s time, before
<note n="g" place="margin">Mal. 4. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>the Sun of Righteousness was risen,</hi> and had brought to light that
blessed Immortality and Glory of that state, the very expectation
was so satisfying, that it could ingage him to pursue them, &amp; attemt
to compass them: &amp; that he might, after he should be awak'd from
death, <hi>see God as he is,</hi> and by consequence be <hi>like him,</hi> he resolves
he will <hi>behold his face in righteousness</hi> here in this life, as being satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that<note n="h" place="margin">Psalm 16. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>in his presence there was fulness of joy, and at his right hand
pleasures for evermore.</hi> When alas after all the advantages, the
force and beauty which the Gospel-revelations have enricht the
draught of that state with, yet now men do not apprehend any
such satisfaction in it, as can quicken an affection or endeavor after
it; they will not move a step nor a desire towards it.</p>
                  <p>And here as to this I will neither wonder at, nor instance in the
men whose minds the pomps, the gauderies, the heights, the state,
and what do's furnish all, the wealth and riches of this world have
seized; if such men be not taken off from the pursuit of these
things by invisible Treasures, and by spiritual Thrones and Scepters;
or if they whose souls have dwelt long in their dishes and their cups,
who drink to create thirst, eate to hunger, are not pleas'd much
with a state whose happiness is said to be, that men shall neither
hunger nor thirst in it; or if they whom all the pleasures of the
flesh sawc'd with variety have made loose and dissolute, will not be
temted to restrain themselves in those bounds that are set to chast
tongues, chast eyes, or chast bodies; or tho they may be mov'd it
may be to dismiss a while, yet cannot be made willing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
their lusts by notions of an happiness for Spirits that have no
sex, where they <hi>neither marry nor are given in marriage,</hi> but are <hi>like
God.</hi> I will not call in here for evidence that most men have no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
apprehensions of the Blessedness of that state, since altho
they had, yet there are appetites in the constitution to those other
satisfactions that are opposite to all these Blessednesses, and these
appetites are hot and fierce, have bin long pamper'd, and now will
not be deni'd, being grown too strong for any notions of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
to make head against them. But here is one fatal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
that will certainly evince men have no pleasing sense of the
condition of that after-state, they do not fancy it with any taking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
at all, and it is this, that in those duties of Religion which have
nothing opposite to any carnal appetite, which of themselves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
not any of our sensual satisfactions, yet most men have all
unwillingnesses to them, deadness in them. To name one of them,
Praier for example, which is rather priviledge than duty, a most
blessed, merciful indulgence, such as if God had not onely not
commanded but not given us leave for, we must have thought our
selves most wretchedly unhappy, since 'tis but giving us leave to
pour out all our wants into the bosom of our Father who is both
Almighty and most Mercifull, to beg those things which if we have
not, we are miserable here and everlastingly, and which Christ's
bloud that purchas'd them does joyn in intercession with us, when
we pray in earnest for them, and our sighs mixe with his agonies
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40114:86"/>
and the merit of his dying groans to his and our Father for us.
Now there is not one appetite in our making that's adverse to
praying, as there are many to strict virtues; 'tis not uneasy to the
flesh, nor yet repugnant to its satisfactions; it is not possible to
find a ground on which one can mislike it: and then to see men
backward to it, languid and dead in it, weary of it, suffering little
avocations to divert them at it, wandring, going from it while
they are about it, engag'd in it; glad to make quick end of it,
seeking out occasions to pretermit it; yea more, out of an insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
stupidity long omitting, not at all performing it, as if that men
had nothing at all to desire of God, or at least nothing they desir'd
so much, that they will take the pains to ask in earnest for it. Now
'tis impossible to give an account of this, there's no imaginable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
but that men have no concern or value for, nor apprehensions of
the things they pray for. 'Tis plain men perform chearfully what
tends to those things they affect and fancy, especially if it be not
uneasy nor at all distastfull: they have no sense therefore of the
things above, that should give life and heat and motion to their
Praiers; those Blessednesses have no tast or relish to them, are so
far from being matter of concernment, that the very asking for
them seems to them an unkind interruption of their divertisments,
any the least trifling thought of which is sufficient to call off their
hearts from the desire of Heaven, from the object of their praiers;
of so little regard it is to them, and so mean a satisfaction to be <hi>like
God. Mahomet</hi> was aware this was the temper of the most of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and he therefore baited his Religion with delights of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
joys that should not need a revelation, miracles, or
faith to make them apprehended pleasant; but he drest his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
with immortal sensualities, strong and eternal lusts made up
his heavenly delights; and then altho their pleasures are but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
(as the Christians are) after a life, yet his Proselytes grew
upon Christianity, are still very numerous, and they bear restraints
and practise that which Christians cannot be invited to, and what
with love to their Religion and those expectations will charge fire,
and run upon cannon to be shot into their Paradise; when after all
that God hath don to prepare Blessednesses for a Christian, and all
that Christ hath don to purchase and secure them to him, he finds
no attractiveness in them.</p>
                  <p>I shall not bring the one and the other satisfactions to a vie, not
onely that I may not entertain you with a common place, but the
comparison would be shamefull, and indeed would serve no ends:
not the conviction surely of a sensual person; for an Epicure that
was born blind, and never had any notice of any of those beauties
that surprize astonish, and transport men, but what their discourse
can give him, is not certainly by that to be convinc'd the pleasures
of the eye transcend those of the palate, 'tis a thing at least they
cannot judg of: nor can they, whose souls are fill'd with all the
images of the delights of sensuality, and who have no apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of God's spiritual, blessed satisfactions, compare or judg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, nor can therefore be convinc'd by our comparing of
them: yet if these men would but reflect a little, this consideration
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40114:87"/>
here might serve to help, if not their imagination, yet their faith of
those joys. Namely that if we think God made these comforts
here below, and fitted them just to our making, so as that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fancy or imagine pleasures more appropriate to our present
state, and we could think a long untroubled age of them great
happiness; and if we think too, when these comforts and our selves
are dead, that he will raise us up into another life, a world in which
he hath prepar'd rewards for those that liv'd here as they ought ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will, that us'd the pleasures of this world by those
rules and at those calm rates that he allows them: then we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that it is certain he both can and will make some as good at
least, and as appropriate to that condition in which he shall place
us. He that can raise us up out of the dust of death, can he not also
quicken joys and make a resurrection of delights, and as he alters
the condition of our being, temper pleasures to it, as he fitted those
here to our present state? What tho you know not how to fancy
satisfactions of another frame than those you now enjoy which you
could like to change for? Think you the infant in the womb, while
it enjoys ease and content in its close dark cell, can fancy the
chearfulness of a lightsom world, which the Sun guilds with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
shine? or that the child hath any notion of the strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of riper age? or can he possibly imagine there are any such
delights as those his babies and rattles afford him? have any savor
of the manly pleasures which mere reason gives, and humane
knowledg entertain us with? And so may not men grow past their
babies? God hath we see proportion'd satisfactions to each state
of being, to their own degree still in an excellent order; and shall
his knowledg or his power fail to do so, when we drop out of this
life into another, and are born to spirituality &amp; to immortality? or
will he not be so good to his Select ones as he hath bin to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
yea to the beasts here; give us joys as great as those of sense
are, which the beasts possess, or which is more, the wicked have in
greatest affluence? He that will let these satisfactions stream upon
the men he hates so, does he not know how, or can he not, or will
he not provide greater for his beloved ones, for those which he hath
studied happiness for? Would he give his own Son to die, shed his
own bloud to redeem us into a worse estate? or will he work a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of power, create a resurrection, that he may reward us to our
loss? All this is most unreasonable to imagine, so that altho we
cannot comprehend the blessedness of that state, we cannot paint
the glory that we shall be cloth'd with, cannot fancy the delights
God hath prepar'd; yet we are sure they must transcend most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
those of this life. The truth is all discourse is but reproch
to them, if ever any person had bin truly satisfied with any one or
with all the enjoyments of this life. If there were ever any one of
those, who in the transports of a passion that possesses their soul so
intirely, that they cannot entertain themselves with any other
thought, and really believe that their felicity is bound up in the
possession of the object of it, that they cannot ever be content with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, so that they dare undertake to vow they never shall or can
have other sentiments, in whom the passion when they had their
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40114:87"/>
wishes, did not grow more quiet and not so opinionative, and find
some allay so far that they were forc'd to seek to be reliev'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
from their felicity by variety of divertisments, and inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of appetites: if so, it were not so intolerable that men should
think they might be satisfied here, &amp; should not much consider any
other. But 'tis not sufferable to set satisfactions that do either go out
suddenly or clog &amp; become wearisom, that either die or we distaste
them, or else are not fit for them, against the satisfactions of being
<hi>like God,</hi> whom there is no one ever did believe to be, but he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
himself he must be blessed for ever; a state which made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
venture to be Devils rather than they would not strive for it,
and might therefore well temt <hi>David</hi> to resolve he would <hi>behold
Gods face in righteousness,</hi> the sure means to attain that state, and
my next particular.</p>
                  <p>The very same means are insinuated by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John</hi> in his first Epistle
where he said, <hi>we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is;</hi> add
this, <hi>Every man that hath this hope, purifieth himself as he is pure,
doth righteousness,</hi> in the words following, and so <hi>is righteous even as
he is righteous.</hi> But that we may know what King <hi>David</hi> means by
<hi>beholding Gods face in Righteousness,</hi> we must know that first by
<hi>Righteousness</hi> is meant uprightness and sincerity of a religious, holy,
virtuous life: and as for the <hi>beholding of Gods face,</hi> we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that altho God saith he spoke to <hi>Moses face to face,</hi> yet he tells
the same <hi>Moses</hi> that he <hi>cannot see his face and live,</hi> Exod. 33. 11, 10.
so that <hi>Davids beholding of his face</hi> is not seeing him as he did hope
to do, when he did <hi>awake up after Gods likeness,</hi> but</p>
                  <p>1. As for God to <hi>lift up the light of his countenance,</hi> Psalm 4. 6.
and to <hi>make his face to shine</hi> upon a man <hi>Psalm</hi> 31. 16. is to be favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to him; and to <hi>hide</hi> Psalm 30. 7. or <hi>turn away his face
2 Chron.</hi> 30. 9. is to withdraw his favor and to be displeased; so also to
<hi>seek his face 1 Chron.</hi> 16. 11. is to endeavor to obtain his kindness, and
accordingly to <hi>see</hi> or <hi>behold his face</hi> is to be in his favor, to be in a
state of enjoying it. But besides this also</p>
                  <p>2. As those that are said to behold the face of Kings, are those
that minister about them, do them service of the nearest admission,
and that stand in their presence, and are ready still to execute
whatever they command. So 2 <hi>King. 25. 19. and he took five men of
those that saw the King's face,</hi> of those that serv'd him in ordinary;
and so very often <hi>Ester 1. 14. &amp;c.</hi> And as secondly the Angels, that
are ministring Spirits, sent forth by God to minister perpetually, are
said to <hi>see the face of God always,</hi> Matt. 18. 10. so when <hi>David</hi> says of
God, <hi>thou settest me before thy face,</hi> Psalm 41. 12. the <hi>Jews</hi> expound
<hi>set me,</hi> that he might serve, minister unto him: for that is to stand
before the face of one, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 2, 4. and <hi>c.</hi> 10. 8. and <hi>c. 17. 1. &amp;c.</hi>
as he had said, dost appoint me for thy service; and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to <hi>see his face</hi> or to <hi>behold his presence,</hi> is to wait upon him in
all duty and obedience to his commands whom they attend: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
to <hi>walk before him,</hi> or <hi>walk with him in his presence,</hi> is to
serve him constantly with all uprightness <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. and to please
him <hi>Heb. 11. 5. cum Gen.</hi> 5. 24. But particularly in the acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Religion, his House, the place that's dedicated to his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40114:88"/>
being call'd his <hi>Court,</hi> his <hi>presence Psalm</hi> 95. 2. and 100. 2, 4.
because he sate upon and spoke from the Mercy-seat <hi>Exod. 25. 22.
Numb.</hi> 7. 89. and the Ark is therefore his <hi>presence</hi> and his <hi>face,</hi>
those that serve there are said to <hi>minister before him in his presence,</hi>
those that come there to <hi>appear before him</hi> Psalm 42. 2. those that
pray, <hi>to seek his face</hi> 2 Chron. 7. 14. and to <hi>intreat the face of the
Lord</hi> 1 Kings 13. 6. and our King <hi>David</hi> did <hi>desire one thing of the
Lord, which,</hi> says he, <hi>I will require, even that I may dwell in the
house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord,
Psalm</hi> 27. 4. So that <hi>to behold God's face in righteousness</hi> here does si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify
all this, I will serve thee truly, faithfully attend thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and wait upon thee in a constant diligent performance of
my duty, live as always in thy presence holily and righteously,
especially in attendance on thy Worship, when I come to seek thy
face, to put my self before thee in thy presence; and so doing I
make no doubt but that thou wilt <hi>lift up the light of thy countenance</hi>
upon me, and I shall behold thy <hi>face to shine</hi> upon thy servant.</p>
                  <p>And indeed that this is the means, and that there is no other
way to arrive at this state, is not difficult to prove; for <hi>the righteous
Lord loveth righteousness,</hi> saith the same <hi>David Psalm 11. 7. his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
will behold the thing that is just,</hi> whereas<note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>without this no man
shall see the Lord;</hi> and thereupon the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> after strict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
in the peoples name what they were to do that they might find
God's face look pleasingly upon them, and see his favorable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<note n="k" place="margin">Micah 6. 6, 7, 8.</note> 
                     <hi>wherewithall shall I come before the Lord, and how myself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the most High God? Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings,
with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of
rams?</hi> If his favor be to be bought, tho at the greatest price, 'twill
be abvisable to give it: and the dearest purchase would be a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
one. Or shall I give <hi>ten thousand rivers of oyl,</hi> thereby to
make his face to shine, and look upon me with a chearfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?
This sure were to be don. Or farther yet, <hi>shall I give my first-born
for my transgression, or the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</hi>
Time was indeed when men would do that; offer up their tender
infants in the fire to <hi>Moloch</hi> to preserve themselves from those sins
of the other <hi>Tophet,</hi> as if the burnt child were to expiate the foul
heats that begat it. I know not whether men believe now such
transgressions can deserve so severe atonements, that a sin of theirs
is valuable at the life of their own first-born, tho they take upon
them to profess the faith, that they were valued at the life of the
first-born of God: however there our Prophet shapes this answer to
that question, <hi>wherewithall shall I come before the Lord? He hath
shewed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord require of
thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy
God.</hi> And truly if we come before the Lord to behold his presence
in the duties of Religion, we must see his face in Righteousness;
otherwise he will either turn away his Face, or else our praiers will
but call his frowns upon us, and indanger us to perish at the rebuke
of his countenance. The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaking as from God to
that vainglorious nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> saith <hi>c. 1. v. 12, &amp;c. When ye
come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand to tread
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40114:88"/>
my courts? Bring no more vain oblations, incense is an abomination to
me, it is iniquity, even your solemn meetings, Sabboths, and your
appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me, I am weary
to bear them. And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
from you; yea when ye make many praiers, I will not hear. Wash ye,
make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes;
cease to do evil, learn to do well, seek judgment, right the oppressed,</hi> &amp;c.
And surely if men do not put away the evil of their doings from
them, when they come before his face, how lowd soever their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
cry for mercy and remission, their crying sins will call as
loud for vengeance: such Worship sure cannot possibly be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to him, we cannot think he will accept that which he nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seates,
like that which his soul hates, and reward that which he
cannot bear. Indeed such Worshippers do plainly rally him in
praying to him. He that hath not faithfully endeavor'd to reform
his manners, what does he in his confessions, but tell God Almighty
solemnly that he is wicked, but in truth he shall continue so, as not
at all as yet intending to be otherwise. He that begs God not to
lead him into temtation, but goes on in impieties, minds not the
keeping of himself out of the opportunities of it, but loves occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and converses with the provocations, plays upon the brink,
does all that is to make it unavoidable for him to sin; mocks God in
praying that he will not lead into temtation him that leads himself
into it. What use were it to him God should hear his praiers, and
not do that to him which he does to himself? Or if he beseech
God to grant, for example, he may live a sober life, yet never pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
to fail one assignation, not resolving to abate one meeting
nor one draught, he is so pleasant with Almighty God to wish, if
he wish any thing when he is praying, that he may be as immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
as ever, but that God would keep him sober, may have all the
drink he went for, but not the drunkenness; this he desires God
would preserve him from, and yet it may be not that neither, for
that may be useful to him, but however for the rest let him do as he
did. Now sure it is our interest God should not hear such praiers,
and therefore tho in all our actions we had need be carefull, since
God is always present, yet we should especially in our Religious
Worship; <hi>semper enim praesentamus &amp; ostendimus nos quasi facie ad fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem
cum Domino loquentes,</hi> we present our selves to him, and speak
face to face with him. Now if we lay not down our sins, but bring
our crimes thither with our Devotions, and so make our very Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
an abomination, to present our provocations to himself and to
his face, is such an affront that will not easily be pardon'd; no, if
we will <hi>behold God's face,</hi> we must do it <hi>in Righteousness.</hi> Indeed the
Psalmist's joyning these in the expression does insinuate, that the
onely hopefull means to make men be Religious, not at their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
onely, but in all their actions, to live holy, virtuous lives,
is to live always as before God's face, <hi>I will behold thy presence in
Righteousness.</hi> He that in every thing he goes about would teach
himself the custom to look up, to behold God's face, and see his
eyes over him, he would be carefull that there should be no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness
in what he did. King <hi>David</hi> was acquainted with the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40114:89"/>
influence of this, <hi>Psalm 119. 168. I have kept thy precepts and thy testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;
for all my ways are before thee.</hi> Indeed the presence of
whatever person we had reverence for, to behold his face towards
us inspecting our actions, would make us wary and fearful of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
or folly, much more of a gross action. <hi>Martials Lucretia</hi>
blusht, says he, laid his Epigrams aside when <hi>Brutus</hi> came in, <hi>Brute,
recede, leget,</hi> but as soon as he was gon, she took them up and read
them. Few vices hurry men with so impetuous a ferocity, but
they can check themselves before a virtuous grave person. One of
them that pretends to stings as sharp as any, would send off a boy,
and tho it be as impudent a sin as any, cannot suffer a spectator:
and then would I but consider always, I were always in God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
shut my eyes and see his face intent upon me, marking not
my actions onely but my purposes and deliberations; I should start
most certainly at the approaches of a sin, and no more dare to close
with it, then a Cut-purse temted by an opportunity which he was
going to make use of, would proceed if he discern'd the Judg upon
the bench beheld him, saw his eye upon him watching him; 'tis
such a guard this, nothing can be greater or securer. <hi>I have set
God always before me,</hi> says King<note n="k" place="margin">Psalm 16. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>David, therefore I shall not fall.</hi>
Nor would this contemplation onely make us cautious, but it would
excite, incourage our devotions: if we saw our selves before him,
we would be humble and attent, as people really concern'd, they
would be full of reverence and godly fear; indeed we would be
righteous, just and upright in all our doings; our whole conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
seeing who is present, would not dare to be unclean or rude, it
would not be vain or uncomly; in fine the business of our life would
be to do that which is well pleasing in his sight, perfecting holiness
in the fear of God, always looking up to him whose face is towards
us. This must needs raise all our affections and our aims, and place
them upon him, on whom our eyes and thoughts are set, especially
if there be resolution in the use of this means; most of all, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
have the courage of King <hi>David</hi>'s in the Text, a resolution
which was taken up against the almost universal practice and the as
great contradiction of the world, which generally minds far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
satisfactions, <hi>But as for me I will behold,</hi> both which conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the resolution and the courage of it I shall joyn in my last
particular.</p>
                  <p>And indeed there's nothing else but such a resolution that can
set it self against the practice of the world, will serve our turns: for,
as <hi>Seneca</hi> says, vice is but common madness, and we see that very oft
against their temper, inclinations and their principles, and the
conviction of their heart and soul, men will do vile and shamefull
things, because they will be mad, if others be so; it seems so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
a thing to endure to be singular in any company. And tho to
be so, singular I mean, in any the advantages of this world, either
as to goods of mind, of body, or of fortune for the most part is
more valued far than the advantages themselves, we would inclose
and be alone in every such thing, and as if we thought an excellency
lost its vertue if another had it, 'tis the rarity that takes with every
body; yet the advantages of Heaven, and the real true goods of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40114:89"/>
the mind, Religion, Piety, and Virtue 'tis far otherwise, as to those
there are none of those emulations in their practices and manners.
Be the the consequence never so dreadfull, men will do and be as
others; 'tis impossible to resist the tide of custom, go against the
torrent of a croud and multitude, or bear the being singular. And
there are two great obstructions to it, the solitude of singularity,
and the censures, scoffings and disreputations that use to attend
it. For example that I instance not, as well I might, in many
of the great duties of our Christianity, which are scofft and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicul'd,
but in the very case that makes the opposition in the
context here betwixt the Psalmist and the men of this world;
their excessive, rich, full way of living. If I do not live up to
the heights and vain pomps of condition or the mode, indeed
tho my condition will not bear it, if I be not as expensive, as luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
as others; I am then concluded sordid, near, short handed,
sleighted by all those that do exceed me, and by all that judg by
such appearances; so that here is disreputation lights upon me.
And besides if I retrench, not superfluities alone, but all licencious
conversation and the other evil uncomly entertainments of socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
retire out of them, allow my self none of these liberties, grow
more severe than others, and consequently singular in my beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior;
then I must keep company with no body, must withdraw
from every meeting, be a Recluse, as if the world were but a Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
or rather Hermitage: so that here's uncomfortable solitude
attends this. 'Twere very sad if onely vicious conversation could
cement societies or make acquaintances, and licencious folly
sawce their meetings, give them relish. What comfort is there
like to be in such companions that have nothing to endear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to one another, but that they will not refuse to sin, be sick
or mad with one another? In truth it were no very eligible thing
to be counted good, pleasant company, if to be so a man must ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
his sobriety or modesty, make bold with his Religion and good
manners. Even common decency can scarce entertain without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance
or detraction, either they must be ridiculous, or sharpe
and bitter. Now it is ill to be engaged by reputation, to play the
Satyrist, or to play the fool, and have no other recompence or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
but to make others laugh. But God be thanked 'tis not
thus, but men that have some little latent affections to their sins or
follies, still frame these objections against reformation of their evil
customs; the age is not so vitiated, such ill conversation, unless it
be by those that like and use it, is not every where to be found: but
if it were, and so far as we meet it, <hi>Davids</hi> resolution is most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.
They may take their course; <hi>but as for me</hi> I will retire into
God's presence, and <hi>behold his face.</hi> And what if by withdrawing
thus I frequently deprive my self of the society that I was us'd to, &amp;
was friendly and delightfull to me? 'Tis better by denying my self
and reforming to make joy in Heaven in God's presence among
Angels, than assist in making sport with such men; and 'twill be but
little comfort to go merrily and with good company to my damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Let them enjoy themselves in such society, but as for me I will
seek other, will live always in God's presence, <hi>I will behold his face.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:40114:90"/>
As to the other obstacle, the scoffs and the disreputations that
are cast upon those that are singular on this account, comply not
with the modes and evil customs of the age according as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi>
tells his Proselytes 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 3, 4. The time past of our life may suffice us
to have wrought the will of the Gentile World, when we walked in lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viousness,
lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings; wherein they
think it strange, that you run not with them to the same excess of riot,
speaking evil of you.</hi> It cannot be deni'd but that the world do's put
disreputation strangly upon things, and most unreasonably. Some
virtues are the most reprochfull things that can be: a man can
scarce live under the disparagement of being guilty of obeying God,
and on the other side one of the greatest and most sinfull injuries in
the whole world is, if not laudable, yet not blam'd in the man that
does it, while the innocent sufferer of it is contemn'd, and is
branded because he is wrong'd. Indeed if Christ's discipline were
in force to censure every vicious person <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, if every open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious
Sinner were render'd as contemtible as a <hi>Publican</hi> was to
the <hi>Jews,</hi> as<note n="l" place="margin">Matt. 18. 17.</note> Christ left order; disreputation then would lie where
it ought, and the objection would have no force. But as the world
is, singularity in good things, and in not comporting with modes
and customs, tho it may derive upon it self the scoffs of vain licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
men, cannot want esteem enough to bare it up against that.
There is indeed no reputation like that of a discreet, well manag'd
virtue; for many men that will not practise it, will yet commend it.
For to pass the great things, and to name that which there is scarce
any, that is, none sensible of, the instance which I made of this out of
the context, where the Psalmist sets himself against the custom of
those men, that pride themselves in ostentation of the plenties,
and the gayeties, and the excess of this world; a mode which may
be grown to such an height even in the lower ranks of people also,
that they are so undervalued who comply not with it, that most
cannot bear the shame of not having that which others have, tho
their condition will not bear the charge of it, and this is almost uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal.
But be it so, yet they that do not see thy pomps like others,
thy estate spangle, glare about thee and thy rooms and thy retinue,
do not see it spilt about thy table; if they see thee live up to thy own
condition, onely taking care not to exceed it, and resolving not to
owe thy plenties to thy debts, that is, thy abundance to the needs of
others, make their dues, their wants and nakedness to dress thy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities;
and if they see thee furnish those that need with what thou
sparest: they cannot count this lower stricter sort of living Sordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but discreet, just, charitable Piety; &amp; the others gaudiness proud
lavishness, yea unjust, unchristian folly, which at last will fall, and
that unpitied. But at once suppose to set our selves against the
evil customs of the world and to be singular in duty should be likely
to create us sleights and scoffs and disreputation; yet consider what
our Savior says<note n="m" place="margin">Mark 8. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>Whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words
in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of man
be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
He couples these, and makes it the same guilt to be asham'd
of him and of his words, asham'd of obedience to his word and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40114:90"/>
asham'd of his person; to be afraid of, loath to do ones duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
possibly some will speak meanly of it, is not onely not to
to dare to go to Heaven because some men laugh and scoff at those
that do go thither, but 'tis reckon'd the same thing as to be asham'd
of the Son of God who requir'd that duty, and think meanly of him,
scorn to own that their elder Brother, God Almighty's First-born,
as some do by their poor mean Relations: but this shame will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
severely, when the <hi>Son shall come in the glory of his Father with
the holy Angels.</hi> And then compare the disreputes, to be asham'd
of virtue, because debauchees that are as far from knowing what is
true repute as they are from being virtuous, will think meanly of
me for it, or to have the Son of God in glory with all his Host of
Heaven think contemtibly of me, when I shall be asham'd so as to
call out to the mountains and the hills to cover my confusion at the
valley of <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> before all the world. Let them delight, and
satisfy themselves with their choice of their commendable vices, sins
that are in reputation, rejoyce with glory in their shame; <hi>But as for
me I will behold thy face in Righteousness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what remains but that we take up this resolution, and put on
the courage of it, firmly purposing to do it, tho by doing so we should
go against the general customs of the world. To make a resolv'd,
open, avowed profession of a good life, provided that we do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ostentation or hypocrisy, is a great advantage towards living
so, makes it much easier. For however some, it may be the prime
ministers of hell, Satan's cheifest agents in temtations, such as
cannot bear that any other should be virtuous, 'tis such a reproch to
them, will the more endeavor to betray such, 'tis their luxury; yet
generally speaking, most men will not offer it, but rather fear them,
having an aw of them, and will themselves avoid the doing ill before
them in some measure. Indeed since none can promise themselves
that such will comply with them if they temt them, nor think it
probable that they will; most men, however forward in assaulting
innocence, will let them alone. Besides that such have put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by having publickly profest, whatever the world does,
they will live righteously, under a necessity of avoiding all their
evil practices; and 'tis a happy and great advantage towards a good
life, to be under a known obligation of well living, such as they
themselves have taken on them out of perfect aversation to ill
actions. Do not you think that most men miscarry out of want of
that which resolution would be able to effect with its own strength?
We see in other things it does attemt, it go's thro with much greater
difficulties, than lie in the way to virtue; which is so known, so eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day an object of mens eyes, that I should be asham'd to go about
to prove it. But when this resolution secondly shall be taken up,
and be avow'd against the open practice of the world out of a dislike
and abhorrency to it; when it is made eager too by aversation,
sharpned by much opposition and by being publickly profest and
own'd as a peculiar concern, since the very shame of being foil'd in
the contest, and proving false to ones own solemn resolution would
have stings in point of honor to push it forwards, for to that shrine
even Atheists are contented to pay homage: this must prosper, &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40114:91"/>
men have a mind to be conquer'd, think it easier to retreat, and
sordidly desert their resolutions, they cannot fail. Especially thirdly
if men consider all this is manag'd in Gods presence, to his face; if
they set the Lord always before them as the object and the end of all
their resolutions and their actions, and do this with all sincerity, as
seeing his eyes over them as witness and judg of their behavior, and
behold his face too with all hope and confidence imaginable, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he looks over them to encourage their endeavors, to behold their
needs of help, and to give them grace sufficient, and to crown their
fidelity, then such resolutions cannot possibly miscarry. What suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
soever they may have in that war which the world here, that is
at enmity with all that love and serve God, wages with them, and
tho it do not onely frown on them, but humble them into the dust
of death, yet keeping firm to their resolutions of <hi>beholding Gods face
in Righteousness,</hi> when they awake out of that dust <hi>after his likeness,
they shall be satisfied with it.</hi>

did declare to <hi>Thomas</hi> the richest Article of the
Christian Faith, the Resurrection, and helpt
him to conclude, that Christ was therefore <hi>Lord

and thrust his own hands into his side, he answered and said, <hi>My
Lord and my God.</hi> We have another sense comes in to evidence, and
makes the application; we have this day not onely seen and handled,
but also tasted the Bread, that is, this Lord; and if we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it worthily, and being become one with him we may upon
our own most sure and close experience cry out, <hi>My Lord and

                  </p>
                  <p>The Text, you see answers both the Solemnities of the day. The
Resurrection evidenced him to be <hi>Lord and God</hi> to <hi>Thomas,</hi> and so
also to us; and our faithful receiving him will evidence him to be
our <hi>Lord</hi> and our <hi>God,</hi> and in order to both these I shall handle
them: for there be in the words these parts.</p>

being risen, <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>God.</hi>

                  <p>1. That the Resurrection did instal him to that title <hi>Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Shew what that title does import,</p>
                  <p>1. By way of requiring, what kind of relation it hath to respect
and homage.</p>
                  <p>2. By way of promise, what it holds out for hope. Then as
to a word of application I will shew how the Sacrament applies
both those importances.</p>
                  <p>1. How it is an assurance to perform what that title requires.</p>
                  <p>2. How it does confer what the title does promise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:40114:92"/>
To the first, that the Resurrection did install Christ to the Title
<hi>Lord.</hi> As Christ was God he had indeed all Power and Autority
from everlasting; that comes not under our consideration. But as
he was the person sent and commissioned by God to bring mankind
to Salvation; he was first to die for them, then to rule over them;
and first to be their Priest, and then their Lord. After his crucifying
when he was risen again, then he says <hi>All power is given to me
both in heaven and earth,</hi> Matt. 28. 18. or in more express words
<hi>Acts 2. 36. Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath
made that fame Jesus, whom they have crucified, both Lord and
Christ.</hi> His Cross was a step to his Throne, it merited that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority
for him, and was in part undertaken for it <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8, 9.
And then for the importance of this Title as to that it does
require is very obvious, <hi>Lord</hi> is a word of power and autority,
it requires service and obedience. Nothing more frequent in
the Prophets, than, when they have from God severely worded
their commands, to add this sanction, <hi>I am the Lord:</hi> and as
applied to Christ S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> does say, <hi>I serve the Lord Christ.</hi> A ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
is the necessary relative to a Lord, and truly doing what he
doth command was the use he assigned of all that power he had
given him, <hi>teaching them to observe whatever I have commanded.</hi>
And truly if those Scriptures be remembred which secure his Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
thus, let us know that Power was the reward of his sufferings,
and he endured them partly for the Title's sake; therefore says as
much, and <hi>Heb. 12. 2. For the joy that was set before him, he endured
the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of God;</hi>
did all this, that he might gain that place: or if that be not plain
enough, then this is most express <hi>Rom. 14. 9. For to this end Christ both
died and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and
the living.</hi> Verse 8. <hi>That whether we live, we live unto the Lord: and
whether we die, we die unto the Lord:</hi> that is, that both our life might
be consecrated to him, our lives spent on his service, and our deaths
be at his command; and this was part of the end of his death.
And then I appeal to your own hearts, for what end, think you, he
did so desire, and obtain this power? Do you think, when he was
set at the right hand of God, he was exalted onely to a name, that
by all those sufferings he did acquire but a bare title, to be call'd
<hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> as he is call'd <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 16. but neither to look after
our obedience, nor indeed to set us any law to obey, as some would
have it? Was this power so dear to him, as that he would suffer
all those torments to compass it, and yet when he hath it, that it
should be so little regarded by him, as to suffer us to neglect &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
it, to go on in a continued course of disobedience to all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
to rebel against his Power, &amp; never submit our appetites to it,
but let every lording passion fly in his face, &amp; every lust defy his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority,
let us be proud against that Lord, be higher than our duties
and all the temper of virtues, and let every ebullition of our proud
wrath trample on a statute back'd with hell-fire, yea and so believe
that his death should procure us an impunity in doing this? What a
wretched mistake is this, to think his bloud, which purchased him
a power to command us, should purchase us a leave to disobey him?
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40114:92"/>
This is to make Christ's bloud divided against it self, and to make
it spill and dash it self. That we should go on in a course of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or allow our selves some peevish vices, and stop our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
and a Preacher's mouth with saying Christ died for us,
when as 'tis clear he died that he might be Lord, that is, that we
might live and dy to him, do both at his command; and canst
thou think that that death will excuse thee for not obeying, which
was undertaken for that very end, that thou mightest obey him?
Christ died to be thy Lord, and thou wilt have that death a plea
for thee, when thou obeyest sin and the Devil his greatest Enimies.
His Cross was his very Ensign and Standard against these Enimies,
his Passion was his grappling with them, and his death his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And yet thou dost again submit to their authority, becomest a
subject to their power, and settest them Lord over thee, and
fetchest the justification of this thy defection from that death and
victory; and that is the same thing as to make them of no autority
nor power, yea the captivity and ruin of those Enimies to be the
reason of thy obeying them, to excuse thy disservice to Christ by
saying he is thy Lord, and for thy rebellion and waging war with
him pretend thou dost it under his own standard. No certainly his
Title claims Obedience, and does assure thee thou must serve.
This is the first thing what thou must do.</p>
                  <p>The second what thou maist expect from it, is easily discover'd,
that is wages: For <hi>he will recompence every man according to his deeds,
Rom. 2. 6. To them, who by patient continuance in well doing seek for
glory, and honor, and immortality, eternal life, v. 7. And glory, honor,
and peace to every man that doth good, v.</hi> 10. For he is the <hi>Lord of
glory,</hi> the <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> and <hi>Lord of life,</hi> the Scripture saith: in a
word to sum up both what his Title doth require, and what we may
expect from it, it saith Service and it saith Wages, and both are
set down in that to the <hi>Heb. 5. 9. He is the Author of eternal salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all them that obey him;</hi> and both here are applied to him who
does in earnest owne the relation to this Title, and can say in truth
<hi>My Lord:</hi> the next part, and first of the applying what it does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
Service, as it is the assuring of performance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lord.</hi> And truly had we not entred any voluntary obligation,
and had we not contracted formally to take him for our Lord, and
not onely owned all that the relation does import to be due from
us, but engaged also to render it; yet he is to us both</p>
                  <p>1. By an Original right: he made us, and there is not a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the world hath so much right to require the uses of his own
handy-work, to dispose of that same utensil which himself shap'd or
fram'd, as the Lord hath to require our service. Did I perchance
furnish the Lord with some materials for my self, or did I find any
piece towards my making, contribute any least thing to my being,
then let me claim somthing for my share in my self, and by the
rule of fellowship with God have some use of my self to my self, and
as to that let him not be my Lord. But there is no such thing; he
called me into being out of the infinite resistance of vacuity, and
nothing. He gave me body, soul, and every power and faculty,
and he upholds every motion and inclination of those faculties,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40114:93"/>
and gives me opportunities and objects for them. There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderability
of any thing within me is from my self, but entirely
owes its being from his store, and comes from the Almighty: and
then what least imaginable pretence or plea can I have, why every
motion and inclination both of soul and body should not be bound
to look towards his service, and every action and thought acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him <hi>My Lord.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>2. By purchased Title. He did redeem us from the service of
those cruel Lords, Sin and the Devil, whose service is unreasonable
and unmanly slavery, and whose wages is eternal ruin; and he
bought the right and title to our service at a price, he became our
Lord, <hi>Ye are bought with a price, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 23. They that do not
acknowledge this, are in the number of those men of whom S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi>
speaks <hi>Epist. 2. c. 2. v. 1. denying the Lord that bought them, and bring
upon themselves swift destruction:</hi> and you may judge what kind of
Lord he ought to be by the price he paid for the Title, what ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he expected by the rates at which he purchased them, even at
the bloud of God <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. He died, I told you, that he might
be Lord. And now Lord, what is thy servant that thou shouldst
thus value him, or what are his performances that thou shouldst buy
them at these rates? And shall I give to Sin or Sathan those ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
which he thus values, and thus buys? No, if thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to purchase that so dear which was thy own just due before,
surely now by all rights thou art <hi>My Lord.</hi> But</p>
                  <p>3. He is so also by my own most solemn contract and engagement.
And to pass by all the rest, and to stick to that of this day onely,
we did contract so in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and in
receiving that we did most solemnly assume to do him faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and took him for our Lord. And this would easily appear
from hence, if Christ's bloud be the price with which he bought the
right to be thy Lord, and this day thou didst come and here didst
take that bloud to all those ends and uses it was given for, then in
so doing thou didst ratify the contract, and take possession of the
relation: but to do it more solemnly, and here I will not stand upon
that proof which I have formerly made to you from the account
that <hi>Pliny</hi> gave to <hi>Trajan</hi> the persecuting Emperor, tho truly it be
strange that a Heathen should discern this was the meaning of their
Sacrament, and Christians will not believe it. He, when he was
emploied to persecute the Christians, tells him what he had found
of them by racking some, and by confessions of others at their
death, <hi>Soliti stato die convenire, seque Sacramento obstringere, ne fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
ne latrocinia, ne adulteria committerent, &amp;c.</hi> to take an oath
(they knew no other sense of the word Sacrament) to do what
their Lord had commanded them. What have you don this day?
Why Christ was sworn your Lord this day, and you have taken an
oath of service, entred into a bond of duty and obedience; and if
you wilfully shall fail of doing this, your Worships will be brought
against you, your Communions will come in as so many evidences
that you have forfeited, so many oaths that you have broken. No
sure, I will henceforwards tie my self to better performance; for I
have hamper'd my self with obligations, entangled my self with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40114:93"/>
one other engagement, I have again sworn at the Altar, Thou art
<hi>my Lord.</hi> But I have a more solemn proof of this, that he who
comes to the renewing of a Covenant with God (now Christ we
know saith<note n="a" place="margin">Luke 22. 20.</note> that that <hi>cup is the new Covenant in his bloud</hi>) he does
enter into <hi>an oath of God, Deut.</hi> 29. from verse 10. to 15. <hi>Ye stand this
day all of you before the Lord your God, your captains of your tribes,
your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel, your little
ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer
of thy wood, unto the drawer of thy water, that thou shouldest enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
covenant with the Lord thy God, and into his oath, which the Lord
thy God maketh with thee this day; that he may establish thee to day for
a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath
said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to
Isaac, and to Jacob: neither with you onely do I make this covenant
and this oath, but with him that standeth here with us this day before the
Lord our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day.</hi> Now
out of this they who are not convinc'd that our first entring Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God by Baptism is a vow, altho the Church require that
we should look upon it under that Solemnity, and tho S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> call it
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a stipulation, or if they think it something like it, yet 'tis
a vow but in the childrens name, and so it does not strike those ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of so sacred an engagement into them, themselves may
see here at an entring Covenant little ones entring into an oath:
and this was not the first giving of the Covenant, that so any thing
might be thought peculiar to that, but onely a repeting of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
in their presence, verse 1. and least that we should think
their standing there in solemn manner, might imply something
more than ordinary verse 14. 15. take us that stand here this day
before the Lord our God, but also with him that shall be born
hereafter. Many expositors, and the <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Exposition says
with all the generations of you that are to come <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
as if they stood with us this day. And the
<hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jon. Vziel</hi> says, they do stand, that is, as to this intent
and purpose, that as soon as they are admitted into Covenant by
Circumcision, they are within this oath. Littles ones therefore
that can be admitted into a Covenant by receiving of the sign of it,
they then enter an oath of keeping it. And then, my Brethren,
we have entred an oath to continue Christ's faithful Soldiers and
Servants unto our lives end, and that is, thou, and I, and every
one have sworn he is <hi>my Lord.</hi> O my Savior I was baptized, and at
that time did swear service, and then if I should fail thee now, I
renounce my Allegiance, I go from my fealty, and I throw of my
Covenant. Every evil action I deliberately commit, brands me
with the dishonorable base stile of one that slights his oaths; there
is no hold of his vows, not his most sacred ones, those that he
makes to God. Every vain or passionate oath, how true soever,
speaks me perjured; the draughts of intemperance would wash off
the water of my Christendom; every unclean lust, every impurity
of Flesh or Spirit does as it were bemire and wipe out my contract
with my Lord. For I covenanted to be pure and clean, for I was
wash'd into the very name of his retainer. I could not have that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40114:94"/>
title of that relation without being cleansed. There I did swear
defiance against all his Enimies, the Devil, World, and Flesh, and
all worldly and carnal lusts, that I would neither follow not be
led by them; and if I should serve them now, I should be a Rebel
and a Traitor to my Lord against my bond, and covenant, and
oath. No, my Lord, I will not serve these, where death must be
my wages, the Fiends my Comrades, and my Conquest Hell; I'le
not do homage to destruction, engage to be true and faithful to
my own ruin, pay allegiance to my perdition. Thou hast my
worship and my service by bargain and by oath, I have sworn Thou
art <hi>my Lord.</hi> Now all this is of much more force in the Sacrament
of the Lord's Supper, where I do formally and knowingly seal to
this Covenant; and when we do this on our knees in the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomn
manner that is possible, this must needs be a more express en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into Christ's oath, than that there of the <hi>Jewss</hi> was the entring
God's oath, which was in probability onely coming and standing
before the Lord to hear the Covenant, which God had struck with
that nation before in <hi>Horeb.</hi> Or if it were performed with Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
which may seem probable in that it is exprest <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that
<hi>thou shouldest pass into the covenant.</hi> So your Margent reads there
verse the 12. alluding to their manner of confirming Covenants by
dividing the beasts, and setting one half against the other, and
passing betwixt the divisions: so we see <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. 18. This is passing
into the Covenant, and therefore the LXX. read here <hi>Deut. 29. 12.
That thou shouldest enter into the Covenant of the Lord thy God,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
that rite of dividing and
passing thro being onely the Symbol of curses against them that
shall break their Covenant, and imprecations in Hieroglyphicks:
so that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. 18. 'tis most literally, if we translate the words
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> according to their importance, <hi>I will make those men, that
have transgressed my Covenant, the calf,</hi> or <hi>as the calf,</hi> as the <hi>Syriac</hi>
reads; I will divide and separate them among the Nations, and
give them to the sword, and cut them in pieces, the ceremony si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifying
to be don to him that does not stand to his Covenant.
Now surely this is don to more advantage in the Sacrament, where
Christ's body is torn, and his bloud poured out no doubt with the
like commination implied, that being the very meaning of pouring
out bloud in Covenants; so that we entred there the Lord's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and imprecation, swearing that he shall be our Lord with a
most threatning sense. And surely if we be not careful to observe
our oath, we have vow'd agonies to our selves, and sworn our own
condemnation, when there I curse myself with all the curses of the
Covenant, if Christ be not <hi>my Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now it will be needless for me to go on and prove, that if we
be not careful to fulfil the importance of this relation, <hi>my Lord,</hi> in
order to what it requires, 'twill be in vain to expect the benefit of
that relation, in what it does import. He that hath not don ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
as to his Lord, must not look<note n="b" place="margin">Matt. 25. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>to enter into the joys of his Lord:</hi>
he that hath not don his will, 'twill be in vain for him to cry at the
last day <hi>Lord Lord,</hi> altho he come with never so applying Titles,
and cry <hi>my Lord,</hi> and tho he call upon any other Title of his <hi>Jesus.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40114:94"/>
He died</hi> indeed <hi>for our sins, but he rose again for our justification.</hi> His
Resurrection did entitle him to be our Lord. If he be risen to thee,
he is thy Lord. But these two make up the confession of a Christian
<hi>Rom. 10. 9. If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
believe in thine heart, that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt
be saved:</hi> and look not for it from any other relation to him. Thy
Priest may sacrifice for thee, but Christ thy Lord must pardon thee:
thy Jesus on the Cross must pay thy ransom, but if <hi>the Lord make
you free, then are ye free indeed, John</hi> 8. 36. Do not deceive thy self
with looking no farther than to thy Jesus in his sufferings; thou
must relate to him also in his Power and Autority, thou must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon thy Jesus dying and risen too; not onely on thy Jesus on
the Cross, but on thy Jesus on the Throne: thou must cry out My
Savior, and thou must cry My Lord; and if thou canst in truth and
in reality, he is the <hi>Author of eternal salvation to all them that obey
him;</hi> that is, he is an everlasting Savior to them, to whom he is a
Lord. His all Autority will be emploied in thy deliverance, he
will shew himself a Lord to thee onely in pardoning, saying and
rewarding thee, and his all-power both in Heaven and Earth will
be to thee Omnipotence of mercy: for he that is thy Lord, he is
thy God also. The third thing, <hi>My God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I must take the same method here that I us'd before. First see
what the Resurrection did contribute towards this Title <hi>God,</hi> and
what that Title does imply, both as to what it doth require, and
as to what it imports by way of promise and encouragement.</p>
                  <p>Secondly see what the Sacrament contributed towards making
the application, <hi>My God,</hi> and what that imports in order to both
the other things.</p>
                  <p>1. Altho this Son of God according to his Divine Nature was
Everlasting God, and, as the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed expresses, <hi>begotten of his
Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very
God,</hi> and was called so in Scripture <hi>John 1. 1. and the Word was God;</hi>
yet it is sure this person Jesus Christ was <hi>declared to be the Son of God
by the resurrection from the dead, Rom.</hi> 1. 4. And this text is the first
place in the New Testament, where this person is expresly called
<hi>God. Thomas</hi> upon the evidence of this Resurrection crying out, I
do acknowledge that thou art my very Lord, and that is a most
certain argument to me that thou art the Omnipotent God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and this his Resurrection did contribute to his Title <hi>God.</hi>
Now I enquire what this implies, and that will be made clear from
<hi>Deut. 26. 16, 17, 18, 19. This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee
to do these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do
them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. Thou hast avouched the
Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
and his commandments and his judgments, and to hearken unto
his voyce. And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar
people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his
commandments: And to make thee high above all nations which he hath
made, in praise, and in name, and in honor, and that thou maiest be an
holy people unto the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken.</hi> So that
you have there the certain meaning of that mutual relation
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40114:95"/>
                     <hi>My God</hi> and <hi>My People</hi> as to what it requires: and so we see
'tis but the same engagement that the other Title did import,
onely with an higher inforcement and ground of obligation;
and therefore God himself that by his Prophet <hi>Malachy c.</hi> 1.
had used the other-argument of Master or Lord <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>v.</hi> 6. and Governor <hi>v. 8. Offer it now unto thy Governor, will he
be pleased with thee or accept thy person?</hi> makes use of the like cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>max
and gradation; as if he had said, Had thy obedience to thy
Ruler no more care nor endeavor in it, had thy services to thy
Lord no more devotion nor zeal, were thy performances to thy
Governor so slight and so regardless, so full of supine negligence,
to say nothing of transgression and contemt; were thy present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to thy Prince so unhandsom, slubber'd &amp; heedless, so uncho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
unprepared &amp; so trivial, would they be content with them? And
must I? No surely, <hi>Cursed be the deceiver</hi> verse 14. that mocks me
with his imperfect, lame, sick services, with outsides of attendance,
yea with irreverence, with casting of my words behind him, with
polluted offerings; <hi>for I am a great King, saith the Lord.</hi> But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in case of an higher affront he breaks into an higher resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>c. 3. 8. Will a man rob God?</hi> This is such a thing as the Lord's
Rhetoric could lay no greater aggravation on it, than by asking
the question, whether any man could heat himself into such a mad
impiety, and not be confounded at the thought of such an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
to abuse his God. Now such an obligation of obedience to
the Lord Christ he owns, that does acknowledge him his God, this
it requires.</p>
                  <p>Now as to what the Title does import by way of promise; here
to be the God of any body signifies to be their Almighty Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
him from whom that person may expect, and shall receive all
good things, that the power of a God includes. So it is clear it
does, when God proclaims himself the <hi>God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob,</hi> and says, <hi>that is his name and his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
to all generations, Exod.</hi> 3. 15, 16. From whence our Savior con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<hi>Matt.</hi> 22. 31, 32. that <hi>Abraham</hi> and the other must have a life
after this; for otherwise how is he yet their God? How can he be
a Benefactor to the dead? And in the tenor of the Covenant,
where it is past, it means, I will bestow upon them all the mercies
of the Covenant. So in the Old, that place of <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 16, 17, 18, 19.
so in the New <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 12. where 'tis explained, <hi>I will be merciful
to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
no more,</hi> So that <hi>my God</hi> does mean, first he that I vow all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and service to, and secondly he from whom I claim and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
all those glorious things that are contracted for us in Christ's
Covenant, the happy issues of the whole chain of methods that he
works for us, the designed mercies of his Predestination and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
that he calls us to, the comfortable condition in which his
Justification does instate us, the graces of his Sanctification, and
the incomprehensible blessedness of his Glorification: yea and all
the preservations and mercies of this life, all these are challenged
in this, <hi>Thou art my God.</hi> For so <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33, 34. which is repeated
in the <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12. whatever both parts do contract for, man's
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40114:95"/>
duty and God's promises, is all sum'd up in this, <hi>I will be their God,
and they shall be my people.</hi> By which words also he assures them all
deliverances from evil, and enstates upon them the securings of his
Providence, both to themselves and their posterity. And if God
mean all this, when he does say <hi>I will be their God;</hi> then man he
vows and claims all this, when he does say <hi>my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let us see how this days performance does both these. First
how it vows and swears all duty, worship, and service, all that Christ
requires by his Covenant, I have already shewn, so that that part is
don; onely we may take notice <hi>Whose belly is his God,</hi> in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Pauls</hi>
words <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. the man who does mind nothing but his sensual
appeties, and notwithstanding Christ's commands contrives all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions
for that, and enjoys them: that either casts the body of
Christ into a stomach filled with late surfet and drowns his bloud in
such intemperate draughts as are yet unrepented of, or else within
a few days after overlaies that body with some riot, or spews that
bloud out in the overflowings of his woful draughts. These what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they have don to day, cannot yet say, <hi>my God;</hi> not onely
because they so defy his Worship which they vowed, but because
they set up an Anti-God against him, and while they vow upon
their knees he is their God, yet at that same time they adore their
appetites. Nor if <hi>Covetousness,</hi> or rather inordinate lusting, as the
word bears, <hi>be Idolatry,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> oft expresses, and surely without
taking in the Heathen uncleanesses in Religion: and it is ill for
some persons of these days, that they had not the luck to be born
Heathens, that so they might have bin unclean devoutly, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in obedience to their Gods, presented their bodies living sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
to be kindled by the flames of lust, and whose whoredoms
were their pieties; for many live now, as if they did not onely wish,
but almost think so. But abating this, there is sure more Idolatry in
the courthips and the practice of that sin than any other. There
is no other thing does cast a man into such base degenerate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
submissions to atchieve or to cover his transgression, lower
than any thing but the unclean commission it self. Now if this be
Idolatry, the lustful person hath an Idol, and then he cannot say
to Christ <hi>my God.</hi> And thus they <hi>in whom the God of this world hath
blinded their mind,</hi> in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> words 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. they who serve Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
by going on in any vitious custom of the World; or in a word,
they that disobey Christ for this God of the World, <hi>this Prince of the
power of the air, the Spirit that works in the Children of disobedience,
Ephes.</hi> 2. 2. they cannot say to Christ <hi>my God;</hi> tho they bow at his
Altar, they obey the Devil, and he will not be a partner together
with the Devil. So that every one of these is perjur'd, when he says
<hi>my God;</hi> much less can he plead the claim, <hi>my God,</hi> the last sense.</p>
                  <p>Now in that sense <hi>My God</hi> does challenge as a right and a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
all the Blessings temporal, Spiritual and Eternal, all that the
promises of Christ do offer, or that the hopes and expectations of a
Christian fly at: all these, I told you, God included, when he said
<hi>I will be their God;</hi> and therefore all these he does truly challenge,
that can say <hi>my God.</hi> It is an huge Confidence that a poor soul may
take, when he can go to God as <hi>David</hi> does <hi>Psalm 119. 94. I am
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40114:96"/>
thine, save me;</hi> secure thine own, O Lord, or else it will be thy loss
what I shall suffer. For I am thine, vindicate thine own right, let
neither Sin nor Devil rob thee of thy own peculiar. Behold I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
thine own charge with thee, and then take care of that. Shall
that miscarry that is a part of thy custody and care, a part of thy
possession and inheritance; for all this is implied in that challenge,
<hi>my God.</hi> For they whose God he is, they are his People, that is the
correlation. Now that means <hi>a special People,</hi> Deut. 7. 6. <hi>a peculiar
People,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. <hi>a peculiar Treasure,</hi> Exod. 19. 5. <hi>his People of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi>
Deut. 4. 20. <hi>his Jewels,</hi> Mal. 3. 17. <hi>the Jewels of his Crown,</hi>
Zach. 9. 16. If I am his, I am so under all these precious notions,
and then how dear, how valuable am I to my God, who make up
his inheritance, who do enrich his treasury, who give a lustre to his
Diadem of glory, and am a Jewel in his Crown? How secure may
I be? For will God wretchlesly lose his inheritance, or will he not
take care of his especial things, or will he throw away his treasure,
or will he throw his own Crown to the ground so to dash off the
Jewels of it? That place of <hi>Malachy</hi> expresses the different condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those that are God's People from the others that have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to him, in respect of God's carings and protection, <hi>Mal. 3. 14,
15, 16, 17, 18. Ye have said, it is in vain to serve God: and what profit
is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
before the Lord of Hosts? And now we call the proud happy: yea
they that work wickedness are set up; yea they that temt God are even
delivered. Then they that feared the Lord, spake often one to another,
and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was
written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon
his name. And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in that day
when I make up my jewels, and I will spare them as a man spareth his
own son that serveth him. Then shall ye return and discern between the
righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God, and him that
serveth him not.</hi> In times of undisturbed abundance and of full
prosperity, when the God of this World is good to them that serve
him, when the Lord lets men alone, and the ungodly thrive; then
indeed his protections are not much regarded, but wickedness and
wealth do seem the strong securities. But when God sends his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
abroad, and when his judgments sweep away those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences,
then this will be a comfortable consideration: Come
what will come, I have one that will care for me, one that hath
writ me in his note book, his book of remembrance to put him in
mind, that he is to provide for me: and when the most florishing
ungodly man shall be stript of all his hopes and trusts, so that there
remains no least relief from them, nor can he look for any from the
Lord, he is not of his People; then have I one that will make me
up amongst his Jewels, have the same care of me as of his precious
and peculiar treasures; I have a right and title to his protections,
to provide for, and to take care of me: it is his office, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
it in his Covenant, and not to do it were to break his compact
which he hath bound himself to with an oath. For I am his, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I can with confidence go to him. <hi>I am thine, save me.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the words afford me greater grounds of confidence, when they
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40114:96"/>
give me autority to challenge him, and tell him, Thou art mine,
<hi>my God.</hi> All the securities that his preserving mercies signify, all
the watches of his providence, all the blessings that fulfil his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
as goodness, they are all mine, for he is mine. Can I fear
the malice of Adversaries? shall I doubt the fury of that spoiler that
even robs necessity, will rob me even to a perfect desolation? Ah
my poor soul, <hi>Nunquid sibi Christianum.</hi> I am sure it cannot take all
from me; it must void Heaven before it can disfurnish me of all, it
must commit a rape upon my Jesus; for while they leave him, I
have my God. Can I want any thing for this life or the life to
come, if there be a supply in Christ? I may be sure to have it, if his
Divinity can effect it; I need not want, for I have right to him, he
is <hi>my God.</hi> What one thought can afflict or trouble me long, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be such an one, for which there is no help for in God? If
such a one indeed do seize me, there is danger; but till that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<note n="c" place="margin">Psalm 42. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>why art thou so troubled, O my soul, why art thou so disquieted
within me? O put thy trust in God,</hi> in Christ, for he is <hi>my God.</hi> Can
I desire indeed, when I have him? Sure I am strangely greedy, if
the Almighty be not enough for me, more unsatisfied than Hell if
Christ, that is God, cannot suffice me, if I am not content when
he is <hi>my God.</hi> O my soul, Christ never failed to pay his debts, he
is a happy Creditor to whom he owes, especially where he owes that
debt, and where he owes himself. Now if thou be a faithful and
Religious Soul, he is thy debt, as due to thee as thy own portion.
<note n="d" place="margin">Psalm 119. 57.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou art my portion, O Lord,</hi> saith <hi>David;</hi> thou hast as great a
right to him as thy inheritance:<note n="e" place="margin">Psalm 16. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou art the lot of my inheritance,</hi>
saith he again, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Thomas</hi> here <hi>He is my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But never hath a faithful Soul more right to lay this claim than
at the Sacrament to both the claims that I have treated of.</p>
                  <p>1. To be his Treasure, his peculiar Treasure; for the Church
tells us, <hi>If with a penitent and true heart we receive that holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then we spiritually eat the flesh of Christ, and drink his bloud, then
we dwell in him and Christ in us, we be one with Christ and Christ with us;</hi>
an Union which fulfils what Christ hath praied for <hi>John 17. 21, 23.
I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and as
thou, Father, art in me and I in thee, that they also may be one with us.</hi>
Here's Unions and interests enough, and all cemented and assured
by the worthy receiving of this Sacrament. I am certainly his, if
I be made one with him, and dearer than his Jewels, and more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to him than his Treasure; for I am him himself. And the
same thing will prove that he is mine; for certainly if I have a title
to him ascertain'd, if I be made one with him, I may well call that
mine to which I am united. So when he dwells and is in me, then
I may say He is my Christ, <hi>my God.</hi> And then, he that there faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
performs worship and service to him, and so does take him for
his God, then if his God be his inheritance, there he does make his
entry: if his God be his portion, there he receives his portion. The
Priest there gave thee, if thou wast a good Communicant, the Body
and Bloud of Christ, and his Body and his Bloud is he himself.
Therefore thou didst receive him as verily as thou didst those, and
if the Sacramental food be thine, then Christ is thine, and thou
maist say <hi>my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:40114:97"/>
My Brethren it was the Bloud of Christ that purchased all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
mercies of the Gospel, all the blessed expectations of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
that was the price of all the joys of Heaven, that reconciled
God to us, bought us an interest in him, and the happy enjoyments
of himself for us: and then if in the Sacrament Christ do give me
his bloud, when I can shew God that, bring him the price of the
remission of my sins, the value of those glories, even the bloud of
Jesus, come with the purchase-money in my hands that bought my
interest in God, cannot I say those are mine, my Heaven and <hi>my
God?</hi> Yea when I can say, O Lord Christ, whom I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to obey, my God whom I have vowed to serve and worship,
thou art even my flesh; for there I ate thy flesh, and thou becamest
flesh of my flesh: <hi>Thou art the portion of my cup,</hi> when thy very bloud
doth fill full my cup, and so thou art my flesh and my bloud, then
surely I may say with <hi>Thomas</hi> here <hi>my Lord and my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O Holy and Eternal Savior, who art made both Lord and Christ,
and by thy Resurrection didst manifest the Omnipotency of thy
person, the truth of thy Promises, and open a way to the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
glory and salvation, which thou hast prepared for them that
give themselves up to serve and worship thee their Lord and God;
pour down that blessed influence of this thy Resurrection on our
hearts, in raising us from the death of sin to the life of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Be thou our Lord and Christ, ruling us by thy laws, saving
us by thy grace, and by thy Spirit applying the mercies of thy
death, and so making us partakers of thy Resurrection; therein
turning us from our iniquities, hereafter in raising us to Glory.
O Lord we have this day made a Covenant of this with thee, and
signed the Articles of it in the bloud of our God, swore to them at
the Altar: give us grace, we beseech thee, to use the strictest care
and watchfulness in our endeavors to perform with thee. Regard
not how we have in times past onely mock'd thee sacredly in these
performances. O let it from this day be otherwise. We have bin
onely on a stage of Religion, when we are at our devoutest perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances;
and having turn'd our backs unto the Church, turn'd
them also to our duty, put off the vizards of Religion, and we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
our selves of all our Piety almost as soon as the exercises of it
were don; and howsoever we tied our selves, our froward wills
have bin too strong for all our obligations, and burst out of them,
broke all thy bonds asunder, and cast away thy cords from us: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
we tied them with all things that were most solemn and most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
vows and oaths, and tied them before the body of our cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Lord and Savior, with the body and bloud of Christ in our
hands, as if we had no other desires, no other cares that should do
us good, than as we were careful to keep those resolutions and vows;
and yet. O Lord, we did let them instantly loosen and slack, pass
by and fail. Yea we did break them wilfully, and would not be
held in by thine or our own bonds. O Lord, if thou look upon us
in this guilt, sure thou wilt have no more to do with us, such false
and perjured vow-breakers. But O look upon us in thine own bloud,
which thou hast bid us pour out still to establish and renew our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with thee; and let this Covenant, wherein we have now
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40114:97"/>
taken thee to be our Lord and God, and taken thee who art so in
us, remain inviolable: be there then with thy Power and Autority,
subdue our hearts and our desires, and bring them under the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of thy laws. Thou that art God Almighty, that didst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
Death and Satan, bring it to pass that none of them prevail
against thee now in our Souls, where thou art: but use thy strength,
O Lord, to drive their power thence, that thy servants and thy
people may not be enslaved to corruption and ruin, nor thy Enimy
gain souls from thee, which thou hast purchased with thy bloud,
that we having attain'd thee for our Lord and God, may claim the
privileges of thy People here, have the watches, and cares, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities
that thou laiest out upon thy Treasures and the Jewels of
thy Crown; and by thy body and thy bloud being made one with
thee, and thou being ours, all things may be ours, thy grace here
and thy joys hereafter; thy Spirit may be ours, and thy Heaven
ours; and we in thee and thou in us, may all enjoy thy Kingdom,
Power and Glory for ever.</p>

earnest and afflicted sadly for his child, that
from his infancy had bin tormented miserably
by a Devil, for which having sought help every
way, but finding none, no not from Christ's
Disciples, at last he repairs to him himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching
him to have compassion on him, and
if he were able to relieve him. To whom Christ
replies that if he could believe, then he could work the miracle,
and help his child, all things being possible to be don for him
that could believe, but nothing otherwise; whereupon strait way
the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, <hi>Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
help thou my unbelief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which words we have, first the necessary Qualification that is
to make all that had ever heard of Christ capable of having any
benefit from Christ, that is belief in him, <hi>I believe.</hi> And since
Christ hath made this qualification absolutely necessary, and by
consequence must be suppos'd to have provided means sufficient to
work in us that belief that he requires so peremtorily, we shall
then</p>
                  <p>In the second place enquire how it comes to pass that they so
often fail; that men do either not believe, or their Faith is so weak
that much unbelief do's mix with it, as in our Confessor here in the
Text, who tho he did profess he did believe, yet withal acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
his unbelief.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly to prevent and remedy all that, here is discovered
whither we are to betake our selves for help, and where alone 'tis
possible to find it, and that is Christ himself, who alone is able to
repair in us whatever degree of true belief is wanting in us, <hi>Lord
help thou my unbelief,</hi> and how he do's repair it.</p>
                  <p>And fourthly when it is repair'd to that due height, what that
degree is can make us capable of those benefits which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to bestow on true Believers; and whether such believers can
say with our man here, <hi>I believe,</hi> yet say too, <hi>Help my unbelief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:40114:98"/>
First of the first, the qualification <hi>believe;</hi> which is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to make men capable of any benefits from Christ. For in all
benefits of this kind the Text mentions, such as were to come by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
'tis well known what S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Matthew</hi> says of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> his own
country, that <hi>he did not many mighty works, there because of their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
c. 13. 58. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Mark</hi> expresses it, that <hi>he could there do no mighty work,
c.</hi> 6. 5. that is, he could not be inclined to work them, so as that he
could or would be willing to do any, <hi>saving that he laid his hands upon
a few sick folk, and healed them.</hi> For tho <hi>signs are not,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> says,
<hi>for believers, but for them that believe not, 1. Cor.</hi> 14. 22. so that infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
seems rather prerequir'd to them than belief, since they are don
on purpose to convince &amp; work men to the Faith, on which account
some were always wrought first where he was not known, to raise
mens opinions and expectations concerning him which if they were
heeded, so that they did work some but beginnings of Belief, he us'd
to add more to encrease that Faith and confirm it. But where the
first Essays were ineffectual, and got no credit, there he did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear;
for such render'd themselves unworthy of them altogether,
Miracles were lost upon them, not attaining that end which they
were intended for: which was not for compassion to their sick to
to heal, or their dead to raise them, for then, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Chrysostome</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
he would have cur'd or rais'd them all; but was for their
Conviction, to make faith of the Divinity of his Person and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and prevail with them to give themselves up to him, as to
the <hi>Messiah:</hi> and therefore all those who by the knowledg or the
fame of his great works were drawn to come to him for help, he
still requires profession of the faith they had concerning him, and
just according to the measures of that faith so he dispenses aid.
Thus <hi>Matt.</hi> 9. 28. the blind men that cried after him and followed
him for sight, he asks, <hi>believe ye that I am able to do this?</hi> and when
they affirm'd, <hi>yea Lord,</hi> he yeilds no more but this, <hi>according to your
faith be it unto you, v.</hi> 29. But when the <hi>Canaanitish</hi> woman did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
even to importunacy and trouble, and her faith was such as
would neither be shaken nor receive repulse, but was full proof
against Christ's arguments and his seeming reproches, yea made
use of his upbraidings, urg'd them to her own advantage, and in
spight of all resistance persever'd, Christ could not then contain,
but cried, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou
wilt, Matt.</hi> 15. 28. And on the other side, as while <hi>Peter's</hi> courage
seeing Christ his master walking towards them upon the water made
him desire to meet him on the water too, accordingly it suited:
while he did resolvedly obey his Master and rely on his assistance
that commanded him, he was sustain'd, that confidence did buoy
him up: but when a turbulent strong wind once shook his faith,
when he began to fear and then to doubt, immediatly he sunk,
<hi>Matt.</hi> 14. 30. And all the reason in the world, that when he doubted
whether Christ would or were able to uphold him in obeying him, tho
he had present experiment of both, he should be then left to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
when in the height of the success and the securities of miracles
he was afraid and stagger'd: since 'twas the whole design of miracles,
and by consequence of that, to work faith, and it is the very essence
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40114:99"/>
also of faith to assure us of God's power and his readiness to perform
whatever he hath promis'd howsoever difficult. It was this very faith
that gave denomination and acceptance to the Father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
for when <hi>Abraham</hi> was bid to offer up that Son in whom he had
receiv'd the promises that he should be the Father of many Nations,
that faith by which against hope he believ'd in hope, that it would
come to pass, and staggering not, consider'd neither difficulty, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
natural impossibility of what was promis'd, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> nor was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to satisfy himself, or indeed examin how it should or could be,
as if he would model God's performances or his own expectation
by the measuress of his comprehension of the means and method;
but accounting <hi>God was able,</hi> if all other methods fail'd, <hi>to raise
him up from death,</hi> altho he had no instance of that power, <hi>Heb. 11. 19.
and being fully perswaded that what he had promised, he was able also
to perform, therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness, Rom.</hi> 4.
21, 22. Now as this faith that God was able, was that faith which
made <hi>Abraham</hi> approved; and the like faith in Christ we see was
that which made them capable of his miraculous assistances: so
(those cures and miracles being emblems, and indeed pledges of
that greater cure, that far more comprehensive miracle he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took,
and came to work on mankind; the healing of their bodies
not onely shadowing out the healing of their souls, but also restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sight to the blind, movement to the lame, and the like
being partial essaies of that Resurrection which he promis'd, that
was to restore all those to all, at once giving life to the dead) the
like assurance of his power and readiness to do all this, together
with a full trust in him, that whatever difficulties we encounter or
imagin, yet in the performance of his promises he will never fail
those who seek after, and pursue them in the ways that he hath
chalk'd out to arrive at them. This faith, I say, is the first quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
that can make us capable of benefit by him: indeed as 'tis
the first, so 'tis the most intimate, and onely active Principle of all
Obedience, Religion, and Virtue.</p>
                  <p>For when all impressions both of God himself, of good and evil,
and their after-recompence were defac'd, and tho the lineaments
of these things were wrought into men in their making, and the
study of Philosophy had refresh'd the dying images, yet an inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of corruption and debauchery had overspread all, so far as
that Almighty God did think it needful that his Son should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnated
to revele again our duty and teach virtue, and to give us
an example of it in his practice, even in the most severe and fatal
instances, and after having suffer'd for it, and by that means ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som'd
us from suffering for transgressing of our duty, then to rise
again and ascend into Glory to assure the blessed recompences of
Religion and Obedience, and the infinitely miserable returns of
impiety and vice; if after all we either shall so far abhor the duty,
as that we renounce these glorious obligations to it, turn away from
the very proposal of all those advantages that are to crown it, and
defy that ransom paid for them, disbelieve all, count them dreams,
cheats or illusions: or however, if we cannot satisfy our selves that
those rewards or punishments are possible or likely, certainly 'tis
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40114:99"/>
most impossible there can be a temtation of force to invite men to
Religion or to any virtue: this method of proposal of such
infinite after-recompences to our faith demonstrated by such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
to evince the power and their certainty, being the most vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
struggle of Divine Compassion towards man, the utmost at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temt
of mercy, which alone was hopeful since all others fail'd the
tryal, 'twas his greatest strength apportion'd to the full-grown
wickedness of the World.</p>
                  <p>At first in one thousand six hundred years from innocence the
whole World was grown so bad, that God could find out but one
whole family to save alive; &amp; he destroy'd the rest for warning to all
future generations: &amp; yet in less than a quarter of that time imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
ensuing there was again onely one family, that of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
which out of all the World he could think fit to take into his favor
&amp; his care. In whose Posterity, altho he exercis'd them with strange
prodigies of sufferings and reliefs, and in the midst of Miracles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
his Law to them, train'd them up in that by all arts of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and rewards, kept them as it were in constant discipline with
present visible returns of plagues and death for every act of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
so that the whole sacred History is nothing but a recurrent
Tide of God's mercy, and <hi>Israels</hi> provocations, their sin and his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
it. When famin, pestilence and war, all the separations
which might be expected from the furnace of affliction, were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ineffectual, and the People were so settled on their lees, that all
attempts to purify onely fretted and disturb'd, and it was necessary
to rack them from those lees, and <hi>emty them from vessel to vessel,</hi> so
that the Nation was carried captive into <hi>Babylon.</hi> Even this dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of seventy years together had no more prosperous effect, than
the preceeding frustrate methods; the return of the captivity
brought also back the former disobedience and infidelity. And
<hi>when the fulness of time was come,</hi> that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should appear, <hi>and
restore all things, Matt.</hi> 17. 11. he came, as the Baptist call'd it, to
a <hi>generation of vipers, Matt. 3. 7. When the light shone in darkness, the
darkness comprehended it not. When he came unto his own, his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him not, John</hi> 1. 5, 11. So that, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke</hi> expresses it, <hi>When
the Son of man came, he did not find faith in the earth.</hi> Where the
fairest steps were made to belief, 'twas exceedingly faint and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect;
his very disciples were <hi>of little faith,</hi> as our Savior Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
<hi>Matt.</hi> 6. 30.—8. 26.—14. 31.—16. 8. Nor was this frailty
superseded in the more establish'd growth of Christianity. Tho we
hear in the book of <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>multitudes of them that believed c.</hi> 4. 32.
yet we hear also of some that oppos'd themselves, <hi>contradicted, and
blasphemed, c.</hi> 13. 45. others there were who <hi>made shipwrack of the
faith 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 19. and of others that <hi>doubted,</hi> and were <hi>wavering,</hi>
and <hi>weak in faith, Rom.</hi> 14. And so it is to this day: what S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi>
said to the <hi>Corinthians 1 Epist.</hi> 3. 1, 2. every Preacher of the Gospel
has to say unto the greatest part of his flock, <hi>I, Brethren, could not
speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in
Christ. I have fed you with milk and not with meat, for hitherto ye were
not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</hi> The Christian flock
more partakes of the folly and weakness of sheep, than the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40114:100"/>
The faces of both tend to the earth, intent on their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
where they may range and feed with plenty and delight. In
the greatest part of Professors with their faith there is mix'd unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
so as sometimes to preponderate, for the most part to alloy
and weaken it.</p>
                  <p>And here I promise not to prosecute those grounds of unbelief so
far, as to shew how they make men able to resist and conquer all
Christ's methods, how they work them up into the confidence of
profest infidelity and Atheism; that's not my design, but plainly
and in brief to name some causes of it, not in this or the other party
or perswasion, but in general, even in minds not ill dispos'd, but
such as our Confessor here in the Text, who tho he do's profess he
did believe, yet withal acknowledges his unbelief, <hi>Lord help my
unbelief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now tho it should be granted that the motives and the means of
Christian Faith are of themselves sufficient to convince the minds
of men, that the Revelations of the Gospel are from God, so far as
that there can remain no place for any reasonable doubt or scruple,
nor by consequence plea for excusing them who give not up their
faith to it; yet notwithstanding all this evidence arising from those
means and motives, still many of the things to be believ'd are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident,
for they are Mysteries, and are wrapt up in such obscurity
that they astonish and affright apprehension, and while the mind is
swallowed up in the abyss of such dark contemplations, whatever
light strikes in from motives, yet the mind is maz'd so, that, if it
assent, it cannot be without suspition and some fear and tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously:
and difficulties often so distract the understanding, that it
cannot settle, but is loose and wavering.</p>
                  <p>Now as in the contests that often happen in us betwixt the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
interests and pleasures of this world and the eternal blessednesses
of the next, in those that are sincerely satisfied of the real infinite
disproportion betwixt them, yet if any present object that does flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
appetite with strong delight or other satisfaction, chance but to
surprise a man so far as that his present whole attention be engag'd
upon it, and it be not call'd off, nor the will apply the understanding
to consider and compare the other interests, the everlasting ones,
and weigh them both together, 'tis certain he will yield against his
conscience to satisfy his sinful inclination; for to that his surpris'd
appetite apply'd him, &amp; that application did determine him; there
being no way to resist the forcible assaults of present things that
strike the mind with vigor, if the will (some way excited) do not
frequently engage the understanding to contemplate on, advert to
with intenseness, even with all its might those blessednesses which
God's promises propose to our belief, that so the mind by reason of
its constant conversation with them may not fail to call them up on
all occasions, and bring them into the comparison, and vie with
any present thing that do's allure, and then those will preponderate
without fail. So in the other Objects of our Faith, the Mysteries,
and generally in all Objects whatsoever, where the understanding
do's not reach the nature, so as to discern and look into the truth
of them, if there be arguments that make a fair shew and flatter
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40114:100"/>
natural reason by complying with its principles, which opposes
that truth, and with their difficulties maze and appale the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
its assent cannot be setled firmly on the truth, unless the
will cause the understanding to busy and apply it self so to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and motives of its credibility, that it find a principle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to bottom its perswasion, such as that it can compare with,
and oppose to those objections, and find reason to adhere to it
against them, such as this, <hi>God hath said it:</hi> so that altho on one
side subtle reasonings seem to commit a rape upon my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and against belief almost force my assent, yet on the other
side God's own autority, of which I have no cause to doubt, (if I
advert sincerely to the motives of its credibility, for we suppos'd
that) is of strength sufficient to secure my faith, and will never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to faint at such objections, as I know arise onely from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and want of principles to judg by, and from the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility
of the Object. Now if the will do constantly engage the
understanding thus by frequent application to such principles, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
reason, howsoever apt to be rebellious, will be easily subdu'd
and brought into captivity to the obedience of faith and our belief,
will be unshaken; so that the will is justly said to have a signal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in, and influence on our faith. To make which good I might
produce Councils and Schoolmen, but it shall suffice me that the
Scripture says, that <hi>with the heart man believeth unto righteousness,
Rom.</hi> 10. 10. and 'tis requir'd that man <hi>believe with all his heart,
Acts</hi> 8. 37. and it is call'd <hi>an evil heart of unbelief in departing from
the living God, Heb.</hi> 3. 12. and for that reason to believe is amongst
God's precepts, Faith is strictly commanded, and a great blessed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
propos'd to it, and Infidelity is threatned with eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Now commands, rewards and punishments are such things
as cannot be propos'd but to the will, and are not at all made to
move the understanding, which must needs assent exactly as it
judges, and must judge according to appearances of objects; and
you may as well desire a stone to fall up to heaven, or the Senses
to perceive that which they have no sense of, as the understanding
to believe against its judgment, or to judge in contradiction to
what appears to it. Now this being granted, that the heart hath
such a vital influence upon our Faith, and that the will contributes
so much to believing, by prevailing with the understanding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
on, and frequently converse with, and with great adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
attend to those Divine and Heavenly objects and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to believe them: it does therefore follow</p>
                  <p>Secondly that whatsoever does engage the heart and take the
will off so, as that they do not cause this application of mind, that
must needs weaken and enfeeble Faith;for it withdraws that that
should nourish and give vigor to it, and makes way for unbelief.
Now here alas, if I should onely name the several impediments
upon this account, the avocations of the heart, it would be endless.
But to say nothing of particulars, whose state of life either thro the
necessities of their condition or the troubles of it, or thro a disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
uneasy temperament of body, or diseases, tho all or each of
these may keep the mind almost in a perpetual disturbance, or at
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40114:101"/>
least in great inaptitude to such Spiritual application, if there be
not strict watch kept to seize all lucid intervals. But to pass these,
and onely touch at two Occasions in the general. And the</p>
                  <p>First is the understanding, which if it be apt to be religiously
scrupulous in little things, as for the most part scruples rise about
such onely, whether thro weakness of judgment, credulity, and
either little probabilities that work upon that, or the arts of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
Teachers, or else especially which is most consequent upon
any close affliction, scruples rise thro applications of God's judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or interpretation of the incomprehensible procedures of his
providence, if these scruples come to work the understanding, so
as that it usually entertains the will with no proposals else, which
happens very frequently, and if it does thus even till the will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
it self in these its self-tormentings, and engages the whole
man in a continual converse with them; so that he comes to love to
aggravate his fears against himself, and wilfully retains them, and
dwells on them, will not be diverted from such thoughts, which do
not onely with these their invenom'd darts stab and wound the
mind perpetually, and the poyson of them drinks up his spirits,
but they wound his Faith. As when those scruples are in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and grown strong, they use to break out into blasphemies and
desperation: so all less degrees also in their proportion raise doubts
in men, not as to their own condition onely, but God's Attributes,
and works, and dealings with mankind, which corrupt and ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and poyson their belief, and it becomes languid, feeble and
unsteady.</p>
                  <p>But secondly that which universally takes off the heart or will
from causing this so necessary application to the objects and the
motives of our Faith, is the lower appetite with its passions. For in
man's life that is so perfectly dramatic, and in which the world is
always shifting scenes, there happens such an infinite variety of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prosperous delightful, or cross sad accidents, which so goad
and stimulate the affections, raise such ebullitions in the bloud,
and such impetuousness in the motions of the appetite, that the
will is hurried along with them with a blind precipitation and a
headlong fury; and by consequence it fares so with the faculties
upon the satisfactions of those appetites. Now in this rout and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
'tis not possible the understanding can attend to Spiritual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
and if this happen frequently, then thus it being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
diverted, and its conversation with affairs of Faith much
broken off, seldom reflecting on them, and so being very unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to those thoughts, all the impressions grow faint, languish
and decay, the motives have no force, and consequently the belief
it self is loose, and scarce hath the assurance of a thin opinion, if it
were examin'd: and of all this the experience is so dreadful, that
we daily see, if men go on so far as to indulge their appetites habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
that their minds being thereby taken altogether off from
the other contemplations, they come to have no love to them, no
regard at all, cannot well endure to think or hear of them; and
are therefore given up by God's just judgment, such as was foretold
long since 2 <hi>Thess. 2. 10, 11. to strong delusions to believe a lie,</hi> even a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40114:101"/>
lie of that eternal dismal consequence that virtue and religion and
the blessed expectation of it are mere trumpery, and renounce
those truths whereby they should be saved.</p>
                  <p>But I promis'd not to prosecute this to that height; it sufficeth we
having seen how the heart being by such means engag'd, and
ceasing to employ the understanding upon heavenly things and on
the motives to believe them, and the faith of them do's come to
lose all vigor, not to be recover'd if there be not some assistance to
the will, that may be able to take off that ravenous inclination
which it hath to present satisfactions, and that gross torpid stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it labors under towards future things, and withal excite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
it with desires after that <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight
of glory,</hi> and besides remove all those other impediments of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
which I have mention'd. Which assistance from what hand it
is to be expected, and how it effects all that, I must declare in the
third place from those words, <hi>Lord, help thou my unbelief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that the birth and growth and strength of Faith (that
Faith, I say, that is effectual to salvation) is all from God, from
the preventing and assisting graces of his Spirit, is a Doctrine which
the Scripture is abundant in. <hi>It is the gift of God, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> saith
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. and Christ says, <hi>No man can come to me,</hi> that is, believe in
me, <hi>except the Father which has sent me, draw him</hi> John 6. 44. <hi>i. e.</hi>
those preparations of the heart by which men are dispos'd to come
at God's call and receive his Gospel, when as others whom 'tis
equally propos'd to, and who alike understand it, will not come,
are the effects of his good grace; and in that respect such are said to
be <hi>drawn by the Father,</hi> and to be <hi>taught of God,</hi> verse 45. and <hi>v.</hi> 64.
speaking to his Followers, and telling them that <hi>there are some of
you that believe not,</hi> tho they had all the methods of conviction,
having heard his preaching, seen his miracles as well as others; yet
some of them notwithstanding not believing, he adds, <hi>v. 65. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I said unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it be given
him of my Father.</hi> All the other means and motives, if alone, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
not. <hi>I have planted, Apollos watered; but 'tis God that giveth
the increase, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 6. I need not say this is the Doctrine of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> 'tis so of the <hi>Latin</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and
on this account of the necessity of Grace and the assistance of God's
Spirit in believing, the whole Church of Christ hath universally
maintain'd a war against <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his Followers. 'Tis more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to shew what he doth, and how he does proceed in doing it,
how he removes those hindrances of Faith I mention'd in each fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
both of the will and understanding.</p>
                  <p>First as to the understanding, that he doth enlighten and clear
it into the discerning of those Heavenly truths, appears, since <hi>David</hi>
therefore prays, <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold the wondrous
things of thy Law,</hi> Psalm 119. 18. and the like <hi>v. 27. Make me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the way of thy precepts.</hi> It should seem he apprehended
wonderful miraculous dispensations in God's discoveries of himself
and of his will to man, besides those of his nature, his transcendent
goodness also in the pardoning our sins, in giving us such excellent
Precepts, in assisting us to the performance, in accepting our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40114:102"/>
Obedience, and in preparing everlasting blessed Glory to
reward and crown it. Now that he might discern all these so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
as to be ravish'd and transported with them, so as that he might
be wrought on to adore the blessed Donor of all these, and cling to
him and them with the close and inseparable unions of Faith and
love; he therefore prays that God would open his eyes, enlighten
and remove all those degrees of darkness that remain'd within him,
quicken and enliven all his faculties, give him a vital sense and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
of all those things, make him understand them, that believing
them he might adhere to them. And since the Scripture says (I
told you) that <hi>with the heart man believeth unto righteousness,</hi> so it
also therefore says that God does <hi>give an heart to understand,
Deut.</hi> 29. 4. and <hi>the Lord opened Lydia's heart, that she attended to
the things that were spoken,</hi> Acts 16. 14. thus preventing unbelief,
which comes for want of such advertency, as I shew'd you.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Will (which hath its influence, I prov'd to you)
that <hi>God works in us to will,</hi> is express Scripture <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. And if we
should but onely put the understanding in that case, wherein, as we
before demonstrated, 'tis needful that the Will engage it to make
applications to these Spiritual objects, when the man is not as yet
byassed or corrupted, but is onely languid and indifferent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd,
yet then there is an absolute necessity the Spirit cause
it: for if the Will be it self a faculty indifferent and free, there
must be some prevenient proposal, thought, or motion, that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin
or fix it; and to will what it ought, it therefore must have
some good motion or proposal, such as will prevail with it. Now
such proposals and motions come not from it self, the Will does
not propose to it self, it cannot think or make the motion, and the
Understanding, which, as the case is put, does need a resolution of
the will thus to engage it, is not therefore qualified to make the
motion sufficient and of force; for then it could and would apply
it self without the Will's engaging of it: much less is it qualified,
when the Will drawn in by the affections of the lower Appetite hath
applied the Understanding, as I shew'd you, to converse with sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
objects, and by doing so 'tis altogether stein'd with their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
and images, and hath few others to excite or entertain
it self withal. In neither case, since neither Understanding nor
the Will is able, there is nothing therefore but God's grace that do's
it by presenting objects and occasions, and disposing circumstances
so in soft and congruous seasons, as with the assistance of his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadowing
and incubating on them, may be sure to hatch some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
and desires that way in the Understanding and Will
both. He does all by these means upon all occasions of Divine
truth heard, or read, or meditated on, by his applying intimately
to the mind the motives of believing, and to help the evidence by
breaking in upon it with his own illuminations, which discover to
the Soul the beauty of God's promises, make it see how infinitely
advantageous they are to it. Thus he fills it with those beauteous
images, then backs the thoughts with their allurements, so as that
they love to hover and to dwell upon them; this animates them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
chearful practice of all performances that tend to them: then
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40114:102"/>
he scatters as it were some gleams of future glory, shedding flashes
of it in the joys of Conscience arising from the sense both of God's
encouragements and assistances to duty, and of the delights result<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the faithful, sincere practice of it: and by this joy quieting
the Conscience, if it either raise fears from the apprehension of
God's dealings in these outward things, or else if it be scrupulous in
little things to the disturbance of his Faith, as I declar'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
it that conscience is not to accuse or else excuse but by the
measures of sincerity or insincerity in known real duty, not from the
events or dispensations of God's providence on one side, nor on the
other, in little things wherein there is no Law to guide us, and which
onely prejudice or seduction can make doubtful, assuring us <hi>the
Kingdom of God is not meat and drink,</hi> indifferent rites, <hi>but righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> Rom. 14. 17. Thus, as
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> says <hi>Heb. 6. 4. they that have tasted of the heavenly gift,</hi> the
comfort of the pardon of their sins, and consequent to that the
peace of Conscience, and <hi>v. 5. tasted of the good word of God, and of
the powers of the world to come,</hi> have intimate experimental relish of
the Gospel-promises; those powers of heaven, those omnipotent
forces God hath prepar'd <hi>to cast down</hi> every reasoning or <hi>imagination</hi>
that should rise against the Christian Doctrine, and <hi>bring every
thought to the obedience</hi> of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. All which are said to
be effected there in them who had bin <hi>made partakers of the Holy
Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By these means therefore he enflames the Will, sets it all on fire
with ardent love to God and his rewards, and consequently to his
service in all the works of Piety and Virtue, and endued with firm
and setled resolutions of adhering to him in faithful constant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of all this. And thus Christ by his Spirit, as he was the <hi>Author,</hi>
the Beginner <hi>of the faith,</hi> by which he is stil'd <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. so by the
same he is the <hi>Finisher</hi> and the completer of it.</p>
                  <p>He was the Author, as that Testimony which the Spirit gave by
miracles, did evince the infallible certainty and the Divinity of the
doctrine to the world; for the <hi>Spirit</hi> is said to <hi>bear witness</hi> to it by
those signs and wonders <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. and those signs are called the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of the Spirit, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 4. that which did irrefragably
prove and demonstrate all the Doctrine of the Gospel, and make
certain Faith of it; and in this sense it is that Faith is truly said to
be resolv'd into the testimony of the Spirit. So also by the same
he is the Finisher, by the graces, the preventings and excitings,
overshadowings and assistings of that Spirit working in us, as we
shew'd, a firm sincere adherence to that Faith, and the obedience
of it; which when it is wrought, Faith hath attain'd that height,
and in that degree, that is to make us capable of those benefits
which Christ hath promis'd to bestow on true believers. The last
thing I was to shew, and withal whether such Believers in that true
degree can say with our man here, <hi>Lord, I believe,</hi> yet say too, <hi>help
my unbelief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Faith, as the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> does define it, is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the
<hi>principle of cleaving to God,</hi> that which knits &amp; joints us to him: and
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> saith as much, when he makes the formality of an evil heart
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40114:103"/>
of unbelief to consist in <hi>departing from the living God;</hi> and to Faith
<hi>by which the just must live,</hi> opposes <hi>drawing back,</hi> slinking away for
fear of danger or affliction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38. So that according as that
cleaving and adherency must be firm and indissoluble, so we are
to judge of Faith.</p>
                  <p>But secondly 'tis certain this adherency must be without wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
<hi>James 1. 6, 7. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering; for
let not that man</hi> (him that wavers) <hi>think that he shall receive any
thing at the hands of God.</hi> A firm and infallible assurance of God's
promises, a confident expectation of a grant to his petitions, tho
the power of Praier be almost omnipotent on that account, <hi>What
things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and
ye shall have them,</hi> Mark 11. 24. yet those are not meant by Faith
here; for the person that is bid not to expect a grant is here sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to think and to be confident he shall receive it, but the Praier
here spoken to is for wisdom, how to behave ones self in times of
chance and danger or affliction for the truth's sake, in these <hi>trials</hi>
of his <hi>Faith, v.</hi> 3. Now that he may obtain that wisdom, he is bid
to <hi>ask</hi> for it of God, but he is also bid to <hi>ask</hi> it <hi>in faith, nothing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
i. e.</hi> he must come to God for it with firm adherence to him,
with dependance on him onely, and a mind resolv'd, whatever
happens, to stick fast to him and his commands and methods, not to
labor or accept deliverance on terms not allow'd by God and a
good Conscience, must not waver betwixt duty and security, nor
be double minded, so as to apply now to Christ and Religion,
now to worldly carnal politics. Such <hi>double minded</hi> men that have a
mind to God and their duty, but a mind also to safety, interest,
or some other satisfaction, <hi>are unstable,</hi> are divided betwixt two,
not knowing which to turn to, now taking one, now the other, do
not stick to God, they are not faithful. It is not sound Faith, where
there is not a resolv'd and setled cleaving; such false-hearted wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
ulcerates and gangrenes all.</p>
                  <p>But then thirdly, where there is that firm, sincere adherency to
God and duty with such a dependance on him, there is Faith that
is effectual to the ends of Faith; for this is true Faith, that works
and is consummated by love, and that begets an efficacious Hope,
by that <hi>hope</hi> works out the <hi>purifying of our selves as God is pure,</hi> and
consequently does entitle us to <hi>see God, i. e.</hi> to the beatifick Vision.</p>
                  <p>I know there are some, who besides this certainty of <hi>adherence</hi> do
require an absolute certainty of <hi>evidence,</hi> affirming there is no true
Faith, but such as stands on a clear resolution into Principles more
evident and certain, than those Propositions are which are made
out to us by Demonstration, than any Principles of Sciences, which
Principles since they are more necessary than that first one, <hi>that
which is, is,</hi> and the contrary to them more impossible, than for
the same thing that is to be and not to be at the same time while it
is: by consequence they cannot but infuse greater necessity and
certainty into our Faith, than there is in the knowledg of those
Propositions; so that 'tis impossible for him, that is a true Believer,
to say, <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall not put it to the question, whether the Rule of Faith be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40114:103"/>
firm and immovable, or the Principle which true Belief must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
into, is most infallible and necessary: for all those which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
their Faith into God's Revelation, and that make his Word
the Rule, must needs assert all that; and where it is affirm'd, that
the motives laid in second Causes by God's Providence to perswade
men to embrace the faith, must be such as of their own nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fail to conclude points true, if they mean they cannot chuse
but be sufficient to conclude that they are such as ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that is assented to as true, I shall allow it; yea so far and in
that manner as God intended that they should conclude, that is by
the assistant grace and influence of his Holy Spirit, so far in that
manner I will grant they could not fail to be conclusive. But that
God intended they should be conclusive to us themselves with the
evidence of such Metaphysical necessity, so that by consequence
they cannot but infuse a greater certainty and evidence into that
assent that must be given to the points of Faith, than there is in the
Science of those Propositions that are first in Science; and where
there is not such necessity, certainty and evidence raised by clear
resolution into Principles more evident, certain and necessary than
those are, there is not that Faith wich is alone, is true; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that all true Faith must assent with the highest evidence,
necessity and certainty. This, I say, may be granted, when it
shall be made appear how it is possible that God can variously deal
to men the measure of Faith, if every true Believer must needs have
the greatest fullest measure; or how any man that hath Faith, and
by consequence is certain most infallibly, can be weak in Faith, or
have his Faith increase, so as that it may grow exceedingly and
wax very strong, even till it come to full assurance and plerophory:
how all this, I say, is not impossible, if all true Faith have essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
this plerophory, that highest, most infallible certainty and
evidence. But it is certain that God variously deales <hi>the measure of
faith,</hi> Rom. 12. 3. that there are those who have Faith, and yet are
<hi>weak in faith,</hi> Rom. 4. 19.—14. 1. that have their <hi>faith increased,</hi>
Luke 17. 5. so as that it does <hi>grow exceedingly,</hi> 2 Thess. 1. 3. <hi>wax</hi>
very <hi>strong,</hi> Rom. 4. 20. even to <hi>a full assurance,</hi> Heb. 10. 22. Is it
not therefore certain, but that he that hath true Faith may say
here with our Confessor, <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover if those Principles and motives blaz'd with such an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
so bright a lustre, of so cogent a necessity, can any man
believe that God would think it needful to arm that necessity with
strict precepts, fortify it with the aids of his own Holy Spirit, and
eternally reward Obedience to a most invincible necessity? Dare
any man imagin God could be so sportive in commanding, as on
pain of everlasting torment to engage us to believe, that that
which is existent is existent, or that the Sun does shine at bright
noon-day, when we behold it so as that we cannot see it, ('tis our
Author's own instance?) or to assent to these must there be the
graces and assistance of the Holy Ghost? or to believe the Sun
shines, when it does, is that a Faith that is fit to be rewarded with
eternal light and glory? In fine, since that the onely certainty of
Faith wich is effectual to the ends of Faith, is the certainty and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40114:104"/>
firmness of adherency to God and Christ, and to our duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which all other certainty, however infallible, can but help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our condemnation; and since where the Holy Spirit and his
Graces intervene not, howsoever evident men fancy that their
principles and motives are, their way of resolution demonstrative,
there will be no true Faith; and where he works with his Graces,
tho they were not so infallible and bright, yet the adherency is
firm, the Faith true and saving. Therefore there appears no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
necessity of such pompous principles and ways of resolution of
our Faith. For I would onely ask, for whose sake, and on whose
account it is so needful that these motives, principles and ways of
resolution should be so infallibly certain, evident and necessary?
Those that do embrace the Faith sincerely and are saved, or those
that do not give their hearts up to it, and so perish in their unbelief?
As to these, since besides all arguments internal to the doctrine,
outward testimony, (the onely argument in matter of fact) and
that in behalf of Christians, it is far greater and more pregnant
than there is for any other fact that ever was, such as humanely
speaking, is impossible not to be true; nor could there ever yet be
found a rational exception or just ground of doubt against it: so
that 'tis impossible but they must be convinc't in reason, that 'tis
most irrational not to assent. Those therefore that do wilfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
their understandings and their reason, and withal God's ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
methods of conviction, and so put a bar against his Graces and
his Spirit, since much more than was enough was don for them,
they are without excuse; and since they did defy what was more
than sufficient in it self, and so resist God's methods also, there is
no pretence or reason for more helps of evidence on their account.
As for the other, those that give themselves up to the guidance of
their light and reason and Almighty God's convictions, and are
made Partakers of the Holy Ghost, 'tis most certain that his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
will do all that is needful to complete their Faith, and make it
certain to salvation; so that there is no need on their behalf of
such self evidence of principles and motives to infuse such metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
certainty into their Faith. And yet this certainty of Faith not
onely is the ground on which alone is built Infallibility, wherever
that is to be placed, for they are not agreed about it and indeed
there were no great need to assure their Faith into such certainty;
but besides poor we, because we do not take upon us to assert do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gmatically
the necessity of such most infallible certainty, not onely
are unchurch'd, but unchristen'd, concluded beyond all possibility
of evasion, not to have true Faith, nor be truly Faithful. An
heavy imputation: therefore I crave leave a little to consider it in
one word, not desiring to reflect on others, but to justify our selves;
for in truth God knows, we would as willingly go to Heaven as our
Neighbors, where we know we cannot be receiv'd without true
Faith.</p>
                  <p>Now tho it looks unlucky that we should be doom'd thus upon
grounds, of which the Founder is himself under censure for them,
and his books that laid them, damn'd even by his own Church, tho
we are by vertue of their Principles condemn'd as Hereticks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40114:104"/>
we come not into their Church which condemns the Founder
of these very Principles on their account; yet since however any
thing does serve their turns, provided it condemns us, 'tis not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be passed by. Now the ground not onely of their Faith,
but this their Confidence, whereby they so exalt themselves and
censure us, is the absolute certainty of the living voice and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of that Church, which resolves her Faith by this Rule or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
not to believe, or teach, or practise any thing as of Faith
but what they did receive from their immediate Forefathers as of
Faith, and saw their practice of. For if this Principle were their
Rule always, (and if it be now, it must, they say, have bin so)
then the Faith of each succeeding Age must needs have bin the
Faith of the preceding, and by consequence there having bin no
change, the Faith of this Age must needs be the same with that of
Christ and his Apostles. Now since in the resolution of our Faith
we proceed not by this Rule, upon this Principle we have no Rule
of faith, nor certain resolution of it, and by consequence no Faith.
Now it appears at first sight fully evident that this Rule of theirs
does supersede and quite evacuate those Doctrines that maintain
either the sayings of the Fathers, or Decrees of Councils, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions
of the Popes, or the infallible Autority of the Church,
whatever that Church signify, hath any part or interest in the Rule
of faith, and very justly so: for Fathers are but eminent Members
of the Church, Popes can pretend to be but Heads of that Church,
Councils but the Representatives, and what infallible Autority so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
can be in the Church, that Church being the Congregation of
the Faithful, and those onely being Faithful that hold the true
Faith: therefore till it be known which is the true Faith, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be known who are the ture Faithful, nor by consequence which
is the Church, nor therefore which is Head, Member, or Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of it, or hath that Autority: and therefore before all, those men
must have a Rule for their Faith, whereby they may try which is
the true. But when we say we have God's own Revelation of his
will what he would have to be believ'd, his Word, the Scriptures,
they add that since we cannot know which is the Scripture but by
the continued testimony of those that recommended it from the
beginning, neither can that be the Rule, which needs another
Rule to establish it; nor can that which is believ'd upon that other
Principle of universal testimony be any part of the Rule, since
what is believ'd is the Object of Faith, and so presupposes the Rule
of Faith: and therefore we who make that to be the onely Rule,
have no Rule, no not a part, tho the <hi>Trent</hi> Council do allow the
Scriptures to go shares with Tradition.</p>
                  <p>'Tis easy to reply, that that which is the Object of that Faith,
whereby we assent to it, as a book written by such inspir'd men, or
as a true historical Narration, of which Testimony does assure us,
may yet be the Rule of that Faith, whereby we assent to Doctrines
as reveal'd from God, which we believe those are, that we find
there recorded. And it were as easy to retort, that if this arguing
were good, men could not know that the Doctrine which Christ
and his Apostles orally deliver'd to them was from God, but by the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40114:105"/>
testimony of the Miracles they taught; therefore neither could
Christ's or the Apostles oral tradition, living voice, be a Rule of
Faith to those Ages, since they were the Objects of belief, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppos'd
those Miracles as the Rule by which men did believe what
Doctrines came from God; nor can the Succession of Doctrine be
the Rule, for we know not the whole Succession but by the living
voice of the present Church, that does deliver Doctrine by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Rule or Principle. But not to reply to this Scholastically, but
suppose for their sakes, that Scripture could be known to be the
word of God no otherwise than by testimony, yet that it might be
the Rule one short familiar instance shall evince irrefragably to the
meanest understanding. We know the Books of Scripture are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
Books of the Old and New Testament, both Scripture it self
and Fathers giving cause for that expression. Now in making a
man's testament, the Testator's last bequests, or that which he last
of all wills, as to the disposal of his goods and possessions, is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
rule, we know, by which they are to be disposed off: and
when that disposition and will of his is put into writing, sign'd and
seal'd, that writing, or that Instrument is secundarily the rule by
which Legacies must be demanded, and upon performance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
the Inheritance entred upon. Now possibly they that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
demand Legacies, or the Executors, yea the Heir indeed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
it may be know not either hand or seal; however that the
writing was in good deed honestly subscrib'd and sealed by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
party, none can know, but who were present, and saw or
heard him declare and publish it: and if any are concern'd to be
assur'd whether it be a true will, neither forg'd nor alter'd or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd,
they can no otherwise be satisfied, than by their testimony.
It is on that account that men give credit to that will, from thence
it is of force, and afterwards continues to be so as to all ends and
uses of a Will, by being witnessed and sworn to, that is, prov'd,
and then enrolled and layd up in an Office for that purpose, and
by that becomes a firm Record, and as such is there conserved.
Now certainly no man is so far destitute of common sence to say
either the Witnesses or their Testimony, or the Office that conserves
the Instrument, or the Clerks and Registers or Judg of that Office
is the Rule by which the man's goods must be distributed, or the
Rule of those things that the Heir or the Excecutors must perform:
for the man's last Will, I shew'd you, was the prime Rule, that Will
put into writing, sign'd and seal'd, that is that Instrument the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
Rule of all that; and the Testimony, Office, Clerks and
Judg are but onely means of bringing that Will to the knowledg of
all such as are concern'd, the way of assuring the truth and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptness
of the Instrument, and of conserving it entire for after
uses.</p>
                  <p>The Application of this to Christ our Savior's Testament is easy.
If by Penmen, which himself inspir'd, he caus'd his last Will in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposing
the Inheritance of Heaven to be written, and what things
he would have believ'd, what don, all which he seal'd with his own,
God's Seal, with Miracles: and if those Penmen and the other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
before whom he declar'd and publish'd it, did attest it, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40114:105"/>
gave it to the Church to be conserv'd there, and her Pastors are
perpetual successive Conservators of the integrity of these Records:
'tis plain our Lord's Will here is primarily the Rule of Faith and
Action, and secondarily the Testament, that authentic Instrument
is so: and the Testimony is no more that Rule here than in the
man's Will, nor yet than the prerogative Office, nor the Pastors or
the Head (if such an one there were) than the Clerks, the Judg
of that Office; nor all, nor any of these are the Rule it self. The
Testimony is but the means of conveying down to us the knowlege
of that Testament, and of the uncorruptness of it; and as far as
that Conveyance and that Testimony is assur'd and certain, so far
they must grant the Faith we give, that that writing is the Rule,
must be assur'd and certain. And since all the means and kinds of
their Tradition make that very Testimony and Conveyance of that
Book, therefore all that certainty and that infallibility their faith
can have from those grounds, the same certainty and infallibility
the faith we give to that Book must needs have too on their own
grounds. But it hath more; for since the ground of all faith must
be testimony, and by consequence none but Divine Testimony can
be ground sufficient for Divine Faith, and that Testimony was, I
shew'd you, Miracles, wrought by the Publisher to confirm the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
both which are in this Rule of ours. Therefore altho that
universal Testimony, all their Tradition for it, which is merely
humane, may be a sufficient method of conveyance to derive all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
as the first men's eyes and ears that saw the Miracles and heard
Christ, tho they be but humane senses, were sufficient to them also,
they suffice not yet to a Divine Belief, they cannot ground that
Faith which must be given to Divine supernatural Doctrines upon a
Divine Testimony, which Tradition is not, but our Rule hath. So
that the resolution of our Faith is made by a Divine Rule, such as
theirs pretends not to be made by; and the mere conveyance of
that Rule to us hath all that certainty and that infallibility, that
they pretend their Rule it self to have, and so we may have Faith,
and may be Christians. But we are never the nearer however: for
if the Rule of Faith, if true, must be a means to make our assent
more infallible than Science upon Demonstration, and there can
be no other such Rule besides the living voice and present practice
of that Church, which does, and always did resolve her Faith into
it by this Principle, not to believe or teach or practise any thing
as of Faith, but what they did receive from their immediate Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
as of Faith, and saw their practice of, which most undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
renders their Faith impossible to be erroneous; therefore we
that owne neither such a resolution, rule or principle, can neither
have true rule nor Faith.</p>
                  <p>But yet how fine soever and self-evident this Principle and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
appear to them as speculators, if it were practically enquir'd
into, it would appear the weakest of all other. For first I might
evince, that ever since the first beginnings of Religion and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
while either they had no other rule at all but this of oral, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
tradition, as in the first times before the Law was given and
Scripture wrote, their faith and practice grew all false and diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40114:106"/>
or when they had another rule, so far as they made use of this
rule, thereby that they did make void their own Faith and God's
Laws, as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> among the <hi>Jews:</hi> or lastly, when they had
not an entire rule written, as in the first Age of Christianity, while
the Scriptures were not spread amongst Believers, but they had the
living and inspir'd voice of the Apostles to resolve their Faith into,
and by that Rule and Principle of oral practical Tradition most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
yet then the most execrable Heresies that ever infested the
Church, had their rise and growth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I might demonstrate their Church did not always so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
their Faith, and by that Principle. Look thro their Councils
all from the beginning, where their Church, sometimes the whole
Church met together, either to confirm the true Faith, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the false, and you shall find no footsteps of this oral, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Tradition, but of doctrinal enough. The Sayings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and Decrees of Former Councils, and the Texts of Scripture,
these they call their Demonstrations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly where there is most need still of a certain rule and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
there this is unpracticable wholly; namely in all great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
of the Church in points of Faith. To instance in the <hi>Arrian</hi>
contentions, where the World was against S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>
against the World, and the Pope himself <hi>Liberius</hi> was then
<hi>Arrian,</hi> who could then hear and distinguish the living voice of the
Church? When the whole East was so universally and bloudily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in the matter of Images, one <hi>Greek</hi> Council defining against
them, and another for it; and the West as much, the <hi>French, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
German</hi> Bishops presently in a great Synod declaring against
them, and the <hi>British</hi> Church particularly. Now I will not ask
how it was possible the greater parts of the whole Church should so
at once have laid aside their infallible self-evident Rule, and
chanc'd together to forget it, should not once bethink themselves
whether they had seen their Forefathers practise that Worship or
no, and heard them teaching that they had received it too from
their Forefathers: nor ask how it was possible their Enimies should
not mind them of it, if it were the Churches rule, and had bin ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
taught and practised, and assure them by their Principle
how impossible that it should be erroneous. But there is not a word
of this in the whole two <hi>Nicene</hi> Councils, but some Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
and some Sayings of the Fathers, which no more evince the
practice, than <hi>Tentordin</hi> steeple does cause <hi>Goodwin</hi> Sands. But I
will ask, how in the noise and the confusion of both States and
Churches, while wars and Anathemas thunder'd in the quarrel,
how it was possible poor souls could hear and distinguish what the
living voice and present practice of that Age was, which was so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
various and contradictory? Those that were then to be
instructed in the Faith, what could they hearken to? How could
they guide themselves by that Rule, when as in their Doctrines
they condemn'd each other, in their practice murder'd one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?
And when each party pleaded that theirs was the Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
to them, which should they believe? The major party.
How should they know infallibly which was? How be assured
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40114:106"/>
the major party is requir'd? Why truth must be on that side where
the most are? What self-evident Rule had they to judge of these
by? Surely none. Accordingly it was not by this Rule, but by
being overpower'd they receiv'd that Faith and practice.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly that it may appear in no case useful in the calmest Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine
of the Church, and when, if ever, they were all of one mind;
namely before <hi>Luther,</hi> when if ever there were any Article that the
<hi>Latin</hi> Church was possessed of an explicit belief of, it was that of
Purgatory, as it is now held amongst them: there was all expresses
of an oral practical Tradition for it, and if there were not, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to know when any Doctrine is receiv'd upon that Principle,
so that the Rule is frivolous as to practice; yet, as if that Principle
had ow'd the very Founder of it a great spight, he must go write a
Book against that Purgatory, which stood by his own Principle,
for which he is under censure by his own Church. But least this
should seem onely an Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> I will urge onely one
instance.</p>
                  <p>There was a time when the immaculate Conception of our Lady
stood by oral practical Tradition, for in the publick Liturgies of
their Church it was expresly own'd and celebrated. For in their
<note n="a" place="margin">See also in the end of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Missal printed at Paris in a large 4<hi rend="sup">0</hi>. in the Praiers at the later end for the Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon the Feast of the Conception, there called Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate. L. Hor. Beat. 6. M. Paris 1534. p. 85.</note> Liturgy printed 1551. after a devout Praier to the B. Virgin there
is added <hi>Ave, Hail Mary, full of grace</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Blessed also be Saint Anne
thy Mother, out of whom thy virgin flesh came without any stain, imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate.</hi>
And again, <hi>Hail</hi> &amp;c. <hi>woman, blessed be thy Mother Anne,
out of whom thou didst proceed a Virgin without any stain or sin.</hi> Once
more in another Praier, <hi>All hail thou most chast Mother of God</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>and blessed be thy Parents Joachim and Anne, out of whom thy virgin
flesh proceeded without stain, immaculate.</hi> The same too was defin'd
expresly in their Oecumenical Council at <hi>Basil</hi> in a session on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
for it <hi>c.</hi> 36. after long debate decreeing that she never had Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
or Actual sin, but was immaculate; and tho the Pope for
other reasons, and not this definition, would not confirm this
Council, yet besides that by the way of oral practical Tradition his
Holiness is declar'd to have but one vote and no negative; yet if his
vote signify, <hi>Alexander</hi> VI. a little after gave ten thousand years of
pardon for all mortal sins, twenty for venial <hi>toties quoties</hi> to all
that said devoutly in that Worship of our Lady and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Anne</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Praier, <hi>Rubr.</hi> Now if the Church did not believe what was
thus in her publick Praiers, in her definitions, which was the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Pastors, of the whole Church Representative, but if som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
else must intervene to prove what is of Faith, the Rule is insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificant,
it is impossible to know their Churches Faith at any time.
But we are bound to think they would not in their Solemn Divine
Worship owne what they did not believe, and they could not believe
any thing by this Rule but what they did receive, and so their Faith
and Practice consequent must have bin always, and must be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.
Yet we know that was defin'd the Doctrine taken up merely
to countenance the Worship that had formerly bin given to the
Blessed Virgin in the celebrating her Conception. For since it
always was the Churches Rule never to solemnize with a Festival
but what they did account was Holy, according to that saying of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40114:107"/>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Epist. 174.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Bernard, quo pacto festus habetur qui minime sanctus est?</hi> And
accordingly the present Church that does still celebrate it, also in
her new Reformed<note n="c" place="margin">In Breviario Monast. Paul. <hi>V.</hi> P. M. auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate recognito vers. ad finem tertiae lectionis in Festo Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptionis ita se ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, <hi>sentiant omnes tuum Juvamen qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brant tuam sanctam Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionem.</hi>
                     </note> Breviaries calls it <hi>Sanctam Conceptionem;</hi>
having therefore entertain'd the Festival, they must needs entertain
the Doctrine. And the forenamed Council does expresly owne this
in defining it <hi>ut consonum cultui Ecclesiastico,</hi> in that it was agreeable
to that Worship which the Church perform'd in the celebration of
it. But if you would know how the Solemnity began, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it from themselves thus. A Canon of a Church in <hi>France</hi>
greatly devoted to the Blessed Virgin, returning home over the large
mouth of the <hi>Seine</hi> in a vessel alone from the other side, where he
had bin committing Adultery with another man's wife, and as he
sail'd singing the Hours of the Blessed Virgin, a great troop of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
drown his vessel &amp; himself in the deep, and his soul they drag'd
away to torments. On the third day, while they were tormenting
him, the Mother of our Lord came thither with a train of Angels,
asking why they did unjustly so torment the soul of her servant?
Whom they answer'd that they had a just right to it, for it was
taken in its being about their employment: she replies, if it ought
to be theirs whose service it was in, then of right it is mine, for you
seiz'd it as he sung my Mattins, so that you are guilty. Upon which
they fled and left it, and the Blessed Virgin brought his soul back
to his body and himself alive to shore, where falling at her feet he
said, <hi>Dear Lady, what shall I render unto thee for so great benefits
that thou hast don unto me?</hi> she replies, <hi>I desire that henceforward thou
commit no more Adultery, least the later end be worse than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
I desire moreover, that thou wouldest devoutly celebrate the Feast
of my Conception yearly on the eighth day of December.</hi> Good Lord!
that singing Mattins to our Lady should attone for him whose
Vespers had bin offer'd up to a foul shrine, to his Paramour, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in the vile Embraces of his Neighbor's Wife? That the
Blessed Virgin should be so concern'd for her own immaculate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
so indifferent, so easy, or indeed indulgent to the gross
Adultery of others? However, as it well became him, he obey'd
her and observ'd it: and upon two other such like visions so did se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
others. But the Worship by all this was onely private mens
particular devotions; therefore there was one more made to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme,</hi>
who immediatly began it in his Priory, and being made
Archbishop afterwards of <hi>Canterbury</hi> made it publick, and then
<hi>Innocent</hi> the III. did so in <hi>France,</hi> and so the Worship became uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
in their publick Services; and to justify that Worship too,
the Doctrine of immaculate Conception was receiv'd into those
Services, and then defin'd in that great Council above mention'd.
Had this but bin in one of the dark Ages, it had certainly prevail'd,
but somthing checking with the doctrin of the whole world that was
more awake then, the Popes afterward, altho they kept the Worship
up, durst not vouch the Doctrin for a point of strict Faith, tho sought
to by two solemn Embassies from two Kings of <hi>Spain, Philip</hi> III.
and IV. Now truly by the equipage, pursuit and carriage of the
business one would think they came to crave an Audience for some
new Faith, as they were wont for any extraordinary grant or dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation:
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40114:107"/>
that at <hi>Rome</hi> they could decree Divinity as they did Acts of
the Conclave, and give out Articles as they did Cardinals Caps, and
make a new Creation for belief; for sure they did not send that
Embassy to enquire whether their own immediat Forefathers had
so taught them, and so forwards that there had bin always a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
succession. But tho that would not do, 'tis evident there was a
doctrinal Point defin'd by the great Representative of their whole
Church, and for some Ages receiv'd with the Devotions and the
Worship of their whole Church, and by consequence into their
Faith; for otherwise they gave Worship upon that account which
they did not believe: and it is also evident to sight, how doctrines
did come in into their Faith upon all least pretence of Visions, (the
known way) some that were devout men began a practice, after
other some in power adopted and gave credit to it, and then gave
autority; by this means the practice in a while grew universal, then
became their Doctrine and their Faith.</p>
                  <p>Now I would know whether it was so, it came along to them by
the way of oral practical Tradition. If it did, 'tis not a sure infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Rule of conveying Faith; if it did not, then that Church did
not still receive their Faith upon that Rule and Principle or by that
method, tho that they did so is their first great Principle: and the
great Master of that Scheme assur'd his Holiness it was not possible
to maintain their doctrine otherwise against the subtlety of the
<hi>English</hi> Hereticks. And truly they that make the greatest noise
amongst us now, are fled to the last hold of it: but that indeed it
does alone protest Infallibility whether of the Church or the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their doctrine by that way of practical Tradition, and that
is the infallible most necessary certainty of Faith. But I shall say
no more to this than what the grand Abettor of the Principle hath
said in answer to himself, objecting what was to be said to them
that could not penetrate into his demonstrations, see the force and
evidence of that Rule and Principle, and yet have that Faith that's
necessary to Salvation, I shall give it you in his own words, as near
as I can put them into <hi>English.</hi> He says, <hi>there is a certainty deriv'd
into the understanding of these men out of their will; for since they think
themselves assur'd these truths were brought down by the Church from
Christ to them, &amp; stand convinc't of that act, this is sufficient to cause their
wills firmly to adhere to them, and by that adherence to repell all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and objections to which curious wits are subjects. And whether
the man see that the Autority of the Church which he follows is of more
force at least to him than particular objections in those truths; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he thinks nothing at all of it, but rests stedfast in that assent which
his very ignorance caus'd, 'tis plain he hath a certainty of will, which in
its way extends it self to the Government of his whole life answerably to
that his perswasion, and by consequence he hath a certainty exclusive of
all doubt, and such as moves him to direct his actions all to God, that is,
there is in him that Faith which worketh by love.</hi> So he. Now hence
'tis evident by his Concessions, first that there may be a saving Faith
which hath not that infallible certainty arising from the motives,
Guide, or Principle, or way of Resolution. And that secondly a
Certainty deriv'd into the Understanding from a Will that is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40114:108"/>
piously dispos'd sufficeth. Thirdly, that there is this certainty,
where the Will firmly cleaves and adheres to God, relying on him
with a vigorous hope and trust, directing all the actions up to God
and to his service, and persevering in it to the life's end. Now this
is all that I am all this while contending for. It is not by self-evident
or demonstrative methods, or by an infallible Guide that
he provides against mens unbelief; but when with preparation,
like our man here in the Text, in weeping earnestly we betake our
selves to him, crying out for help and direction, and applying our
understanding meekly to attend his methods, he disposes piously
the Will to entertain the gracious blessed Proposals of the Gospel
with complacency and heartiness, and from conversing with the
experience of them to prefer them before all worldly carnal things
that used to bait our lusts, ravish our hearts, and carry us away
from God and from our duty: and it is against this <hi>unbelief,</hi> in thus
<hi>departing from the living God,</hi> that his assistances are mainly level'd,
and our Praiers chiefly are to be directed. For 'tis most infinite
madness to perswade and satisfy our selves we are of the true
Church, have the onely true certain Faith, if yet our practices be
such as set us at as great a distance from Almighty God, as Hell is
from Heaven; and while we do commit such things, 'tis as impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
we can adhere to God, as 'tis impossible for Christ to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with <hi>Belial.</hi> It is a Contradiction by ungodly actions to
defy God and turn our backs upon, and depart from him, yet to
cling and adhere to him; 'tis, as I say, a Contradiction to believe
that we have Faith, while we do not cling to, and adhere, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from him. <hi>Lord, help thou</hi> this our <hi>unbelief.</hi> And if his grace
but once dispose us to prefer the blessed expectations of a Christian,
he does easily prevail with us to cling to them with such certain as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances,
as will carry us thro all the stages of our life and duty, with
all chearfulness and constancy. This is that certainty of Faith
by which the Martyrs cleav'd to, and embrac'd at once the Cross
and their Religion, firm in dying as believing; and when with arts
of torment they broke all their joynts and their limbs piece-meal,
scatter'd all their parts asunder, tore their souls out of their bodies,
still they kept their Faith whole, and their Tormentors could not
tear one Article of their belief or Christian practice from them:
and when their Wills were once inflam'd with the desires and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
of God's preparations, then no other martyring flames
could make them shrink. Those seem'd to them but brighter Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
of, and speedier Conveyances to that Eternal Light and
Glory, which their Faith had given them the evidence and the first
vision of: they knew by them they onely did expire into Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Life and Glory.</p>

works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE words have two parts, a command and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it: the command, <hi>Let your light shine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men;</hi> the reason, <hi>That they may see your good
works</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The command affords to us this instruction;
the life of a Christian is to be fruitful and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary.
Both these are commanded not onely in
the command it self, but proved in the reason,
<hi>That they may see your good works:</hi> there must therefore be works,
which are the fruits of virtue. Yea and fruitfulness is every where
requir'd by Christ, and if we look upon the current of Scripture and
our duty, we shall find that it will not serve a Christian's turn not
to bring forth ill fruit, to be onely barren ground, not to have
vices bud and sprout within us and grow with an increase of sin;
but we must do good. In the Parable of the Sower <hi>Matt. 13. 23.
But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the
word and understandeth it, which also beareth fruit, and bringeth
forth some an hundred fold. We are gods Husbandry, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 9. Now
is any of you satisfied with his field, because it plows well and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the seed most kindly, if it bring you no increase or crop,
yield you no harvest? No, saith the Author to the <hi>Hebrews c. 6. 8. such
ground is nigh to cursing.</hi> Why your works they are your crop, your
harvest; and when God shall send forth his Reapers, the Angels, if
they can find no returns of all God's cultivating you, but all his
husbandry, his seedness, and his pains too have bin lost upon you,
no increase, but onely barreness, your end is to be burnt; or onely
tares, they are to be <hi>cast into a furnace of fire, where there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth,</hi> Matt. 13. 42. And in like manner by
the Parable of fruit trees<note n="a" place="margin">Matt. 3. 8, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>John</hi> Baptist, <hi>Bring forth fruits meet for
repentance; for the ax is laid to the root of the trees, therefore every
tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewen down, and cast into the
fire.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> describing his blessed man <hi>Psalm</hi> 1. does it, first
by shewing he does not bring forth ill fruit. But neither will that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40114:109"/>
serve turn to hear and meditate and talk of the word of God, and
not to do it. It is the very same thing as a wilderness upon the
water side, a dead barren tree upon the River's bank. No his
man is <hi>like a tree planted by the rivers of waters, that brings forth his
fruit in due season.</hi> We are God's <hi>Vineyard, Isaiah</hi> 5. and he tells us
there, what pains he hath bestow'd upon us, <hi>v. 2. He fenced it, and
gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest
Vines</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v. 4. What could have bin don more to my Vineyard, that I
have not don unto it?</hi> Now if we do not bring forth grapes, <hi>Go to,</hi>
saith God <hi>v. 5, 6. I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard, I will take
away the hedg thereof, and it shall be eaten up; break down the wall
thereof, and it shall be trodden down. And I will lay it wast, it shall not
be pruned nor digged, but there shall come up briars and thorns: I will
also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</hi> Yea God did
not onely lay wast his Vineyard in that <hi>Isaiah</hi> 5. because it brought
forth sower and wild fruit, but our Savior in the Gospel curst a Fig-tree,
because it brought forth no fruit. And indeed that barren Fig-tree
was the onely thing upon the earth that ever Christ did curse, all
his Miracles were mercies, but that. An unfruitful Christian is such a
thing a Savior hath no mercy for; a mere negative virtue hath so
little claim to Heaven, that it cannot escape the curse of a <hi>Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And shall we apply this, first to the conviction of their opinions,
who think if they lie under no gross customs, if they be not tainted
with any foul commissions, they are then in a safe condition?
What if they forgive no wrong, why they will do none, and so who
shall lay any thing to their charge? Pardon they will not any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
offence, because they avoid the wanting it from others; and
they will not hate nor malice, tho they cannot have the bowels of
of love, no fellowship of Christian kindness: they have no foul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
heats, nor no devout ones; no ardencies of lust, nor yet of
zeal: so they do not blaspheme God by daily oaths, make no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of worshipping him by daily Praiers; and if his holy name be not
in their execrations, 'tis well enough tho he be not in their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
No tho they go a little further, and besides their doing no
gross ills have great Professions of Religion, they have all the
leaves and foliage of a Christian, they make a fair shell of Piety,
take abundance of pains to do all those things that are to stile them
great Professors, plenty of hearing, and abundance of talking,
but no doing: if you search the leaves you find no fruit, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
tenor of good works in every kind of Christian duty; these
are but too obvious stratagems of Satan and our deceitful hearts to
make us satisfy our selves, either with our condition, tho our Piety
look no further than to do no ill, and the positive part of Religion
be altogether unregarded by us; or tho we have no more of it, but
the Profession. O my Brethren, as to these last remember that the
curst Fig-tree had leaves, had fair shew enough to bait our Savior's
hunger, and promise him refreshment, and temt him out of the
way to it: and to the other, hath God autority onely to forbid,
can he command nothing from us? Are we content onely to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from something for his sake, but will not do any thing for his,
nor Heaven's sake? Is not his Worship as dear to him as our lusts
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40114:109"/>
are hurtful to him, and hath he not as much reason to require that
we should be devout and holy, as that we should not be profance and
filthy? Can all his mercies, all his rewards neither procure nor
deserve more of us, than onely not to serve the Devil? Surely, my
Beloved, both these sorts of Christians shall find, that in the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of sins to be accounted for, omissions shall be reckon'd, when
our Savior comes to pass his sentence at the dreadful day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
See the tenor of it,<note n="b" place="margin">Matt. 25. 41, 42.</note> 
                     <hi>Go ye cursed, for when I was hungry, ye
gave me no meat.</hi> 'Tis not ye shall be damn'd because ye stript me,
and because ye starved me, but because ye did not relieve me. And
'tis so in the other, not bringing forth fruit, not doing fills up the
sentence of final malediction.</p>
                  <p>But the sadder conviction of this is for the practice of those that
are nothing but commissions, whose vice is positive, men that
cleanse themselves from holiness, and go on daily perfecting filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
If the man, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. that received the one Talent, and
laid it up safe in a Napkin, and did no ill with, yet because he did
no good, was therefore cast into utter darkness, whither, think you,
had he bin cast, if he had made that Talent the instrument of his
sin, if like the Prodigal he had spent it upon harlots, or upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses?
And whither shall they be doom'd, who do so? If it be
not enough to abstain from sin, what will become of them that do
little else but act it? If not to do pass sentence, how will to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
condemn? and if the half righteous shall not be saved,<note n="c" place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>where
shall the ungodly and sinner appear?</hi> If the tree with leaves, that
was green in foliage be curst, shall not the dry and rotten one be
burnt? Alas for these men, what a long stage of duty have they
to go thro (if they do intend in this life ever to be better) who
have not yet set forth, have entred upon any part; who have not
<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 13. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>cast off the works of darkness,</hi> which yet, when they have don, they
have but half, they must <hi>put on the armor of light,</hi> such too as will
shine: they must be fruitful and exemplary.</p>
                  <p>And this second quality is indeed the great design of this Text,
which hath more force in it than that of a single command; for
the verse is a conclusion following upon the three former. He tells
them that they are <hi>Salt,</hi> and <hi>Sun,</hi> and a <hi>City,</hi> and a <hi>Candle,</hi> things
that are visible or else diffusive of their vertues, and then concludes
<hi>Let your light,</hi> or rather, So let your light, as a candle gives light
unto all that are in the house; So do ye, <hi>Let your light shine he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Light</hi> is set here for Christian Holiness and Purity, as I shall shew
you; and that most fitly, because nothing so pure as Light, clear
as shine and noon-day, nor nothing so diffusive, it shews it self to
all: so that the thing meant by it, is an open visible Holiness of
Conversation.</p>
                  <p>Or secondly more especially to represent the Purity of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Life; Light is so clear, that it is set to express the very Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God himself 1 <hi>John 1. 5. This then is the message which we have
heard of him and declare unto you, that God is Light, and in him is no
darkness at all.</hi> And indeed Light was the very first emanation of
God in the<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note> Creation, he said first, <hi>let there be light.</hi> And it is
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40114:110"/>
the most spiritual and pure of all visible corporeal beings, its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
seem instantaneous, and by a kind of omnipresence it fills the
medium, and appears entire in every part of it: yea farther, it is not
liable to stain or sulliage, sun-shine is as bright upon a Cottage as a
Palace, a dung-hill as a bed of Roses; you may extinguish light,
but not defile it. No expression comes near the clearness of light,
and this our Holiness is to strive after.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, most of all to represent the open visibility of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
virtue. Nothing is so easily seen as Light, for indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be seen but by it: in a moment it will scatter it self over
the whole Hemisphere; yea Heaven it self does not bound the
Sun-shine, and it passes thro the Firmament. Even so diffusive
should our Piety be, shining before men, and like the Sun's light
too spreading into Heaven, shining before Angels, and making
them rejoice. A Christian is not to suffer any man to walk in the
dark either of ignorance or of sin, whom his knowledg or example
may recover; he must instruct and enlighten the mind, he must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and enlighten the will and the affections. His pious actions
must be always shining in his eyes to guide and stir him up, and
every one must be Christ's star to lead to him. <hi>They that be wise,</hi>
saith <hi>Daniel c. 12. 3. shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they
that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever.</hi> Yea
they are to shine so as they may turn many, that shining being both
their glory and their duty. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> tells how they are to shine
<hi>Phil. 2. 15. Be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke
in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye shine
as lights in the world.</hi> All men look upon you, and therefore you
are to give them good example. They are as watch-towers upon
the sea, that have lights placed in them to guide the Mariners into
safe harbor, to teach them how to shun the rocks: and this they
are to do both by their own practice and by reproof. <hi>Eph. 5. 11, 13.
Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them. But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the
light.</hi> When those foul acts that are don of them in secret, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by a man that hath this Divine Light in him, then it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
how foul and wicked they are, which the darkness of their
souls would not let them see. <hi>John</hi> 3. 20. it is set down as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of light to reprove evil deeds by discovering to them the ugli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their courses, and shewing the fair example of a contrary
life, to turn them from the evil of their ways. This is to let their
<hi>light shine before men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another expression is of a Candle <hi>v.</hi> 15. of which the ground is
the same with that of the other, the Light of the world, onely the
Type sinks a little. The Light there had a larger Sphere; for the
Sun gives shine to all the world, but the Candle here <hi>gives light</hi> but
<hi>unto all that are in the house,</hi> as our Savior words it, or at least that
are in the room. Now this Emblem was also very necessary: the
greatest part of men are of a lower rank and emploiment than their
example should have influence upon very many, or that their
actions should be called Sunshine; the acts of their calling are low,
and so are those of their Piety and Religion, not considerable
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40114:110"/>
enough to be view'd or look'd upon by many others; they are not
any thing notably, and how then can they be exemplary in their
lives? They are too much clouded both in their fortunes and their
emploiments and their faculties to send forth any Raies, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
shine. Why yet for these our Savior hath a Type here in his
Sermon, as also a great part of his life was the very practice of this
exemplariness in a very low and ordinary condition. From the
time that he disputed with the Doctors at twelve years old, the shine
and glory of which action may seem enough to have temted one to
shew forth his light in an eminent manner, to have presently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
emploiments, wherein he might have bin seen; yet till the
time that he was thirty years old he retired himself, and was subject
to his Parents, living with, and serving them privately at <hi>Nazareth
Luke</hi> 2. 51. who, God knows, were of a very mean condition, and
consequently so was he, working with his hands in a mean trade.
Now all this while how did his <hi>light shine before men,</hi> when it was
immur'd in a Carpenter's work-house? Why even then it did in
exemplary humility, great obedience, pious carriage, and virtuous
diligence, ordering his conversation in that very mean condition,
so as that made him gracious in the sight of God and of men <hi>v.</hi> 52.
So that from his behavior in that low estate men accounted him a
very good person. And then, whosoever thou art, be thou never
so low, Christ hath shewed thee how to <hi>shine before men,</hi> as he did,
tho he were the Son of Righteousness. Thou canst not be too mean
to be obedient, to be careful in thy service, to be harmless, never
doing or speaking ill of any body: thou canst not be too low to be
abased, nor consequently to have occasion to shew forth patience,
meekness, and longsuffering, and gentleness, those glorious, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
humble, virtues. And this is truly to <hi>make thy light shine before
men.</hi> Tho thy example be not big enough to be look'd upon by a
whole Shire, nor yet a Parish, nor a Township, thou canst not be
accounted the light of the world; yet be thou never so little, thou
maiest shine forth as a Candle, give example to the Family in
which thou art by those virtues of being harmless. If thou have
not so much Piety, so much Light as will shine abroad and make a
day, yet give a roomful of example, let none grope thro ignorance,
or fall into sin in the house where thou dost dwell, if thy small
light of knowledg can instruct, or thy good carriage and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
can perswade him. And this especially concerns them
that are set out to be Lights to walk before them in knowledg:
Husbands, Masters, Parents, or any others, whose emploiment is
to instruct or govern, of whom whosoever he be that by any evil
carriage of his own gives ill example to those he hath to deal with,
if they follow it, (as 'tis not to be expected but they will) he mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies
his guilt, and derives on himself all the sins that are his imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
The vices of all that follow him are all his retainers, his
is a family of sins, and the imitations of his Children are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him; he is Father of villany, and hath a whole off-spring
of guilt too: and all the sins that are don by his example, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
the same thing as the Devil at the day of Judgment, and claim
their Father; there the brood of iniquity will come and challenge
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40114:111"/>
him, and there alike curse their Parent and the Devil to whom they
equally, and as accursedly relate, as those that joined to beget their
vices, that have destroy'd them eternally, both Parents of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
This is certain hence, for he that but puts out the
Candle, is accessary to all the falls and hurts that the darkness
causeth. Now thy good Example is the Candle, which if thou do
not shew forth, thou leavest them in the dark. And then if not to
walk holily in all thy actions be a thing of so much guilt, it would
be worth the sad serious consideration of every man, whom any
others do but hear or look upon, especially if those whose age makes
them capable of little else but imitation, to bethink themselves
that every oath or curse of theirs may teach some others, every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene
word may stir up others lust, and instruct others what to learn
hereafter: every passion, every drunkeness may make the ignorant
believe those sins are not so foul, which are so customary with
those that know more than they do, and by often seeing them may
be invited to them; and so for other sins. And if they do, how
many sins shall they have to answer for, besides their own, which,
God knows, are an infinity, too many? What an invitation may
one take for this from that happy consideration, that an innocent
carriage, an holy Example does contribute to the blessedness of all
the Souls that look upon me? Let others take delight to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the desires of those that keep them company with the pleasures
of sin or vanity, to furnish them with instruments of delightful folly;
but let me be instrumental to their being happy to eternity: I had
rather be a lover of their Souls, than of their mirth. Let me be
useful to the glory of my God, and the Salvation of those that are
about me; which certainly I am in a good measure, if I can but
have a care of approving all my actions so, as may give others no
occasions to sin, but may effectually attract them to my profession.
Then I do cooperate with the Bloud of Christ; for that was poured
out to buy men from their vain conversation, from which if my
Example will but help to reduce them, I shall save Souls, and in
my Light they shall see a Light of everlasting Glory on themselves,
and my Light also will shed Glory towards God; for so I <hi>glorify my
Father which is in heaven,</hi> the reason of the precedent command.</p>
                  <p>And this is incumbent especially in a dark season, such as this to
which we are condemned; wherein to say nothing of those mists
of error in which the generality of us are lost, engaged in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
crowd of Religions, tost up and down with a tumult of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
opinions, and either wholly in the dark, or having onely
false lights that do misguide us, so that we know not which way to
get out. Omitting these, there is a grosser darkness does inhabit
with us, such as that which makes Hell the Region of utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
'Tis not ignorance but wickedness that dwells there, and
that is the Region not of mistakes, but of impiety, and we go on
in such a constancy of works of darkness, as does require an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
night to cover, and go on in such a fearlesness, as if that
night could hide us from that God, who clothes himself with light.
And what is the duty in relation to such a season? You have it
<hi>Phil. 2. 15, 16. That ye may be blameless and harmless, the Sons of God,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40114:111"/>
without rebuke,</hi> unblemish'd <hi>in the midst of a crooked and perverse ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
among whom shine ye as lights in the world, holding forth the
word of life.</hi> A severe harsh injunction, that man must therefore
have the stricter care that his life be blameless and unblemish'd,
must therefore be more forward in devotions &amp; holy performances,
because most men about him are far otherwise, because he lives
among loose people. The contrary indeed might prove a good
encouragement to live a blameless life, because I live amongst
harmless holy people; for then what provocation have I to be
otherwise? Besides the shame of being otherwise among such would
abundantly restrain me, when if I did commit any enormity I must
be look't upon as a stain and blemish in the very beauty of Holiness,
look like a Negro in the midst of glorious beauties, as a dash of Hell
in the Landshape of Heaven: besides this, 'tis easier to be harmless
among those that are so. If the generality of persons were truly
pious, how could any one almost be otherwise among them that
are so dispos'd, as neither to provoke, nor give admission to a sin,
where every one is so truly meek as to bear any thing, and yet
every one so virtuously just as to offer nothing unfit; such humble
patience as to entertain any cross, any vexation quietly, and yet
such meek true-hearted charity as not to give any? Indeed if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body that one hath occasion to converse or deal with were a full
Christian, there could be no discontent at all, Heaven would be
upon Earth: and then if I were in the midst of such a Nation or
People, there were Argument enough to make me harmless, both
because I should have no occasion to be otherwise, and because I
must be so, that I might be unblemish'd. But a perverse and
crooked Generation as it deserves no kind of dealing but its own,
to return them the like is but just dealing one would think, and
onely recompence, not injury. So not to do is almost impossible:
perversness is so great a goad, that <hi>with the froward thou wilt shew
thy self froward,</hi> saith <hi>David</hi> to the Lord <hi>Psalm</hi> 18. 26. and then to
tell me I must be harmless, because I live in the midst of a perverse
and crooked Generation, looks like a very unreasonable reason.
This is the sense of men. But truly this is to discourse against Text,
and perfectly to go against that duty which the Scripture does so
strictly enjoin upon those very grounds for which they refuse it.
This is so far from doing without disputing, that we would reason
our selves out of our obedience with those very reasons, for which
God says we should obey. And truly very justly; for when is any
use of light but in the dark? 'Tis then most time for us to shine,
when there is nothing else but works of night about us. When
thou art engag'd in the conversation of those profane people, or
by any occasion cast into the company of them; when either cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
or passion, or carnal inclinations make them without regard
of God and Piety transgress or break one or more Commandments,
if thou be a Christian, and consequently pretend to those things
here which Christ says every Christian is, if thou be a Light, then
God hath cast thee where there is some business, some emploiment
for thy light; and truly that hath several things to do in such a
case. One is to <hi>reprove</hi> Eph. 5. 11, 13. And truly as to this duty of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40114:112"/>
reproving, that is if the persons offending be such, as either are my
charge, or such; as preserving that respect that is due to Autority
and distance, I may speak to freely, then clearly to reprehend
them; or if they be otherwise, then by some humble gesture or
other meek manner to give them to see that sense I have, and every
Christian ought to have of their sins, and that tho I respect their
persons, yet I dislike and detest the crime, is such a piece of Piety,
as if there were no other engagement to but that of Friendship, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
it should prevail with me. For should I see my company
that I pretend a kindness to, or any of them that I call friend,
going to drink a cup of poison either heedlesly or in an humor, or
stab himself in a frolick, when probably by speaking I might
hinder it, at leastwise I may hope to do somwhat towards it, if I
but beg them to be kinder to my friend, and not to stab or poison
him that I have a kindness for, not to destroy my friendship; shall
I think I have a friendship for him, if I would not so much as make
essay to hinder it, but let him take this course of ruin? Shall I say,
I have a kindness for him, when I would not so much as mind him
of that precipice he stood upon the edg of, nor offer to desire him
back? Or is it indeed more friendship to pledg him in the dagger
or the poison, or when I see him at the brink of headlong destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to thrust him forwards, and to throw my self down with him?
This is indeed the way of the world's kindness, but God deliver me
from such a friend, I can have legions of such as those in Hell: the
Devil hath bin shewing me such kindness constantly ever since I did
know what sin was, offering me the company and the delights of
sin, urging me forwards to them. No sure I that should think
that man had scarce affection for me, who would not tell me to
prevent a little danger, or a mischief; or that should but see
a great unhandsomness about my habit, or foul stain upon my
face, which probably would make me laugh'd at by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
I was then going into, and should not care to give me
warning, should much less think he lov'd me that would not tell
me of a spot or deformity, which would render me hateful to God
and all the holy Saints and Angels, nor come to keep me from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
condemnation. I think he loves me most that labors heartily
to do me most good, and he that endeavors to make me blessed,
does that. And truly can you tell me what other very great use
there is of friendship (which yet is one of the greatest desirables in
this world) besides this of having one that will heartily mind the
making of me better, and so helping me forwards that
which is infinitely and everlastingly my greatest concernment?
All other uses may be had without it, but a faithful Monitor, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover
cannot be had without it. The benefit of such reproof,
where it is follow'd, is the worthy issue of such an excellent thing as
holy friendship, God-like love. And indeed the kindness of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
befits well the most bosom-friendship, that it tied by the
utmost engagements of this world. This where it did speed (and
they that love in earnest will desire and labor that it may) would
be sure to breed a kindness as lasting as their Souls, they need feel
no decay of it, while there is an Heaven to reward the good success
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40114:112"/>
of such Reproofs. And a much greater kindness too 'twould be
than any little carnal endearments, and the merits of mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
beget common interests, and common pleasures, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
children are not like common salvation; when one of these
pairs shall look upon the other as the Angel that watches over him
to keep him from from falling into evil, as <hi>Lots</hi> two Angels that took
him by the hands to hurry and to force him out of <hi>Sodom:</hi> as one to
whom he does not onely owe his share of the comforts of this life,
but the comforts of Religion and the Hope of Eternity. This must
cement beyond all carnal Unions; and he that evermore hath a
friend whom he dares trust, and hath no interest disjointed from
his own, would give a commission, and desire that friend to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
him in whatever thing he sees amiss: however I may be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
at the time, yet let this be your warrant; do it, I may
think on it afterwards; do not let me be ruin'd, because in that hot
moment I would be angry to be saved; if you love me, love my
happiness, and not the satisfaction of an instantaneous passion, or
the letting me enjoy that present folly. Rather than see me hot
with anger, will you see me dwell with everlasting burnings? When
I come to my self, the heat will change into devout, and into
loving warmths; and if I do recover by it, both our Souls at last in
one close Pyramid of zealous and affectionate Flame will mount
to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Now I have said all this, and do consider that by almost all the
world reprehensions and kindnesses are thought two very distant
things, I know not whether all this will signify much, nor may be
would it more, if I should press this property of Light, this kind of
shine that a Christian is bound to, reproof of whom them he sees sin
from the reason of the Text, the glory that will accrew to God by it.
When in a loose and vicious company a Sinner does run on in a full
carrier, transgress without a rub, if there be no one there that is
fit, and dares owne Piety and the Lord of it, they are quite put out
of countenance, and vice becomes creditable in that company;
and accordingly you may see many that otherwise are not very apt
to sin, yet then they will offer at little Atheistical beginnings of it:
they will endeavor, because they will be in the fashion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
And this is one of Satans advantageous seasons, when as
we see if there be but one by of a sober and discreet virtue, that
dares speak meek reason, or dares when they do swill their Souls in
filthy folly of one or other sort, or are loud in the rants of vice by
disliking gestures, let them know that such unclean entertainments
are detestable to a sober person, or withdraws abruptly, &amp; by such a
departure shews, that he scorns to stay to behold or hear such impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities;
this often does not onely hinder those beginners, take them
off that would have bin dabbling, but does somtimes a little damp
the progress of the most professed Sinner. It is a bridle to his neck,
he will not march so furiously in his carrier of oaths, or of obsce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or whatever other sin; he does not indulge himself so full a
licence: and so by this means God gets some respect, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
a little repute, when they see it hath some followers, and God
hath some that will not see him dishonored. And truly, my
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40114:113"/>
Brethren, do but consider what a storm it does use to raise in any
man to hear an absent Friend or Relation abused, or evil spoken of.
If we be in any degree of them the world calls Gentlemen, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the sword must make return to such a word, nothing but
life and soul can answer, nothing but bloud and death repair: and
'tis this resentment we, in whose company the disgrace was offer'd,
think ourselves more concern'd, than that Friend that was the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of. And then methinks you should not think it strange, if there
be some that do believe they have so much relation to God, and
that he hath approv'd himself to be so much their Friend, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but take it unkindly, and speak, when they hear him affronted,
and see him dishonor'd. And methinks too it should not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
to expect this from all of us to whom God hath bin
Friend enough, that we should do this handsom, this noble glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
thing, as to right the Lord in companies where we are, and
to credit our Maker; and not let vice exalt over him, where we
shall chance to be. Truly, my Brethren, this is the least that God
hath reason to expect from us, even the reproof of our words, that
of our open holy lives, by which as the wicked say in <hi>Wisdom 2. 12.
The Righteous do reprove their thoughts, and upbraid them with their
offending the Law, and object to their infamy their transgressions.</hi>
This is strictly and to an high degree required by God of every one
of us, that we may have influence upon others, to be open and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary,
to <hi>shine before men, that they may see our good works, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
our Father which is in Heaven,</hi> which was the reason of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and the end of our very being. Now <hi>to God the Father &amp;c.</hi>

placentiae,</hi> time of grace, wherein he was well pleas'd to hearken to
their cries and wants, and in those he heard and succour'd them: so
in the Antitype, and in relation of the Christian Church and all the
Members of it (for of these S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> here useth it expresly) he hath
his accepted time, days not onely for such temporal deliverance,
of which some will have the Salvation meant here, but much more
for Salvation Eternal. But then as Kings, when they publish acts
of grace and oblivion, do not onely set &amp; appoint, but limit out the
time for Subjects to come in, submit and return to their fidelity and
allegiance, which if once elapst, they are incapable of benefit by
any such grant, cannot at least plead it: so it seems God does too,
and it is not sure that <hi>whosoever,</hi> at what time soever, <hi>calls upon the
name of the Lord shall be saved,</hi> Rom. 10. 13. but, as King <hi>David</hi>
told him, <hi>they shall make their praier to thee in a time of finding

<hi>Psalm</hi> 69. 13. and this time S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

meaning not onely in the general now in times while they are under
grace, are in the Covenant of it, and when the day-spring from on
high hath visited them, and while they had the Gospel, that word of
this Salvation: for whilest men live under this gracious dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they may let the opportunities of laying hold of it go by
them; while the light of the Gospel shines upon them, yet the
day of Salvation may be quite gon out, of which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> here seems
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40114:114"/>
sollicitous for his <hi>Corinthians</hi> who had receiv'd the Gospel, least yet
they may have <hi>receiv'd that grace in vain,</hi> and the Salvation should
escape them. To prevent which, saith he, there is no other sure
way but by seizing on the present, <hi>Behold now is the accepted time,
now is the day of salvation:</hi> so that the words afford these subjects of
discourse.</p>
                  <p>1. There is a <hi>time</hi> wherein we may be certainly accepted if we
come to God, and there is <hi>a day of Salvation</hi> offer'd us.</p>
                  <p>2. This time is limited, 'tis <hi>a day of salvation,</hi> consequently we
may possibly outstand it, and may suffer it to pass irrecoverably.</p>
                  <p>3. The onely sure way to prevent that, is to lay hold on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to begin <hi>now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. There is a time wherein we may be certainly accepted if we
come to God, and there is a <hi>day of Salvation</hi> offer'd us.</p>
                  <p>The Text does make sufficient proof of this, for if the <hi>accepted
time</hi> be <hi>now,</hi> and if <hi>now</hi> be the <hi>day of salvation,</hi> then there is such a
day and time, which our Lord commanded to be preached to every
humane creature in the world. Indeed the preaching of the Gospel
is nothing else but publishing this truth, the Gospel being but a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Salvation upon pardon of whatever we have don amiss, and
the accepting us, whenever we repent and truly turn to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
on him, and resolving to continue faithful to him, and all
this assur'd to us by Covenant, such as God himself both made and
ratified in the bloud of Christ; and to prevent exception, since he
gave command to have this Gospel <hi>preach'd to every creature</hi> Mark
16. 15. and our Church does teach us in her Articles, that we must
<hi>receive Gods promises in such wise as they be generally set forth to us in
Holy Scripture,</hi> there is no pretence for controversy with a Preacher
of the Gospel, who shall publish there is such an offer of Salvation
made us all, a time wherein we may be sure to be accepted. Yea
more, not onely to ascertain but to work effectually this acceptance,
howsoever wicked and rebellious we had bin, he sent his Son, the
Son of God to be incarnated to treat a Reconciliation; for so cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
5. 19. 'tis said, <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
not imputing their trespasses.</hi> For this he made him shed his bloud
upon the Cross, and die and live again; for <hi>thus it behoved Christ
to suffer and to rise from the dead, that Repentance and Remission of sins
might be preached in his name to all Nations</hi> Luke 24. 46, 47. Yea for
that he gave this crucified Jesus all the Glory, Majesty and Power of
Heaven; for <hi>him hath God exalted to his right hand to be a Prince and
Savior to give Repentance and Remission of sins,</hi> Acts 5. 31. A won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Oeconomy if we reflect upon it, and sufficient to astonish
both our faith and apprehension also, that the Great Creator and
the onely Lord of all things should make God man, and then igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniously
suffer a most cruel death that he might mediate and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
for us terms of this acceptance and salvation, and make that
ignominious sufferer, that dead man God, and give him all the
Power of Heaven and Earth, that he might make us fit for, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
it on us. This strange transaction is no argument at all most
surely, that to be at peace with us can be of any consequence to
him, to whom felicity is most essential. <hi>Lord, what is man that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40114:114"/>
thou art thus mindful of him, and the son of man that thou so regardest
him?</hi> in whom, if we look thro him, we can find nothing in the
world that's very notable, but onely that he can defy his most Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Maker, so as nothing but the bloud of such a Mediator
could be fit to satisfy for, nothing but Eternal Hell fit to revenge;
and can defy his own concerns and interests so far, as to make that
Eternal Hell his choice, his most deliberate option. But however
the Oeconomy of this so strange a mediation, tho it cannot prove
God is concern'd at all to have this Reconciliation wrought with us
that we should be accepted and be sav'd; for<note n="a" place="margin">Job 22. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>is it any pleasure to
Almighty God that thou art just? or is it gain to him that thou makest
thy ways perfect?</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Job 35. 6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>If thou be righteous, what givest thou him; or
what receiveth he of thine hand? If thou sinnest, what doest thou against
him; or if thy wickedness be multiplied, what dost thou to him?</hi> yet of
how much the less consequence we are to God, it is so much the
greater demonstration of his infinite benignity and goodness, who
when he had no one motive in the world but pity to our lost condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was so bountiful, that when all the compassion of Divinity
would not serve our turn for the provision of a ransom, he took in
Humanity, that God might give somwhat besides himself to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
us a time of Grace, and a <hi>day of salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet more, if we should trace him in his several ways of mercy
which he constantly pursues those wretchless creatures, miserable us,
in, that all that may be effectual and succeed to our Salvation, we
should find he uses all means possible to engage us to accept of it:

all the soft and lowly arts of invitation they must pray you, and in
Christ's name beg of you, and God does beseech you by them. Now
did he please out onely to expostulate it with us, why we will resolve
to be at enmity with him and Salvation too, <hi>why we will die</hi> for ever;
it would argue a concern for us, the apprehension of which ought to
be very comfortable to us: but when God descends to <hi>beseech</hi> us,
(the expression looks uncouth indeed, but yet it is not strange he
should intreat that which he died for, beg of us what he ask'd for
not with importent weak tears, but with <hi>strong cries</hi> on the Cross,
with the bloudshed of his own onely-begotten Son;) when he thus
conveighs his importunate entreaties to us, that we would endure

Nor did he send these his Ambassadors as bare petitioners with emty
importunities and meer intreaties of this, but they strengthen these
proposals with <hi>exceeding great and precious promises,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> calls
them <hi>Epist.</hi> 2. 1. 4. promises both <hi>of the life that now is, and of that

                     <hi>Paul</hi> says 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. yea and these as sure as
<hi>that there is a God</hi> that made them. Neither are they wanting to
inform us of the dangers we most certainly incurr if we refuse him,
merely to affright us to him, to incline us to admit Salvation ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and preferr it before everlasting misery: and all this by his
express commission, they being set by God as <hi>watch-men to give
warning to the wicked from him,</hi> as he tells <hi>Ezekiel c.</hi> 3. 17. And least
their discourse should be too faint, and not have force to move us,
God does frequently step in himself by providential acts; when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subduable
by Reason or Religion, deaf to our very interests we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
our sinful satisfactions with ungovernable fierce carrier, he lays
a Cross on us to trash us, or lets loose a feaver at us so to bring us
low and make us sensible; or else he suffers our own evil counsels to
entangle us, we are catcht in our own machinations and designs, he
lets us tast the bitter fruit of our own doings, and our sins pull down
calamities or mischiefs on us so far somtimes as to scare us with the
landshape of their after expectations; having thrown us on the
brink of destruction, laid us at the gates of the grave, at the very
mouth of Hell, where if God had left us, we had bin sealed up, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
to the irreversible retributions of our iniquities; but he
interpos'd to snatch us thence and set us further off, so to enlarge
our time to be accepted in, and to lengthen the <hi>day of salvation</hi> to
us. I challenge every man's experience to attest this, there is no
man but his heart heart witness to it; and to this too, how when we
have thrown our selves upon temtation, he is pleas'd to blunt or turn
aside the edge of it: how often have we put our selves into those
circumstances, wherein thousands have miscarried as to all conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
both of this world and the other? And inevitably we had
don so, but that he was pleased to temper the malignity of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
and divert the mischief, merely that he might preserve
us for his opportunities. It is for this he watches over us, as he tells
<hi>Jeremy</hi> 31. 28. when as, God knows, we are so far from importuning
him to do it that we think not of him nor of our selves, do not so
much as ask his cares, indeed neglect, affront them, yea deny them;
yet he spares us for these blessed purposes, and <hi>is long-suffering to

if possible he may find softer seasons wherein we may be more
pliant, take impression more easily; therefore also he provides oft
such a state of things as may be more effectual, more prevailing
with us, as if indeed he waited for the time of our good pleasure,
when himself should be acceptable to us, and his motions receiv'd
by us. Yea and that they may be so, with these external methods
there are also inward excitations and assistances afforded us. That
he may both find and make these congruous seasons, he is either
trying or solliciting and importuning frequently our very hearts,

yet I do not pass by or stand at them unconcern'd expecting whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you will open and admit me, but I knock importunately and
unwearied, by disquieting men in their Lethargick state of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration

upon their duty and their practice that is so distant from it and the
danger of that; I attemt to rouse their Conscience, if so be when
that is waked and troubled and affrighted, it may possibly prevail
with them to be content to let a Savior in. Nor is he satisfied with
standing still so, and expecting; for God is that very Father in the
Parable, who when the Prodigal had wasted among riotous men
and harlots all his portion, all the obligations of his Father's kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but at last made sensible by the extremity of want and hunger,
and not able to find any sustenance elsewhere, then resolves on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning

off, saw him and had compassion on him,</hi> did not stay his coming, but
<hi>ran</hi> out to meet him, and <hi>fell on his neck to kiss him;</hi> yea fell lower
in his kindness than the Son in his humiliation and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
accepted him to all the dearness that relation enhanc'd by
the recovery of what was lost and hopeless could pretend to. He is
that Shepherd who went out to seek that lost sheep that ran from
him, and that thought not of returning, who sought <hi>till be found it;</hi>
and when it was wearied so with wilful stragling that it could not
come back, carried it on his shoulders <hi>rejoicing.</hi> And now judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I pray, between God and the Sinner, whether he have not Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
offer'd him, and whether there be not a time wherein he may
be certainly accepted if he come to God; when (in fum of that
which hath bin said) 'tis plain, to preach the Gospel to us Sinners
is to proclaim this acceptable year of the Lord, it is to tender us
Salvation purchased for us, and confirm'd to us by the bloud of the
Son of God, which Son of his, God, was incarnate, crucified, raised,
and exalted to be Lord of Heaven and Earth to work it out, and to
bestow it on us; and to direct us in attaining it he keeps a standing
Embassy of men commissionated to advise, premonish and sollicite,
to encourage to it, represent the dangers, if we follow other, our
own counsels, and he suffers us to run our selves into some of them,
that the tast may make us sensible: and however we pass him by
scornfully, and make no applications to his Providence, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
his cares of us, yet he delivers us to give us more time that we
may not perish, yea diverts temtations when we seek them, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats
the mischief of them when we throw our selves upon them
and himself invites, beseeches, temts us, finds or else makes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
seasons, and contrives such circumstances as may press, in

follows us, seeks till he finds us, carries us home to him. And what
could have him don more to the Sinner, that he hath not don<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40114:116"/>
what we thus have seen him doing for particular persons, that he
does much more unweariedly for Nations, in whose undisturb'd
tranquillity and good righteous Government the Godliness and
honesty, as well as wealth and quiet of particular men, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi>
saith, is concern'd: since in careless and loose Governments, and
disturb'd and broken ones men equally grow vitious, dishonest and
ungodly; and in too great calms as well as tempests are apt to make
shipwrack both of Faith and of good Conscience. Therefore God
expresseth his concern for Nations in most passionate words, <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth
over them to do them good with his whole heart and with his
whole soul</hi> Jer. 32. 41. and when the importunity of crying Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
enormities, and that are so far from being punish'd, they are
not discountenanc'd, enforce him that he can forbear no longer to
endeavor by some chastning to reduce them, yet <hi>in all their affliction

having all the bowels of a tender Parent to them, and cries out in
most lamenting wishes, <hi>O that my people would have hearkned unto

their enimies, and turned my hand against their adversaries,</hi> Psalm 81.
13, 14. And our Savior in like manner, <hi>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
that killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how
often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth
her chickens under her wings,</hi> Matt. 23. 37. Altho thou wilt
endure no Envoies from me, no reconciliation, but against all
Laws of Nations, which men do observe to all men, murderest all
those Ambassadors that come from me, thy God, to treat it with
thee, yet how oft would I my self have sav'd thee at the approch of
imminent dangers? God does beseech the liberty of doing it,
however obstinate they are against it. <hi>All the day long,</hi> saith he, <hi>I
have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gain-saying people,</hi>
as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> expresseth it <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 21. and himself saith, <hi>I have spread
out my hands all the day to a rebellious people,</hi> Isaiah 65. 2. spread them
out in entreaties &amp; assistances, to give them help and to beg of them
they would receive it. We know when<note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 17. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Moses</hi> stretched forth his
hands for <hi>Israel,</hi> (in Praier saith the <hi>Chaldee</hi>) God still heard, and
<hi>Israel</hi> prevail'd against their Enimies; and when his hands were
heavy and he weary, yet while others held them up stretch'd forth
to God, they still prevail'd, he heard still. But when God spreads
out his hands to them all day long, as beseeching them that they
would accept of his deliverances they gain-say it, and continue
disobedient. Yea altho they make him <hi>serve</hi> thus <hi>with their sins,
and weary him with their iniquities,</hi> as he complains by the Prophet
<hi>Isaiah c.</hi> 43. 24. yet by the same Prophet he assures them, <hi>therefore
will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you, c.</hi> 30. 18. and if
all his waiting by their obstinate perverseness be made ineffectual,
then he seems inconsolable. In <hi>Hosea</hi> 13. 14. he tells <hi>Ephraim, I
would have ransom'd thee from the power of the grave, I would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd
thee from death,</hi> from those calamities and enimies that
threaten ruin and extinction to the Nation, <hi>O death, I would have
bin thy plague, O grave, I would have bin thy destruction,</hi> would have
brought to nothing every thing that did endanger or look fatal to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40114:116"/>
thee; but now <hi>consolatio abscondita est ab oculis meis, comfort is hidden
from mine eyes,</hi> and since there is no further application, remedy or
help for thee, there is no consolation for me. As indeed comfort
was hid from the eyes of Christ, and they were capable onely of
tears, he could not see <hi>Jerusalem</hi> but <hi>he wept over it,</hi> Luke 19. 41, 42.
when once <hi>the things that did belong to the peace</hi> of that City <hi>were hid
from their eyes,</hi> their day being ended, as he there tells them; for
to that it may come, since this <hi>accepted time</hi> and <hi>the day of salvation</hi>
being God's own chosen time and the day of his grace, it is also li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
by him, we may outstand it, may suffer this day of Salvation
to pass irrecoverably, the second thing I am to speak to.</p>
                  <p>I shall not undertake to prove 'tis limited, because 'tis here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
but by a day, a very narrow scantling; yet our Savior so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaks
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as if it had but that its day, when he spake to
them, <hi>O that thou hadst known in this thy day,</hi> Luke 19. 42. and
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> bids the <hi>Hebrews c. 3. 13. exhort one another while it is called
to day.</hi> Yea more, as if that day were limited to one point of it,
here 'tis worded so as that <hi>now is the time, now is the day;</hi> as if it
were onely that point of time that stabs it self, that present instant
which expires the same first moment that it is: and yet our Savior
when he had told <hi>Jerusalem</hi> of that their day, as if that their day
were no longer than the Apostle's <hi>now,</hi> which as it now is, so now
perisheth, even while it is; so did their day, for even in that their
day, he tells them, <hi>now they are hidden from thine eyes.</hi> But passing
these, that it is so both as to Nations and particular persons, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
will make evident. And my first instance shall be made in
all the Nations of the Earth at once: God limited the time of his
forbearance to the whole world, beyond which he resolved to be so
far from using his endeavors to reclaim them, as that he would
suffer them no longer <hi>Gen. 6. 3. My Spirit shall not always strive
with man, for that he is flesh; yet his days shall be an hundred and
twenty years.</hi> He was so wearied by their obstinacy, that he posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
does determine that he would not still continue to be earnest
with them, struggle to reduce them, since they were so stupid,
wholly sensual, mere flesh. But before he would destroy them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
he was content to try them yet so many years, and then he
<hi>brought the flood upon the world of the ungodly.</hi> Again he tells<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 15. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
that his Posterity, however it should be afflicted many years in
a strange Land, yet <hi>in the fourth generation they shall come hither
again, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.</hi> Four Ages
therefore they had yet allow'd them to return in, and prevent their
ruin; but if they neglect that and go on to add sin still to sin, by
then the measure will be heapt and the iniquity will be full. Again
the <hi>Jews,</hi> God's own peculiar People, and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> his holy and
beloved City had yet but its term, <hi>Dan. 9. 24. Seventy weeks are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
upon thy people, and upon thy holy City to finish the transgression,
and to make an end of sins,</hi> to compleat that which shall bring full
ruin on thy nation: and of those weeks it should seem as if the day
on which Christ weeping over them wish'd, <hi>O that thou hadst known in
this thy day,</hi> was the last of them; for he says, <hi>Now they are hidden
from thine eyes.</hi>

Once more, the City <hi>Niniveh</hi> was yet more straitned; <hi>Yet fourty
days and Niniveh shall be destroied,</hi> Jonah 3. 4. 'Tis true this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was not executed, for the mere denouncing of it gave them
such a true sense of their own condition, made them so consider
how they had deserv'd it, that the Scripture says <hi>they believed God,</hi>
heartily acknowledg'd it would be just dealing with them, that they
could expect no other. Whereupon <hi>they cried out mightily to God,</hi>
and put themselves into a state of such humiliation, as whether for
the severity or the universality of it, 'tis possible the world hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen an instance like it. And if he that did command all this
were King <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> as most of the Learned do conclude, a
man whose name alone was set to signify all sensuality beyond
whatever other character, was the expression of it to a Proverb, if
he became so sensible upon one Sermon to require and practise such
Mortification and Repentance, it is no wonder if God would not
execute his sentence upon them that so severely executed it on their
sins and on themselves. And truly those few that allow it not <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danapalus,</hi>
and yet place the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> not long after him,
must be put hard to it to find out then so great a City, as he tells
you <hi>Niniveh</hi> then was, and so great a King of it. But he, altho (as
men of his vice possibly are apt to be somtimes) a little tender
hearted, easily affected on some sudden passionate occasion, yet
that being, as it mostly is, a fit of penitence, returning to his old
abominable practices, after a short Reign his Kingdom was quite
rent in pieces, and the City utterly destroied, himself beginning it.
He had before inflam'd it with his lust, then he set fire to it, and
left nothing after him besides his Epitaph, a greater and more
lively character of sensuality than his whole life had bin: and so that
City, tho it did lay hold upon the <hi>time of acceptance,</hi> seize the <hi>day
of salvation,</hi> yet it quickly let it go again.</p>
                  <p>And as for persons I shall need to give one onely instance, since
'tis of more than six hundred thousand men, and each in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
capacity. All whom<note n="g" place="margin">Num. 1. 2, 3.</note> Males, able to go out to war God
brought from <hi>Egypt</hi> with a mighty hand on purpose to conduct
them to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and possess them of it; every one of
whom saw more of God's immediat presence and his Glory, had
more express miracle of grace and favor and forbearance also, than
yet ever any People in the world had: yet these had their time of
favor limited, had their day for God's performance; which time
while it lasted he endur'd their provocations of the highest measure,
even when they made another God to lead them. But when that
day came, and they were at the point to enter, and<note n="h" place="margin">De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

go in and possess it, and they would not make use of it, being scar'd
with news of Enimies taller than they, and so distrusting God's help
they repin'd they had not staid in <hi>Egypt</hi> rather; then <hi>as I live,</hi> saith
God, <hi>because all these men have seen my glory, and my miracles which
I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have temted me now these ten
times, surely they shall not come into the Land concerning which
I sware to make you dwell therein; neither shall any of them that
provoked me, see it</hi> Num. 14. 22, 23, 30. And of all that number

it. This very instance, and the Prophe <hi>Davids</hi> application of
it also <hi>Psalm</hi> 95. to the <hi>Jews</hi> of his time, that they would not be as
their Forefathers, stubborn and untractable to all God's methods,
standing out against them till it was too late, but that to day if they
would hear his voice, they should be flexible and plaint: this, I say,
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> in the third chapter to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> urges to the Christians,

finally withdraw his grace from those who in the day of it resist it,
and makes no more tender of it to them; and illustrates this in the

                  <p>Whether the term that limits this <hi>accepted time</hi> be meted out by
years and months, so much time I will bear with them and expect,
as the instance of the old world gives some color for; or whether it
be not set to days and hours, but measured by their reckonings of
iniquity, when they have made up and filled the Epha, their time
shall be out, as the <hi>Amorites</hi> example and the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
would evince: or whether both ways, as <hi>Jerusalems</hi> and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivehs</hi>
seem plain for, 'tis not for me to determin. Each or any of
them does assure us that the time is bounded, beyond which there
is no term, no day left if we do outstand that. <hi>O that thou hadst
known in this day,</hi> saith he, but that being expir'd, then is the hour
of darkness, <hi>now they are hidden from thine eyes;</hi> nor are they onely
hidden from their eyes, but God also shuts their eyes, sends them the
spirit of slumber on them, that they may not see, not perceive, not
understand, nor be converted, least he heal them. The Predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
that do limit out the Age of mens Repentance, seem much
more unalterable than those are that bound the Age of Life. Good

                     <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> tears and praiers got him fifteen years accession to his
days, time did go back for him, and he liv'd part of his Age over
again. But when the life that is allotted for the possibilities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is spun out, when the day of God's expectation is once
gon, we have no instance to produce that he will call back, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
it to us: death may let go its hold, but obstinacy in sin does
not; marble Monuments have heard and bin obedient, yielded up,
but the stony hard heart will not. And indeed to be innexible
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40114:118"/>
arises from the very nature of that course and progress in sin that
does weary out God's forbearances, outstands all his offers, wasts
the whole <hi>day of salvation.</hi> For to pass by the instances of the old
World and of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> of which we have no more account,
but that these <hi>Amorites</hi> were given up so to unnatural sin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanesses,
that the<note n="l" place="margin">Lev. 18. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Land spued them out;</hi> in the other, that the
Daughters of men had effac'd all the thoughts and knowledg of
God out of the very Sons of God, that the wickedness of man was
so great that<note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evil continually.</hi> But in <hi>Israel,</hi> whom S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> represents to us for
caution, thus their state was; they had set their hearts on present
satisfactions so eagerly and impotently, that whenever there was
the least want of any, they repin'd that God had brought them out
of <hi>Egypt;</hi> that their <hi>Jehovah</hi> should be at that distance from them as
in Heaven, and their sustenance come thence too, quite discourag'd
them, broke all their confidence and faith: they must have their
Provisions and their Deity too nearer, cry out for<note n="n" place="margin">Num. 11. 4.</note> Flesh-pots and
the<note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 32. 1.</note> Calf of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that their meat and God too may be present.
And altho God always answer'd their complaints by satisfying of
them, miracle sustain'd them constantly; yet, as <hi>Moses</hi> told them,
<hi>Deut. 29. 2, 3, 4. Ye have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in
the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all
his land, the great temtations which thine eyes have seen, the signs and
those great miracles, yet ye had not an heart to understand, and eyes to
see, and ears to hear unto this day:</hi> they had no sense of them but
what brute beasts were capable of having; onely gaz'd as lookers
on them; did not mind, consider, and much less discern how
great he was that wrought those wonders, and how able, ready and
desirous to supply whatever they could need or he had promis'd,
and that whatsoever they might want 'twas sure they should not
want a miracle to furnish, and by consequence had all obligation
that could be imagin'd to believe in, trust upon him and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
But of this they were not sensible, made no such reasonings;
but when ever any thing they had a mind to was not present, or
when any danger look'd upon them, disbeliev'd and murmur'd still,
flew in his very face, insomuch that God says <hi>Num. 14. 11. How
long will this people provoke me, and how long will it be ere they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me?</hi> Now after all those strong, most operative ways of
making faith, they still persisting in their incredulity and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
and sensless doubtings, not believing him is but conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
they would not hearken to him, and be wrought on or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
by him; but resisted his will always, and, as it must follow,
grew more and more stubborn and inflexible, that is, stiff-neck'd,
as God calls them, having their hearts harden'd. For it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of things harden'd to be such intractables. And being so to
that degree that Miracles, God's most effectual method, could
make no impression on them, that he labor'd in vain with them,
he must needs abandon them, and give them over as incorrigible:
and so having worn out all his methods, and by consequence all
his forbearance, he swore they should not enter in <hi>Canaan;</hi> and
however he endur'd them to live fourty years, their opportunity
was dead and their day ended.</p>

                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:40114:118"/>
I might tell you how the same ill temper of that Nation, looking
after present earthly satisfactions, consequently for a temporal
<hi>Messiah,</hi> made them disbelieve, and hardned them against Christ's
miracles and teachings, but that former instance serves my turn;
and when S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> proposes this Example to the Christians as a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they suffer not their day to pass them, least they be shut out
of their eternal rest, their heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> he expresly cautions them
against the same two things, that they <hi>fall not by the same ensample
of unbelief</hi> Heb. 4. 11. and that <hi>their hearts be not hardened by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness
of sin</hi> Heb. 3. 13. Christ's Miracles, if they did not make
faith of his person and commission, of the duties, promises and
threats of the Gospel to the <hi>Jews,</hi> when present with them, we may
fear their efficacy may be fainter in men at this distance: and if
strong inclinations to the present, howsoever sinful satisfactions of
their appetites, together with long practice and converse in them,
have got a great love to them, 'tis most certain that this will not
suffer them to receive the love of the Gospel; no not of its promises
and blessednesses, all which are so averse and opposite to those sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions:
and not loving it, it is impossible they can be willing
to give credit to it. Yea those sensual affections blind the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
so that indeed it discerns not the truth of it, and engage
the heart so that it gives no great heed to it; and then as Attention
to it doth, the belief of it must decay. The man is onely such a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
Auditor of what is recorded in Scripture, as the <hi>Jews</hi> in the
wilderness were Spectators of it, without faith or reflection; he
considers not himself concern'd much in whatever it proposes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by injunction, threat or invitation, whether it do promise bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
or denounce judgment, and so grows insensible of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
as to either: and then coming thus to have no sense of his
condition, therefore neither hath he any fear by reason of it, <hi>i. e.</hi>
so far his heart is hardned, and so going on continuing in that state,
it is so perfectly. And what that is, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> can inform us. 'Tis such
an heart as admits no compunction, tho you let fly all God's arrows at
it. No respect to God, what grounds soever of experienc'd goodness
he have for it, softens it: if you beseech him on God's part, he is
not mov'd, nor yields altho you threaten him; if God invite him
by prosperity and kindness, he is ungrateful, and he grows more
dissolute; but if he scourge him, he grows either senseless or else
furious and desperate, shameless here, fearless of hereafter, of all
humane things regardless, of Divine contemtuous: all past things
are most perfectly past to him, he remembers nothing of the good
or evil, so as to consider or make use of either; and altho he throw
away the present, yet as if the future would never arrive, altho
you lay before him certain death and the ensuing two Eternities,
it is not possible to move him to provide for that Futurity. And
then, when neither present, past, nor future can work any thing
upon him, how is it possible to change him? Now 'tis no wonder
if God give him over, when his state is thus unalterable. Indeed
as this condition when 'tis grown thus irreversible, makes the state
of Hell here as to sinning, so it seems to make the state of it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
as to suffering, adding weight and in some sort Eternity to its
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40114:119"/>
torments; for with the other grounds that shew it just for God to
plague the little transient satisfactions of our sins with an immortal
worm and everlasting burnings, this also is one, that the Sinner's
appetite and resolution to sin is endless, and as much as in him lies
eternal, and were he not cut off from the commission, his iniquity
would be immortal. And it does appear so certainly, when if God
set him out a time for his Repentance and their Reconciliation, and
how great soever he have made his heaps, if he do not seal up the
sum with this hard-heartedness and persevering obstinacy, if while
there is yet any sand to run, he will consider and take up, then God
will pass by all the rest, and cancel the whole reckoning; if yet he
will refuse this mercy, will go on to fill his Ephah, and commits
even while the life of his Repentance is breathing out its last, while
the possibilities of mercy are upon their death-bed gasping, the
<hi>accepted time</hi> and the <hi>day of Salvation</hi> just ending, there is no doubt,
his will, his appetite and resolutions to it are immortal, and 'tis
therefore also fit his worm should be so: and there is no security
against this, but by laying hold upon the present; for <hi>behold now is
the day of Salvation,</hi> the last thing I am to speak to.</p>
                  <p>I shall not press this from the common place of the uncertainty
of this life, of which whatever we have past as death possesses, so
the succeeding moments Judgment may lay hold of; we are sure
of nothing but the present. But if we had not onely the assurances
which constancy of health and strength of constitution give but a
lease of years, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had from God himself, we have no as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of the time of acceptance. Many men, tho they live fast,
furiously spend the stock of Nature, sin yet with a much fiercer
carrier, <hi>as the horse,</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">Jer. 8. 6.</note> in <hi>Jeremies</hi> expression, <hi>rusheth into the battel,</hi>
and they spend the <hi>day of Salvation</hi> faster. Men may deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by reckoning to repent hereafter. We cannot conclude with
reason we have space left for it while our life lasts, since those op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
are not always, and perchance not frequently, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate
with the life or being of a profligate man or Nation:
and when they end together 'tis not that their whole life or being
was allotted to those opportunities, but when these are forfeit or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisht,
God cuts off the other. Thus indeed he did destroy the
old World, when the one hundred and twenty years for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
were expir'd; and several men are <hi>cut down out of time,</hi>
as <hi>Job</hi> saith <hi>c.</hi> 22. 16. men that <hi>shall not live out half their days,</hi> as
<note n="q" place="margin">Psalm 55. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>David</hi> saith of the <hi>deceitful and the bloudy men,</hi> that drink their
own Bloud when they thirst for others; men whose time for their
acceptance went not out while their life lasted, because when it
went out God cut off their life. But 'tis not always so. Not first in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
four Generations filled the measure of the <hi>Amorites</hi> iniquity,
but five were past before destruction made approaches to them. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
had its sentence of excision in<note n="r" place="margin">2 Kings 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Manasses</hi> reign, but its execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was suspended till the time of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> near a hundred years.
And again the things that belonged to the peace of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were
taken from them when they kill'd the <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> their <hi>day of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
too was darkned at Christ's Crucifixion, but the City liv'd
yet fourty years. Nor secondly in persons: <hi>Pharaohs</hi> time was out
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40114:119"/>
at the sixth plague, but God at once upheld and hardned him until
the tenth was past. And those six hundred thousand, that were
doom'd for murmuring, were afterwards near fourty years in
dying, liv'd so long to rebel against more miracles. Now all that
time the state of all these, whether men or Nations, was irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
as to the doom past upon them. Did we know indeed our
measure of iniquity, how many crimes we wanted to fill up our
Ephah, make an end at once of sin and the <hi>day of Salvation</hi> also;
'twere no wonder if we did not think it necessary <hi>now</hi> to seize the
opportunity, having yet so many sins good. But there are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
of great bulk, few of which will do it; the men that sin
post, soon arrive at the end of the race that is set before them.
There are whose life is nothing else but perpetual variety of
wickedness, and they will quickly make up their account; the
constancy inflames the reckoning, and the sum does advance
mightily: how know they but the next of any of these greater
magnitudes may fill up the score? To such <hi>now</hi> onely may be the
<hi>accepted time.</hi> However</p>
                  <p>1. They that, whenever such considerations are suggested, will not
at that present, even <hi>now</hi> resolve to attemt <hi>to break their sins off by
repentance,</hi> it is plain they are intangled in them, love them so,
that they resolve expresly not to part with them yet, tho they are
made to consider by the course of all God's several workings for
them and their own provokings, that they may have wasted almost
all the stock both of God's methods and their own opportunities,
and will venture doing it completely, rather than forego their dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
customs. Now such a love to sin, as it works induration, (as I
shew'd you) hardens mens hearts; so it does betray it, and evince
they are in some degree so. Such a resolution is sufficient not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to provoke God to contract the measure and cut short the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 28. but it self bids fair to fill it up. The present
therefore must be their <hi>accepted time;</hi> and they do all that in them
is to put out the <hi>day of Salvation,</hi> who do thus put off from them
this <hi>Now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Of this that hath bin said, whether Almighty God be now about
to make the application, either as to what concerns the Nation or
particular persons, is not may part to determine or debate;<note n="s" place="margin">Acts 1. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>It is not
for us to know the times and seasons, which the Father hath put in his
own power.</hi> Many seem indeed to have uncomfortable expectations,
great fears both as to the Nation; and I must say they have reason,
we may justly fear those judgments which we have deserv'd most
justly, and provok'd most heinously, wilfully, impudently; and
great fears too as to Religion, nor without good cause, yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
those men that earnestly desire a change talk of it as at hand
with comfort. False, ungracious, treacherous Sons to their poor
Mother, who do what they can to blast and weaken her, that they
may have color to forsake her. But this they have talkt oft with
great confidence, and he that sits in Heaven always laught their
confidence to scorn, &amp; we hope he will do so to the world's end. Sure
I am there could be no fear of what they expect and wish so from
comparison of the Religions; or if we would answer our Religion
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40114:120"/>
by our living. But there is great cause of fear we may provoke God
to desert that reformation we deform so with our manners, and put
out the Worship we unhallow. And inded a flood of Atheism and
contemt of all Religion and Virtue, or the having a Religion that
is next to that itself, looks like just dereliction of them, who would
not let God be in their thoughts, nor Piety or Morality in their
actions. Now if this be so, and by consequent these fears be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
&amp; just, there can be no prevention but by closing now with
the proposal of my Text by laying hold upon the present. Any
least forbearance may make our state irreversible, and does cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
provoke God towards it; whereas, if now, when God shews
us the rod, we would break off our sins, reform our selves, live up
to our Religion, there would be no cause to fear destruction, since
God's work were don, &amp; whatever shall happen, all would work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for the everlasting good of those that did so. This, if ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
also, must preserve Religion to us. The certain and the onely
way to keep Religion is to practise it; it is impossible that they can
take it from us while we live it, and without that no Religion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
current, can be useful to us. But this must secure our Faith
here, and secure us of the end of our Faith, the Salvation of our
Souls.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE words do need no other explication than the
reading the whole verse: it runs thus, <hi>For which
cause</hi> (for the Gospel's sake) <hi>I also suffer these
things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know
whom I have believed, and I am perswaded that he
is able to keep that which I have committed unto
him against that day.</hi> Let those that suffer for
ill doing be abashed and troubled at it, I am
neither asham'd of the Gospel, nor the least discourag'd by my suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
how great and ignominious soever for its sake, and for
doing my duty in relation and obedience to it; for I trust and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on one that will secure me, and will bless and crown my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors.
That he wills and intends it I am sure, for he hath promis'd,
and in what he hath promis'd I know he is faithful, and he is also
able above all that I can ask or think; and consequently whatever
in pursuance of his promise is entrusted to him, must be safe in his
hands I am sure, <hi>for I know whom I have believed.</hi> So that the words
direct us how to quiet and secure our selves in what estate soever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
whether publick or our own, are; namely in a close depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon God: and in the handling them I have but these three
things to speak to.</p>
                  <p>1. Who this <hi>I</hi> is, <hi>I know;</hi> and in what respect qualified for such
secure dependance.</p>
                  <p>2. What those cases are, wherein dependance do's admit such
confident assurance, as is here express'd by the word know, <hi>I know.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Who this is on whom the person that is qualified thus does so
depend, and upon what account, especially in relation to him,
hath the man that does depend upon him such assurance that he
can profess, <hi>I know whom I believe:</hi> to all which I shall make plain
answers, and shall onely give you God's word for them.</p>
                  <p>1. Who this <hi>I</hi> here is, <hi>I know?</hi> and in what respect, and how
qualified? This <hi>I</hi> here is S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> whom I do not mean to speak of
in that narrow notion as an Apostle, but as one in such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
as do make him fit to represent the state of any one that is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40114:121"/>
qualified to commit all his concerns into God's hands with a perfect
resignation and with full assurance. Now as to this, first it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
every person is not qualified for such dependance, cannot trust
on God, rely upon his promise, as not having any right that it
should be fulfilled to him. No not where the promise being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
for example, made to the whole present body of a Nation, by
consequence concerns most of the individual persons of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
even there it may not be sure to them: and of this we have a
pregnant instance <hi>Num. 14. 30. Doubtless ye shall not come into the
Land concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, and ye shall
know my breach of promise, v.</hi> 34. And that very justly, they first
having broke with him: for there being some, at least tacit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
still implied in all such promises as well as threatnings,
therefore as to one and the other God sets this down as a general
rule in his proceedings, and not onely with particular persons but
with Nations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 7, 8, 9, 10. as <hi>at what instant I shall speak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Nation, or concerning a Kingdom to pluck up, and to pull
down, and to destroy it, if that Nation against whom I have pronounced
turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto
them:</hi> so <hi>whenever I shall speak concerning a Nation, and concerning
a Kingdom to build and to plant it, if it do evil in my sight that it obey
not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
them,</hi> that is will not do it. And accordingly the Prophet
<hi>Daniel,</hi> tho it be said <hi>c. 9. 2. He understood by books the number of
years, that God would after seventy years restore Jerusalem,</hi> yet saith
<hi>Theodoret</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he did not stand still and expect the fulfilling of
God's promise of it, but <hi>v. 3. sets his face to the Lord God to seek by
praiers and supplications, with fasting, and sackloth, and ashes,</hi> as
knowing <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, tho he had promis'd it a thousand times, if we
render our selves unworthy of it, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> we put a bar against
God's performance, do not suffer him to make it good: and in
those solemn supplications and addresses to Almighty God thus he
bespeaks him <hi>v. 4. O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;</hi>
whereupon S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Jerom</hi> saith, <hi>non ergo quod pollicetur Deus
statim futurum est, sed in eos sua promissa implet, qui custodiunt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>data
illius;</hi> what God does promise any, is not therefore sure to be
fulfilled; those are they whom he performs with, who keep his
Commandments. With the rest that do not but transgress, the
Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> in an emblem shews God's way of dealing <hi>c. 11. 10.
And I took my staff, even beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break
my covenant which I had made with all the people:</hi> and we see the real
practice with that Nation for their wickednesses <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. from the
30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse. Now this being thus in general declar'd that all men
cannot trust God, we are therefore as to this particular person, this
I here to find out how he was qualified for this dependance.</p>
                  <p>It is certain first that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> had bin a great Sinner, a Blasphemer,
Persecutor and injurious person: 'tis true he says 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. he
was so <hi>ignorantly, out of unbelief,</hi> he knew not nor believ'd that he
did ill in doing what he did; yea more, he said that he liv'd in all
good Conscience before God all that time also, had don nothing
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40114:121"/>
which he was not perswaded in his conscience that he ought to do.
But altho this good conscience might prepare him for a readier and
more sound conversion, than profane, presumtuous, habitual Sinners
are dispos'd for; (for the will of such a one is true to God and right
already, and you have but to remove the ignorance of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
a little better information must reform him, and will
turn his persecuting and whatever other factious or injurious heats
into true zeal, holy devout warmths, as it did in him,) yet while
he was mistaken, that his good but erring conscience could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
excuse, much less could it sanctify his actions; 'twas injury,
'twas blasphemy and persecution, tho 'twas conscience, guilts these
of a bloudy and deep scarlet, and this very conscientious man found
cause to call himself <hi>the chief of Sinners v.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit secondly he tells us <hi>v. 16. for this cause I obtained mercy,
that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering for a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
to them that should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting;</hi>
that in me the worst of men might have example and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to depend upon him for eternal mercies, if they will but
come in to him, he was pleas'd to shew me mercy, call me in the
very flagrancy and execution of my crimes.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon, as he says thirdly, he not onely was not disobedient
to the Heavenly Calling, but (as if by owning himself chief of
Sinners he had set himself a standard for his service, put upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
an obligation to be chief of all Christ's Votaries) he became
more laborious in his duty than all others; and particularly so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
faithful, resolute and constant, as nothing could remove
him, neither opposition stop him, nor temtation divert him. Now
it is this faithfulness, this being honest-hearted to Almighty God;
'tis the firmness of this purpose to go thro with duty in a constant
tenor of obedience in whatever circumstance we are plac'd, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
happens not to be allur'd nor frighted, neither biass'd nor
forc'd out of it, with the consciencious pursuance of this resolution
that particularly qualifies for this secure dependance upon God for
success, it does dispose a man for perfect resignation of himself and
full assurance. It was S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> case here, <hi>for this I suffer,</hi> saith he,
(and indeed he liv'd almost in constant martyrdom) yet all this
does not in the least discourage me, but by God's gracious assistance
I will do my duty, come what can come. Now discerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
thus resolv'd and thus assisted, he concludes that he hath ground
enough for trust, for he that is thus faithful to him may trust on
him; then he says, <hi>I know whom I have believed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that we may not think this is an instance solitary, in the
third of <hi>Daniel,</hi> when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> told the three Children, <hi>If
ye worship not the Image I have set up, ye shall be cast the same hour into
the midst of a burning fiery furnace, and who is that God that shall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you out of my hands? Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
and said to the King, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to
answer thee in this matter; if it be so, our God whom we serve is able to
deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of
thine hand, O King: but if not, (i. e.</hi> but if he would not) <hi>be it
known unto thee, O King, that we will not serve thy Gods, nor worship
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40114:122"/>
the golden image which thou hast set up.</hi> The being conscious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that they were thus resolv'd in earnest not to offend against the
Lord, but to obey how dear soever their obedience cost them, and
so casting themselves on him to do what he would with them, gave
them confidence, made them know and say he would deliver them;
and so he did. It is according to the measures of discerning the
integrity and faithfulness of our own hearts that <hi>we assure our hearts
before him,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John</hi> expresseth 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 3. 19. and then tells us,
<hi>if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all
things, v.</hi> 20. If we find not that sincerity within, if any thing be
false there, if our conscience accuse us, our own hearts condemn
us, 'tis most certain God will do so too, because he knows all those
things of us that we can know of our selves. But if we truly cannot
charge that insincerity upon our selves, we need not fear that God
will charge us with the things we are not guilty of. No surely, as
he there goes on, <hi>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we
confidence towards God, v. 21. And this is the confidence that we have
towards him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth
us; and if we know that he hears us, whatever we ask, we know that
we have the petitions that we desired of him, c. 5. 14, 15. And whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we ask, we receive of him, c.</hi> 3. 22. Thus by assuring their own
hearts to God they know this, have this confidence towards him,
<hi>i. e.</hi> have the trust and the dependance in the Text, which in what
cases it admits this strong assurance, that is here exprest by the word
<hi>know,</hi> is my next inquiry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I know.</hi> Now by the last words it should seem as if in every case,
in every thing that he can want or does desire, the person that is
qualified so, had a ground to trust with full assurance. <hi>We know,</hi>
saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John, that whatsoever we ask we receive of him;</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
in all the Spiritual needs of the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> both in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and as the Church, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had blest them and
praied for them thus: <hi>The very God of peace sanctify you wholly, and I
pray God your whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless
unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Thess.</hi> 5. 23. adds in the
24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erse, <hi>Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.</hi> And
here in this Epistle of himself he says, <hi>The Lord shall deliver me from
every evil work, and will preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom,
2 Tim.</hi> 4. 18. Nor did good men want this confidence as to the
things of this life; for in times of publick consternation, in the
want of all things <hi>Habbakuk</hi> does thus assure himself <hi>c. 3. 16, 17, 18.
When I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quiver'd at the voice, rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenness
entred into my bones, when he cometh up unto the people he will
invade them with his troops;</hi> but in that state he adds, <hi>Altho the Fig-tree
shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the Vines, the labor of
the Olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat, the flock shall be
cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls; yet I will
rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</hi> The exstasy
of trust, the rapture is too elegant and gay, too high and full of
transport to admit of any descant. Holy <hi>Job</hi> went yet a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Tho he slay me, yet will I trust in him, c.</hi> 13. 15. In a word at
once, in whatsoever God hath promis'd, there the Faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40114:122"/>
hath a right to trust. I will not be so rude as to suppose my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
so unacquainted with the rich and precious Promises, those
Christian Treasures, which God's Book is the Repository of, that
I should need to mind them of them; and indeed to do it were to
read a very great part of that Book. 'Tis sure in every case of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
whether publick or particular, real just concern, whether in
temporal, spiritual, or eternal things, in some indeed more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
than in others, but in all these there are promises; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
were made to be believ'd, and every faithful Christian that
trusts to them, does <hi>know whom he hath believ'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet it cannot be denied, since God hath threatned <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.
13, 14, &amp;c. <hi>When a Land sinneth against him by transgressing grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then he will stretch out his hand against it; and if he say, sword, go
thro the Land, and pour out fury upon it in bloud, and break the staff
of bread thereof;</hi> he swears, <hi>tho Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it,
they should but deliver their own souls:</hi> then if we chance to see
wickedness overspread a Nation, vice and profaness grown so
universal and habitual, that 'tis almost natural; when impunity
hath made it safe and upon that account familiar, and then fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
practice made it necessary, yea and great examples made it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,
and by this all virtue is made mean and contemtible, and
insolently domineer'd over or derided petulantly; when a people
looks so like the thing God threaten'd so: 'tis hard to apply the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of safety to it, or with confidence rely upon God for its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.
And yet there is the resolution of a case so like this in
the Prophet <hi>Micah c.</hi> 7. as is able to revive a dying hope, and give
it vigor and security: <hi>Wo is me, for I am as when they have gathered
the summer-fruits as the grape-gleanings of the Vintage, there is no
cluster to eat: the good man is perished out of the Land, and there is
none upright among men; they all lie in wait for bloud, they hunt every
every man his brother with a net. That they may do evil with both
hands, the Prince asketh, and the Judg asketh for a reward, and the
great man uttereth his mischievous desire, so they wrap it up. The best
of them is as a briar, the most upright sharper than a thorn-hedg:</hi> and
then he adds, <hi>the day of visitation cometh, now shall be their perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
but he recollects himself and says, <hi>Therefore I will look unto the
Lord, I will wait for the God of my salvation, my God will hear me. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
not against me, O mine Enimy, when I fall I shall arise, when I sit
in darkness the Lord shall be a light unto me.</hi> So that when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hope well of the Commonwealth, yet we may hope in God still.
And I pray you tell me whether way looks quieter and safer, hath
more comfortable expectations, to confederate, make factions,
lay plots, dark, somtimes illegal, and unjust contrivances, and
sow the seeds of trouble and dissention, and think with these to
carry all their own away, not enduring to submit to Providence, or
be contented with God's dispensations, but will help him, as if he
had need of such arts or instruments, and could not govern except
his commands were broke: when 'tis certain such contrivances, if
they do not thwart his counsels, (which if they comport not with,
he laughs at and defeats,) yet they do his commands; and then he
will punish them, however he may let them give a while some
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40114:123"/>
trouble. And then whether is this better, or to do our duty faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and trust God? when we are assur'd, if<note n="a" place="margin">Matt. 10. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>one sparrow, two of
which are worth yet but one farthing, fall not to the ground without our
Heavenly Father,</hi> a Church and State shall not fall without him.
But yet 'tis certain Governments are somtimes broken or else fall in
pieces, and while the fury of the sword does ravage all, the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
as well as guilty suffer the same miseries, and the same car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
does devour the righteous with the wicked; yea Religion
hath bin swept away too by the inundation, and whole Churches
have bin quite un-Christian'd; and no doubt there was all reason
in the world for this. Yet tho I will not take upon me to mark out
the lines by which God moves either in his ways of mercy or of
judgment, nor to give the reasons of them; yet when plenty hath
brought in all sorts of luxury and dissoluteness, and (as it must
needs) that corrupts all, loosens all the bonds by which Societies
and Government consist, the very bonds of common right and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
those that either mens propriety or their security and lives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on, and besots men so, as that they take no other rule or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of their interests than as things serve the ends and satisfactions
of luxurious appetites; and if Religion also, while 'tis trampled on,
despised and scofft down by such sensual persons that have no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and so not having countenance, being injur'd, and cut short
by others, does decay; or else, if willing to comply and save it self,
it grow it self debaucht in some measure, learn by formalities to
serve worldly purposes; yea possibly learns to adopt principles and
consecrate some practices which are enimies to the very nature of
Religion, wound, destroy Christianity, and dishonor the God of it:
if every thing does thus seem to provoke and call for present ruin,
and God stir himself up, as he did in the<note n="b" place="margin">Jer. 5. 9.</note> Prophet, <hi>Shall I not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
for these things, shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation
as this;</hi> yet in such a Nation if there be enough remaining of those
that can stand in the gap and maintain the breach against him, as
once <hi>Moses</hi> alone did, he will turn away his indignation, so as not to
stir up his whole wrath; and, altho he leave them not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punisht,
he will not destroy them utterly. Now he knows what the
numbers are of faithful Christians, such as wrestle day and night
with him and do not let him rest. If the hairs of our heads be all
numbred, sure the knees are, that cleave to the ground in humble
adorations and petitions to him. Yea and so they are; for when
<hi>Elijah</hi> brought his charge in against <hi>Israel,</hi> whose condition lookt
so desperate, that he thought there was no servant of God but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>I, even I onely am left, 1 Kings</hi> 19. 10. God tells him <hi>v.</hi> 18. he
had <hi>seven thousand knees in it that had never bowed to Baal:</hi> and
when those three <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> are not able, seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men yet may prevail. Indeed if once Religion grow so low,
be so defiled that 'tis not worth preserving with all those corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
that get into it, when not onely the Professors of it are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd,
but its very constitution in its vitals, in the doctrines both
of faith and manners vitiated; and it is hard to shew where God
did ever overthrow a Church and a Religion wholly, where it was
not so; and then it was not he that did destroy it, it destroy'd it
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40114:123"/>
self. If also in a state Judgment be turned into Wormwood, and
you find oppression for Justice, and for Righteousness behold a
crying; in a word, if a Church and State sink by such proportions
as <hi>Sodom</hi> and the rest of the Cities of the Plain, when in all <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi>
there was not ten Righteous, for whose sake five great Cities
might be spar'd: in fine, when once they have wrought out the
measure of God's mercies, and their iniquity is full, it is no wonder
if the measure of their Judgment be full too, and it self irreversible
and utter. But yet tho in all these Judgments, whether partial or
final, Innocent and Righteous persons suffer with the wicked, <hi>All
things come alike to all, there is one event to the clean and to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not, as is the
good so is the sinner, and he that sweareth as he that feareth an oath,
Ecclesiastes</hi> 9. 2. So as that it should seem the sincere Christian can
no more depend than others, or if he do his trust will fail him; yet
to omit the reasons of this dispensation of God's Providenc which
are many very just ones, that alone sufficeth good men in the midst
of all such Judgments to depend upon, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> writes on the
very account of such distresses and necessities <hi>Rom. 8. 28. We know
that all things work together for good to them that love God;</hi> even those
afflictions working for them <hi>a far more exceeding and eternal weight
of glory 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 17. They are God's words, and so trusting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on them we <hi>know whom we have believed,</hi> namely God, the
person, and my last part, wherein I am to enquire on what accounts
especially he that does depend upon him in these cases hath assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
such as that he can profess, <hi>I know whom I have believed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now there is scarce that Attribute in God which is not a firm
ground for resignation of our selves to, and of reliance on him.
But to pass all those, which are every where in God's Book to be
met with, and are urg'd with all advantage, and to name two
other onely. First 'tis certain that we may with the most comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
hope and greatest confidence rely on him, who, when we have
most need, is readiest to relieve. As we read in the Scripture of an
accepted time, of the day of Salvation, to let us know that it is not
to be catcht in every season, as if whensoever we shall have a mind
to be delivered and ask for it, God must hearken and command de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances;
no sure there are proper set times, and we must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
in waiting for it: so also ordinarily that the time of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
need is God's opportunity, and the day of extremity the day of
Salvation, is obvious. All other times he tries us and does exercise
our virtues, but when we are past all other help, then he relieves us.
Therefore <hi>David</hi> is most peremtory with the Lord on that account
<hi>Psalm 102. 13, 14. Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion; for it
is time that thou have mercy upon her, yea the time is come. And why?
thy servants think upon her stones, and it pitieth them to see her in the
dust:</hi> and <hi>Psalm 9. 9. The Lord also will be a refuge</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
LXXII. <hi>in opportunitatibus, in tribulatione,</hi> in the
true opportunity, that is, when trouble comes. And we shall find
a reason for this way of working in his Praier <hi>Psalm 109. 26, 27.
O save me according to thy mercy, that they may know that this is thy
hand, and that thou, Lord, hast don it.</hi> When we are in such distress
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:40114:124"/>
as is past man's aid, then if deliverance come we cannot chuse but
know the hand: when we are in darkness and dimness of anguish,
<hi>and if we look unto the earth behold nothing but darkness as of the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of death,</hi> then if any light arise we know it is the <hi>day-spring from
on high that visits us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if besides this reason and those Texts we but consult the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
of God's actings, we shall find it always thus: and not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
those that refer to particular persons, of which <hi>Joseph's</hi> single
story is a manifold instance, which also gave birth to those great
events which shall make up a demonstration that this is the way of
God's procedure. In <hi>Egypt</hi> when the design was laid so, that the
People of <hi>Israel</hi> could not have lasted longer than one Age, (for
posterity was forbidden, and the Nation was to be murder'd by a
prohibition of being born,) and when they could not to avoid this
persecution get out thence, except the sea would at once make a
passage for them, and a wall and rampart to secure that passage;
and if it also should do so, it would but land them in a wilderness,
and they but fled from water to perish for want of it, and escapt
being drown'd to die with thirst; a place too where unless the
desert can bring forth the bread of Heaven, unless Flesh and
Manna can grow there where nothing grew, they have but chang'd
their fate, and brought themselves into a more unavoidable and
speedy ruin: when this state of exigence was come, then God
comes in by weak means, a stammering tongue and little rod works
all deliverance.</p>
                  <p>And again afterwards in the captivity of that Nation, a state
which <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Prophet when he had bewailed in sorrowful elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
in lamentations that live still, yet<note n="c" place="margin">Jer. 9. 1.</note> wish'd <hi>his head had bin
a fountain of tears</hi> to weep for it; when in seventy years the people
was so mixt, incorporated with their Conquerors, as must needs be
very hard to separate and tear them asunder; and as for their
Temple it was ruin'd and despoil'd of all its holy furniture, which
was not onely rob'd but desecrated and profan'd, so as not to be
likely nor scarce fit to be returned, the vessels of the Sanctuary
being made the utensils of their Idol-feasts and their own riots, and
those holy bowls made up their drunkeness as well as sacriledge:
yet when these conquering Robbers were enjoying their spoils and
crimes, as if wine in those holy bowls did stupity men past all sense,
they and the great <hi>Babylon</hi> are taken ere they knew it, and the
<hi>Jews</hi> return strait follow'd.</p>
                  <p>Again, when <hi>Cestius Gallus</hi> had sate down before <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at the
Feast of Tabernacles, when the Nation being oblig'd by their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was all in that City, and the Christians of the Land were there
too, after several assaults, and when he might have taken it, he on
a sudden rais'd the siege <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, saith <hi>Josephus,</hi> without any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
no body knows why, but onely as God put it in his heart to do
so to give way for the Christians to obey that voice, which the same
<note n="d" place="margin">De Bello l. 6. c. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>Josephus</hi> saith was heard in the Temple at the Feast of Pentecost,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>let us go hence,</hi> and upon it all the Christians went
to <hi>Pella,</hi> not one staid, but every one escapt that ruin which
<hi>Titus</hi> sitting down before that City, brought upon that People,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40114:124"/>
(the great Enimies of his Church) to a final utter desolation.</p>
                  <p>Once more, when after the nine Persecutions, which like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
torrents of fire had swept away the Christians in flame, <hi>Dioclesians</hi>
like a tenth wave came as if it meant to swallow not the relicks onely
of Christ's Church, but also all the memory of the other cruelties;
when in one small Province in a month he put to death one hundred
and fourty four thousand Christians; banish'd seven hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
more, and proportionably so in other places thro the <hi>Roman</hi>
world with such success, that he took confidence to write on his
triumphal Arches, <hi>Deleto nomine Christiano,</hi> as he had blotted out
the very name of Christians, then at the last gasp of his Church it
pleas'd the Lord to raise up <hi>Constantine,</hi> and strait the whole face of
the world was Christian, and <hi>Dioclesian</hi> himself liv'd to see it. I
might have instanced in our own so fresh deliverance, but that it
would not look like an incouragement, it may be, to rely and cast
our selves again upon him, if so soon we call upon our selves the same
needs by the same wretchless methods; and there are some, they
say, that apprehend so. And God knows the ruin of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and our Church hath from its first beginning bin still working
by her restless indefatigable Enimies, and hath often bin preserv'd
onely on the account I am now speaking, that when things are past
all humane help, then is God's set time for relief. I know the
Churches Adversaries brag of multitudes, and they come up on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
side close to her; yea and which is worse, we seem to labor to
make God himself our Enimy, or at least provoke him to desert
that Chutch and Reformation we pollute so, put out the Worship
we unhallow and profane so by ill lives, make those that will
have nothing of Religion but some forms it may be loose them too,
and let them die for want of substance, and the shew go out, not
leave so much as the hypocrisy of piety. Indeed a flood of Atheism
and contemt of all Religion and virtue looks like a just dereliction
of them who would not let God be in their thoughts, nor Religion
or Morality in their actions. Nay may it not look like a kindness
to remove the Gospel which proves onely the <hi>savor of death unto
death,</hi> put out that light which men are but resolv'd to sin against?
Or can there be a greater mercy than to refuse all the means of
mercy to such men as onely make them work out condemnation to
them?<note n="e" place="margin">Dan. 9. 8, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>O Lord, to us indeed belongs confusion of face,</hi> but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<hi>to the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, tho we
have rebelled against him;</hi> and as he knows how to reserve the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
to the day of Judgment to be punish'd, he knows too how
many thousand knees do bow to him in secret, reckons all those
tears that are pour'd out in Religion's and the Churches cause; and
how wicked soever the Professors of Religion, the Church Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
may be, if the constitution of Religion and the Church them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
yet be not vitiated or defective, there is hope still. And
truly whereas many blame the Reformation that it did not keep
more hold upon the Consciences of the Community, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
some power, which altho not of Divine Institution, but things
warily and by degrees brought in as seeming to work towards piety,
and most certainly in humane ways of judging serving to procure
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40114:125"/>
more veneration and outward security of the Church and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
to work out which the other consequential worldly interests
we see the very scheme of some Professions, not their discipline
onely but their faith too is contriv'd: I think on the other side, if
our Reformation instead of doing thus, as it consulted not at first
with carnal Politicks, but Christ's institutions as the Scripture and
other primitive Records conveied them, and design'd no more to
themselves than those bare naked Spiritual doctrines, rights and
powers which Christ gave them, left to <hi>Cesar</hi> whatsoever was <hi>Cesar's,</hi>
knowing God had promis'd Kings should be their Nursing-fathers;
and to be so, is part of their Office: trusting therefore God and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
with their protection, and defence of Church and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
So also if thro all succeeding times, whether of flourish or
depression and calamity, Religion it self, whatever its Professors
are, have retain'd always the same simplicity of principles, be it
self untainted, not new model'd to serve ends or interests, then
whenever men shall begin to clip it, I do not say in maintenance,
seizing what their Father's sacriledge had left them, but I mean
because ours did not so as other Churches, grasp some usurpt power
to secure their own, shall therefore cut her Spiritual powers short,
so that they cannot serve the ends of piety; because they know her
Children will not, cannot by their principles resist, <hi>i. e.</hi> if they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
to destroy them for this reason, that they make men the
best Subjects and of the most Christian Principles; that is, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
their Christianity it self, and martyr that; I must profess that
it will look like God's set <hi>appointed time to arise and to have mercy
upon Sion;</hi> when it is expos'd a naked Orphan, left to his protection
onely, then he cannot pass it by; but when he sees it <hi>in its bloud</hi>
thus, <hi>he will say unto it, live:</hi> and tho he plague her wicked and
ungracious Sons, and possibly take away many of the good ones
from the evil to come, yet the Religion will not die. Let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it hopeless who desire a pretence to leave it, who do what
they can to stab their Mother, and make it a reason to forsake her
then, because she is so desperately wounded; and let them declare
it, who design to betray men out of it. But whether is wiser to
believe these, or the God from whom we have these promises, and
these experiences, and the other grounds of trust? Sure we <hi>know</hi>
better <hi>whom we have believed,</hi> especially since the very trust to him
is an engagement to him not to fail us: that's my last ground.</p>
                  <p>'Tis it self a means prescrib'd us by himself, <hi>Isaiah 50. 10. Who is
he among you that feareth the Lord, that walketh in darkness &amp; hath no
light? Let him trust in the name of the Lord, &amp; stay upon his God.</hi> There
is nothing in the world that more engages any man that is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligately
false, than trusting to him; and for God, there is no other
piece of piety or virtue gives such honor to him &amp; his Attributes, as
sincere dependance on him do's. It does acknowledge his Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that he knows our needs, &amp; be they never so perplext &amp; intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
knows how to help them; his Omnipresence, that he is at hand
on all occasions; his Omnipotence, how he is able above all our pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of want; his Mercy, Goodness, &amp; Benignity, in that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended
to be willing to relieve us; his Faithfulness, &amp; Truth, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40114:125"/>
Justice, in observing his good promises and never failing them, and
his Immutability in all these and his other Attributes of loving
kindness. Now truly as our miseries requir'd all these, so our trust
to him gives him the glory of all these; and therefore 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if some men made this reliance or dependance, trust or faith
our whole condition of the Covenant. But tho 'tis true the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
does require some disposition in us that we also may be trusted,
for those that are not faithful to him, cannot have faith in him;
for us he knows our needs, he knows our hearts too, and if they be
false he sees it, and the trust is broken on both sides: such hearts
cannot trust him, for it is impossible that one can trust upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if he know that other does discern that he is false to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
he knows that he is not in condition to be dealt with by the rules of
trust. Yet the sincere and honest-hearted person may cast all his
care there, Faith does his work, and he <hi>knows</hi> well <hi>whom he hath
believed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sum is this, however grievous Sinner one hath bin, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and with intire submission to God's will become faithful to
him, and assure his own heart towards him, he may commit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and all his Spiritual and Eternal interests with all assurance ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
into his hands, and his temporal so far as they shall be suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful
in all cases, except those wherein God sees it necessary for his
more advantage to determin otherwise. All his concerns too for
Religion he may put into the same safe hands with all assurance;
for God will never destroy his own Religion, if it do not change
first, vitiate and put out it self. And in whatever Judgments God
at any time shall bring upon the publick, he may perfectly ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re
himself, that whatsoever happens, shall be for good to him; for
how sad soever the necessity be, he knows both it and how to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
it, and is able and hath said he will, he is true and just and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in his promises, it is his very Nature that he cannot change or
fail him; and how desperate soever his condition seem here, that
state is God's opportunity, and that time his set time, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on him is yet a further engagement to him.</p>
                  <p>Yet in all this I have said very little, all these grounds for trust
&amp; reliance the old Covenant afforded. Thus far the <hi>Jew knew whom he
had believ'd;</hi> but sure the Christian knows more comfortably, hath
more cause to trust on God as on the <hi>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
And certainly we may rely upon that Father, that he will deny us
nothing, who denied ns not his son. 'Tis S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> argument
<hi>Rom. 8. 32. He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
all; how shall he not with him also freely give us all things.</hi> We may
resign our selves into his hands that lov'd us at these rates, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be confident as the Apostle was <hi>v. 38, 39. that neither death
nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,
nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall
be able to separate us from the love of God,</hi> which he hath to us in and
thro Christ our Lord and Savior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or shall hinder him from preserving
and delivering us in and from the hopes and fears, the terrors and
allurements of them all, the temtations that either fear of death or
hope of life, or malice of the Devil and his Angels, or of Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40114:126"/>
or powers, whether earthly Potentates or infernal, or distresses
present or to come, or heights of honor or depths of disgrace may
assault us with. How can these hinder, when sin could not hinder?
Or what possibly can separate, when God chose to be divided as it
were from his own Son, rather than any thing should separate him
from the love of man? And then what may we not expect from
this, the Eternal Son of God, who became one of us, that so he
himself <hi>suffering by being temted might be able to succour them that are
temted?</hi> Heb. 2. 18. <hi>Able to succour?</hi> Sure he could have don it ere
he took upon him weak flesh, being God Almighty; he was not less
able, when he was Omnipotent: yet being, when he was made
man himself, afflicted, having the experience of our infirmities,
in all points temted like as we are, he is enabled to be much more
sensibly compassionate and toucht with the feeling of our weak
condition, which himself felt: so the ability which he hath gain'd,
is the Omnipotency of kindness. One would have thought indeed
it had bin large enough before, when to shew mercy to us seem'd
more dear to him and more considerable than to enjoy Divinity,
when he emtied himself of this, that he might be qualified for the
other. How infinitely willing then was he to be compassionate to us,
when he takes flesh to learn to be compassionate? How desirous
was he to succour us, who lays down Heaven and glory above, and
life here below, that he might be able to succour us? To whom
can we betake our selves for mercy with such confidence, as him
who made himself like one of us, that he might be a merciful High-Priest
to expiate and make reconciliation? We that are the sheep
of his pasture, what hands can we possibly resign our Souls into with
such assurance, as to those of this Bishop and Shepherd of our Souls,
this good Shepherd who not onely seeks the lost sheep that is run
away, but who also <hi>lays down his life for his sheep?</hi> 10. 15. And what
may not his poor Church depend upon him for, who <hi>purchased to
himself his Church with his own bloud?</hi> What design can he have to
fail us possibly, who would be crucified for us? In a word, if one
that for us men and for our Salvation would come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
be incarnate and made man, a man of sorrows and afflictions,
and would suffer want shame and reproches, agonies, a Cross, a bitter
passion and a cruel death for us; and who is sat down on the right
hand of Majesty and Power, hath all power in Heaven and Earth,
the keys of Death and Hell; in whom all the promises of God are
<hi>yea</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> faithful and true, faithful to immutability, Jesus
Christ yesterday, to day, and the same for ever: if, I say, he that
is all this, can be trusted, <hi>we know whom we have believed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now I have no more to do but onely ask, whether we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
of any other whom on more or safer grounds we have or may
believe? I will upbraid none with that Irony which <hi>Eliphas</hi> insults
on <hi>Job</hi> with <hi>c. 5. 1. Call now, see if there be any that will answer thee,
and to which of the Saints wilt thou turn thee?</hi> There are that do
with all the evidence imaginable of a strong confidence and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hopes to speed in doing so, pour out their needs, their whole
Souls to a fancied, or it may be true Saint, whom they have adopted
as the object of their invocation, which it seems they cannot do so
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40114:126"/>
feelingly, with such a close and intimate dependance, with such
comfortable expectations upon Christ himself. Now I would onely
put the question of <hi rend="sup">f</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> to such a one, was that Saint <hi>crucified
for thee,</hi> that he should be more concerned for, and more sensible
of thy condition, and that thou shouldest have a greater confidence
of his good will, than of his that did and suffer'd all that for thee,
that he might be merciful and faithful, toucht with thy necessities,
that I mention not the rest of those qualifications that do make one
fit to be relied upon? 'Tis to be fear'd such persons do not know
well <hi>whom they have believ'd.</hi> But I pass them. There are that trust
their being here to Policy and Prudence, to their own contrivances,
that is, trust to themselves, and give credit onely to what interest
or their ambition suggests, and accordingly design ends, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
means, weave plots, spread their nets abroad with cords, and
lay snares, and do all this with that confidence of success, as if they
did believe they were fulfilling Prophecies, and mov'd by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Heaven; for many times they seem to do this in the fear
of God, and in subserviency to Religion: but whatever fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
some of them may have to wash or color their intentions,
God, you may be sure, hath no hand there in those designs, where
his Commandments are broken. Where you discern either as to
particulars, treachery, or fraud, or falseness, undermining and
supplanting to serve interests, or pride, or malice, or revenge; or
as to publick, interverting justice and the due course of Laws, or
mutiny, sedition, raising discontents, and making breaches, 'tis
not he on whom they have believ'd. And did they but consider
what they see perpetually, how false interests are, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
high place; how this tumbles men down headlong, those
change daily; and altho men thrive so that they wash their steps
with butter, they are only so much more in slippery places, where
God also leaves them, somtimes overturns them suddenly. Or did
they consider who the great Patrons of interest and ambition are,
<hi>Mammon</hi> the fomenter and encourager of almost all the mischiefs
upon Earth, and <hi>Lucifer</hi> that was discontent in Heaven, had ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be greater there too, mutinied and stirred sedition up against
God, and got by it to be chief of Devils onely, Prince of Hell. Did
these designers but reflect on these things, they would know then
<hi>whom they have believ'd,</hi> a deceitful world, a false glistering light
that mocks them, and a treacherous malicious Devil that hath bin
a Liar and a Murderer from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>I might ask the sensual person, whether he that hearkens to the
cravings of the one or other of his inclinations, and is so perswaded,
overcome by their insinuations, that whenever any of his appetites
is high, he thinks there is no joy that is like the satisfaction of that
appetite, and is mad till he have it; yet hath found himself betraied,
fool'd, cheated every time he serv'd it, but still courts and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
the false treacherous mischief, and will not be disenchanted,
whether he considers <hi>whom he hath believ'd,</hi> whether he knows that
he lets his horse ride him, and is guided, animated by, and believes
the beast.</p>
                  <p>Once more, whether he knows <hi>whom he hath believ'd,</hi> that ownes
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40114:127"/>
being an Infidel, any one of those that with great seeming gravity,
or wit and railery declares dissatisfaction at the proof of those
things, which the world for many hundred years continued so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of, that they chose to die rather than say that they did not
believe them: when as for them, good Souls, they think they can
believe nothing but upon demonstration; yet if a man consider but
the men themselves, the method and the means of their conviction
into that their unbelief, he would find that themselves are always
vicious, and that they examin little but converse much, and keep
company with them that in the heat and confidence of drink and
vice swear 'tis impossible those things can be, and rally them that
give heed to or profess them; and then themselves give easy credit
to this and their own inclinations, that would have them all impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
for it is their concern, they are eternally unhappy if they be
not: so that we know whom they have believ'd, their debaucht
company and their evil inclinations; and these stupid Infidels are
the most credulous, we see, on the least grounds of any in the world.
It is not my emploiment at this time to make comparison betwixt
the one and others grounds, the several motives of belief and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity;
'tis plain, Christ Judg'd the arguments and grounds of faith
were so sufficient, that he positively gives his charge thus,<note n="f" place="margin">Mark 16. 15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Go and
preach the Gospel to the whole world, he that believeth is sav'd, and he
that believeth not is damn'd.</hi> And if his threats are as inviolable as
his promises, 'twill be but ill knowing him, whom we would not
believe; the conviction will be very fatal, when their unbelief will
become vision. And this gives me yet occasion to ask, what temta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Sinners can have not to believe, to be willing to come in
to Christ and be sav'd? They cannot chuse but see all others whom
they have believ'd, betraied them and will fail them: all their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions
must go out, their expectations die and perish, and why
will ye not take up here then, why will ye die for ever? Is your
case, think you, desperate, and have you gon too far to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
if you should turn? Why our Saint here, the person of the
Text declares, he was the <hi>chief of Sinners</hi> that obtain'd mercy for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to all that would believe and turn: and if you did but
know whom he believ'd, you must know one that went to meet the
Prodigal in his return, when he was yet far off; that sought the
lost sheep while he straied and ran away still, till he found him, and
when he was gon so far that he could not return, he carried him.
And will you neither be invited into life, nor carried into it?
Why will ye die? Can ye not help it? Have your inclinations
and customs, think you, so prevail'd upon you, that to leave them
looks impossible? Then 'tis plain you <hi>know not whom you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd.</hi>
Is any thing impossible for him, that is Almighty, whose
grace is sufficient? Or can he command too hard things, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables
to perform what he commands, who, as<note n="g" place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in us both to will and to do,</hi> if we will suffer him? He never praied
and tried in earnest, watched, endeavor'd, and comported with
God's workings, that complains thus. You cannot but believe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are too hard while you hearken to the cravings of your
lusts, your customs and your inclinations; but why will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40114:127"/>
them still? Why will you die? Is it not in fine worth while
to strive against it, but e'en go on with the stream, abandon all
consideration of concern for that life? Indeed if that which God
thought worth the concern of all his Attributes, the contrivance of
his Wisdom, the assistances of his Almightiness, the invitations of
his Promises, the engagement of his Justice, Truth and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
worth all the issues of his Goodness Mercy and Benignity,
worth the Incarnation, Death and Passion of his Son, worth Christ's
Bloud to purchase, worth the giving him all Power in Heaven and
Earth, exalting him to his own right hand a Prince and Savior to
give us repentance and remission, that we might be capable of that
life, and then to bestow it on us: if this be not worth the while to
strive for, not in opposition to Hell eternal, then indeed we know
not whom we have believ'd. Consider how it is this issue that such
put it to, a most fatal issue, but the sure one of all those that will
give credit to the suggestions of their flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this world; Lord
Christ, <hi>we believe</hi> thee, <hi>help our unbelief.</hi>

THE CHILDREN OF THIS WORLD
are wiser than the Children of Light.</head>

                     <bibl>Luke 16. 8.</bibl>
                     <q>The Children of this world are in their Generation wiser than
the Children of Light.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the <hi>Children of this World</hi> are meant those
that look after and take care for onely the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and satisfactions of this World, have
no thought of, or at most design for any other:
by the <hi>Children of Light</hi> all those that see far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
into one to come, and who look after
that; accordingly all Christians are called so,
1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 5. of whom howsoever some are more
and some less Christian, all yet are suppos'd to have bin <hi>visited by
that day-spring from on high,</hi> enlightned in some measure by the
Gospel, which <hi>brought Life and Immortality to light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Those former are said here, <hi>in their generation,</hi> in their own
affairs of this World, (which alone they busy and concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in,) or in their contrivance for their Age or time in this life,
to be <hi>wiser</hi> than those others. Now Wisdom, tho it import many
offices and of highest concernment, which have place in every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
action of our lives, it weighs interests and obligations, and
considers circumstances, which do somtimes make necessities, and
somtimes void them, and which cannot all fall under Rules and
Precepts, and are therefore left to the decisions of Prudence which
does judge of them, and then accordingly direct and steer the
actions; yet these offices of Wisdom do not come directly into this
comparison of our Savior. Its main office in the general is<note n="a" place="margin">Arist. Eth. l. 6. c. 5.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>to consult and counsel well and rightly,</hi> which acts, since they
cannot be emploi'd but about things that must be don in order to
an end; therefore</p>
                  <p>1. The Wise man always looks at, and intends some end; and</p>
                  <p>2. He pitches on such means as seem most useful, and directly
tending to that end: yea</p>
                  <p>3. Since this Wisdom is not speculative, but<note n="b" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is
<hi>Ratio agibilium,</hi> deals in things that must be don; it therefore sets
the man upon the use of those means in pursuit of that end, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40114:128"/>
him to it and guides him in the execution, and does all by
Rules proper to each one of these Offices.</p>
                  <p>Now as to these three Offices of Wisdom, we will try to find out
how far, and in what respect <hi>the Children of this World are wiser than
the Children of Light,</hi> the Worldling than the Christian, than the
most of them, yea than the best, and how this comes to pass; that
so if men will not be wrought upon by any Rules, not by God's
Precepts, nor by means examples, yet comparing themselves with
themselves how much they fail of the observance of the Rules of
Prudence that concern the next World in comparison of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of those very same Rules as to this World, they may shame
themselves into discretion, and may learn to be a Rule and an
Example to themselves, which I must first enforce by that property
of Wisdom, which I mention'd in the first place, that the wise
man always looks at, and intends some end.</p>
                  <p>I suppose this, and I may well do so; for the World allows the
action that hath no end, to be to no purpose, vain and foolish.
Now the worldly man, as such, proposes, as I told you, to himself
the satisfactions of this world, either more particularly of some one
kind, or else all in general; and the Child of Light, so far as he is
so, designs especially the happiness of the world to come. But
then if in relation to their aims, those men be wisest that propose
the best end to themselves, the Child of Light is as much wiser
than the worldling, as eternal Blessedness above is better than the
little broken dying starts of satisfaction here below. And truly 'tis
not in relation to their several ends in general that our Savior here
compares them, but the one, saith he, <hi>are wiser in their generation,</hi>
in their own concerns; and that first in relation to their ends.</p>
                  <p>For the worldly man is intent upon his end, his will is fixt to it,
and his affections all concenter in it. We are most assur'd of this by
the pains he takes to compass it, all which are carried on and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and made easy merely by his aims and expectation, which his
heart is therefore passionately set on; for mens actions will be
chearful, vigorous, and lively onely by those measures that the
Soul breaths spirit into them. If the will and outward faculties
lookt several ways, all his external motions would be force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
not nature; but since his pursuits are eager, his affections
are in them. I should enter into an Abyss of matter and should
find no end of the discourse, should I attemt to shew this in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
states of men of this World in relation to their several inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to this World's advantages. Some pour out and sell the bloud
and souls both of their own and other Nations, but to purchase
some accession to their Territories, to enlarge their bounds and
glory. And it is matter of astonishment how 'tis possible that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature should attain to such a monstrous excess of barbarous &amp;
bloudy villany to acquire their ends, as <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> practis'd.
Yet neither should men wonder, and complain of these so much;
for every little great man, that hath power, would be enterprizing
upon others, outing and supplanting, catching at more power,
cutting short, diminishing the rights of others to extend their own:
and altho these Aggressors be not bloudy as the former, (which 'tis
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40114:129"/>
possible they would be, if they durst,) yet they are as unjust and
false; and they that are not able to do so much, are not in a state
to put a force on others, force themselves, break their own natures
into soft compliances and servile attendances to reach their ends.
'Tis thus in all conditions, the Soldier charges and storms fire, and
the Merchant storms the raging Sea and Tempests; and if the
man's heart be once bent on getting wealth, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ells his meals, his
sleeps, his sweat, the whole emploiment of his life, and his anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for that which onely brings him more care and more parsimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and by consequence more want.</p>
                  <p>Now is there any thing that is like this in those others who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to aim at Heaven and the Blessedness that God is happy in?
Nay do they mind it cordially, when they stand before him in his
house in order to it? Or is their heart upon it there, while they
are praying for it? Whenever we discern religious performances
are uneasy or unpleasing to us, we may then assure our selves the
mind is not intent upon the end of them. For 'tis impossible he
should not busy, concern himself extremely in the things that his
affections are engag'd in, which possess him mainly, and which are
his treasure. But 'tis as when God askt the question by the Prophet
<hi>Jeremy c. 2. 32. Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire?
Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</hi> He asks
a gentler question by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah c. 49. 15. Can a woman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
her sucking child, that she should not remember the fruit of her
womb?</hi> There is some object for an heart, that it should mind and
pour out it self in tenderness to that dear part of its own breast and
bowels; it is no wonder, if it be not with so sensible affection set on
any of those remoter objects, such as God and Salvation in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
but that they should be less considerable than attire, the Robe
of Immortality not so much minded as a dress, that to be gay
should challenge morning hours and cares, but to be blessed scarce
engage a praier, wish, or thought, is sad. The truth is, such is
man's corruption, that there is scarce any inclination left in nature
that desires, or is indeed content to be upon the way to Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
Before any thing can be don for man, he must be made willing
not to destroy himself; for<note n="c" place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> tells us 'tis <hi>God</hi> that by his
power <hi>worketh in us both to will and to do.</hi> We must not onely be
oblig'd by duty not to neglect and forsake our own mercies, but we
must be wrought and made contented to receive them; all God's
arts and methods us'd, the terrors of the Lord, and the promises of
Heaven, and the strivings of the Holy Spirit, and the power of
Grace emploied to work in us to will, for it is God that <hi>worketh in
us to will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this the men of this World have especial advantages over the
generality of Christians, that they mind and are intent upon their
aim. For the mere being so engages them to the observance of
that Rule of Prudence, which above all others is to regulate the
counsels and the actions of all men in order to their several ends,
if they mean to act wisely in relation to them, which is this, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be true to their own ends, still observing their main point.
I say not they should never look off from it, mind no other; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40114:129"/>
they must do that. For as in the wise Government of
Nations Princes must take care, not onely that their Subjects live
in <hi>Godliness and honesty</hi> and keep all the Laws, but that they <hi>may live,</hi>
as<note n="d" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>peaceable and quiet lives,</hi> secure as far as may be
from the danger of their Enimies abroad or at home, in all tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and plenty; and the like in Oeconomical and Military Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
So in Christian Prudence we are so to look at everlasting life
hereafter, as not to neglect this here, but may contrive for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of this life, to avoid what may be dangerous or incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode
us, provided we do nothing that's against the other. So
<note n="e" place="margin">Acts 23., 67.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> was wise, when both the <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> conspir'd
against his life, to break that their confederacy by throwing in the
question of the Resurrection of the dead, which was certain to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
them, since the thing he said was true, and consequently
since the means he us'd did not at all clash with his higher purposes:
the Rule thus signifying, that wise men in order to whatever end
their wisdom lies, must still be true to their own end, be careful to
do nothing that may take them off from, or oppose their main
aim, (for that were to destroy their own design) and must be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
never to avoid whatever tends most to attain their purposes.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly the Children of this World are us'd to stick at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is likely to advance their ends. This was the case expresly
of the Text, and thereupon our Savior pronounces they <hi>are wiser.</hi>
The unjust Stewards aim was to provide what should maintain him
and his ease and reputation the remainder of his life, a comfortable
plentiful subsistence, when his office should be taken from him;
and discerning no way to this, but to cheat his Master, and engage
his Master's debtors in the wrong too, making them as false and
wicked as himself, regards not the injustice, but pursues his mark.
And so the Child of Light, so far as he is wise, in order to his aim,
<hi>the price of his high calling;</hi> looks directly forward to it. If he
cannot at once do his duty in relation to his great end, life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and take care of the conveniences of this life, he will not for
these let go the other, never will look after these, but when, and
so far as they will consist; does not turn aside to any other ends
that thwart that, is neither byass'd from his mark by any flattering
considerations of whatever this World temts with, nor is forc'd
from it by terrors or whatever sufferings. We have great instances
of this in the second book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> the seventh chapter,
the Mother and her seven Sons, who looking to obtain a blessed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35. did in order to it resolve to
die under God's Covenant of everlasting Life, would not therefore
accept life here, and deliverance from most cruel torments on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to transgress the Laws. Thus the three wise men in <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.
17, 18. told <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Our God whom we serve is able to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine
hand. But if not, be it known unto thee, that we will not serve thy Gods,
nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</hi> Thus <hi>Eleazar
2 Macc.</hi> 6. from <hi>v.</hi> 19. chose to die gloriously rather than to live
stain'd with an abomination, as it behov'd them that are resolute,
to stand out against such things as are not lawful to be tasted; tho
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40114:130"/>
the penalty propos'd were loss of life, and tho the Officers that
were his friends besought him to bring flesh of his own provision,
such as was lawful for him to use, and make as if he did eat of the
flesh taken from the Sacrifice, he began to consider discreetly and as
became his age and his most honest Education from a child, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the holy Law made and given by God. Therefore he willed
them straitways to send him to the grave, <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25. For <hi>it becometh not
our age in any wise to dissemble, whereby many young persons might think
that Eleazar were now gon to a strange Religion; and so they thro my hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy
and desire to live a little time should be deceived by me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Wendelin. Mor. Phil. p. 255.</note>'Tis said the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> gave this answer to King <hi>Charles</hi>
the IX. of <hi>France,</hi> who told him he must make his option either
of going to Mass, or death, or to perpetual prison: for the first
by God's help he would never chuse it, in the other he submitted
to his pleasure, but that God would certainly dispose of them as it
seem'd good to him. On the other side we have an instance,<note n="g" place="margin">Aul. Gell. Noct. Att. l. 1. c. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Chilon,</hi>
one of the wise men of <hi>Greece;</hi> who, whatsoever his last aim was, here
his end was to live justly and according to right reason, who upon his
death-bed told his friends, it was not then a time for him to flatter
&amp; deceive himself, his thoughts did not suggest unto him any thing
he had don in his whole life that troubled him but one, that when
he with two others was to sit in judgement on a man that was his
great friend, who had broke the Law so heinously that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to condemn him, looking out for some means that might
save his virtue and his friend too, he resolv'd on this, that since the
suffrages were given so that none could know what sentence any
one Judg in particular pronounc'd, he perswaded his Companions
to absolve him and himself condemn'd him, thinking thus he salv'd
his duty both as Judg and Friend: but when he came to die, he
thought 'twas wicked and perfidious to draw others in to do that,
which he held not just for him to do, he was not true to his own end,
but was diverted by the calls of friendship to serve other, and in
that he found his Wisdom fail'd him, and his Conscience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
him. So that we have seen the Rule exemplified in all kinds.</p>
                  <p>Now by this Rule we may make experiment both of the truth of
what our Savior here pronounces, and mens wisdom also of what
kind it is, what the aim is, whether of this World or of the other,
and which of the pursuers are the truer to their end, and so wiser.</p>
                  <p>There is scarce any one profession, dignity, or place of power,
nor indeed condition or state of life, but is adapted so that it may
serve ends, either of the <hi>Child of this World</hi> or the <hi>Child of Light,</hi> and
contribute either to the advantages of this life or of that which is to
come. To take a view of one or two of them: the man that gets
into authority and place, may have for his end to serve God and
his Country, if he intend it for an opportunity truly and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
to administer justice to the punishment of wickedness and
vice, and to the maintenance of God's true Religion and virtue;
by such <hi>Sons of restraint,</hi> as the Scripture calls them, vice may be
discountenanc'd, goodness cherish'd, till <hi>judgement run down like
waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Amos 5. 24.</note> and the Nation be
taught to live in peace and honesty: or he may intend to serve
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40114:130"/>
himself, to gratify his pride or his ambition by getting into place
and power, that so he may be over others, and his person more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
and his will observ'd, and himself be more uncontrolable
in his words and actions, may be vices; or to gratify his covetous
desires, if in the perquisites of his place he find an opportunity for
bribes, a power to sell justice, or what's worse, impunity of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
an office where men may buy off their duties, yea their crimes
and punishments, at least a place of doing something like this as
they find occasion. Now whereas Authority finds good men often
modest in the use of it as to its true ends of Religion and Justice,
power will scarce give them countenance and courage for its execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
'tis uneasy, or they are sollicited or aw'd, and they look off,
at least they seldom put themselves upon it as upon the prosecution
of a thing they mainly aim at, or they seldom persevere so: on the
other side in order to the other ends men struggle for them, buy the
opportunities of selling, give bribes that they may have power to
receive them, use all arts to compass offices to serve their worldly
end with. This is more notorious if the Office be Ecclesiastical,
the true end of whose Ministry is to gather Christ's Sheep that yet
go astray, to carry on the Salvation of those Souls which God hath
purchas'd with his own bloud, to preserve his Children from Eternal
Hell, to be applying to the wounds and the distempers of the body
of Christ, to prepare his Spouse for the marriage of the Lamb, to
be Dispensers and Stewards of his means of Grace and Glory; in
fine, Fellow-workers with him to the Everlasting blessedness of
those that are committed to their charge, and who is sufficient
for, and does not tremble at these things? to all which yet they do
solemnly in express words dedicate themselves and their faithful
endeavors, and are consecrated to it by the Holy Spirit. Or the
end of this Ministry may be to advance themselves, to reap the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
to receive the fleece, enjoy the honors, no great care appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of those other dreadful obligations, or concern that looks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to them: and if men will purchase this charge too, as
some say, we may be sure they do not buy the duty or those fearful
obligations, and much less the Holy Spirit or his graces; but 'tis
somwhat else they bargain for, which they break thro oaths to come
at, some other end they aim at.</p>
                  <p>2. As for states of life I must be endless should I enter into them,
to name but that which God himself did institute and first before all
others, which he made to be the complement of the felicities of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
to be mutual support in every state of life, give all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of society with innocence, to preserve from vice in the most
dangerous and fatal instances, and so assist in the recovery of lost
Paradise; to fill earth, so as by their good education it might
people Heaven, and repair its loss of faln Angels. But some also
may intend no more by it than dowry, or to serve the needs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of families, and to raise them; for as for other satisfactions,
they intend to make them to themselves much otherwise, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
not this at all a bar to any, do not look upon it as God meant
it for a remedy, because they would not be preserv'd from the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
onely they purpose to have such posterity, it may be, as
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40114:131"/>
the Law will suffer to inherit what their vices leave, and their arts
can secure from Creditors. Yet truly, since men learnt to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
or not regard their own immortality, and then learn not to
care for living after they are gon hence in a good name; it is not
strange if they esteem not living in posterity, and however brutish
they are, mind not yet that immortality which beasts endeavor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
to live in successive Offspring: yea where such men have it,
they so little mind the giving them good education, that their
vices onely seem to live in their descendants. Thus men convey
ruin into all the future Ages of their own families, and all this the
most certain consequent of depraving this Divine primary Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which was of such absolute necessity and benefit to mankind as
he judg'd, and of slighting his ends in it, drawing it aside, and so
making it of no reputation to others.</p>
                  <p>By these few instances we may discern, that there is no profession
place or state of life, but may be taught to serve ends either of the
<hi>Child of this World</hi> or the <hi>Child of Light.</hi> It is not my part to affirm
that most men make them minister to worldly purposes, that is not
necessary to make good my Thesis, which says onely that the
<hi>Children of this World</hi> are truer to their own ends, more careful to do
nothing that may call them off from, or oppose their purposes,
more certain never to avoid what tends to the attaining them, and
by consequence <hi>are in their generation wiser.</hi> Mens practice in those
instances (and 'tis the like in others) look them in the face so,
that it were a shame to prove it to them; and 'tis as easily discern'd
what kind mens wisdom is of, they need no marks to distinguish
them. In a word, he that will act wisely in order to those ends and
objects which the light of Christianity discovers and proposes, must
in every serious action look before him and consider what he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
and designs by it, and, not giving ear to the suggestions of his
prejudices, interests or any passions, shutting out their counsels,
think where and what his aims are in it; whether by what he is
about to do, he can intend an act of justice, honesty, charity or
religion; whether he can do it out of love of God and for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
or else passing by that, whether it does look another way aside
to somthing else, and then consider, since Almighty God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
just, and will be sure to punish what is grossely don amiss,
and eternally reward what is faithfully endeavor'd in his service,
whether therefore by thy action thou art going to work towards,
and ascertain thy felicity, or not. For if it be to gratify carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or worldliness, to serve but any present inclination that will call
thee off from, or will make thee worse dispos'd for duty, and will
not comport with thy designs of Piety and Heaven, then thou art
not true to thy own ends, run'st counter to thy own design and
everlasting interest; but if thou canst really and in truth intend to
do that thing for Heaven and God, on God's name do it, if I say,
thou dost intend directly by just means, that being the second pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of our wise man, that he pitches on such means as seem most
useful and directly tending to his end, which I am next to speak to.</p>
                  <p>And as to this the <hi>Child of Light</hi> is furnisht now with all, that he,
who is the Wisdom of the Father and his Everlasting Word, could
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40114:131"/>
judge was necessary or conducing to his end, and would prescribe
for the attaining it. For however in the state of Heathenism they
were much in the dark, both as to vice and virtue, and to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and punishments, and thro the prejudices of their education
in a world corrupted wholly both in practices and principles; they
sin'd out of piety, and their Religion was their greatest crime: yet
he that brought <hi>life and immortality to light,</hi> was himself<note n="f" place="margin">John 14. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>the way,
the truth and the life,</hi> the true living <hi>way</hi> to it, sent by his Father to
trace out, and walk before us in that onely true <hi>way</hi> that can bring
us to that Life and immortality. Faith and Repentance make up
the whole duty of man. To believe on him, to endeavor faithfully
and with sincerity to obey him, and when 'ere we fail, to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for it and amend, these are the true mens to attain eternal
Life, as God hath by two most immutable things assur'd us, both
by Promise and by Covenant, which he seal'd to us in the bloud of
his own Son, which bloud also purchas'd it. And his Word declares
infallibly all the Rules of our duty, not in general onely, but oft
brought down to particular cases with their circumstances, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
in most familiar instances. So that as to this part of Wisdom,
which consists in pitching upon good means, sure the <hi>Child of Light</hi>
is prepar'd as much better than the other, as the Wisdom of God
exceeds that of men. 'Tis true the other hath the compass of all
Arts, Professions, and all other humane Inventions for his choice,
but besides that they are humane, how fantastically are most put
upon their course of life as to this world? To some chance does
appoint it, others are determin'd to it oft without considering their
capacities, whether they can fulfil the obligations of the charge
they undertake, are blindly set down; one for example for a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
this a Merchant, one a Scholar, this for Law, that other for the
Gospel <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if they thought God in the distribution of his faculties
and abilities were bound to follow their rash inconsiderate appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But be the ways and means design'd well, yet how insufficient
they are for the most part for their ends is every man's complaint,
who seldom can attain them with all industry imaginable,<note n="g" place="margin">Eccles. 9. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>The race
is not to the swift, nor the battel to the strong,</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Psalm 33. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>There is no King saved
by the multitude of an host:</hi> the ways to some too are false and slippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and on a precipice, the men that aim at high place often find it,
men that build on aire, as others do on water, on the waves, men
whose means are most uncertain; so the paths in seas are also to the
Merchant, and the winds and weather: some are dangerous too as
shelves and tempests to them. So the Soldier's constant conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is with death too, and <hi>his life is</hi> always <hi>in his hand,</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi>
Yea many of the means men use are treacherous, false arts, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
frauds, injustices, and bribes breed rust and canker in the
gold and silver which they get, and <hi>eat the flesh like fire,</hi> James 5. 2.
And what is taken from the Altar hath a live coal in it. And as to
the means men use in order to the plentiful enjoiments of their good
things, the luxurious oft eats surfet, the intemperate drinks feaver,
the incontinent embraces rotteness that eats out his marrow. So that
certainly the worldly man that aims at satisfactions of this life by
such means, makes the worse choice, and were wiser, if he sought
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40114:132"/>
them also by those means that tend to life hereafter, to Salvation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the ways of piety; for as <hi>David</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> both prescribes, <hi>he
that loves life and would see good daies, let him eschew evil and do good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But he hath a very obvious objection, it is the most concerning
part of wise men in the choice of means to pitch on such as are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their power; for to deliberate about, and to intend impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
is the most horrible instance of folly. Now the man of this
world chuseth such means, as humanely speaking, seem within
man's power. But the means whereby the Christian must attain
his ends he thinks are not so, and he is glad to think so, 'tis Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and he had rather have the excuse of God's not giving grace to
him, than have the virtue; and 'tis certain truth, that God must
give it. <hi>O God, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, all just
works do proceed,</hi> saith our Church. All holy desires, for he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
the heart that his ear may hearken thereto, his Spirit is the
Spirit of supplication, he must intercede in us with grones unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
as if men need not set themselves to it, but were to wait for
inspiration for it from that Spirit who blows where he listeth. All
good counsels also and just works are from him; <hi>For we are not able
of our selves to think a good thought, as of our selves, all our sufficiency
is of God, 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 5. the very <hi>preparations of the heart</hi> are from him
<hi>Psalm</hi> 10. 17. 'tis he that does <hi>touch the heart, 1 Sam.</hi> 10. 26. and
<hi>open</hi> it, <hi>Acts 16. 14. turn</hi> it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18. he must <hi>draw</hi> us, <hi>John</hi> 6. 44.
which if he do not, no man cometh to him; and must <hi>give an heart
to know him, Jer. 24. 7. give a new heart, Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. and in all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of expression, <hi>a new spirit I will put within you, and will take
away the stony heart out of your flesh, and cause you to walk in my sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and ye shall keep my judgments and do them.</hi> In a word, he
<hi>worketh in us both to will and to do, Phil.</hi> 2. 13. Now since he onely
does all this at his own pleasure, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> affirms there, therefore
'tis not in man's power: <hi>I know, O Lord,</hi> saith <hi>Jeremy c. 10. 23. that
the way of man is not in himself, it is not in man that walketh to direct
his steps,</hi> no not to his main soveraign end. And in this the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
thinks he has advantage; but does he not know that he must
pray too, as well as labor for his own bread <hi>Matt.</hi> 6. 11. it is God
produceth all in order to it; <hi>He bringeth food out of the earth, and
giveth wine that maketh man's heart glad, and bread which strengthens
it,</hi> Psalm 104. 14, 15. <hi>He that watereth the hills from his chambers</hi> v. 13.
<hi>and his clouds drop fatness, he prepares men corn,</hi> Psalm 65. 9, 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
'Tis he that <hi>gives us power to get</hi> what we have, and he that does not
know this, knows not God, <hi>Deut. 8. 14, 17, 18. Beware that thou
forget not the Lord thy God, and say in thy heart my power and the might
of my hand hath gotten me this wealth; but thou shalt remember the
Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth,</hi> yea he
gives it it self, whatever labor we bestow in getting it 1 <hi>Chron. 29. 16.
O Lord our God, all this store cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own;
riches and honor come of thee v. 12. 'Tis I gave them corn, and wine, and
oyl, and multiplied her silver and her gold</hi> [even that] whereof they
did make <hi>Baal,</hi> made an Idol. And God is so jealous of his honor
in this particular, that if men do not render this acknowledgment,
he threatens to take all away: <hi>Therefore will I return, and take away
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40114:132"/>
my corn in the time thereof and will recover my wooll and my flax given
to cover her nakedness,</hi> Hos. 2. 8, 9. And if he do not take it, he
must bless it, otherwise we shall not thrive, shall have no comfort
in it; for <hi>the blessing of the Lord it maketh rich, and he addeth no sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
with it,</hi> Prov. 10. 22. Without that, bread may stuff us but not
nourish, we may have saturity but not have sustenance 1 Hag. 6. 9.
<hi>for I did blow upon it, saith the Lord.</hi> So that for ought appears, if
Scripture signify to the men of this world, as here they appeal to
it, the means whereby they should attain their Ends seem no more
in their power then the others. For as in the order of Grace those
general rules to which he hath determin'd the conversion of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
God must work with his means to make them effectual; so in
the order of Nature those general rules by which all things in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are effected; he must prepare the means, and bestow the power,
and bless the endeavors, yea and himself give all too, otherwise
they also cannot be effectual. Thus he hath in both appointed,
that in one and the other we should live with constant application
to, and with entire dependence on him in the faithful use of means
both in the one and the other order. So that the objection is quite
vanisht. 'Tis true tho somtimes God doth blast mens actions so,
that do they what they can, they cannot prosper for some secret
cause that's unaccountable to us, yet because for the most part in
the sphere of Nature, so far as the men of this world diligently use
the means, they attain their aims in some measure; therefore not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the interest God pleads in these things, they make
no doubt but they are sufficiently in their power; much more then
those in the sphere of Grace are in that of the Christians, where
they have express promises of not being disappointed, and are
requir'd by most strict and multiplied commands which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the work of grace as duty. For tho all good desires and
Prayers, come from God's good Spirit, and from his prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the heart as we saw, yet<note n="i" place="margin">Eccles. 18. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Before thou praiest, prepare
thy self, and be not as one that temts God,</hi> as one that waits for a
particular inspiration to it, one that will not pray without a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.
Tho God is said <hi>to open Lydia's heart;</hi> yet Rev. 3. 20. <hi>he
dos only knock,</hi> and we must open. He turns the heart, and therefore
Ephraim praies<note n="k" place="margin">Jer. 31. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>turn thou me, O God:</hi> yet by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> he saies<note n="l" place="margin">Ezek. 18. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>turn

                     <hi>Return now every
one from his evil waies, and make your waies and your doings good.</hi>
He promises to <hi>circumcise the heart</hi> Deut. 30. 6. but yet he bids them
<hi>circumcise the foreskin of their hearts,</hi> Deut. 10. 16. He dos en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
to put a <hi>new heart and a new spirit in them,</hi> Ezek. 18. 31.
In fine altho <hi>he worketh in us both to will and to do</hi> as S. Paul says, yet
he therefore charges us, <hi>Work out your own Salvation, For it is God
that worketh in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now when the man of this world thinks all those expressions
of Gods workings in the course of Nature are such as yet leave<note n="n" place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note>
all to him to do, so far, that he were a Fanatic as to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
interests who without endeavoring in the use of means, should
look that God would work out his ends for him, give bread
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40114:133"/>
without sowing, nourish without eating, notwithstanding that
Scripture dos ascribe to God the intire efficacy: shall the
like expressions in the order of grace, leave nothing for the
Christian to do, especially when the same endeavors are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him too? I know not whether these expressions made to
us to turn our felves &amp;c. do make more Pelagians that deny all
need of grace; or else ascrib'd to God, make more deny all need
of our endeavors, even of our praiers, or of any thing but more
dependance, waiting for his season. Whereas indeed we are to
work, because he works and gives means to enable us; and not to
use the means he gives us is to temt him, 'tis to refuse Salvation by
the ordinary methods of his workings, &amp; expect new miracle, 'tis
to be that fanatic that dos look to live without food. 'Tis gospel
truth to say it is not the direction of Gods laws can rule us, nor his
promises allure us, nor his threats affright us; but <hi>his Holy spirit must
direct and rule our hearts.</hi> Coll. 19. Sun. aft. Trin. and he must
<hi>write his laws there</hi> Heb. 8. 10. and he must <hi>give us a heart to love
and dread him.</hi> To affirm the other is heresy: and to say that
a sinner can dispose himself for his conversion, or that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
means can by their own moral efficacy turn a sinner, is an
heresy against grace, but grace where it hath not been too far
resisted, still accompanies the means. Gods word is<note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>the ministration
of the Spirit</hi> and of<note n="p" place="margin">2 Cor 3. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>rightousness,</hi> and his word and Spirit go together
<hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51. for to resist one is to resist the other. And if the heart
be not by evil education, bad converse and example (great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
these of reprobation) deprav'd, either hardened or made dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
or overgrown with principles that choak all God's good seed
that can be sown in it, those means so assisted call attention, work
some disposition to regard them. The ordinariest means are blest
to that end. <hi>Prov. 23. 14. thou shalt heal him with the rod and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his soul from hell.</hi> Yea they do it, tho the force of good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
have been broken, when these gracious means find congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
soft seasons, lay hold on occasions of calamity or such like;
and they move the inclinations, and so make soile prepar'd for
God's husbandry. And since experience shews us mere Gentile breeding
and converse, if there be but care and parts, can temper,
take off, at least moderate all insolence and passion, make men
generous, and meek and humble, decent as to all behavior to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God and man, not one ill vicious habit in their practise, but
an universal probity upon the face of their whole life; why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may not those beginnings of God's workings, which he never
fails to carry on for his part, do as much? And if they but keep
off ill habits, and by constant practise weaken inclinations to
them; here 'tis plain that God's means of grace find not so much
resistance, and that which in another state of mind would not have
been sufficient there becomes effectual; especially when with them
that work, he works, and as S. James says, <hi>gives more grace</hi> to them
that use it, and diverts temtations, enables <hi>to do all things thro Christ
that strengthens.</hi> O that the Christian would but try and strive to use
his means as heartily as the Child of this world! It is because men
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40114:133"/>
are not so industrious for salvation, answer not the motions of God's
Spirit, but neglect grace given, when the worldly man is indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in, and therefore is wiser in order, to his end.</p>
                  <p>Yet in relation to their proper means in order to their several ends
I must confess the worldling does observe the rules of prudence bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
the true child of this world for the most part chuseth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
known waies to his end, and do's use the general means
and methods of the world, gets into a profession or a place in
which if he use false arts, they are trades now, mysteries well taught
and known; there are few adventure on untrodden paths: Projectors
seldom thrive. But the generality of Christians who would gladly
reconcile God and this world, life hereafter with the being well
here, do not therefore acquiesce in Gods means only, but make
Principles, by-Rules of Conscience, which they guide themselves by
on occasions, and have taught themselves to think they are safe
waies, and such as do not lead them from salvation.</p>
                  <p>It is too well known what one sort of men have attemted in this
case, how by new-rais'd principles of Probability and directing
the intention, they have reconcil'd all villany with Christian life,
made it safe yea meritorious to lye, forswear, and bear malice, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame,
revenge by either force or treachery, rebel, massacre, drown
whole Nations in their own bloud, depose or murder Kings. But pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
these as monsters in Religion &amp; honest heathen humanity; there
are pretenders to some tolerable regard of God and vertue, who on
occasions, fit their conscience to their convenience. Besides S. Pauls
<hi>good Conscience void of offence to God and man,</hi> there is one of genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
of Politics, of Honour, of friendship, and a conscience for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
times and places, one of compliance and one of the mode, one
for the interests of a Profession, and the like. I might have nam'd
some quite the other way; the Conscience that is rul'd by rouling
changeable Principles, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> play fast and loose, now strains at
Gnats, and now can swallow camels: or a Conscience of caprice, that
sets it self strong suddain heats of nice observances somtimes in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
things, somtimes in greater, but is firm in nothing. But waving
these, and that for Politics too, which is govern'd wholly by reasons
of State, which is too nice and high for my consideration; the man
of honor makes himself a Principle which will allow him to require
reparations for the least affront so call'd; for otherwise what Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
would be of Christ's Religion; he can right himself with sword
and pistol and with a good Conscience. The conscience for friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is like that of <hi>Chilon,</hi> whom I mention'd to you, hath a by-rule.
And indeed who is there almost that hath the same sentiments or
laws for equity and justice in his own cause or the cause of those he
is most concern'd for, as in others? They mesure not by the same
standard: do not think in conscience the same case is like when it
makes against, as when it serves a turn. As for persons, so for times.
We have one conscience for the time of health, and one for sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Things do not equally seem good or evil in their different
seasons. And as for places, <hi>ut vestitum, sic sententiam aliam domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,
aliam forensem</hi> saith the Orator. Men have their shifts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
as of clothes; their dress is carefuller, and their rules stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
much abroad in public, then when at home or out of sight. As
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40114:134"/>
for the conscience of compliance, many do not only do things which
they have dislike to, out of compliance, but satisfy themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do them with reluctancy against their inclination, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the being singular or offensive. For the mode too; Men learn to
interpret God's laws also by the practice of the age, live and judge by
imitation and example. The man's conscience tho it boggle at first
sight of dangerous uncomely liberties, yet conversation with them,
as it takes away the horror of them, so he thinks it do's the danger
and ill influence. And as fashion makes all dresses to be mode and
not look uncomely; so the custom of these things makes them seem
indifferent. A Conscience also for the interests of a Profession: as in
trade for example, and in Corporations of it, it thinks their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations
for the better keeping up the Company fair and honest,
and therewithal make tricks and exactions lawful. And in single tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
such another principle makes Princes Laws be broken, &amp; their
dues stoln without any check of Conscience; and I verily believe that
many think these are not inconsistent with a good mind. I might
have instanc'd in other professions; particularly in that which sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies
it self in the defending manifestly wrongful, and in right
causes, in protracting suits to mens great molestation and
the ruin of just rights. But in truth this is paltry trifling with
religion, having false weights and mesures of what's lawful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
things that God abhors: and indeed these frauds will in the
end return upon their authors, and the unhappy artist will most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
deceive his own soul. For he never can arrive at life, whom
he that is the way do's not lead thither, Christ and his rules only can
introduce us into the mansions of Eternity. 'Tis true there may be
doubts somtimes about the way of duty (for 'tis that I speak to) in
applying general rules; for circumstances may perplex &amp; vary cases,
obligations seem to clash and quarrel, so that one may be uncertain
which to follow, what means he should take to attain his great end.</p>
                  <p>2. Now in case of such uncertainty, as to the means, the Child of
this world do's observe a Rule of Prudence better then the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
for he takes advice. For who intends to purchase an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
but he goes to Counsel, and if there be the least appearance
of uncertainty in the Title, spares no charge to have it searcht and to
be sure? The least indisposition drives the man that aims at life to
his Physician. In every difficulty of a voiage where there's any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of a shelf or rock, the Merchant and the Master will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
the Pilot. But in the voiage towards heaven how many make
shipwrack of a good conscience, because they will not commit
themselves to any conduct? How often do they shake their Title to
God's inheritance, because they will not take advice of him at whose
mouth God commanded they should seek the Law? And who do's
go to the Physician of Souls to prevent death Eternal? I do not
say men should betake themselves to a director in each action of
their lives; For who goes to a Doctor to know whether he should eat
stones or poison; or who asks a Lawyer whether he should keep or
burn his evidences? Now for the most part what I ought to do,
what to forbear, is every jot as clear as those, except where circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
trouble, or else seeming cross obligations a muse our judgment;
and then for a man not to ask direction in his way to heaven, is
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40114:134"/>
unanswerable folly in a man that will inquire the way to the next
village; 'tis nothing but a wretchless stupid carelesness in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
interests of his own Soul. When he that takes the best directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he can get with this sincere intent that he may not transgress,
may quiet his own mind in this that he hath don his utmost faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
towards duty, and in doing that with our good God shall be
interpreted to have don his duty, if he also faithfully pursue the
means directed, the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. property of Wisdom, which does set the
man upon the use of those means which he must attain his end by;
the last thing I am to speak too.</p>
                  <p>Now as to this I must confess the Child of this world wiser: and
give up the cause. Whoever does resolvedly intend his profit, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
honor, or whatever state in this life, 'tis the business of his parts,
his study and his whole life to pursue it: and it is so while the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
of any carnal end is eager in him, Anger, hate, revenge &amp;c.
And I cannot say it is so with the Christian as to his end. But the
worldly man besides the zeal in using all means in pursuit of
his end, he observs two Rules that wisdom dictates, with more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness;
1. Be <hi>circumspect,</hi> then <hi>wary;</hi> both prescrib'd us by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>circumspectly, not as fools
but wise,</hi> as we translate it, and the Vulgar <hi>caute</hi> warily, with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now the first of these two, Circumspection signifies the look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every way about him to discern, or if he can foresee what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may obstruct him in his progress, give him any hindrance in
whatever shape it is likely to attemt it; whether it do threaten with
inconvenience, or do flatter with the deceitful appearances of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
useful; come with treachery or open opposition, as a false
Friend or a known Enemy: and the other, Caution sets him upon
all the care he can make use of to avoi'd or rid himself of such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
of what kind soever.</p>
                  <p>Now tis evident the man of this world in whatever occupation,
trade, profession, or place he may be, from the lowest to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
who proposes any one thing to himself, and does not live <hi>ex tempore</hi>
and follow ends and objects as the boy's do Crows, but
hath at least some one design, so far as he does so, looks round
him, that he may shun every thing that would defeat, divert, or
but disturb him in it, and endeavors to move every stone, which
he may stumble at in his pursuit, whatever may be an impediment
to his attainments.</p>
                  <p>Now the Child of Light hath warning given him by the wise
man also, <hi>My Son if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for
temtation.</hi> There are those that will attemt to break his progress
in pursuit of any such designment; His enemy <hi>the Devil like a
roaring Lyon,</hi> his false friend the Flesh, and a third (that will assault
him under both appearances) the World, somtimes by reproches
taunts and insolent scorn, by turning piety and virtue into raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
discouraging men from the pursuit, somtimes by vexatious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesting,
injuring, oppressing good men that they think will bear
it, making a prey of the meek, patient and long-suffering, tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under foot the humble; because they know their principles
will make them suffer it: and somtimes by invading them with
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40114:135"/>
downright persecution, when duty and Religion are made crimes,
true faith and a good Conscience mark men out for ruine. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
on the other side it courts us, shews us all it's glory,
it's places, powers, plenties, pomps and gayeties, and so kindles in
us the desire of wealth, which is the only way to compass all those;
which desire if it touch the heart once, if the world can charm us
once with the <hi>deceitfulness of riches</hi> as our Saviour words it
Matth. 13. 22. we are quite betraid. For these deceitful riches, tho
they are and may be made great instruments of good, and most
well minded men, when they are in the way of getting them, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
they shall do more good with more of them, when they have
got them, they deceive them, prove occasions and foments of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
do not only serve, but grow incentives to those Sins, which
men have any inclinations too, yea many times betray them into
those they before had no disposition towards, by putting them
into their power, and by heightning for them. And however ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that possess them, do make blessed use of them, yet those that
seek them and endeavor their increase on the account of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so, to make them help their entry into life, do in our
Savior's judgment for the most part so <hi>deceive themselves,</hi> and are as
sottish as a man that should get up upon a Camel, to ride thro the
eye of a Needle. 'Tis our only wisdom to beware of all temtations.
'Twas Christ's last advice in that agony both of his Love and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.
<hi>Watch and pray that ye enter not into</hi> them; Look about
you, give no opportunities to them to approch you undiscern'd,
advert still that you may be either able to avoi'd them, or have
time to fortify and call up all the succours Reason and Religion
offer, and all those of Grace, which God is ready to bestow upon
your prayers, that you may not be surpriz'd and taken unprepar'd;
and rather bear &amp; suffer any thing then yield. Whatever 'tis that is
most precious to thee, serves thy greatest uses, contributes to thy
most charming satisfactions, rather part with it then let it temt
thee. 'Tis our Saviors charge, <hi>if thy right Eye offend,</hi> insnare, <hi>thee pluck
it out and cast it from thee.</hi> It is sad indeed when the Eye that
should watch, the organ of Circumspection and with which we
should discern the snare to shun it, should it self lead into it, and
be it. But 'tis sadder when the snare is dear to men as the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
part and most delightful of their senses, when they can no
more endure to withdraw from temtation, then to cut off their
right hand, or pull out their right Eye, when they use those parts
to look about for ruine, and lay violent hands upon the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their Perdition; when they will loose any of those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
rather then not pursue what the temtation suggests, rather cut
off a right hand and pull out a right Eye, then not satisfy the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
it raises, give up all their own aimes, and the worldlings
also for that only; loose their Salvation, their God and their own
Soul, spend wealth and strength and body, honor and understanding
on one sin, that they may become their own ruins here in this life,
and the type of their judgment in the life to come. Now these are
such instances of folly that the men that practise them and call
themselves Christians, are not to be put in the comparison with the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40114:135"/>
children of this world, who in every part of wisdom are much wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
in relation to their ends, and to the means they pitch upon,
and to the use of those means in pursuit of their intentions: which
I undertook to shew.</p>
                  <p>And then when all their Wisdom is <hi>foolishness with God,</hi> and
branded with the worst extremest names of it in Scripture; in
what rank of folly stand most Christians? And truly to sum up
all, 'tis a most astonishing contemplation how 'tis only in these
everlasting interests that most men act without any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as men wholly destitute of understanding, and that could
not think. He that hath a journey or a voyage which he must
make, and accordingly designes, he takes some thought of
fit means of conveyance, and providing whatsoever else is at
least necessary for it, never is so sottish as to chuse and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a Ship for land, or a Coach for Sea, nor to hire and put
himself in any one he meets by hazard, without minding whether
it is going and will carry him. Now each man hath a journey to
the other World, knows he must make it, and is going on it, and
and pretends at least to be assur'd there are two ways to that world;
one that leads to felicities which never can dye, and the other to
as endless and immortal misery and torment: yet the one of these
however dreadful, and the other how desireable soever never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into his Consideration so as to weigh ought with him, and to
incline him in the choice he makes of that way which he walks
in all his life long. And tho men know that they approch nearer
to that terrible moment every day, and have for ought they know
few paces more, but are to step immediatly into one of these two
Eternities; yet if you ask them why they go that way they march
in, not another, whether they ever minded where that way will
lead them: why alass they did not ask themselves that question,
may be never yet reflected on it; but their inclinations and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the example of converse with others carried them along with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
consideration whither: these did guide them wholly, and from
these they took their sentiments of things and actions, which they
follow'd without ever giving heed too, or examining how they
came by them, or what grounds of truth or goodness they have
for them, but pursued them constantly, and doing so, that while
those sentiments remain in them as judgments, and remaining
long so and by that becoming prejudices, with them go for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
and if ever they be call'd on to reflect upon the way they
walk in, being willing out of a desire that's natural to man, and
is inbred in him, to justify themselves as much as may be in
their inclinations and their actions, they seek reason or colour of it
to guild over and beautify the principles they took up so. Thus they
come to have their maxims and rules, and so a Conscience which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
or at least does not reprove their conduct; and so go on confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
and acquiesce in those, and never take nor ask other directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Yet these very men will hire a Tutor to direct their footings
that they may be to the mesures and the rules of Music; will be
bountiful and docile &amp; obedient to him, and spend time too in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
how to set their paces to the cadences of an aire: so much
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40114:136"/>
more considerable 'tis to dance well then to live and dye well. No
guide in that science that must teach them how to be for ever bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
they march forwards in the way they fall into, in which
provided all their appetites be entertain'd well, and themselves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
the good company submissive and complaisant, and let
them have their will, and rule it, then they go on pleasantly not
ever thinking what way they are in or whither going. Much less
are they circumspect and wary, watching both their wayes and
steps; but rather love to walk amongst, break into snares; and
so walking so entangled, their last fatal minute overtakes them:
never till then sensible, but then made so by despair, when, as the
wise man words it, they <hi>repenting and groaning for anguish of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
shall say within themselvs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wisedom c. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>The Righteous we had in derision and a
proverb of reproch, we fools accounted his life madness; how is he num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
among the Children of God, and his lot is among the Saints. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have we erred from the way of truth; we have wearied our
selves in the way of wickedness, yea we have gon thro deserts. Where
there lay no way; but as for the way of the Lord we have not known it.
What hath pride profited us, or what good hath riches with our vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought us? All those things are pass'd away like a shadow. For
the hope of the ungodly is like a thin froth that is driven away with the
storm, but the Righteous live for evermore; the reward of them is
with the Lord, and the care of them is with the most High. Therefore
shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and a beautiful Crown from the
Lords hand.</hi> Which Crown God of his infinite mercy grant, &amp;c.</p>

THE LIGHT OF THE BODY
is the Eye.</head>
                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>Matt. 6. 22, 23.</bibl>
                     <q>The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thy eye be single,
thy whole body shall be full of light.</q>
                     <q>But if thine eye be evill, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.
If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is
that darkness?</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N daies that above all others so pretend to light,
yet then in which the Church was scarcely ever
more involv'd in darkness, wholly overspread
with error and confusion, and these new lights
prove but like those fires that do mislead them
that are overtaken by the night; guide them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of their way into dangers and precipices,
and make them loose themselvs in many wandrings; only Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
meteors: It cannot be unseasonable or needless to try what
kind of light it is that Christ would have us follow; if all were true
those others do pretend, 'twould give them but enlightned brains:
but Christs light here will give us shining lives, make our whole
bodies full of light; and which light if men want, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their wild illuminations, they are still in the most amazing
darkness. <hi>For the light of the body is the eye. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words are clearly the former part of a comparison,
only hinting at, and leaving us to guess and to draw out the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
which hath by divers been assign'd diversly. In their direct
view they say thus much, The Eye is the candle of the body: that
is, as in the body of man the Eye is the director, do's that office to
it that a lamp dos in the dark, shews it which way it should walk,
what it should do, and by its guidance the body can discerningly
set about its offices and perform its functions: and if the Eye be
as it ought, pure and right, it directeth well; but if not, the body
not being able to discern, not only cannot exercise its functions
as it ought, but also may walk on in dangerous errors, and stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
upon precipices into ruin. So also it fares in our spiritual
estate. But the particulars thereof are not by all agreed upon, and are
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40114:137"/>
very variously rendred. The single and the evil eye being exprest
by such words as do assure us that a spiritual eye is here intended,
yet leaves place for enquiry into what it is: and tho several mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
have been pitch't upon, and but one was meant, yet each
having either large authority or reasons, I know not why I may
not apply it too, and treat of every one: seeing each way afford's
us true and good instructions. And first that which hath most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
been adhered to is that the singleness of the Eye should
mean the singleness or simplicity of heart, &amp; purity of intention. So
<hi>Abimelech</hi> Gen. xx. 5, 6. when he had taken <hi>Sarah</hi> to him, pleads
for himself he did it <hi>in the simplicity of his heart,</hi> and God acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
he did so; with an honest intention, meaning to make her
his wife, not knowing that she was so to another man. And then
the second part of the comparison says thus: So also if thy heart
be single and sincere, thy intentions right to God, if in all thy
actions thou intend his service and Glory, that thy good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will derive a goodness into all thy doings, <hi>thy whole body will
be full of light,</hi> all thy actions holy; but if thy intentions be viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
if in the duties I named before, alms, praier, fasts thou aime
not at my service, but the praise of men, if thy heart be impure,
mudded with the desire of earthly things, which I did last forbid
thee; thy actions must needs be dark and foul: yea indeed <hi>how.
great a</hi> spiritual <hi>darkness,</hi> how much unholiness must needs dwell
upon thy doings, if the only thing, that should give light, and shed
an holiness into them, thy intentions be dark and evil? To this
sense I shall first speak, and divide my text into subjects rather then
parts.</p>
                  <p>1. The first shall be this, the lamp of the body is the eye, a good
intention a well meaning must enlighten &amp; direct every action to
make it not reprovable.</p>
                  <p>2. I shall lay before you a single eye, shew you what is required
to make a Religious intention singly and purely so.</p>
                  <p>3. That from such a single eye the body shall be light, that
such good hearty meanings do either break out into holy actions,
or are accepted as such.</p>
                  <p>4. That such a single eye makes the whole body light, that by
such pure religious intentions a man may sanctify all the actions of
his life.</p>
                  <p>5. The remaining part of the text, <hi>but if thine eye be evil &amp;c.</hi>
being but the affirming all the contraries to these of the evil eye,
the bad meaning, the intention that is not honest and pure, must
needs be prov'd and press'd in pressing of the former part; and
therefore that shall only furnish me with application.</p>
                  <p>First of the first, the candle of the body is the eye, a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
a well meaning must enlighten and direct every action
to make it not reprovable. I mean in actions that are any way
matter of duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know only an innocent harmless intention,
if there be no other unhandsom circumstance, will serve to make
the common actions of life innocent and not blameable; but
without the Religious intention the action cannot be accounted
duty, and upon this score 'tis in Religion reprovable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:40114:137"/>
Among all creatures here below man is the only one that hath
a faculty to chuse his ends, &amp; consequently that can direct his
intentions. Things without life are carried only to the makers ends,
not to their own; the stone however by its own weight it hurry
downwards to it's sphere of rest, and as it does approch goes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
still and faster, as if there were it's inclination, and that incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
were more sensible as it came nearer, and so increas'd upon
it; yet 'tis determined to it's line, 'tis bound to move by plummet,
and cannot possibly turn one point aside, not make the smallest
crook to meet a nearer knob of earth that stretches up it self to
give it soonest rest: and all it's hast is only weight not inclination,
not choice, but natural violence as it were. Things that have life
and sense, have inded aims, and these do prosecute those aims
with eager strong intentions; but they also are limited, <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantur
ad unum,</hi> as the Schools speak; their end is set to them, nor
do they pick and chuse upon comparative considerations; that
which strikes their present sense with strongest relish, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
fix upon: and therefore <hi>Buridan</hi> tells us of an Asse that
was so justly plac'd between two bottles of hay of so exact and equal
sent and goodness, that neither of them being able to determine
his appetite to the one more then the other, his inclinations stood
divided equally betwixt those equal invitations, and being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to preferr, nor consequently chuse any, he wanted both, and
two bottles sterv'd him whom one would have preserved. But 'tis
not so with man, for as there is as great a difference betwixt his
ends as does distinguish Hell from heaven in obedience on one
side, and transgression on the other; life and death, eternity of
blessedness, and immortality of misery are set before his choice;
one of these everlastingnesses sets out it self before every action
of his that is not merely indifferent, and offers it self to be his
aim. So also he hath (as it mostly proves) a most unhappy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege,
that he can chuse his ruine: and as by the assistance of that
Grace, which God does not deny, he can intend those actions that
look directly towards happiness; so he can by the power of his will
prosecute his own destruction. Now then as for him that can
thus chuse his ends, that can direct his intentions either to good
or evill, to limit this his freedom to the choice of evill would be
most unreasonable; God knows 'tis too much so for him to let the
lawful delights of his senses according to their degrees and strengths
fix and determine much of his intentions; and to employ his soul
to spring and start such pleasures, and let his appetite still hover
over them, and the fairest quarry alwaies engage it in the pursuit,
tyed to that object that does strike his sense with greatest vigor of
temtation: for this is to live merely a life of sense, 'tis to degenerate
from man into the rank of lower creatures; for just these are their
aims, and so they make their choices: and did God place an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
and Angelic Spirit in a man only to make him be a more
sagacious brute? But then much more then brutish would it be
when as two objects court his choice, as different as Hell and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in desireableness; for him to chuse the terrors, to pursue that
which carries with it inconsistency to all his happinesses. The beasts
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40114:138"/>
cannot do so, they cannot chuse the worse, but man will preferr
misery, and make his choice of wretchedness. And truly thither
every action of man does tend, that is not otherwise level'd and
directed by honest intentions. It is the meaning that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
the deeds, and as the mind intends, so it alters the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
action into good, bad or indifferent. If I do take a walk
to the next town, whether I do it for fresh aire and recreation, or
else to make a charitable Christian visit, so to relieve or help a
weak sick soul, or go to meet companions of my sin and to appoint
or execute a vice, the walk is still the same, but those so different
ends do make the action tend to consequences of an eternal dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
Nay the aim hath so great an influence upon the deeds,
that tho the action be an action of a vertue or Religion, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the quality of the mans meaning that performs it, so
it may either lose its vertue, or transmute into a vice, and the
very Religion become sin. The first part of this chapter is all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of this: 'tis lawful without question by all good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
means to seek to advance my reputation, but he that does
endeavor it by his devotions, tho his life be all strictnesses, and he
do spend himself in alms and fasts and praiers, by all these holy
practices he does not purchase the reward of piety, but only
praise of men; so that all that Religion ceaseth to be holy, and
if it mainly aim at that, becomes hypocrisy. And all the reason
in the world it should be so; for he that merely in order to his
ends does chuse and practise such means, 'tis certain he does love
those means no otherwise then as they serve that end, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tho the means be vertue, he does not love the Religion of that
vertue, but the convenience of it as it does contribute to his aim.
Now if it be convenient to an ill end, 'tis an evill convenience,
and so in chusing vertue he chuseth evill; if but to an indifferent
end, 'tis an indifferent convenience; and so the Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
insipid and indifferent; and tho there be honesty in the
thing, yet 'tis by accident as to his mind, 'tis not for that he
chuses it, but for its usefulness; and ordinarily 'tis not that males
it convenient or useful for ends, or if it do, yet the appearance
of it is as good as it is it self; and so 'tis clear, howsoever he chuse
vertue, yet the vertue hath no interest in his performance, not in
his intention, nor election. Thus he that is charitable to one in
distress on purpose to oblige him afterwards for some designs he
hath in using him, he does contract, not give, and 'tis not alms,
but commerce, 'tis rather earnest of wages, then a liberality. She
that abstains from vicious and suspected company, and observes
strictest chastity merely to avoid an ill name or worse consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
does not fear God, but shame and being undone, and 'tis not
vertue this but care of reputation: she's no more chast as to the
Religion of it, then she that does abstain from places suspected of
diseases, that would spoil her face or do her other injury: she
does avoid uncleanness, as she does small pox or breaking of her
limbs; and she that will not lame or deform her self is every jot
as vertuous. They that make long praiers for a pretence to cover
their devouring widows houses, that their opinion of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40114:138"/>
may palliate some other wickednesses they have; their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
only pull down woes upon them <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>They that go to the place of Gods Worship and Service and to
the exercises of devotion, intending there to offer up some eyes
and thoughts to some object, which their vicious inclinations have
service for, their very Religion is Idolatry; and truly they who do
good actions to an ill intent, their wickedness is multiplied, they
do not only sin in the intention, but they defile the means, they
make Piety serve their vice, and Christ Minister unto Belial. Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
enough to perswade us to look to our intentions, and have
a care our meanings be purely and singly religious; which when
they are I am now next to shew you.</p>
                  <p>Now for this intentions may be considered either precisely in
order to the end they aime at, without taking in the consideration
of the means, by which I must prosecute that end; as for instance,
from this time forward I intend strictly and duly to observe my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and the public hours of prayer; nothing but such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as God shall interpose, shall hinder me. Or I intend accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my ability to practise charity to the distressed. Or secondly
the man considers also what means there are for him to pursue that
intention, and chuseth what he thinks the most convenient, and by
that means intends to compass his designs. So in order to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
keeping prayers, I will be sure to rise so early, as that the hast
of any business I shall have, shall not hurry me from my private
morning devotions; I will be up timely enough for both: and I
will so and so order my business of the day, and so cut off, or so
dispose my pleasures as that they shall not enterfere with prayers,
shall not intrench on my Religious hours, but doing so and so I
will have void spaces left for them, that are so much more my
concerns; and will not suffer trifles to detain me from them; or
from any part, such as I may easily shake off, or defer for so much
better interests then trifles, as the business of my prayers is; which
yet truly 'tis to be doubted they do scarce believe, that let trifles
turn them either from all or part, or slacken them in coming. And
for my charity I do intend out of such my revenue, or my wages,
or out of the superfluity of my expences (from which I do discern
I could spare somthing, and be never the worse) to lay aside con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
for the uses of that virtue. And so any man intends to set
upon the serious practise of sobriety and temperance or chastity;
and then considers that 'tis necessary for him to avoid such and
such engaging practises, or such and tempting companions,
and occasions, and thereupon intends that too: where we see the
means come in with the end to make up the intention; as where
they do not, God knows the bare intention of the end is but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
and fancy.</p>
                  <p>1. Now as to both these intentions: First for the precise inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the end; that in religious aims that may be single and
pure, I must 1. take heed that neither temporal nor vicious aims
do mixe in any degree with my Religion in my thoughts, nor that
the pious meaning do decline unto any such intention. For any
either mixture or defilement, makes a thing not pure and single.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40114:139"/>
Do not mistake me, temporal ends such as profit, recreations;
reputation are not only lawful, but necessary for our intentions,
provided they do not transgress their bounds of time ot mesure,
but they must not in any degree come into your obediences to God.
To intend both in that, were to endeavor that which Christ saies
we cannot do, 'twere to serve God and Mammon, or God and
pleasure, or the Lord and Honor: yea 'twere to serve them with
the Lords Religion, to make the very worship of my God be the
Idolatry of my covetousness, 'tis one of the worst kinds of sacrilege
to alienate his own service from him. Nay I must take a care
that an intention piously begun, do not decline into any degree
of such meanings. I may out of a real sense of my imperfections
or detestation of some of my former practises begin a confession,
and complaint against my self, and have the thoughts of emty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and of humility of heart, when this intention springs within
me, but if I then find some have a better opinion of me for it, and
speak well of my modesty or my humility, and that opinion do
begin to tickle me, that air to fill me (and I shall easily discover
it, if there be any thing of such an aim, for if I cannot wel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
another should say that of me which I say my self, then it
is sure that my confessions were either dissimulation, or fishing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
praise:) here the humble intention declines, &amp; now 'tis time to
have a care and turn my thoughts from other mens opinions to
my own guilty consciousness.</p>
                  <p>So for vice, if the same confessing man acknowledg sadly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
loosnesses, or out of a good meaning tell some story to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the vileness of such fault, and doing this before a female au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
makes her pleas'd with the expression of it, and as she begins
to like the person for the story, so the contagion spreads, and the
relator from such a liking (as it quickly will) contracts a mutual
kindness, and refreshes decaied desires; here the good meaning is
sunk and drown'd in sin; <hi>desinit in piscem,</hi> 'tis but a Mermaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
the fair upper part, however beauteous, ends in monster,
the Saint declines into a feind.</p>
                  <p>2. If none of this, yet if I can foresee some casual unconcern'd
evil accident will happen and come in; then I must either free
my good intention from that, or change it. If I intend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
my Superior towards whom I have some office of so doing,
for his vice, and do foresee that probably upon that his just respect
and authority may decay with some others; I will then take some
other way of doing it. If by aggravating the guilty hainousness
of some practices of those that do profess the strictness of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I can guess my doing so will cast a dash upon the profession of
Religion it self in the esteem of som that hear me; I will forbear
a good of so ill consequence, except such aggravation be necessary
upon some other score, as to take off the opinion of those that may
be mislead by those persons into guilt.</p>
                  <p>If I foresee my laying open of a false opinion (provided that it
be not fundamental as to practise) in a man of pious learning and
of reverend esteem, may chance to stagger the beliefs of some that
must receive their knowledg from instruction and cannot do it
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40114:139"/>
better then from such; and make them thinkalas from whom shall
we learn truths, or what assurance have we that any thing we have
given credit to is so: sure my intention is more noxious then his
false opinion and to be turn'd aside.</p>
                  <p>If by telling a true story intended for the disparagement of vice,
I think aspersions may come upon a person (which are not at all
necessary for my hearers avoiding of the vice,) yea tho he be
mine enemy, the story and my intentions would be much better
spar'd.</p>
                  <p>A meaning then is purely good, when it hath nothing else but
good in view of it; and that intention is not truly single, that
hath two ends, altho but one be mine, and the other chances only;
for if I foresee it, I some way adopt it, and do make it mine. So
for the first intentions.</p>
                  <p>2. The intire intentions as they take in the means succeed into
our consideration; and here I would be plain because I know it is
the common plea and ground of most whereby they excuse acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
otherwise very blameable by saying that they did it with a
good intent: and this they think will stop the mouths of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaders
and their conscience. On this score Phineas's zeal is
grown a Christian principle (tho the like zeal were blamed by
Christ in his disciples) yea and that stretcht now much beyond the
original; such a zealous intention shall execute real murders, and
all the bloudy hainous consequences of a war undertaken upon no
other appearing ground: when not upon a visible confest Idolatry,
and impudent whoredom, as that in Phineas case, but upon only
controverted doubts, or indeed fancied stains in an established
happy Church; their zealous intention must warrant them to let
out those taint's together with the life, to bloud them with the
sword; and if they cannot call for fire from Heaven to purge away
the dross, yet they will make the reformation with fire and fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
prune the worship by cutting up both root and branch: <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
Religio potuit suadere malorum.</hi> And Religion must perswade
and warrant all these mischeifs.</p>
                  <p>A like good meaning shall engage men to defy the persons and
authority of their most just Superiors, to both which they were
bound by laws and oaths; but they are nothing to a good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and while they prosecute the ruine of their Governors, and
desolation of their Nation, yet they can mean well to them both,
and be still innocent.</p>
                  <p>So the ends of self-preservation, or which is much worse, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of a little wealth or dignity, shall justify perjury and
doing things against the conscience: and those things look't upon
as slight transgressions in order to that end, when the pride of an
estate, or of a wife and family is in the intention.</p>
                  <p>I could make divers other instances in common actions of our
lives, in which whatever men do practise, if they have a good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they believe themselves excusable. Therefore</p>
                  <p>1. That an intention may be good, 'tis absolutely necessary, that
it do not take in any forbidden means to bring about its end; for
if it do, however the end were good, the intention will be sinful.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40114:140"/>
The reasons clear, because that particular intention do's especially
respect and include that particular means; which means is evil,
that is to say, it do's especially respect and include evil, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
is so. Nay if I use ill means, tho to advance an end of
noblest Religion, yet in so intending that intention do's not do
God service, nor obey his commands for it is impossible that the
same action of the mind should in it self be both commanded and
forbid by God.</p>
                  <p>Now as the intention takes in and pursues the evil means so 'tis
forbid, and consequently is a sin, and therefore cannot be service
to God nor obedience to his command. If that this reason will
not do, example and command shall do it. <hi>Saul</hi> did intend to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
when he did spare the fattest of the sheep and oxen: 'tis true
he was commanded to slay all, but he intended to preserve the
best for God, his meaning was Religion and worship; but yet that
good intention of worship did condemn him, and he and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
lost the Kingdom for this Religion.</p>
                  <p>God do's not require any action, which he sees I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
without sin; for the requires no man to sin, for that were to
require that we should break his commands, and 'twere a strange
obedience to the Lord to disobey him for his own sake; <hi>shall I
speak wickedly for God,</hi> saith Job, Job. 13. 7. <hi>and talk deceitfully for
him? will ye accept his person?</hi> and plainer yet S. Paul. <hi>Rom. 3. 5, 6,
7, 8. But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God,
what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I
speak as a man.) God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
For if the truth of God hath more abounded thro my lie unto his glory;
why also yet am I judged as a sinner? And not rather as we are slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drously
reported, and as some affirm that we say, Let us do evil, that
good may come: whose damnation is just.</hi> The argumentation runs
thus, If Gods way of grace may be thus set out, and more illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
seen by the sins of men; why should God thus punish their sins
which so tend to his glory (Irecite the objection of some men) or if
he do's, is it not injustice in him so to doe? <hi>v.</hi> 7. For (say they) if the
faithfulness, and mercifulness of God in performing his promises to
<hi>Abraham</hi> giving the <hi>Messiah</hi> hath appear'd more abundantly, and
tended more to his glory by occasion of the Jews sins or infidelity,
there will be then no reason why they that are guilty of such sins
so much tending to Gods honor should be complained of or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
with in judgment; but on the other side men might do well
to commit such sins, from which so much good or glory to God
might come. I recite, saies the Apostle, a damnable doctrine,
and in opposition say, that no one sin is to be committed, tho in
order to and contemplation of the greatest good, Gods glory.
And this is proof enough, and therefore</p>
                  <p>2. tho an intention that sets it selfe an holy and Religious end,
the glory of God, the purity of Religion, the peace and flourish
of Jerusalem, nay Church and nation, or some particular service
to God, while it looks only at the end is good and holy, yet when
it comes to think of means in order to that end, if he can find
there is only one within his compass, and that forbidden, as he
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40114:140"/>
is bound to renounce the means, so also he must desert the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
instantly: for if he go on to intend good, which he knows
he cannot compass but by doing ill, 'tis clear he do's intend the
doing ill; as he that know it is not possible, that he should shoot
at such a mark, behind which a man stands, but he must kill the
man, if he intend to shoot, he do's intend to kill. No, he may pray
for such an end that God would find expedients to bring it about,
but must not set wickedness on work to do it; God do's not need
the aids of sin to promote his glory or service. And therefore</p>
                  <p>3. A truly Religious intention of a good end purely as it is good
cannot suffer a man to chuse an evil means of working towards
it. It is not possible that he should do it; for he that do's chuse
a means unto an evil end, intends it only as 'tis useful to that end,
and otherwise he could not like nor pitch upon it; but sin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be useful to a vertuous action as it is vertuous, but perfectly
repugnant to it. I may exact, and gripe, oppress deceive, and
many more such things, that so I may be rich, and have to give
to them that want; but I cannot do those things truly intending
the Religion of charity, because that would not suffer me to do
them. Those actions are perfectly contradictions to its nature,
they ruinate the very being of a vertue, as it is in obedience to
God; for a man cannot disobey God in obedience to him, and
therefore are not useful to it, as it is a virtue, nor chosen so but
on some other motive. The man that heaps by fraud and by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
intending to build hospitals, intends thereby to build
himself a monument, and leave as great a name behind him, as
he do's treasure may be, but if he truly had intended charity, he
had not been uncharitable for charity.</p>
                  <p>The man that do's intend to be a daily constant person in the
public exercises of Religion, and travail up and down to get the
opportunities, if when he do's begin to think how he is to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
those intentions, and so considers that then he must neglect
his calling greatly and impoverish, may be break himself and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
if he then set down with himself; I may allow my self some
arts of thriving, take ways of getting greater gains in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
then are fit for others that do not give God so much of
their time; or I will restrain my hand as to the poor; for if Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to God take away so considerable a part of what I should gain,
charity to the poor, hath no reason to have a great share too in
what I have; and so leave off to be a doer, that he may be a
hearer, or do that which is not justifiable, use some deceitful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
or be not merciful (and these are no strange things they
say) 'Tis clear this man do's not intend towards the real power
of religion, for that would not allow him such waies to it, which
are so far from useful to it, that they are perfect oppositions to its
nature, but either the repute of a professor, or the being own'd as
of a party, or some such motive lurks under the visor of Religion;
it may be undiscern'd by him who minds that fair appearance of a
good end, so intently as not to search, and try the whole intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the means as well as aim. For such means, however they may
contribute to the action of Religion and vertue in the general, yet
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40114:141"/>
they cannot be useful to the Religion, or the vertue of the action,
nay do they not contribute sin more then their own to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
'Tis a hard question; and tho indeed it be apparent, that
he that chuseth an ill way only to bring about a good intent; do's
not like or chuse that ill for it self, and would not embrace it if
it were not drest and varnisht with the adornments and the paint
of a well meaning, and consequently is not so malicious, as they
that chuse sin barefac't in its own shape and colours; yet when to
do so is so directly against the very nature of piety, against reason
and command, and hath so harsh a sentence as S. <hi>Paul</hi> do's thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
out against them, that shall entertain such a doctrine, that
truly I do not know what to say to them, that notwithstanding
that dare practise it. I'am sure the wise man saith <hi>Eccles. 34. 20.
He that bringeth an offering of the goods of the poor, doth as one that
killeth the Son before the Fathers eyes;</hi> an offence that to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that hath more then his sons death in it, it strikes him also
thro the eyes and would make his own sight his murderers, do's
make it to be his torment; and defies his displeasure, chusing to
spite him to his face: and some such aggravation it should seem
vice carries in it, when it comes into Religion, as it do's, when it
thrusts into our holy intentions, as means to pious ends. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, I'me sure I've said enough to prove that truly good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
cannot take in evil means, and that such means when
they are taken in, make the intention mixt and unholy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
far from pure: and so have don the second thing, and let
you know what is required to make a Religious intention singly
&amp; purely so. The third follows</p>
                  <p>3. That from such a single eye the body shall be light, that such
good hearty meanings do make the actions good and holy, or are
accepted as such actions. The former part, that actions regulated
by intentions compleatly Religious are Religious, needs no proof;
because our actions derive theis guilt or their Religiousness from
thence: there can be nothing there to blame; for when the end is
good, and the means good, then all is so. But I would tell you
such intentions have a privilege beyond this of making outward
actions acceptable to the Lord: for where we do endeavor in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance
of such intentions, and cannot bring them into act there
those intentions are in Gods sight as the actions themselvs, he do's
so value them, and so he will reward them. For God accepts the
will for deed, <hi>and if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not,</hi>
2 Cor. 8. 4. Here thy good meaning if it put forth it self according
to thy power is compleat performance; here is a way the meanest
soul may be an Heroe in Religion: there is no bounds that can be
set to holy meanings. My actions may be fetter'd in, ty'd by impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities,
that I cannot perform such holy deeds as others, but my
intentions are free as Angels; I can mean heartily and intend to
the utmost, and by such an art the poor widow, that gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the expression of the meanest poverty, did yet give
more then they that bestow'd treasures, because in two mites she
meant to give her utmost; and at such rates God will reward them
too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:40114:141"/>
Those good intentions that sincerely mind Gods glory shall
themselvs reap glory, even before the action shall. From resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to eternity is time enough to reward holy actions, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that, betwixt death and judgment, the soul shall be rewarded
with the blessing of its intentions. As it did often do its part in
piety without the body, so it shall have a crown before the body,
shall forestal happiness, and for a while it shall alone be blessed, as
oftentimes it hath been vertuous alone in good intentions, when
it could not act.</p>
                  <p>4. But all this is not strange, that the great mercy of our God
should so interpret to our advantage our designs of piety, as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
good meanings to our glory as if they were good doings, and
consequently where the intentions are holy, the actions must be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and where this eye is clear, the body must have light: but 'twill be
very strange if a clear eye make the whole body full of light, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
those performances which have no relation to the soul. Most
of the actions of our life are common and indifferent, serve only the
necessities or recreations of nature, and how can these be holy?
Why yes, by pure Religious intentions a man may sanctify all the
actions of his life, and if <hi>thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be
full of light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether you eat or drink or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory
of God,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31. Every therefore the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
action may be intended to Gods glory, and then 'tis sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
That the Lord should look for honor from the devout perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
of our strictest Religion, 'tis no wonder, for therefore he
requires them: but that when in the meanest instance I do serve
my self, in doing so I should be able to give glory to my God, is sure
by vertue of some strange stratagem, some Divine elixar that will
so transmute things: why a good meaning will do this. To shew
thee how, when thou goest about the employments of thy lawful
calling, have but good thoughts about thee, good intentions in
them, and the actions of thy calling are for the uses of grace, and
thy necessities do prove thy vertue. As for instance, when thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourest
do but consider to what pains sin hath put thee, sells thee
thy bread for sweat; for if man had not sin'd, <hi>Eden</hi> had furnish't
him with all the delicacies of Paradise, without his care or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution,
and he had had the fruits of the tree of life without
the pains of planting any thing: 'tis sin that gives thee all this toil;
and then do but resolve to use this as an argument to thy self to
make thee hate the cause of so much trouble: I will sure labour
most against that, which hath so chang'd and debas'd my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and which do's aim to make me far more miserable to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
If I am weary of my work e're night, what shall I be of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlastingness
of torment? If little thirsty heats and drops of sweat
offend me, what will unquenchable feavors, and what a lake of
brimstone? And think again upon the mercies of thy God, who
offers thee at the rate of easier endeavors the food that lasteth to
eternal life; the calling of a Christian being the least painful, and
yet it brings the greatest fruits, the price of that high calling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
blessedness, if thou but labor in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:40114:142"/>
If thou be sustaining the necessities of nature in meat and drink,
look up to him that do's provide for them, and resolve only not
to use his blessings to his dishonor by excesses, not to spew his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
out into his face again; but use them as assistances of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to enable thee for such emploiments as his providence hath
assign'd to thee.</p>
                  <p>And in thy recreations also do but take notice thankfully how
God hath provided for delights too, how he hath not only brought
forth <hi>bread to strengthen man,</hi> but <hi>wine to make his heart glad, and
oyl to make him a cheerful countenance,</hi> and instruments of sport
to delight him: and but acknowledg all these things to God, and
intend with thy self to use them only to his ends. Thy calling ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to provide for thy subsistence here, that thou may'st serve
him, or to do good to others. Thy meals for preservation of
that life which he hath lent thee for his uses; and recreations for
refreshment and for health; and make no doubt if nothing do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose
to spoil these instances, that thou art serving God in all of
these, that thy most secular actions are thus make spiritual imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by being dedicated so to God undertaken in his fear, and
intended for the uses of his providence: so that if whensoever
thou art going about any thing, thou do but ask thy self, why
thou do'st set upon it, and can'st but make a good intention look
towards it, and resolve only to let it serve such ends, resolve not
to transgress in it the bounds that God hath set thee either of time
or measure, and to make all subordinate and to assist towards pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
some way or other; and then sometimes with eyes lift up,
call for, and look for a blessing down upon thee in it: and by this
means the action is sanctified, so thou dost consecrate thy deeds
to God and he accepts thy meaning in it, as an offering to him,
the action is adopted into the stock of Religion meant to God, and
so thy whole life may be made pious by such good intentions, and
thus thy single eye makes thy whole body full of light.</p>
                  <p>And this consideration alone might apply it self with pressing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
upon us. Shall I think God not easy to be serv'd when I may
teach my recreations to serve him? Shall I think Heaven placed out
of my possibilities, when I can learn my sports to wing me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it? Religion sure is not so very difficult, when a good ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
meaning can transmute every action of my life into Religion;
and then who would not at such easy rates change his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which he must do, and his sports which he will do, into
pieties; when it is don by putting good intentions into them, by
good thoughts and ejaculations engaging God along in them?
But the last words do urge an application which I promised in one
word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body is full of darkness.</hi> My brethren,
if ill intentions have so destructive an influence upon our actions,
that when the end is foolish, tho the action I practise be a vertue, yet
that aim do's defeat it of its vertuosness, it loseth all its tast of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and an ill enddo's debauch it into vice, as I have prov'd; and so
for want of a good meaning I either lose my Religion, or my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
becomes sin unto me: Unhappy I that when with such inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40114:142"/>
I practise duty, I lose the pleasures or the profits of the sins
I might have practis'd every jot as innocently, and much more
usefully, as to those ends; and I lose the duty, and by the very
duty I purchase condemnation; enjoy neither the vice I do omit,
nor yet the piety I practise, nor any thing, but the sad sentence of
<hi>they have their reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And on the other side, if my ends be never so pious, if I intend
to compass them by unlawful means, and do evil tho that good
may come thereof; what do's the justice of my ends do for me, but
only make damnation just to me? Alas! then in one word what
is their doom, who do by evil means intend to compass evil ends,
whose intentions are intirely singly wicked, that design only the
plesures or the profits of iniquity, that level directly at sin both all
the way and at the mark too, whose aimes and whose contrivances
are wickedness, thy purpose such an evil action, and care not by
what means they compass it, so they acquire their ends? Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
had no way to express the condition fo these, but that of an
admiring question: <hi>If the light that is in thee be darkness, how great
is that darkness?</hi> The Sinner notwithstanding all his pomp of
shine and splendor, that he thinks himself cloth'd with, drest up
with guilded profits or with a glory of pleasures; yet he is still in
the dark, his life is all night, and that condition, which three days
made intolerable to Egypt, is always on the Sinners soul; he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velop't
in thick <hi>darkness</hi> like theirs <hi>that may be</hi> felt by any thing
but by a soul of such stupidity as the sinners is; a darkness such as
Christ had not a fit word for, nor did know how to phrase but by
being astonish't at it. <hi>How great is that darkness!</hi> a state indeed
that is most proper for his deeds and intentions of darkness that
need a night to cover them: a darkness, that do's border on the
regions of utter darkness, that shall never have any dawne, but
such as flaming brimstone strikes into it: and O <hi>How great is
that darkness?</hi> O blessed Savior, who art the day spring from on
high, that came to visit us, deliver us from those dark regions. O
thou Eternal Sun of righteousness that camest to enlighten the
darknesses of the world by thy example and by thy doctrine, and
the illuminations of thy Holy Spirit, let these thy methods shine
powerfully upon our souls to scatter all the clouds and mists that
dwell upon our hearts; that we may have no misapprehensions of
our duty, that our intentions may be clear, our affections pure,
and all our actions regular and holy. Wee know, O Lord, we were
created for thy glory, and our own eternal happiness: We beseech
thee direct all the purposes of our minds, the inclinations of our
hearts and actions of our lives unto these blessed ends. Teach us
to mind thee in every thing we do, that so whatever we shall do in
our whole lives, may work towards our future happy life. Let no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy
aims mixe with any of our actions, no forbidden contrivances or
purposes creep into, and make sinful our performancs. Let not
self-ends of pride, vain-glory, gain, revenge, or any vice make
our Religion hypocrisy of sin, nor any poor low ends of little
pleasure or of profit rob the actions of our callings or recreations
of that Religion, which a good intention may put into them: but
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40114:143"/>
make all our actions so orderly and temperate, and so subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to holy ends, that they may all turn into duty: make us hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intent on our Religious performances in their seasons, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
all our other works to the occasions of Religion, and
making them serve and assist towards it, and thereby become Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
that so our whole lives may be consecrated unto thee, and
our whole conversation become holy. And do thou prevent us in all
our doings with thy most gracious favor, and further them with thy
continual help, that in all our works begun, continued and ended in
thee, we may glorify thy holy name, and after an age of doing so
may be glorisied with thee in thy Kingdom, thy power and thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for ever &amp;c.</p>

THE LIGHT OF THE BODY
is the Eye.</head>
                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>Matt. 6. 22, 23.</bibl>
                     <q>The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thy eye be single,
thy whole body shall be full of light.</q>
                     <q>But if thine eye be evill, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.
If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is
that darkness?</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat is observ'd of the lights of our daies that they
still abound in their senses; will appear true of
the light in the Text: and indeed 'tis but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
that it should have that most excellent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of light still to communicate it self without
decay, to pour out fresh streams every moment,
and yet be still the same: one of the rivulets we
have exhausted in the last daies discourse; and we shall also find
that in another sense <hi>The light of the body is the eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Amongst the divers things to which the Eye in the Text may
have Analogy, and which may make Christs Aphorism here true
in the spiritual sense, as well as in the outward literal; the second
and indeed in my apprehension much more proper then that I have
already given, tho not so general, is <hi>Conscience;</hi> that Eye of the
mind in order to practice, from which alone and nothing else in
matters of Religion the actions have all their direction and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;
and which so far as it is clear and well informed, the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are regulated by it are all full of light and Piety: and on
the other side so far as the Conscience is amiss, so far the mans
deeds must of necessity be dark and evil. And that I may now for
all say, without discussing every minute particular Analogy, 'tis for
this that the expressions of <hi>blindness of mind, understanding darkened,</hi>
and <hi>sins</hi> being call'd <hi>darkness;</hi> and on the contrary holiness <hi>light,</hi>
and the <hi>Eye of the understanding enlightened,</hi> are so frequent in the
Scripture, to let us see the whole comparison is good. For to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to you that the Conscience may be properly set out by the
Analogy of an eye, I need but tell you this eye of the mind is in
the little world the frame of man, the true deputy and Vicegerent
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:40114:144"/>
of that universal and all seeing eye of Providence and inspection:
for as that eye of inspection spies all our waies, watches over all
a mans motions, inclinations and thoughts; and as the eye of
Providence guides and directs every thing to its ends; all this the
Conscience do's in man: 'tis privy to every little rising of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
it knows each bending of the will. There is not any clos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
no recess in the whole heart, where the soul can retire to
think of, wish, or design any thing, but this same Eye of Conscience
looks in, beholds it all, and lays it up. And Conscience also is the
under-Eye of Providence in man, it prescribes to all our actions,
it leads the will that <hi>potentia caeca,</hi> and gives directions to all that
man attemts or do's in matter of Religion. <hi>Thy word,</hi> saith Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
<hi>is a lanthorn to my feet, and light to my paths,</hi> and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Gods Commandments are the light we are to walk by, except
we will walk on in darkness unto the land of utter darkness. But
as a lanthorn is no guidance to the blind, and a light is of use
only where there is an eye; so Gods commandments can have no
influence upon, nor give direction or assistance to our waies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
this eye of the mind be enlightned by them; for it is Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that is the conveiance to all duty to the heart of man, that
cannot set up obedience, but as the Conscience do's press it on it,
that conveys the immediate obligation. My Conscience tells me
this I must forbear, that I must practise. Yea where there was no
law to give direction, the eye of Conscience looking o're the frame
of man, a creature reasonable in his making, could strait see a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of doing things agreable to right reason; and viewing the
materials of the pile saw he was built of Soul as well as body, of
of an immortal Spirit, as well as a carnal part, knew that his life
was to be order'd to the uses of the Spirit, as well as of the flesh:
(and more indeed that being the better part) and easily could
gather hence, that man was not to serve his lower brutish part the
body, so as to discompose his soul, and when it did so did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him for the doing of it. And upon this S. Paul affirms.
Rom. 2. 14, 15. <hi>When the Gentiles that have not the Law, do by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the things contained in the Law, they having not the Law, are a
Law unto themselves, which shew the work of the Law written on their
hearts, their Conscience bearing them witness.</hi> Which says that tho
the rest of the world had not the Revelation of Gods will, and
Law as the Jews had, yet from the dictats of their reason, and the
notions of good and evil implanted in them, their conscience did
oblige them unto the performance of such things as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and upon such performance or omission without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Law did either excuse them, as men that did not culpably
wander out of those paths, which the light and Eye that God had
planted in them, did direct them in; or else accuse them as trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors,
and render them obnoxious to punishment. And so it did
before the Law. So Rom. 5. 13, 14. <hi>For until the Law sin was in the
world, but sin is not imputed where there is no Law, Nevertheless
death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
after the similitude of Adams transgressions.</hi> First after Adams
time till Moses before the giving of the Law men fin'd, and tho
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40114:144"/>
it be true that sin is not charg'd to punishment but where there
is a Law to forbid it under that penalty, and therefore it might be
thought that sin without the Law would not have brought death
into the world, yet from <hi>Adam</hi> till <hi>Moses</hi> death reign'd, men
died that had not sinn'd as <hi>Adam</hi> did against an express actual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
promulgated, as his was, and establish't with a positive threat
of death: but died because they had sinn'd against the laws of
their nature, the principles of duty that were put into their
making, which Conscience prest upon their practise and whose gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
they would not follow, they pull'd death upon themselvs in
the errors of their waies.</p>
                  <p>'Twas by the equity of this that when <hi>the wickedness of men grew
great in the earth,</hi> the <hi>floud</hi> grew so too: an inundation of waters
overspread it, when sin had once don so, and iniquity against the
dictates of conscience struck all the world at once with death, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
eight persons. Conscience therefore where there is law, and
also where there is none, is the great director of our actions; and
to this I shall apply our Saviors discourse dividing not the Text
but Conscience, and in the several members verifying what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
he reaffirms.</p>
                  <p>1. Conscience either respecteth actions to be don, or actions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
don. First as it respecteth actions to be don, telling us this
we must do, that we must forbear, so first as it answers to the single
Eye, it denotes the pure Conscience the enlightned <hi>Eye of the mind</hi>
as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, that is a truly well inform'd Conscience, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
that judges according to its rule: and to this I shall first
tell you what is the entire rule of conscience, and consequently
when its dictates are right, when it informs me truly this I must do,
that I must forbear.</p>
                  <p>2. Prove to you that all our actions that are regulated by such
a well inform'd conscience are good and honest; so that if this
eye be single, the whole body shall be full of light. If the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
be pure, the man's holy, and so the first part of the text is
proved.</p>
                  <p>2. As it answers to the evil eye, so it denotes an evil conscience,
a conscience that do's not give true judgment of duty, ill inform'd.
And this either First wholly so, and then <hi>'tis reprobate sense,</hi>
such as that of them that <hi>call good evil and evil good,</hi> from which
men are stil'd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 1 Tim. 4. 2. or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, saith <hi>Phavorinus,</hi> Rom. 1. 31. Or secondly but in part,
and then 'tis either first an erring conscience, or secondly a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
conscience, or thirdly a scrupulous conscience, to which also
several others will fall in. And I shall shew you how every of these
do's mislead a man into the dark. The scrupulous raiseth clouds and
mists about him, dark errors and discomforts too: the doubtful do's
instead of guiding leave him so puzl'd, that he knows not which
way to be-take himself; and the erring conscience lights him into
the pit, takes him by the hand to thrust him down, guides him into
a necessity of sin; and the no conscience, the reprobate sense, it is
a darkness somwhat worse then that, the blackness of Hell here.
All this I shall do in order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:40114:145"/>
Upon the other part conscience as it relates to actions already don,
so it do's testify, and in so doing <hi>either excuse or accuse</hi> Rom. 2. 15. Now
tho conscience in the other former respect hath indeed the greater
influence upon our practise, and so to it the text do's more directly
answer: yet this latter having some also in order to the making fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
actions holy by repentance, (for when once the soul hath
shipwrack't on a sin, and she is ready to sink and perish, there is no
plank on which she can escape but repentance.) Now 'tis this Eye
that must look out for that; 'tis an accusing conscience that must set
him upon Repentance: this hurry's him about and will not let him
rest, 'till he get upon the plank that's fastned to the Anchor, even the
Anchor of hope, by which until it be secur'd, a good conscience ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is at quiet. Because I intend to say but little to this, I shall dispatch
it now. And that in order to its actions excusing and accusing.</p>
                  <p>And first if conscience be the Eye: then a clear single eye is a clear
conscience; and then of that it must be true that it do's make the
man full of light; and so it do's indeed as light do's signify joy and
gladness, and so it often do's in Scripture <hi>Psalm</hi> 4. 6, 7. And truly
the applauds of an honest undeceiving heart, that is conscious to it
self of cordial endeavors after good, and knows it neither had ill
ends nor ill means, they shed comforts beyond all that the earth
can give, they shed <hi>the peace of God that passeth understanding.</hi> If
my conscience be clear, let my condition be never so overcast,
never so dark and cloudy, yet do I live in shine. This is the only
thing that makes every estate gladsome: If my condition be low
pressing adversity, yet if my conscience assure me 'tis not my fault
that threw me down into it, my sin did not put out the light of
Gods candle of prosperity that before shone about me; but rather
because I would hold fast my duty, and would not let go a good
conscience, therefore I was thrown down with them into deep af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
here my conscience assures me I am in a case which S.
<hi>James</hi> bids me <hi>count all joy</hi> Jam. 1. 2. and which our Savior do's
call <hi>blessed</hi> Matth. 5. 11. S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells me: <hi>If ye be reproched for the
name of Christ</hi> (and 'tis so for all duty) <hi>happy are ye; for the spirit
of Glory and of God resteth on you,</hi> 1 Pet. 14. 14. What if I be <hi>in
the place of Dragons,</hi> my conscience do's assure me 'twas my duty
not guilt did put me there, that is, God brought me thither, and he
is with me there: <hi>the Spirit of God resteth on you.</hi> What if I be in
darknesss and <hi>dimness of anguish,</hi> encompast with the <hi>shadow of
death,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Glory</hi> resteth on me. And then sure a clear
conscience makes the man full of light, when it makes him full of
glory: when in his darkest solitudes there do's break in the light
of Gods countenance.</p>
                  <p>Let them be sadded with afflictions, who understand no delight
but in carnalities, whose souls are married to some little comforts
of this world. Adversity indeed sweeps all their joys away at once,
a cross throws blacks upon them strait, their heart's in mourning
instantly. But he that understands the comforts of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and knows where to find them, and hath a treasure of
them in his breast, will soon be able to allay the other sadnesses.</p>
                  <p>What can I want while I have <hi>a continual feast,</hi> for so'is a good
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40114:145"/>
conscience? It is not in the power of words to express the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this blisful state. It is <hi>the peace of God which passeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi>
Phil. 4. 7. and tho felicity seems to be measur'd by our
perception of it, here we are happy beyond the scanty limits of our
narrow apprehensions, do not take in the beatific object, but are
our selves enclos'd, and <hi>enter into the joy of our Lord,</hi> Matt. 25. 23.</p>
                  <p>2. In order to the second act, accusing; if conscience be an eye,
then the well qualified eye is the tender conscience. I mean not
in the modern sense, not only as it is accompanied with, but as
'tis but another word for a weak Judgment and a proud heart;
sturdy opposing private opinion or phancy against public autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
And whereas conscience is said to be the eye of the soul, a
tender conscience has the sme importance in this case, as when we
call a blear or bloudshot, a tender eye. A gentle word for a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
malady. The innocent importance of the word is that which
denotes, besides weakness in judging, quickness in perception; for
conscience is the judgment of the mind concerning actions, and
whatsoever is tender is weak; but a conscience which is such, as
tender things are alwaies, is sensible of every the least touch of guilt,
checks at whatsoever we do amiss; the least thing we do is a wound
to it. This is the tender conscience. Such a one as is deeply sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the majesty, and power, and justice of Almighty God, and
the fatally provoking guilt of sin; fears alwaies, doubts and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
foregoes lawful enjoyment, least they should prove to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
and flies from every not only approch, but even appearance
of evil. This is an uneasy state, but the inconvenience is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
repaid by the safety it procures, whilst this flaming sword
that turns every way, guards both our Paradise and us, and suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
render us secure. But if my heart grow hard, not tender, and
my conscience insensible, there is no hopes of cure.</p>
                  <p>I shall content my self with this one instance in answer to the evil
eye as it relates to both these actions of accusing and excusing: tho
I might also name the conscience that accuseth to despair. This is
an evil eye indeed that entertains it self with the terrors of utter
darkness in their own shapes, that sees nothing but feinds, those
spirits of the dark; nor will see any other. An eye that will not
endure, but hates the least light of instruction or comfort. A dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
this, out of which the grave hath been counted an
escape, the darks of death a refuge, yea to avoid the horror they
have run into the shades of Hell. And oh! how great, how insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
is this darkness?</p>
                  <p>But God knows in this age we see little cause to fear, nor reason
to endeavor to prevent this. Some little beginnings of it would
be mercies to most men, the danger now a daies is in the insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of conscience, the heart that never do's accuse of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
in earnest, nay rather do's find out excuses; it do's not
check or sting them to the quick, but rather tickles them. Good
God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the heathens had a much more tender constitution of soul.

They that knew not there was an Hell to recompence iniquity,
nor knew that God threaten'd it with plagues; yet when they
heard it thunder, their guilt did strike them like the thunder-bolts,
their souls did faint as it were the voice of God pronouncing wrath
to their iniquities, as if its lightnings were the flashes of that brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
in whose eternal burnings sin must dwell. This conscience
did in them, when knowing Christians can stand unappal'd. We
read of men of <hi>sear'd consciences</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 2. and such indeed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be tender. Searing do's make insensible of pricks or little
touches, that you may lance and gash, and it will not perceive.
And so it seems are some mens consciences: and you will find there
some other qualifications of such men, they <hi>depart from the faith,</hi>
they <hi>give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of Devils;</hi> and it will
be no wonder if they desert the holy Christian faith, who have put
themselves under the tutorage of Satan, and have imbib'd the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Devils,</hi> who with his institution, have receiv'd his flames,
whose consciences are fear'd, that feel no stripes from their commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and are such whom sin do's not wound.</p>
                  <p>We read of a strange <hi>evil eye</hi> Matth. 7, 3. <hi>seest not the beam that
is in thine own eye.</hi> A beam upon the eye must needs make all dark:
but the insensibleness of such an eye, that do's not feel a beam is
strange beyond imagination, yet 'twas but fit to word a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that was not sensible of the guilt of wilful gross deliberate
sins; 'tis like an eye that under the dead weight of a mighty beam
yet rouls and feels no pressure. A much worse then feared conscience
this. That which is seared tho it will not shrink for a prick or gash,
yet 'twill shrink under load; but this feels no degree of weight; but
tho it be that weak and tender part the eye, yet is this without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under that which the whole body cannot stand under, nothing
but pillars can support.</p>
                  <p>The characters of such a conscience, and its dark consequence
(to fit it to my text,) are given by S. Paul Eph. 4. 18, 19. You see
here a <hi>blind heart</hi> like an evil eye creates a darkness such as makes
them <hi>aliens to the life of God;</hi> for indeed they lead the life of feinds
the inhabitants of darkness, and they do quickly grow to an estate
<hi>past feeling,</hi> and then they commit evil <hi>with greediness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed 'twere very easy for me to shew how this do's grow
by deading the tenderness of conscience at the first, by fortifying
against its checks and pricks, by seeking little excuses to allay
and palliate the sores, either Christ do's not mean so strictly; or
getting other principles to set against the strictness, as custome of
the age, or honor, or the like; God knows things that will not
be principles, nor be allow'd in any lest degree, when he comes
to examin, but in the mean time they do stop the mouth of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the doing so frequently, together with the conversations
of sin, do clear take off the horror, and the aversation, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
the sense<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the mind first leaves to be affraid and startle at it,
and then leaves to check for it. All this I could deduce at large, but
that I hasten to the other remaining consideration of conscience,
as it respecteth actions to be don, as it signifies the judgment of the
mind informing us what we may or must do, or what we must forbear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:40114:146"/>
And so, I told you, as it answers to the single eye, so it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
the pure Conscience, the enlightened eye of the mind,
that is, a truly well inform'd conscience, a conscience that
judges according to its rule. And to this I must (what I promised)
tell you first, What is the entire Rule of conscience, that so we may
know when conscience do's inform us truly this we must do, that
not. For conscience being not it self supreme director, it hath a
God above it, that conscience may be right, it must be according
to its rule, therefore we must enquire of that; and</p>
                  <p>First 'tis certain that the Law of God in force (as all the law of
Christ is to us Christians, particularly that of these Chapters that
contain Christs sermon on the Mount, Repentance, self-denial, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
forgiving injuries, humility &amp;c.) is a rule of conscience. And
here I will suppose that I do not speak to <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and that I
need not to prove that we are oblig'd to do what God by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
has enjoin'd, and that whether the mandate terminat in duty
to himself, or to our fellow men, especially his Vicegerent upon
earth the lawful Magistrate. There are some men I know who would
acquit themselves to their Governors, if they are content to suffer in
case of disobedience: but unless there were guilt in the neglect of
active obedience, it would be very unjust to enforce passive, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when 'tis plain that all the Apostles arguings Rom. 13. do
prove an obligation to active duty. 1. Because the Magistrate hath
Commission from God; and therefore he that will not yeild active
obedience to their lawful constitutions, will not obey the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
v. 2. and then 4. <hi>he is the minister of God,</hi> his officer; and he
that do's refuse obedience to those Constitutions of an officer, which
his superior hath impower'd him to make, he do's refuse it to that
Superior. And out of these he then infers <hi>Wherefore ye must needs
be subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea indeed if the just laws of such Governors do not oblige the
conscience, neither can many of Gods laws. To instance; God
hath commanded me I shall not steal, and I think my self bound in
conscience not to do it; but what is it to steal? To take that which
of right is another mans against his will. And what do's give a right
but human Law? 'Tis according to that, any thing is thine or mine.
Christ do's not interpose in setling rights; for when the man would
have had him <hi>speak</hi> to his <hi>Brother to divide the inheritance with him;</hi>
answers <hi>Man who made me a Judge or a divider</hi> amongst you, let the
laws do it. That inheritance which here a Man do's claim as eldest,
in other places of this very Nation the youngest should have only
right too; where the tenure of Burrough English takes place.
And again in other places each brother should have equal right to
by Gavelkind. And in some other Nations, as in <hi>Denmark</hi> for
example, no child of any second Wife hath any right, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the example of <hi>Abraham:</hi> yet all these several waies of right
are one as just as another, and in one place the one hath as true a
right as the other hath in the other. Establish't laws therefore do
give the only right, and by those human Laws thou hast a right
in conscience to that which they make thine; for otherwise how
can it be a sin against my conscience to take that from thee, which
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:40114:147"/>
neither thou nor any man else hath a right in conscience to? Such
human laws therefore do oblige the Conscience, or else Gods
eighth and tenth Commandements cannot.</p>
                  <p>3. There is yet another branch of the Rule of conscience, and
that is the law of scandal. In things that both by Gods and by
mans law are free to me to do or not, if yet by doing any of them,
or by not doing, I see others will be ensnared in sin, I am bound
in conscience to avoid either such actions or omissions. 1 Cor. 8.
from v. 8. Rom. 14.</p>
                  <p>And here I will not wonder how barefac't temtations to vice,
and pressing sin upon a man with all the arts of friendship, or of
treachery or force, should grow to be civilities and kindnesses;
when an innocent lawful action is so ill character'd because it may
prove a stumbling block: but I will only sum up what hath been
said in one word: the Will of God is the Rule of conscience, I am
bound in conscience to do what God will have; and so the law of
Christ, and the just laws of our just Governors (which that we should
submit too, <hi>is the will of God</hi> saith S. <hi>Peter</hi>) and the law of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
are the full and entire rule of conscience. Whatsoever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
or forbid, that my conscience, if it be rightly inform'd, will
tell me I must do or forbear; and if I act according to the dictates
of a conscience so inform'd, my actions will be good and honest,
and such a single eye makes my whole body full of light, which was
the second thing.</p>
                  <p>Now this is prov'd in one word; that must needs be a good
life, which is regulated by a good conscience, because all good
life is call'd by the name of a <hi>good conscience</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 19. This was
S. <hi>Pauls</hi> whole charge to Timothy <hi>holding faith and a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
there's the belief and duty that's the whole. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. a
good conscience is explain'd by <hi>a good Conversation in Christ,</hi> and
plainer yet Heb. 13. 18. <hi>We trust we have a good conscience willing in
all things to live honestly.</hi> Sincere endeavors to obey the conscience
in every thing, not boggling with it accepting the persons of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and being very conscientious in some things, but taking liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in other, bribing my conscience to wink like an evil eye, and
leave me in the dark as to some actions, this is not to be conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious;
he is so only that is <hi>willing to live honestly in all things,</hi> and
to do so is matter for the Apostles confidence <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. This also
was the sum of all S. <hi>Paul</hi> himself endeavored after Acts 24. 16.
<hi>And herein do I exercise my self to have alwaies a conscience void of
offence towards God and towards man.</hi> He had no stricter aims, here
was the height of his Religion, these were his exercises. And the
antient Father <hi>Clemens Alex. Strom.</hi> 6. says <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
And what would any man have
more? Yea 'tis apparent from the very terms; for if thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
truly inform thee of all thy duty, and thou dost accordingly,
then thou dost all thy duty, or which is all that we can do. So far as
thy hearty endeavor is to this, so far is thy life good and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
                  <p>And here I have an hint for application by conviction of those,
who guide their conscience, and consequently their lives by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40114:147"/>
and fancies, and not by the certain rules of conscience, the
laws I have assign'd. Some men will call that conscience which is
their inclination, tho they do not examin whence the inclination
springs, from God, or from suggestion of an interest, or an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and think they are bound to do, or may do that they have a
mind to do. Some mens rash heats that have somthing like zeal,
and it may be that have good intentions in them, are strait the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of their Conscience, and they must actuate those animosities
and heats, for they are bound in conscience. Some men are advis'd
by their fears, and that will look like conscience in a little time.
Some mens imaginations promted by loose and libertine interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Scripture or false infusions, are strait their conscience,
and then their conscience tells them they must act accordingly.
But where's the Law for these? Conscience was, I told you, Gods
Vicegerent, possest his throne in man, and was his Deputy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
to all mans actions and took cognizance of them; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
did sentence: and will a man have humor give the Law
to Gods Vicegerent, or vain imaginations rule <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>that God
within us,</hi> as the ancients call'd it, set fancy on the Throne?</p>
                  <p>Or I might secondly complain of them that would divide the
rule of conscience, and pick and chuse and take but part of it; the
immediate law of God they would think themselves bound to, but
for the law of scandal they regard it little. Who did make them the
keepers of their brothers soul? If others by misunderstanding of
their actions be drawn to sin, at their own peril be it; and at so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
rates they value the salvation of that soul, which Christ thought
worth his bloud, that for their <hi>meat or drink,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> words it,
<hi>they will let their Brother perish, for whom Christ died,</hi> do actions for
their interest or security under a close and secret sense of their
own, which being not understood by other weaker souls that look
on their example with some Reverence, they are led to sin and to
perdition.</p>
                  <p>But much less do they think a law of man a Rule for conscience.
According to the Spartan method, to be found out was transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the law, the crafty performance was merit and vertue: and
whereas only Almighty God has cognizance of the heart, his laws
alone can reach designs and the obortive issues of the thought, or
those reserv'd enormities that are committed in the dark, and
without the privity of a witness.</p>
                  <p>Here were a subject for a sad complaint, but that I have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for a worse, and that is of the conscience, that answers to the
evil eye, the other subject of the parable, that is, an evil conscience,
a conscience that do's not give true judgment of duty, ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.
And first that which is totally, or for the most so, and of
that but a word for 'tis not pleasant sure to rake in such a
sinke.</p>
                  <p>We read in Scripture, of men given up to a <hi>reprobate mind</hi> or
sense, Rom. 1. 28. <hi>and to every good Work reprobate</hi> Tim. 1. 16. men
who against all the checks of conscience, and in despite of all its
oppositions have chosen and pursued forbidden interests and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
so long, till custome of them hath made them a part not only of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40114:148"/>
their family but themselves: and they do nothing now but prosecute
them by contrivances and actions, and have don this till conscience
is stupified; and as pleasures are especially saith Aristotle, <hi>corruptive
of principles,</hi> from the absolute necessity they have conceived of
them they think them little sins, and from a long practise none
at all, these men are so far in a reprobate ense, their hearts
give a false judgment, as false indeed as Satan would have
them give, and falser much then he can give himself of things
of Religion, who believes and trembles. For they stick not to
think those terrors Clergy men do talk of are but mormo's, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of fear, only Religious spectres, shades of terror; those stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctnesses
of vertue and of the means of practising it, but the
dreams of bigots, foolish self injuries, and those things we with
so much eager zeal call sins, the only and not dangerous enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>'Tis the Apostles asseveration, and it is justified by every daies
unhappy experience, that <hi>evil men and seducers wax worse and
worse, deceiving and being deceiv'd</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 13. Habits of ill em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
gradually as those of vertue; only with this difference, that
the grouth is more suddain and prosperous: like that of weeds
and noxious plants in respect of those which are medicinal. There
is no opinion, nor no practice so bad which men by degrees can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make plausible; as custome renders vice necessary, so by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
it becomes acceptable; the first horrors are soon worn
off; and as it fares in War; the enemy is made a servant, and
after grows up to be a favorite, and is at length a master. The
progress from bad to worse, is like that of heavy bodies down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
the native weight, gains fresh accessions from the decent
already made, and the motion being continued grows still more
rapid and irresistible. That fool who said in his heart there is
no God, e're long emproves into a wit, and loudly saies there
neither is or can be one. Conscience gall'd with perpetual ill u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
contracts a callows hardness, and becomes utterly insensible;
and by these unhappy steps, ungodly men are dead, while they
live 1 Tim. 5. 6. are <hi>dead in trespasses and sins.</hi> Eph. 2. 1.</p>
                  <p>O thou the day-spring from on high that cam'st to visit us,
who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, in ignorance and
sin, and in the suburbs of eternal darkness, shed thy light in our

give us enlightned minds, and sanctified wills and affections. Thou
hast plac'd conscience in thy stead within us, to do thy offices and
to be thy Vicegerent, to lay thy laws to us for our direction, and to
watch over all our actions, to teach us, to convince us, to correct,
or comfort us. Furnish we beseech thee then this thy commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
within us with all qualifications necessary for thy offices, endue
it with the knowledg of all thy will, that we may have a right
judgment in all things, and then endue us with obsequious hearts,

us from this sad state and the occasions of it, and if at any time we

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have drawn you the parallel betwixt the Eye
and the Conscience, to several of their objects and
uses; shew'd you how the clear eye is not a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
guide to a mans walks, nor finds more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in the prospects of those beauties that are
made to temt and entertain the sight, then a
pure conscience do's find in looking over the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shape
of a life led righteously, soberly, and Godly, which it must
needs if it follow the guidance of this single eye, this well-inform'd
conscience: I have lead you also to the confines of that more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
prospect, the dark of that sad state, which an evil conscience
do's lead into. This I have done in one, and that in the worst
consideration, that of a sear'd reprobate conscience; there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
three that I propos'd to consideration; the first that of an
erring conscience, second doubtful, third scrupulous.</p>
                  <p>And now I am to shew how each of these do's lead a man into
the dark; the scrupulons raiseth a dust about him, leads into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and discomfort too; the doubtful do's instead of guiding him
leave him so puzl'd that he knows not which way to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and the erring conscience lights him into the pit, and takes
him by the hand only to thrust him down: if in any of these waies
<hi>the eye be evil, the whole body shall be full of darkness.</hi> Of these in
their order.</p>
                  <p>2. An erring conscience, a conscience that gives false informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of duty, that either tells me I may or I must do that which
either Gods Law or some Law in force upon me tells me I must
not do; or else tells I must not do that which I am bound to do,
or at the least may do. Now that this is a light indeed like those
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40114:149"/>
deceitful ones that lead men over precipices into dark ruins; like
such lights that were so plac'd between the rocks as to guide the
mariner into a shipwrack, to make it necessary for him to be dasht
against the one or the other, is most certain: for so it is here.
There is scarce such another infelicity as that this man lies under,
whose conscience tells him one thing, when God's Law, or that
which is any way his duty do's require the contrary; for if he do
according to the Law of God, he acts against his conscience, and
so sins; and if he act according to his conscience, he sins against
the Law of God. Poor soul! Sin lies on the right and on the left
hand, which way soever he do's turn, it seizes on him, and all this
I shall prove.</p>
                  <p>1. That if he act against his conscience he sins, (tho the Law of
God make it no sin) Scripture and reason shall make good.
Rom. 14. 14. <hi>I know, and am perswaded by the Lord Jesus, that there
is nothing unclean of it self, but to him that esteemeth any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
to him it is unclean.</hi> God had once forbidden such and such
meats under pain of sin to the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and made them
unclean, that is, unlawful to their use: Now Christ had taken off
this obligation, and made all meats lawful for any man; S. <hi>Paul</hi>
saith that he knew so. I am assur'd that Christ hath so remov'd
all obligation to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> that to a Christian no meat is
unlawful to be eaten: but yet for all this 'tis unlawful to him, who
thinks it still prohibited, and if his erring conscience tell him he
ought not eat it, tho by Christ's certain Law he may, he sins if
he do eat against his conscience, and that to such an height, that
he whose example wrought with him to eat against the perswasion
of his mind, destroyeth the man v. 15. <hi>Destroy not him with thy meat
for whom Christ died;</hi> 'tis therefore a destroying sin to do a lawful
thing against a mans conscience. The reason of all this is cleer,
because no Law of God or man, no rule of duty can be applied
unto us, but by the mediation of conscience: for till my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
laies it to my heart, and tells me such a thing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
and my duty, it is to me as if there were no such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and it were not my duty, for till then I knew nothing
of it; this alone therefore do's propose and apply duty to us, and
consequently whether that which it proposes be my duty really in
it self or no, yet I must needs look upon it as so, having no other
direction imaginable what to do or forbear, but what my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
some way instructed tells me God or my Governors have
commanded or forbid me. So that if I am resolv'd in my mind of
the sinfulness and obliquity of an action propos'd, tho really the
thing be innocent, yet to me in my present circumstance 'twill be
utterly unlawful, and tho the action be innocent, the agent will
be guilty.</p>
                  <p>2. That God hath plac'd the conscience in us as the only next
and immediate rule of all our actions, according to which they are
to be directed, which if they be not, they are faulty, as every
thing that swerves from its rule is not right: tho what I have
said will sufficiently prove, yet Scripture do's confirm; when it
saies Rom. 14. 23. <hi>Whatsoever is not of faith is sin,</hi> that is to say,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40114:150"/>
whatsoever is contrary to the perswasion of lawfulness, that is in
other words contrary to conscience, is sin; whatsoever he do's as
long as he thinks in conscience he should not do it, he sins whether
the thing be sin or no, as that was no sin of which he there spake.
And reason good; for we are so far honest hearted lovers of God,
as we embrace that which our hearts are really possest is his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and our duty, and hate the contrary; that is, as we follow
our conscience: conscience being nothing but the persuasion that
this is duty, which if we go against 'tis sure we like and follow that
which in our thoughts is vicious and wicked; be it what it will
in it self, to us 'tis so: 'tis sure the inclinations and the actions
pursue vice, when they pursue that which they cannot look upon
but as vice. Conscience therefore is the rule from which 'tis sin
to recede.</p>
                  <p>'Tis with fair pretence to reason said, that nothing can be a
rule which is it self crooked and irregular. That which is strait
is indeed said to be <hi>index sui &amp; obliqui,</hi> and having justified its own
rectitude, becomes qualified to be a test of right and wrong in
others. For certainly if the man knew what God's Law do's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of him, in that case the conscience do's not erre; if he do
not know what God's word do's require, how can he follow it
against that which his conscience tells him God requires? And
it is certain if the man should suspend his action, and have not
reason to act according to his erring conscience, he never can
have reason to act according to a conscience well-inform'd, not
when it tells him God is to be lov'd; for it is sure his conscience
do's as much propose the error as his duty, as it do's the truth:
the man as really believes the one is to be don as the other, and
hath no reason to make difference, and therefore if at any time
he must follow his conscience, he must alwaies, and it will be sin
to act against it, be it what it will.</p>
                  <p>But then you'l hope it will excuse to act according to it. Oh
no alas! for that's the second thing in this case of erring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
if a man act according to his conscience he sins too,
<hi>if he act against the Law of God.</hi> Scripture will furnish me with
several examples and proofs of this, and 'tis a doctrine worth the
taking notice of, it having prov'd to so many persons a plea for
actions otherwise abominable; they follow'd their conscience, 'twas,
it may be, mistake in judgment, but 'twas uprightness of heart,
sincerity of conscience. Now to take off this color, which I shall
do with all imaginable plainess. Our Savior John 16. 2. fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells
to his Disciples, <hi>they shall put you out of their Synagogues
yea the time will come that whosoever killeth you will think that he
doth God service,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that he do's offer God an obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or worship;</hi> shall think it not only lawful but acceptable to
God, and of the nature of a Sacrifice which propitiates for other
offences, to put you to death. See here a conscience bravely
glos'd, when the error look'd like Religion and Attonement,
(a color not at all strange to our daies in such another case,)
and yet these <hi>Jews</hi> that did so (for of them he speaks) were
given up to the direst punishments that ever any nation did
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40114:150"/>
groan under. Of the same <hi>Jews</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> saies Rom. 10. 2. <hi>I bear
them record, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg;</hi>
that is, I must testify of them, that they are very many of
them great zealots for their Law, as that which is commanded
them by God, and so in their way and heart zealous to have God
obeied, only for want of knowledg they are mistaken in their zeal.
Here is strong conscience granted in these <hi>Jews,</hi> and that built up
upon a Law of God, then indeed outdated, which yet thro a
zealous earnestness they were ignorant of: but yet the following
this zeal and conscience was plagued with total induration of
of that people c. 11. 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Nor was this S. <hi>Pauls</hi> heat against that persecuting nation, but that
Apostle do's more plainly yet and home to our matter say of himself,
Acts 23. 1. <hi>I have liv'd in all good conscience before God until this day:</hi> I
have all my life long, even when I was a defender of the <hi>Mosaical</hi>
Law against Christ's reformation, acted sincerely and uprightly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my conscience: and again 2 Tim. 1. 3. <hi>I thank God, whom
I serve from my forefathers with a pure conscience,</hi> i. e. whom I have
obeied sincerely all my time, even when thro ignorance I persecuted
the Christian faith, doing according to the dictate of my conscience,
and as I was perswaded I ought to do. And now if conscience will
excuse, there was enough of that, a <hi>good conscience</hi> and a <hi>pure
conscience;</hi> and will his fiery persecutions n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w by vertue of his
conscience be Christned holy zeal, shall the pure conscience make
his bloudy hands to be undefil'd? Oh no: 'twas <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> and
<hi>injury,</hi> and persecution, for all 'twas conscience, 1 Tim. 1. 13.
<hi>I was before a blasphemer,</hi> &amp;c. and notwithstanding I did it all in
the uprightness and sincerity of my heart, I am <hi>the chief of sinners,
v.</hi> 15. And let us not suppose these aggravations were laid on
by S. <hi>Paul</hi> upon himself because of his unbelief, that that was
the only thing that gave guilt to his actions, and that we thro
faith and assurance shall escape, if we do such gross actions out
of an erring conscience. For on the contrary S. <hi>Paul</hi> do's bring
his unbelief not as the Aggravation, but the Apology of his crimes,
he pleads that for himself <hi>v.</hi> 13. and he finds another occasion for
God's remitting him not from his conscience, which might alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
the faults, but by his being by the horror of his sins a greater
instance of God's wonderful grace in forgiving, <hi>v. 16. Howbeit for
this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew
forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in him to life everlasting.</hi> God dealt most mercifully with me,
call'd me from heaven, whilst I was persecuting him, to be a prime
object of his patience and longanimity, and in order of time the
first that was so miraculously call'd, that so the wickedest of the
Gentiles may in me have an example of hope of mercy, if they
shall come in to Christ.</p>
                  <p>And will it now be fit, my Brethren, with this of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who
notwithstanding such true pleas of conscience is forc'd to seek out
for such motives of forgiveness, and plead hard ignorance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
and yet confess himself the cheif of sinners, with this I say
to parallel some actions of our daies, that under the pretence of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:40114:151"/>
conscience (which too hath no Law, as that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> had, tho
then outdated) will justify forbidden actions even against repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
men will not ask forgiveness where they can pretend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
I could instance in a strange particular of one of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
and my knowledg of the person and the story suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
notorious, who because the Papists believing that to be
Christ, which indeed is bread, worship it, therefore thought in his
conscience all kneeling at the Sacrament Idolatry, and to that
error adding the command <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 6, 7, 8, 9. cut off his brother's
and his mother's head: yea and when condemn'd to death by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Law for the action, would not be beaten from his hold,
but on the strength of that mistaken place went as boldly with that
bloud on his hand and his soul to face the judgment seat, as he
could have don, had he bin wash'd in Christ's own bloud; and of
this resolute fury the Zealots of our neighbor country of <hi>Scotland</hi>
have made many recent instances in their reviv'd <hi>Ravilliacs.</hi> See
the sad issue of an erring conscience, an action whose horror feinds
would startle at, such a perswasion do's make meritorious, and yet
God knows, that erring consciences have brought the Parent of a
Nation (a thing of much direr guilt) to the same state; and yet
that conscience must be admitted an excuse, when God knows jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
and suspicions have bin all the ground and all the rule for
their determinations of conscience, and yet on that stock alone
they could misjudge and censure, speak evil of and revile the
actions of just Governors, and do that which I dare not say. When
against all Laws both of God and man, all ties sacred and civil,
obligations of oaths and duties, that it may be impossible to plead
ignorance, men yet will act under the banner of such a thin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that never could produce any Law of God for its direction
or its quiet, and yet think themselves secure. When a confident per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of heart, God knows how taken up, shall quite annual that
command of Christ, of taking up the Cross, and change that state
which he calls blessed, <hi>suffering for righteousness sake,</hi> (if there were
such a thing) change it into so great a curse, as men will rather
embowel themselves in their brother's hearts, involve a Nation in
bloud and misery, in guilt and ruin, than not throw off the Cross
from off their shoulders.</p>
                  <p>And now 'tis to no purpose to observe, that when perjury and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledg
and breach of almost every Commandment in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue
shall not only become tolerable, but be the only cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a godly side by vertue of a thing call'd conscience; surely
S. <hi>Paul</hi> was a weak man, that when he had don some such things
out of a good and pure conscience, yet calls himself the <hi>chief of
sinners.</hi> In like manner in the Church new religious fancies are
bold to take upon them the holy face of conscience, and then to
quicken men into schisms, and all uncharitable separations and
factions, withdrawing them from the obedience of them that have
the spiritual rule over them, not at all <hi>submitting themselves to them,
who by Gods appointment watch over their souls,</hi> but rather flying in
their faces, at once with open disobedience, loud reproches, bitter
censures, and severe condemnations. Others, <hi>by having had mens
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40114:151"/>
persons in admiration,</hi> and consequently their opinions, suffer'd
their models to be stampt upon their conscience, and then that
must justify Ecclesiastical parricides, destroying their own fathers
that begot them to the Church, and at once cutting off the whole
line of those progenitors, that can derive their race from Christ, a
fairer stem and pedigree than most can shew. But alas! my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
if we shall grant that these opinions really possess their souls,
and that in the uprightness of their heart they did pursue them, that
neither interest nor faction, nor having bin disoblig'd, or having
suffer'd, hath pufft up a passion into conscience, but that 'tis all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity;
yet we have seen that cannot bear us out in such commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
'tis but an erring conscience still that animates a man into
any breach of duty, and if there be no other Law to warrant
actions, the conscience is so far from being able to justify them,
that while it errs, it but entangles a man in the necessity of sinning,
leads him into such Labyrinths of guilt, that whatever he do's, he
offends: on one side if he do what his erring conscience dictates to
him, he sins against God's Law; on the other side, if he forbear,
he sins against God's Vicegerent, his own conscience; there is the
guilt of his deed, here is the guilt of his heart, which do's oblige
a man to follow that which it is sin to follow, and which makes
him he must and ought to do that, which he must not nor ought
to do.</p>
                  <p>And sure, my Brethren, the only application to such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is to advise the laying it aside, to rectify the error. Good
counsel that indeed, but the hardest to be taken in the world;
for that a man may rectify, he must know himself in an error,
and if he know that, then he hath not an erring conscience:
this when it is strongly so, doth not so much as doubt of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and while he do's not doubt, what temtation hath he so
much as to set upon the rectifying? I shall but name some
means.</p>
                  <p>The first will be Praier for Divine illumination; S. <hi>James</hi> has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
this, <hi>if any man lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth
to all men liberally, and upbraideth not,</hi> c. 1. 5. and our Savior has
promis'd, that <hi>he will give his Holy Spirit to them that ask him,</hi>
Luke 11. 13. whose office, we know, is <hi>to lead us into all truth,</hi>
John 16. 13.</p>
                  <p>The second means will be, not to be wanting to our selves,
not to <hi>shut our eies against,</hi> or <hi>resist the truth,</hi> Acts 28. 27.
2 Tim. 3. 8. nor by a wretchless unconcerndness take up with slight
appearances, and receive a vulgar error for a sacred revelation,
and <hi>having mens persons in admiration,</hi> Jude 16. <hi>believe as doctrines</hi>
the devices or <hi>commandments of men,</hi> Matt. 15. 9. not to consider
what this celebrated Teacher, or this Sect and Party say, but
make our resort to the Law and to the Testament, what Law of
God there is for, or against this action. For in this case it is most
true, <hi>There is one Law-giver, who can save and destroy,</hi> James 4. 12.
and if <hi>sin be the transgression of a law,</hi> 1 John 3. 4. it inevitably
follows, that <hi>where no law is, there is no transgression,</hi> Rom. 4. 15.
And yet 'tis strange to see, how men amuse and embarras them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40114:152"/>
in things that have no bottom or foundation in Scripture,
and in the mean time <hi>omit the weighty matters of the law, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
mercy, and faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if I have bin engag'd in any practices, of which by
the contrary practices of other sober rational men, I see there
may be reason, if not to doubt, yet to search into them; then
I'le take the same course in order to the settling, or the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of my judgment; and especially if any obligations to the
contrary have got possession of me, if obedience and meekness,
and peace of the State or Church, or any sacred bond, in a
word, if any commands of Superiors, or engagements to them
seem strong for the other side, then nothing but clear Law of God
or my Superiors shall fixe me.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, where things are not absolutely convincing on either
side, and there is no clear Law on neither, or else so much like Law
on both sides; here, as I must suspend if possible my action, for these
must needs make doubts, so if I be necessitated to act on one side or
other, then if my conscience do mistake, according to the degree
of my diligence in examining, so will be the degrees of my guilt. If
I have search't to my utmost, and so offend out of an ignorance I
could not overcome, it is the constant doctrine of all, that the
mercy of our God by the tenure of the Gospel will not impute the
error to a person otherwise of holy life: but if there was a means
of knowing, that either heat, or any other thing did hurry me
from a sufficient consideration thereof, according to my means
so is my sin. <hi>Abimelech</hi> had a competent ground to think that
<hi>Sarah</hi> was not <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife, when both herself, and he had told
him so, and upon that he saies, he took her to him <hi>in the integrity
of his heart,</hi> his conscience reasonably well-inform'd telling him
that he might do it; and yet God p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nisheth his hast: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
too speedily, his desire was too quick, did not proceed
by those slow steps, that a good careful conscience do's move with,
that will examin with all strictness where he discerns there will
be gross sin on the other side. The <hi>Jews</hi> had a strong prejudice
against Christ's reformation of the Law, by those so many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of Scripture that their sacrifices should be eternal, and when
for many ages they had bin brought up in a Religion so own'd
by God, and were so harden'd in that Religion by all their
Teachers, 'twas no wonder they rejected the Apostles preaching
out of conscience of their own Religion, <hi>Paul</hi> himself had don
so, and yet God gives them up to final induration for it; because
they had sufficient means of knowing Christ was sent by God to
reform their Religion, for <hi>have they not heard?</hi> Rom. 10. 18. Thy
diligence therefore shall alleviate the fault, and where it is us'd
in a good measure, probably will not suffer the conscience to
be long positive and peremtory in a mistake, but at the most
will let it only be a doubting conscience, which how far 'tis an
evil eie, and how we are to guide our selves out of that darkness
it do's lead into, we must now shew.</p>
                  <p>A doubting conscience may be either in things of very little
moment, and also where there is very little light to guide it, and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40114:152"/>
then we only call it scrupulous; or else in things of consequence,
and of these we now treat; and the Position is, that he that acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to a doubting conscience sins, and this evil eie leads into
utter darkness. The Aphorism is a certain reveled pronunc't truth,
<hi>he that doubteth is damn'd if he eat,</hi> Rom. 14. 23. However sacred the
tribunal of conscience can be thought to be, it must not stand in
competition with the Throne of Almighty God, and oblige us to
do that which the Divine Command has interdicted, or to leave
that undon, the doing of which he has expresly charg'd upon us.
It was thought to be a tyrannous hardship which the <hi>Egyptian</hi> task-masters
put upon the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that they should be beaten because
they made not brick, when they had no straw to make it with: but
it would seem a more tyrannous cruelty, to punish them if they
made, and also to punish if they did not make it. But so it is;
he who chuses to do that which his conscience suggests he ought
to avoid as being ill, and resolves to omit that which he judges
or believes he ought to do as being good, has all the inordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mind that constitutes the most flagrant guilt; he pursues
evil, and turns away from good apprehended to be such, and so
has that depravation of mind that constitutes a Devil. But on the
other side, our opinions cannot alter the real natures of things,
nor will my belief that my act is laudable make it to be so, any
more than my fancy that Poisons are wholsome food, will free
them from their noxious venim, and render them restoratives and
cordials. In like manner, my adventuring on an action which
I think is bad, upon the cold reserve of a possibility, that it may
be otherwise, involves the desperate resolution of doing it how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever;
which differs very little from doing it, tho I know it to
be certainly unlawful. But a doubting conscience admits of a
counterpoise from a contrary doubt, and there is fear of sin, as
on the one, so also on the other part. I am uncertain whether
I may not do ill in acting, and yet whether I may not do worse in
forbearing: or thus, I am not sure that what I enterprize is lawful,
but yet I have no ground to believe it is unlawful. Now from this
exigent thus declared I might deduce resolutions in many cases
of our life. As</p>
                  <p>1. When there is no ground to build a certain judgment on of
either side, but it is only probable the thing is not sin, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
I cannot be sure it is not, yet if upon that probability I act,
this is clear different from the state of the doubting conscience:
for tho I may have some doubt 'tis possible the thing may not be
good, yet having honestly examined it, I have no reason to think
it not good, and I am sure of my own heart, that if I thought
it were so, I would not do it; here is no chusing of a sin, not with
the least degree of inclination. 'Tis this secures the Physitian,
who cannot possibly be assur'd there may not something lurk in
his Patient's body, (for whose dark and unwholsome closets he
hath no prospective,) to which the physic he prescribes may be
pernicious; yet because God hath revel'd no certain grounds for
guidance in this case, therefore he upon diligent search and
grounds of art, which are the best God hath allow'd us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40114:153"/>
what he really believes will do him good, satisfies a
good conscience. Upon the same account the Pilot satisfies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
where he adventures his ship and fraight upon shelfs and
shallows: and the Captain, when he leads his men upon he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non's
mouth, and other desperat attemts of war.</p>
                  <p>Shall I make more familiar instances to you: some have doubted
whether celebrating Christ's Nativity be not will-worship, because
'tis not commanded in Scripture; other have doubted of the use of
Garments prescribed Ministers from the same ground, and from
their being significant. Now as to these, not to shew the unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of these doubts, tho I could easily do it: for in God's name
why is it to set apart a day to thank God for the Redemtion of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
will-worship, and yet to set apart a day for the deliverance
of a Nation from a temporal plague not will-worship? Is the
fifth of November in the Scripture any more than the twenty fifth
of December? Or is it the infinitely greater mercy of Christ's Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
that makes it more unlawful than the Gunpowder-Treason
day, and therefore 'tis not lawful because 'tis more fit? And for
the Garments of the Clergy, I would they were all significant,
but that that is an argument against them in these daies. It is
true Scripture prescribes them not, and by that rule they should
wear none, for it prescribes none: but pray tell me, will not any
of these doubting men seek a Pulpit to preach in, or now a daies
a bason to baptize with, never looking whether they have a warrant
in Scripture to command it? Just so, rational and sensible men
select a particular habit for a Priest, whereby his words and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
may be receiv'd with greater respect and authority, and
this without any written precept: for as where Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
it renders every thing necessary; so where it is silent, it
renders nothing unlawful in such circumstantials.</p>
                  <p>So a prescribed way of Praier is boggled at, and why that more
unlawful than a limited way of praising God? They had effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of those in the first times, why do not we as well pretend to
the one as to the other? Or why should it be less faulty to have set
forms of singing Psalms than have set forms of Liturgy, in which
too people might communicate, as they do also join in praises?
or indeed would that Rhyme and tune become unlawful, should
the Magistrate command them too?</p>
                  <p>But passing over this, and to speak in short of the whole matter. If
the man that doubts, bids his conscience stand aside, and because of
legal penalties muffles himself, and resolvedly goes on, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his speculative irresolution, with desperat boldness judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it better to trust God with his soul, than the Law with his estate
or liberty: if he fears to consider or enquire, least he should get con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
that suits not with his interest, and thinks it easier to doubt
than to be certain, because he's certainly determin'd to do what is
enjoin'd, tho it be never so unlawful. This is a profligate state
of mind, that wants nothing but occasion to engage upon the
greatest villanies, and close with Apostacy it self, when recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by impunity. But if this doubting makes another scheme
of reasoning, and performs what is enjoind, because the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate's
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40114:153"/>
command is certain, but its unlawfulness is only dubious,
and the safest course is ever the most innocent, because it is
the most prudent; then the obligation to suspend the going on
to act in case of doubting, is superseded by another obligation,
actually to obey the undoubted injunction of Superiors, and the
good Subject will not fail to be a good Christian too.</p>
                  <p>But alas! why should I busy my self in picking cases which
here, I hope, are not useful, when as upon this very Proposition
we are now upon, other things do apply themselves to most mens
hearts of a more strong concern, and of more daily practice.
If an action otherwise lawful will make up an indictment to our
condemnation, if don with a doubting conscience; what guilt
and damnation is there in those actions that are don against present
full perswasion of conscience. Truly, my Brethren, I have no ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
for sins don against knowledg, that being the worst that
can be said of sin; and I shall only add, that they who so defie their
conscience, are in the ready way to have no conscience, the sad
estate of whom my last did display to you; and in short, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if God's Vicegerent do depart, when he is so affronted. There
is a great and sad example of this procedure Rom. 1. 18, 19, 20. <hi>For
the wrath of God is reveled from heaven against all ungodliness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness. Because that
which may be known of God, is manifest in them, for God hath shewed it
unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his
eternal power and God-head, so that they are without excuse.</hi> There
is no plea for such, because they did not use their knowledg to his
service, but sin'd against it, and by their deeds of darkness put out
that light, which was vouchsafed them by God, yea indeed did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
those deeds of darkness in the face of light.</p>
                  <p>I have to what I have already said, one word to add for the
scrupulous conscience. Scruples are little suspicions in things of
small concern or indifferency, and where there is but little ground;
for otherwise they swell into that we call doubts, and which deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
a doubting conscience. Now scruples, which are small par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of dust, do indeed cast dust into the eies, which dim the sight,
and make the eies to roule, and fret, and grieve; and so do these
the mind: they disturb duty wonderfully, by taking up the heart,
and making it restless and unquiet, and so quite discompos'd for
duty; for the heart is still call'd aside, &amp; wandring about that which
troubles it. And indeed these quite take off the edge of the mind;
for while scruples arise, I am unsatisfied in every thing I do, and
then with what heart can I do them? I am in fear of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
and such a fear exceedingly damps love, and quashes
all endeavors. I have no cheerfulness in my actions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
never can be eager and forward, but cold and slack;
for these do still put demurs, and nothing but discomfort dwells
upon my spirit.</p>
                  <p>A dark and ill state this, and therefore 'tis no wonder if the
Spirit of darkness sheds it, especially where he cannot draw in the
soul to works of darkness; if he cannot quench the heats of their
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40114:154"/>
devotion, then he will strive to cool them by these arts, which
like little dashings of water thrown into the fire, if they cannot
put it out, yet at least they darken the flame, and change that
which was pure and clear into thick fume and smother: so do
these raise smoak and cloud in the soul. If the Devil cannot
betray the heart to downright vice, but his suggestions are shut
out, and temtations scorn'd, or at least avoided; then he will
trouble them in their duties, he will suggest things that under
the vizor of nicer and stricter Religious shall be let in, and
when they are in, shall put the soul in little combustions, and
disturb all its performances. Therefore these are to be combated
with, and the heart to be fortified against them; as soon as ever
we find these little spies and incendiaries of Satan stirring in the
mind, let us strait seize them, and examin what they do there,
what account they can give of themselves. Have they any ground
or plea? when a thought checks me with a sudden motion of
heart, least what I do may be amiss, I will question instantly,
hath God said so any where, is there any Law that forbids it?
If I cannot resolve my self, I will call in counsel; (for if I be
not ashamed to whisper the unhandsomnesses of nature to a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
to betray uncomely infirmities, shall the chearful quiet of
my Soul, and the comfortable progress of my Religion be less
considerable to me?) and if by these means I cannot find God
hath forbid it any way, either directly or by consequence, why
then shall I do Satan's work for him, help him to disquiet my
own heart, make the semblance of Religion hinder my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and with a pudder about duty keep my self from doing
duty, much more of which I might perform with less trouble, than
I do think of these things, and with infinitely more comfort?
No sure, I will make no sins to my self that God hath not made,
but in God's name with an upright heart set about my known
duty, in full assurance of faith. But</p>
                  <p>Secondly it will become us, whosoever is at any time troubled
with these, to consider with our selves, when we find scruples arise
about things of very small concern, to examin, am I thus wary
and thus nice in every peice of known duty, have I as sharp checks
there, and is my conscience as stirring in every circumstance of
sure Religion; if a true object of charity pass by me, or I hear
of such an one, whose real wants seem to call upon me for Christ's
sake, and I instead of satisfying his needs, satisfy only the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of my own thoughts by some little excuse, I have not
about me, or let others give that are more able, or why should
I give to every one that asks me? In this case now is my heart rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and scrupulous, least the real wants of the poor soul should
make an alms duty, unsatisfied till I either know that, or till
I do releive him?</p>
                  <p>If when Praiers call, and at the same time either a trifle or
something, which I had time enough before to prevent, and
knew well enough the fit times of doing one and t'other, yet
seek to detain me; have I scruples here, and are they strong
enough to throw aside the less concerns, and will not let my
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40114:154"/>
heart rest till it brings me honestly and zealously to my devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
If some little slight injury, or it may be inadvertency of
another fret my mind, and begin to swell me into a passion, or
thicken into a grudg, and I am in present heat of words, and
remember him with a slight or a less esteem; do scruples rise as
fast as these heats, and my heart become more troubled at it
self, than at the little conceiv'd injury, and never well at ease,
till I am calm to him? If it be not thus, but we who strain at
gnats and swallow camels, we whose eies boggle at motes in the
Sun, can wink, or suffer beams to hood-wink them; we that scruple
at things indifferent, things of which we have no rule to judge
them sins, and are not nice at all in things of certain duty, have
no such scrupulous conscience in known faults, or at least in much
more concerning matters, we may do well to consider, whether
our nicest carefulness in these do not betray, that in such little
things the main of our Religion lies, our hearts lay their greatest
stress upon these. There are certain formalities of Religion,
things that speak people Professors, distinctive characters of a Party
professing Godliness, little things by which they are discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
as niceties in habits, or gestures, or modes, or tones of
speaking, or forms of doing things in Religion, or some strict
forbearances of things that all the world beside themselves never
imagin'd hurt in. Now they that do make such to be the stamp
and signature of a Professor, it is no wonder if they be nice and
scrupulous in them; and truly to be scrupulous, especially in such
indifferencies, do's dangerously look towards that: 'tis certain,
where the greatest care and watchfulness is laid, there will the most
and greatest scruples be apt to stir; so that if these be most in such
indifferencies, either the heart hath entertain'd some end besides
Religion, the seeming strict or a Professor; or else the heart hath
bin betraied, and by being bred up to strict cares, especially in
such things, it hath let it self be besotted by those strict and
handsom appearances, and low spirited as it is, hath rais'd no
higher, but set up his cheif rest there; they think if they do
these things, they are religious. There cannot be any other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
given of these different strictnesses, this scrupulosity in little
things, and negligence in greater interests; and therefore 'tis
worth the search in every heart, in which examination whosoever
shall find his scruples to be universal, and proportion'd to the
duty, his heart watchful, especially where the concern is greatest,
and there most careful where it most behoves him; let that heart
take comfort, that quality is but the nicety, the quickness of a
clear, pure eie, that can endure no dust, no soil upon it, and such
an eie shall lead a person thro the paths of God's word, which is
<hi>a light to the feet, and a light unto the paths</hi> here to the Land of
everlasting light and glory, where in God's light he shall see light
for evermore.</p>

THE LIGHT OF THE BODY
is the Eye.</head>
                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>Matt. 6. 22, 23.</bibl>
                     <q>The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thy eye be single,
thy whole body shall be full of light.</q>
                     <q>But if thine eye be evill, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.
If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is
that darkness?</q>

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a treasure hid
in a field,</hi> Matth. 13. 44. a field this much richer
than it shews for, that provides for several uses
of our life, that furnisheth with food and wealth
too, and is both granary and treasury; and just
such is the word of the Kingdom also, it hath in
it more than it promises to sight, there are still
hidden treasures besides the food that grows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eies: if we search, we shall find still more and more furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for life, more wealth yet in the bowels of it. These words
give us experience of this, from which tho we have had several spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
entertainments, provisions for divers cases of our life, yet
have we not exhausted them; for we shall find that yet in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
sense <hi>The light of the body is the eie,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To the two interpretations, I have given of these words, the
first of which that by a single eie should be meant a single in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
an intire, honest meaning, an heart like that of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
plain, simple, and upright, such as may therefore stile a man <hi>an
Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile,</hi> no doubling, but such
an one as laies alwaies to it self good ends, and intends to take in
no ill means to compass them, hath bin generally adhered to by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all Expositors. The second, that by the single eie should be
meant the pure, clear, good conscience, which to me indeed
seems much more proper than the other; to neither of them have
I any objection but this, that they do not at all relate to the matter
of the discourse, which our Savior hath in hand, and 'tis not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
why Christ should in the midst of a Paragraph concerning
mortifying the desire and love of wealth, the beginning of which
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:40114:155"/>
commands <hi>laying up treasure in heaven,</hi> and the end tells us we
<hi>cannot serve God and Mammon,</hi> should interpose any thing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
or intentions: and therefore, tho what we have delivered
of them be exactly consonant to the words, and built upon other
certain Scripture, and be the sense of most men, yet we will view
one other, which tho it be assign'd but by one Expositor, that I
know of, yet being exactly pertinent to the matter in hand, and
having a surer plea for its being the sense of the place, than any of
the rest have, it shall not escape us, tho no more have lighted upon
it. Now the way of finding out the meaning was, not to consider
what may be compar'd to a single eie or an evil eie, for possibly so
many things may be; but by seeing what those words do constantly
signify in Scripture, and so what light and darkness also do, and
then put them together, and see whether they will so here: and we
shall take those grounds.</p>
                  <p>1. Then what a single eie and evil eie do use to signify in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
and for the evil eie, we find it often Prov. 23. 6, 7. <hi>Eat thou
not the bread of him that hath an evil eie, neither desire thou his dainty
meats; for as he thinketh in his heart so is he; eat and drink, saith he
to thee, but his heart is not with thee:</hi> which means, eat not the
meat of him that is a niggard, who tho he do invite thee to it, yet
he do's grudge it thee, and grieves thou eatest it; his heart do's not
speak in his invitations, but he had rather thou wouldest spare, and
he computes thy morsels. So again Prov. 28. 22. <hi>He that hasteth to
be rich, hath an evil eie,</hi> that is, is covetous; he envies every other
man's prosperity, (so most Translations render it here) is troubled
to see another flourish, and thinks their gain his loss. So Matt. 20. 15.
<hi>Is thine eie evil, because I am good?</hi> he saies to them, who tho they
had contracted for a penny by the day for labor, yet when they saw
those that had wrought but a little part receive so much, strait en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
desires and hopes of more than they had bargain'd for, and
when they saw they should have nothing but their due, they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur'd;
to whom the Master do's reply, <hi>Friend, I do thee no wrong,
didst thou not agree with me for a penny,</hi> be thou content with that
which comes to thy share? This man that came last to work (it
being not his fault that he came no sooner, but his not being sooner
call'd, and he having labored honestly and cheerfully ever since he
came) shall by me, who accept the will for the deed, be rewarded
with the same reward that thou hast; and sure thou hast no reason
to complain, that I dispose of my own as I see cause: what reason
is there that my bounty to others should be matter of envy and
discontent to thee? So that an evil eie signifies unsatisfiedness with
ones own condition, and envy at anothers, an eie that grieves to
see any thing go besides it self; in one word, an illiberal, covetous,
envious mind. You have its perfect character Ecclesiasticus 14.
from v. 3. to 10. <hi>Riches are not comely for a niggard, and what should an
envious man do with mony? He that gathereth by defrauding his own
soul, gathereth for others, that shall spend his goods riotously: he that is
evil to himself, to whom will he be good? he shall not take pleasure in
his goods. There is none worse than he that envieth himself, and if
he doth good, he doth it unwillingly. The envious man hath a wicked
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:40114:156"/>
eie, he turneth away his face, and despiseth men; a covetous man's
eie is not satisfied with his portion, and the iniquity of the wicked dries
up his soul: a wicked eie envieth his bread, and he is a niggard at
his table.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next for the single eie, that certainly is set as opposite to the
evil eie, as meaning liberality and chearful bounty, and we shall
see accordingly that singleness do's signify; for so our Bible almost
alwaies translates the word: 2 Cor. 8. 2. <hi>Their deep poverty abounded
unto the riches of their liberality,</hi> the riches of their singleness it is in
the Original. So chap. 9. 11. <hi>being enriched in every thing to all boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulness,</hi>
to all singleness; again v. 13. <hi>liberal distribution,</hi> singleness
of distribution the Greek do's say; and so in many places which
others have observ'd; and Rom. 12. 8. <hi>He that giveth, let him do it
with simplicity</hi> or singleness, for 'tis the same word still, and there
our Margent tells you, that it means liberality. Single therefore
do's in Scripture signify bountiful, and we shall find that coupled
with the eie, Prov. 22. 9. <hi>He that hath a bountiful eie shall be blessed,
for he giveth of his bread to the poor.</hi> And so we have the Scripture
sense of these two words, the single eie do's signify a liberal mind,
and the evil eie a niggardly, uncontented, envious disposition.
And here let us stop a little, and say a word on these expressions,
why these things to the eie? is that the chief seat of those qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
is not the heart much rather? 'Tis true indeed that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
and envy shed themselves into the eie, they dwell there
in a cloud, the eie flags and is dull, and do's so certainly betray a
niggard, envious heart, that we may see it grudges spirits to its
own eies, and do's restrain that current that is to feed them with
a vigorous life: when bounty on the other side flows into the eies
in a chearful stream of spirits, that make them full and bright.
But this is not all the reason; 'tis not only the sign of these same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
that hangs out in the eie, but the lust it self do's lodge and
dwell there. S. <hi>John</hi> calls covetousness <hi>the lust of the eie,</hi> 1 John 2. 16.
and that not only because the eie of the covetous is never satisfied
with wealth, but lusts still more and more; but there is reason why
it should be the lust of the eie, for <hi>when goods increase they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
that eat them, and what good is there to the owners thereof
saving the beholding them with their eies?</hi> Ecclesiasticus 5. 11. When
plenty do's stream in upon us with a torrent, while we do lay
it by and do not use it, then it is clear, that nothing but the eie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joies
it: when we do lay it out, if we dispose it to comply with
fashions, or to serve pomp and ostentation, or to feed emulation,
because I will not be without what any other hath, or else to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sports and delights, it is clear that nothing but the eie is
treated with the expence, and with the magnificence of these; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the back nor belly hath the least relish of them, nor hath the
soul any other organ to imploy about them, but the organ of
seeing. But if thy riches be expended in great provisions for the
appetite, unless a man can stretch his belly as he do's his barns and
his demesnes, and make all bigger, enlarge his stomach as he do's
his table, pull out new sides of appetite, and multiply his hungers
as he do's his dishes; the wealthy man himself devours but little
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:40114:156"/>
more, than when he had not such abundance, only he sees more
meat, and sees more eaters of it: so that muchness of wealth, what
is beyond sufficient competency, nothing but the eie enjoies, and
it is therefore said that that lusts after it; 'tis the eie desires riches,
and with them we serve no other part.</p>
                  <p>And then, my Brethren, this expression of single eie or bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
eie do s let us see, that liberality is no great pressure to a man,
it do's require no inconveniences from him, it do's retrench from
nothing but his eie; if we can but get this to be moderate in its
objects, get but a single eie, an eie that is not covetous of every
thing it likes and that delights it, an eie that will be satisfied with
competencies, and then a man will have no other uses for much
wealth, but only those of doing good with it; for if thine eie be
not alwaies gaping after superfluities and daily novelties of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,
pursuing every thing it fancies, or any other man pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses,
and still ambitioning the heights of whatsoever it beholds
that pleases it; if he can keep it from thirsting after every thing
that feeds its own pride, or anothers envy: keep, I say, but the
eie in bounds of moderation, and there is nothing else in man, that
do's require much for its satisfaction. 'Tis nothing else but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited,
unwearied eie, that looks thro all the world for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and must have services from every part of the whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse;
the <hi>Indians</hi> must dive into the depths of the Abyss, and digg
the rocks to get a Jewel that shall dash a little light into thine
eie; the Mariner must pass throughout all the variety of climes,
must cross the frozen and the torrid Zones to pick up those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
of things that are to please thy sight, with a new garment
for thy self or for thy chamber, or rather are to make a dress,
not for thy back indeed or for thy room, but for thy eie, which
is not well, except it see fine things; that must have furniture
out of the bowels of the worms, and out of the bowels of the earth,
have gold and silver utensils, and silken ornaments, and have I
know not what: so also several nations must conspire to make
up almost any one in the whole variety of sports, which yet do
but pass by, and please the eie, and move away as quick as sight
it self. It is the eie indeed that endears every excessive sin to us.
The Scripture do's most properly express it, when it saies the <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
of the eie;</hi> for its delights, those of variety I mean, for that
too hath no other, serve nothing but the eie. So it is in the sin
of pride, and covetousness, and pleasure: it is that part spends
almost all the riots and intemperances, that drinks in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
minutely, and thirsts for all diversities, these consume.
Do but teach that to be content, and there will be enough for
charity. If God had bid us rob our bowels for to feed the hungry,
divide necessity betwixt us, and deny nature's cravings to hear
those of the poor, it had bin hard; and tho the Lord emtied
himself for us, yet sure the croaking of our emty bowels would
have sounded much like murmurings at such a precept: but when
he bids us only spare a little of the provisions of our eie, which
wants nothing at all of them, do but deny thy sight some little
portion of its excesses, and lay out some of its unnecessary objects
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:40114:157"/>
on the Poor, and I will ask no more for charity. This sure is no
hard duty. Get but a single eie, an eie that is not niggardly and
covetous, that catches at and grasps at every thing that likes it;
do but moderate its desires and lusts, and all the rest of thee, thy
back and belly will be easily contented, will spare enough for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality:
'tis nothing but an evil eie that hinders. The pinching
Miser he can deny all other appetites to gorge his eie, he crucifies
his flesh, and almost starves his body to provide for his sight; 'tis
this alone he cares for, to have wealth to behold, not use. Could
he cure this Wolf, this canine appetite in his eie, that is so greedy
to look on wealth, he might afford to give his heaps, for he do's
nothing else with them, but see them. And 'tis the very same
with them who are as covetous of pleasures for their sight, or things
to furnish out the pomps of pride or ostentation of vanity; if their
eie would abate in these, bounty would have provisions.</p>
                  <p>And sure, my Brethren, among the lovely changes that the eie
delights in, this might come in for one handsom variety, to see
such and so many souls live cheerfully thro the help of thy libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
to see thy wealth, not only feed the instruments of thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
thy Dogs, it may be, or thy Hawks, but feed poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but feed the members of thy Savior; to see when with a
great deal thou canst hardly furnish one room well, much less of it
do's furnish such poor laboring families: furniture of a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
prospect it will be at that day, I am sure, when all the
other satisfactions of thy eies are dead, or else dissolving in a floud
of fire, then to behold those works which thy estate did help thee
to perform; for they <hi>shall follow</hi> thee to Heaven, Rev. 14. 13. and
to see that Christ upon the Throne, whom in his members thou
hast oft reliev'd; an object that will comfort such a single eie with
everlasting light. And so I pass to the second terms to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
Light and Darkness.</p>
                  <p>1. Light in Scripture do's often signify Prosperity, as Darkness
do's the contrary. I need not cite much Scripture for it, Psalm 18. 28.
<hi>For thou wilt light my canlde, the Lord my God will enlighten my dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
Job 21. 17. <hi>How often is the candle of the wicked put out, and
how oft cometh their destruction upon them? God distributeth sorrows
in his anger to them.</hi> Isaiah, <hi>c.</hi> 5. 30. do's express times of affliction
thus, <hi>and if one look unto the earth, behold darkness and distress, and
the light is darkned in the heavens thereof.</hi> So chap. 8. 22. <hi>Behold
trouble, and darkness, and dimness of anguish.</hi> Now if it mean thus
here, then the sense is, a single eie fills the body full of light; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
makes a man prosperous in all his actions; but <hi>if the eie be evil,
the body shall be full of darkness,</hi> he that either to furnish coffers,
pride, or pleasures, or excesses do's retrench from bounty, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he advance these for a while, yet before long God will cut off
the opportunities of these; he that will not put a good portion of
what he hath to good uses, the time will come, when either he or
his, however well provided for, shall not have for their own uses:
if their eie be so evil as not to let their candle shed a light to any
other but themselves, God will put out their canlde, and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness
shall bring adversity upon them or upon their families;
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:40114:157"/>
and if the verse mean thus, then it agrees with Solomon's Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism
Prov. 11. 24. <hi>There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; there
is that withholdeth more than is meet, and it tendeth to penury.</hi> But
to this I have spoke already; now I shall only say, this is a doctrine
that we need not only trust on Christ for the truth of, a very Turk
believes it, and not the Gospel only, but the Alcoran affirms it:
saying, that which they lay out of their wealth in the way of God, in
pious charitable uses, is like a grain that brings forth seven stalks.
Blessed harvest of Charity, increase more than an hundred fold! and
I will add but one place of Scripture to it, which saies over the Text
in larger and more glorious words Isaiah, 58. 7, 8, 10, 11. <hi>To deal thy
bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out
to thy house, when thou seest the naked that thou cover him, and
that thou hide not thy self from thine own flesh; then shall thy light
break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of the Lord
shall be thy reward: and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and
satisfy the afflicted soul, then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy
darkness be as the noon-day: and the Lord shall guide thee continually,
and satisfy thy soul in droughts, and make fat thy bones, and thou
shalt be like a water'd garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters
fail not.</hi> The expressions seem to grow upon the Prophet, first he
saies, <hi>Thy light shall break forth as the morning,</hi> by little slow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of increasing light, which peeps out first in a dawn, and
so grows into day; and so shall thy prosperity, which dawns and
brightens by degrees, as thou drawest out reliefs: but he corrects
these words, and thinks this is not blessing quick enough for this
vertue, whose return shall be more eminent, conspicuous, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
<hi>thy light,</hi> saies he, <hi>shall rise in obscurity,</hi> shall have no
creeping twilight for to usher it, but they very night shall break into
Sun-shine, and in the midst of hopeless affliction the face of joy
and gladness shall rise upon thee. Yea more as if the rising light
were but weak, and too faint for his meaning, <hi>Thy darkness shall be
as the noon-day,</hi> strong and hot brightness shall break in upon thy
occasions of sadness, which shall both cherish and enlighten thee,
thaw every thing that did sit cold about thine heart, and make all
pleasant shine about thee. But where, I pray you, are the Luminaries
that are to shed this Noon? The Prophet hath them here, <hi>thy Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness,</hi>
that is in Scripture dialect thy Alms, <hi>shall go before thee, and
the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward:</hi> Light express'd not only
in terms of overflowing blessedness, but terms of guard and
strength; Light he shall have here that shall be glory to him,
and shall be fortification to him; <hi>the glory of the Lord shall be
his reward,</hi> as if the charitable man did also dwell in Light that
were inaccessible, who is so guarded as to have righteousness in
his van for his avantguard, and the glory of the Lord of hosts and
victories for his rere-defence; which means in plain words this,
that the Lord will make the righteousness of such a man appear,
and will do good and glorious things for him in this life. And then
let others please themselves to have their wealth break out in
shining pomps of bravery about them, or flow in streams of plenty
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:40114:158"/>
and of delicacy, or of pleasure; alas the spring of these will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fail. If any scorching weather come, any fiery trial, any perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
yea any daies of adversity, the wealth will go out that is to
furnish them; or if there do not come such daies, yet the too full
streams will drain the fountain, and there will be no spring to
feed the current; yea or however in a while these streams must
grow unpleasant, and they will choak the soul that swims in
them: but the charitable man, the man that deals his bread, and
draws out his soul to the hungry in relief, while he hath the means,
and in compassion and assistance while he hath not, whatever fail,
the fountain of the glory of the Lord cannot be exhausted, he will
have righteousness and glory still about him; the comfortable
streams of which are of another relish than those carnal worldly
delights which wealth provides, or else can give; of a more bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
goust, the inextinguishable shine of which is surely far more
cherishing and gladsom, than the gauds of vanity or fading
pleasures. The brightness of God's glory cannot die, cannot be
taken from thee, it is its own defence and shine: for righteousness
shall go before thee, and the glory of the Lord shall be thy rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and then 'tis clearly prov'd, that such a single Eie shall make
<hi>the body full of light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Light do's signify holiness of life, deeds truly Christian; <hi>walk
as Lights in the Lord,</hi> nothing more common in Scripture: and
Darkness signifies a sinful and un-Christian life, a life that's full of
deeds of darkness. And then the words mean thus; as the eie is the
candle of the body, lightens and directs it well if it be as it ought,
but otherwise very ill, and the man is in the dark, if his eie be ill,
and do not serve him: so is the heart of man, as to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and direction of his actions; if his eie be single, if he have an
heart taken off from the world, a liberal, bountiful mind, not
set upon the love and desire of the things of this world, his whole
body will be full of light, his whole life will be very Christian,
all his actions holy and heavenly, and to the making of them so,
liberality of mind hath a very observable influence. It will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
a man wonderfully to pious courses, it is a leading vertue,
as the eie is a leading part. But if the eie be evil, but if the heart
be worldly set upon wealth, either for it self, or for those heights
or fine things, or pleasures which wealth do's procure; if it be unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in these things for it self, or envious at others for them, the
whole body will be full of darkness, the whole life will be very un-Christian;
such a disposition of mind as that, quite draws a man off
from the temper that Christ requires: the unsatisfied, the envious,
and the covetous person can never serve God, but only Sin, those
dispositions being the root of all evil. Now <hi>if the light that is in thee
be darkness,</hi> if thy heart be un-Christian, and if thy leading vertue,
that was to take thee off from all worldly inclinations, be extinct
and dark in thee, <hi>how great is that darkness?</hi> what an un-Christian
life will there be, and whatever light do's shine about thee of the
Gospel, whatever light thou dost pretend of knowledg, or of
whatsoever else, there is a deep darkness dwells upon thy heart,
and is in all thy actions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:40114:158"/>
Now this sense we see connects what went before and that which
follows after, drives on our Savior's design that he is pressing here,
and to this sense Scripture alwaies speaks in the expressions of single
and of evil eie, of light and darkness; and therefore this was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the sense that was intended by our Savior, and to the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
of it I shall shew,</p>
                  <p>1. That to have a generous, liberal mind, an heart taken off
from the self uses and advantages of wealth, is the great means,
the great engine and instrument of making all the actions very
Christian, the life holy.</p>
                  <p>2. This grace in the heart, bounty of mind, is a great evidence
of a true Christian heart.</p>
                  <p>3. A worldly heart, loving and desiring wealth, troubled at its
condition, envying others that are in better, and for the ends of
any advantages to it self, straitning its liberality, is not only in it
self an un-Christian temper, but such as is the root and cause of a
life wholly un-Christian and unholy. Of these in their order.</p>
                  <p>1. To have a liberal mind &amp;c. That the throwing of this earth
out of the heart is a most hopeful way of making the man clean
and pure, we have most pregnant Scripture, Luke 11. 39, 40, 41.
<hi>Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter,
but your inward part in full of ravening and wickedness. Ye fools, did
not be that made that which is without, make that which is within also?
But rather give alms of such things as you have, and behold, all
things are clean unto you:</hi> which bears this sene, ye hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<hi>Pharisees</hi> wash yor selve as if a man should wash his vessels,
the outside of them only, leaving the insides of them full of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
for thus do ye wash your bodies, leaving your souls full of all
uncleaness. This is an extreme folly; for it your outward washings
were in obedience to God, you would cleanse the insides, your
hearts and souls, as well as your bodies. The best way of purifying
your selves, your estates, your meats and drinks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from all pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
cleaving to them, is by works of mercy and liberal alms
gifts, and not by washing pots and vessels. Thy broken meats,
thy scraps, thy charities shall cleanse thy platters more than wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them shall do, alms shall make all things clean. But how this?
To cleanse hath two aspects, either on the guilt of past actions, or
on the habits and dispositions to future commissions; and is to
cleanse us from the evil that we have don, or to make us clean from
those vices that were in us, and which would make us do more evil:
the first of these is don by Repentance, not by Alms. Indeed the
Wise man saies, <hi>the alms of a man is as a signet with the Lord, and he
will keep the good deeds of a man as the apple of an eie, and give
repentance to his sons and daughters,</hi> Ecclesiasticus 17. 22. the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest
way of purchase for a family in the world. The give to children
an estate perchance is but to give an instrument of vice, bestow the
means of sining on them; at best 'tis but to leave them pomp
and superfluity; but to give Repenetance to them is to give security
of everlasting blessedness, this is as it were to entail Heaven on
ones children. But this is not the thing we mean, we are to see how
Alms should make us clean from vice. It is observ'd by a Reverend
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:40114:159"/>
Expositor, that our Savior speaking <hi>Syriack,</hi> useth a word for alms,
which in that language and <hi>Arabick</hi> signifies cleansing; that is, give
Alms, which as it comes from a word that signifies to cleanse, so all
shall be clean to you: and they give this reason of the notion, they
derive Alams from a word that signifies to cleanse, <hi>quod opes ab inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namento,
&amp; animum ab avaritiae sordibus purgat,</hi> because</p>
                  <p>1. Alms purgeth our wealth from the pollution and filthiness
that adheres to it. As among the <hi>Jews</hi> it was not lawful for any
man to use the increase of his own land or cattle, to eat part of his
own harvest, nor feed on his own vineyard, or imploy the profits
of any one beast of his own herd or flock, till he had given up to
God the first-born of that beast, offered the first fruits every year of
his fruit-yards, and dedicated a first sheaf of his harvest: this must
sanctify all the rest, which till then was unclean, not to be used by
him; to this, it seems, our Savior do's look in his direction. There
is an unclean tacke in every thing that comes from earth, it do's
derive a soil and tincture thence, and tasts of the palce from
whence it came, there is a kind of unsanctifiedness in wealth,
which must be purg'd away. Our Savior do's imply this, when he
saies, <hi>all things shall be clean to thee,</hi> intimating, that without some
such course be taken <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> all our possessions are unclean to us; and
S. <hi>Paul</hi> saies expresly of meat, it must be sanctified. Now saies he,
the way to cleanse thy meats (and so for all thy wealth) is to give
up part of thy meat to God by the now Christian way of sacrificing.
Alms: this the truest way of blessing a meal, by engaging God a
guest to it, who brings his blessings alwaies with him, and he hath
still a share in that meal that the poor partake in. This course is of
so great importance to be taken in every sort of our wealth, that
holy <hi>Job</hi> presses an imprecation on himself, if he have not don so,
Job 31. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23. <hi>If I have withheld the poor from their
desire, or have caused the eies of the widow to fail, or have eaten my
morsel my self alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; for
from my youth he was brought up with me as with a father, and I have
guided her from my mother's womb: if I have seen any perish for
want of clothing, or any poor without covering; if his loins have not
blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep, then
let my arm from my shoulder-blade, and mine arm be broken from
the bone; for destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason
of his highness I could not endure.</hi> So that Alms makes <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
all our possessions, all our moderate enjoiments clean, if sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
them to our use.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, which is mre to our design, their second reason
is, <hi>animum ab avaritiae sordibus purgat,</hi> it do's draw off the heart
from worldly mindedness, and by that means from all unclean
carnalities: but to not mistake me, Brethren, that a few, tho per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
noble acts of charity will necessarily take a man off from all
vice; he may perchance be willing in some good humor to part
with some wealth, that will not part with a lust or an ill custome,
and his profuse and inconsiderate bounty may come in amongst his
prodigalities, and be his vice, so far it will be from lceasing him
from vice. But the thing is this, he that hath thus far conquer'd
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:40114:159"/>
his heart, and unwrapt is out of the intanglements of riches, that
he is perfectly dispos'd in mind, not once, but by a constant course
to dedicate a good portion of what he hath for those compassionate
uses, and is very well pleas'd to look upon such a share as not his
own, but set aside and consecrated: 'tis certain that if this be
hearty, he that can resolve to part with such a part of income
for those uses, must also resolve to part with all worldly or carnal
advantages of that income, such things as it procur'd him, and he
cannot have without it. If I will cut off so much from my estate
on that good consideration, then I must cut off such degrees of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity,
I must abate such and such pomps and vanities, I must
retrench excesses, and I must part with heights of pleasures, for
these are virtually resolv'd in the other; I cannot have these if I
give away the foment, the thing that is to feed and preserve them,
these therefore I dispos'd of with that part of my revenue, nor
shall I think them fit to vie with those necessities, that beg or
Christ his sake, nay with those wants of Christ himself that begs in
those poor mens request and needs, nor shall I for such things
draw back or grudg my charities. I can much easier want some
portions of those contents, than see so many souls want neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries;
compassion strikes me deeper than those satisfactions, and
finds me much more pliant, and more sensible. Lo here a man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
brought within the mediocrities of vertue, there too where
vertue finds the greatest oppositions of temtation; those of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,
and pride, and pleasure, in all these he is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and calm, merely by vertue of his bountiful-mindedness:
and if he be not so, 'tis certain that the person is not free-hearted,
unless it be unto his sins or the companions of them. For if he
love his pride, and heights, and honors, and all those pomps
that are to serve them and his emulations; or love the superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of riots, or love immoderate delights, 'tis certain he loves
wealth implicity, altho he take no notice of it, and he is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
in his heart, tho he do's not discover it; because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but desire passionately that which is to furnish his eager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and love immoderately that without which he knows, if
he consider what he do's, he cannot have that whicih he loves
immoderately; and if he do resolve to serve those still, and yet
do give away, 'tis out of inconsiderateness, not from bounty;
he is not liberal but rash and careless, will not weigh how the
wealth serves the other ends, but still resolving upon thees, not
minding what he do's, disposeth of the other. No he tha is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compassionate and liberal, resolves to deprive himself of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to relieve others wants, that is to say, if he consider what
he do's, (and if he do not, 'tis not liberality of heart) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
himself some of the advantages of his estate, (for to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
those and his estate are all the same) pomps, profits,
and pleasures to sustain those that need: and he that do's so, he
hath plainly brought himself into the bounds of all vertues, and
for the rest that concern men, 'tis sure he that is so fully dispos'd
in heart, as to deny himself his own advantages merely to do
good to others, cannot be inclin'd to do ill to others for his own
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:40114:160"/>
advantage, these inclinations cannot dwell together; so that in
one word, this bounty of heart ingages into all Morality, he will
be humble, sober, contented in himself, and live righteously and
justly with other men. 'Tis such a leading quality, that merely
by vertue of that disposition of mind, when it is seated there in
earnest, the other parts of that which we call honesty, come in.
And then for all Religion and Piety, if he that out of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to God and compassion to the afflicted have brought his
heart to such a pass, that he can draw out his soul to the needy,
'tis certain that in doing so he <hi>laies up treasures in heaven,</hi> v. 20.
and by the verse that follows he that laies his treasure there,
he sets his heart there also; and he whose heart is set on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
I shall not fear to pronounce of him, his actions will drive
him thitherwards with all religious violence. Do but think with
your selves how you pursue the things you hearts are set upon
in earnest, what out-goings of soul you have to this rencounter
of the object of its strong affections, no rest but in the labors
that work towards it, no calm but in those violences. And much
of this there must be in Religion, where the heart is set upon the
hopes of it, on heaven. He must be eager in it, as the covetous is on
his gains, the proud man on his pomps, the pleasurist on his sports,
the Epicure on his excesses. It is not possible a man should have
no heart to that on which his heart is set. He therefore that hath
set his heart on heaven, must be religious and holy; and so it is
concluded that the liberal-minded must needs be so. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of which proof is this, he whose heart is in heaven, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
will be there, his life will be Christian and holy: he
whose treasure is in heaven, his heart is in heaven: he that hath
taken off his heart from the world, and out of liberality of heart
gives alms, he laies his treasure up in heaven, and then it is
concluded that he is religious.</p>
                  <p>And this now may apply it self without my help to press it to
you. Ah my Brethren chuse and strive towards a vertue that will
help you to all the rest, that will calm and moderate your affections
to this world and the dying follies of it; and that will draw your
hearts to heaven, and set them on the world to come. Who
would not labor for one disposition of mind that comes with such
a train of pieties, that hath all Christianity in its attendance,
and brings all into the soul with it? Who would not give alms,
if by doing so he give himself a shole of vertue? to whom is this
man bountiful, but to himself indeed? Here is a ground for
men to beg after the fashion of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> Be good to your self,
Sir, and bestow an alms upon me: for he indeed is good unto
himself, who what he gives laies up in heaven as a treasure for
eternity, and at the same time entertains the disposition to all
piety in his heart, receives all vertue into him. I sahll not need
to call in accessory proofs, fetch in auxiliary motives, tell you
that works of charity are called <hi>good works</hi> in Scripture, and the
liberal man <hi>good.</hi> So Rom. 5. 7. the <hi>good man</hi> signifies, and Tit. 2. 5.
where the women are commanded to be <hi>good,</hi> it is merciful; so
works of mercy are call'd <hi>good works,</hi> Acts. 9. 36. <hi>doing good,</hi>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:40114:160"/>
Matt. 12. 12. Heb. 13. 16. <hi>good fruits</hi> James 3. 17. So to <hi>work good</hi>
signifies Gal. 6. 9. and <hi>every good work</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 8. is works of
mercy, as if he did engross all goodness, and that same vertue did
fulfil the title. Nay I tell you more, that the <hi>merciful man</hi> and the
<hi>perfect man</hi> are but two words for the same person, Matt. 5. 48.
Luke 6. 36. all Christianity is so sure appendant to this disposition
of the heart, (when it is in the soul I tell you, not when it is now
and then in the actions) that this alone is perfectness, 'tis <hi>entire
lacking nothing.</hi> And then here is a clear account, why at the last
great trial nothing should come upon account but charity, that is
the only thing the Judg takes cognizance of at the day of final
doom; <hi>When I was hungry, ye gave me meat:</hi> the words of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Judgment pass only in relation to this, nothing but cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
do's come into that sentence, for all the rest is implied in
this: and where the heart is liberal, the whole life will be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
this is an evidence will pass at God's Assise, stand before the
Searcher of the heart and reins. And therefore it may well be a
sign to us, and make proof, that this grace in the heart, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of mind is a great evidence of a truly Christian heart: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Proposition.</p>
                  <p>Blessed Savior, thou that wert all bounty to us, that didst emty
thy self to enrich us, and didst chuse rather to die thy self than not
relieve us when we were sick to everlasting death; give us grace to
be like-minded, shed into our hearts this disposition of soul, that
will make us so remember thee, a disposition that will make our
affections even and moderate to things of this earth, which by
teaching us to part with wealth contentedly, will work us out
of the world, and teach us not to be enamoured on the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of wealth, not to be passionate for pomps or pleasures, or
for any superfluities which wealth procures, which will set our
hearts in heaven, and lay up treasures for us there; which if it
rob us of the pomps and the magnificences of this world, will
give us for them pomps of piety, the whole train of vertues, a
long attendance of graces; if it deprives us of some heights or
some excess of pleasures, it will recompence with the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of relieving Christ in his members here, and reigning with
him hereafter in Kingdom:</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>HILOSOPHY do's say that all vertues are so
annext and tied together, that it is not possible
for any man to have any one truly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
but he must needs have all; they are like
pearls upon the necklace, from which if any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
pull one, the string is broke, and all are
shatter'd and disorder'd. And S. <hi>James</hi> saith,
c. 2. 10. <hi>Whosoever shall offend in one point, is guilty of all;</hi> and
sure the vertue of the Text makes good both these Positions: if
liberality of heart be that one point, he that excludes it from his
Soul, shuts out the rest at once. All the graces are as train to that
leading vertue, are its such close attendants, that they must needs
have the same fate, and either dwell together in the heart, or
all together be thrust thence: for, <hi>if thine eie be single, thy
whole body shall be full of light; but if thine eie be evil, thy whole
body shall be full of darkness.</hi> An envious discontent, uncharitable
mind, makes the whole life un-Christian, and he that do's offend
in that one point, must needs be guilty of all; and if Charity,
that <hi>bond of perfectness</hi> in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that tie of graces that do's
unite them to it self, and with each other, if that be there, all
graces must be there, and liberality of heart makes the life Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
for <hi>if thine eie be single, thy whole body shall be full of
light.</hi> But</p>
                  <p>I am now to shew you that bounty in the heart is a great Sign
of a true Christian heart, that that person who not out of easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or modesty of constitution not knowing how to deny when
he is askt, nor out of inconsideration or vanity bestows an alms,
or else when importunities do's beg it; but he who out of real
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:40114:161"/>
compassion to the wants of others, and hearty sense of their
calamities, and out of sincere obedience to God resolves with
himself to deny himself such and such advantages of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to such a good proportion of what God hath bestow'd upon
him, purposes in his heart to set aside such a portion from his
own uses, knowing and considering that by so doing he do's part
with such and such satisfactions which did accrue to him by that
wealth, yet will do it for the relief of others necessities, that their
souls may be comforted, and they may praise God in his behalf.
This person hath in himself a great evidence of an heart truly and
sincerely wrought upon by the Gospel, and wrought over into the
realities of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>I shall prove this to you, and tho I know there be many vertues
which seem to have no connexion with liberality, and many incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
in the heart which bounty hath no direct influence upon,
several evil tendencies of soul which it hath no formal opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to, that it should thrust them out of the heart; yet that
such a complexion of mind doe's either directly or by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
so oppose them, as not to endure them in the heart, I
shall very briefly shew you in gross, and by retail.</p>
                  <p>And first that in gross that is a sign of a true Christian heart,
see Col. 3. 12. <hi>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved,
bowels of mercies, kindness;</hi> it seems that bowels of compassion and
bounty is a sign of being such full Christians, that the Apostle
takes in all words to compleat the Character, and do's it in words
of a beloved sense: and let men take them in what sense they
please, they do my work, whether as persons chosen out before
all time; it seems then to be liberal is a sign of that, and they
will have very little reason to conclude themselves elected an
eternity before they were, who now they are, and are call'd and
taught by God, do not find this disposition in their hearts: or
to take them in their naked meaning, be liberal, as being God's
choice and pretious ones, (so it signifies, <hi>elect, pretious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 6,
and in other Scripture <hi>elect</hi> is the choicest, best,) such as are
priz'd and valued by God: <hi>as the elect of God, holy,</hi> such as have
his sanctifying Spirit poured out upon them; and such are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
by him; as choice and pretious things are alwaies dear to
us. Now then to be compassionate and bountiful is to be as thus,
and liberality of heart is one mark of Election and Holiness, and
they that have it, are as God's choice, sanctified, dear ones.
<hi>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
compassion</hi> and bounty.</p>
                  <p>2. As it is a sign of our being the Elect of God, and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Holy Spirit, so it is also a sign of our being like
minded with Christ. S. <hi>Paul</hi> do's urge his example as a motive
to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> liberality, Ep. 2. c. 8. v. 9. <hi>For ye know the grace</hi>
(or charity) <hi>of our Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich, yet for your
sakes became poor, that ye thro his poverty might be rich:</hi> and
therefore for us to do so is to follow his example, and to have
our hearts set to it is to be <hi>like minded,</hi> and truly that is to be
Christian enough. If that a person of the God-head <hi>emtied bim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:40114:162"/>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Phil. 2. 7. exhausted himself of Divinity to relieve
us; if the God of all the pleasures of the earth and the joies of
heaven became the Man of sorrows to rescue us, if that the Lord
of everlasting blessedness made himself Prince of sufferings and
calamities to ransom us, if this be a temtation to the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our heart to set us upon going to do likewise in some
low weak mesure after the rates of our abilities; then to do so
considerately, to deprive my self of some advantages, to exhaust
somewhat for the sakes of those that want, is to have the <hi>like
mind in us that was in Christ Jesus our Lord:</hi> but because this may
possibly evince us to be like-minded only in one thing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
                  <p>3. In particular, he that is thus minded hath a great evidence
of his having overcome the World, a wide and a vast conquest;
for, my Brethren, 'tis not only he that is a slave to mony, whose
heart and actions do importunately pursue the waies of getting
or of hoarding that, whom the world overcomes; but he is a slave
to the world, whose mind is impotently set upon any of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of this world, the man whose heart do's in too great a
proportion either of time or whatsoever else pursue any thing
which this World is to furnish with, that man's heart is entangled
in the pursuit, and it is fetter'd to the World, which is his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and pretence for that too eager inclination. And therefore
in our Baptism when we renounce the World, we do not only
bid defiance to the love of mony, but we renounce the Pomps
and vanities of this wicked World; whatsoever either too great
pleasure or height, excess or ostentation, or pride that this World
ministers unto. Now then, when a man do's not only now and
then give little to them that ask and beg of him, (for so it go's
away in such small instances, as will not evidence either much
consideration of it, or any great work wrought upon him as to
not loving of the World,) but in devout retirements resolves to
deny himself in such a proportion, and cut off such a part, 'tis
certain he do's cut off such degrees either of pomp or vanity, or
plenties, or whatsoever other thing that part of his estate did
serve. Now he that can do this resolvedly in his soul, not out
of any heat, but from deliberate purpose of heart, 'tis certain
he hath to so great a degree disentangled himself from the snares
of the pleasures or other advantages of this World, he hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loosed
their fascinations, and weakned all their sorceries; 'tis clear
he hath so far withdrawn his heart from the degrees of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he did love that this World serv'd him in, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
none of them shall engage him to their superfluities: for
to prevent that he cuts off their foment, the streams of those
contents, they shall not overflow his soul; for he will turn the
spring, and make the current run another way. 'Tis evident he
hath so torn all beloved earthly satisfactions from the embraces
of his heart, as that he will not feed them, not with his own
estate, if he cannot also to a vertuous degree feed the poor: he
hath so far turn'd out the love of pleasures, or of pomps, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
as that he willingly do's part with those degrees of them,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:40114:162"/>
cannot be retain'd together with his liberality. And such a
heart sure is without the vicious degree of worldly contents: for
vicious inclinations to them use to pursue them as far as they are
able, and set no bounds to themselves but those of possibility,
will not be limited in their prosecutions by considerations of a
vertue as this man's are, and therefore he is too strong for these
temtations, and so hath overcome the world.</p>
                  <p>And now if we consider the advantages of this conquest ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in gross, it is a victory over such Enemies as were in Christ's
opinion almost invincible, such as did so block up all passages
and avenues to blessedness, that he affirms and repetes <hi>it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Let
men think what they will of those occasions of sin, which their
dislikes of a low condition or of poverty makes them believe it
do's abound with; but I tell you there are such ineluctable temta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to vice in an estate of plenty, as that without a greater
measure of God's grace than is sufficient for any other state of
life, a man will never overcome them. It is so insuperable a
temtation to have that which will furnish him with all his heart
or lust can wish for, to have every thing that is in his desires
put into his power, and so impossible to part with that which
serves all his inclinations when God calls for it, as he do's when
we cannot at once keep the estate and obey Christ, (which was
the occasion of our Savior's words:) and wealth it do's so sawce
and invite every vice, it do's so dress objects for lust, and feed
with those full plenties, that heat men into it and strengthen for it,
do's so pour in provocatives by idleness and excesses, it do's so fill
with insolence, or pride, or ostentation and vain glory; it do's
so swell and so puff up with heights and scorns, makes men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
others and oppress them, think any thing almost is lawful
in their usage of them; yea become careless of Religion, and by
degrees contemn it too, wax insolent with God, scoffers at piety,
rude in profaness, any thing forsooth they may do; and a whole
shole of other such like qualities are the almost certain appendages
of men in estate, at least in some degree. In a word, it takes off
the heart quite from the Love of God and those things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to him, it fixes them so to these worldly satisfactions: yea
when it comes to such a pinch, that a man must either wound his
conscience, do some great deliberate sin, or part with this so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
happy utensil, his estate; break with all the duty in the
world rather than part with that which furnisheth him with such
convenience of sins, that 'tis no wonder if it be impossible for a
rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And then for a man to have overcome the General of this
great Army of ruinous vices, the only leader that can draw
them up against him, to have cut off the source that feeds this
inundation of mischeifs, these overflowings of ungodliness from
the heart, is a good strong evidence to a man's heart, that he
is well resolv'd against the vices, when that he do's resolvedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
himself of the instrument of them, the thing that do's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
them, and hath perfectly divorc'd from them: he needs
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:40114:163"/>
not doubt but that if it please God to bring him to straits, that
he shall rather be content to part with a good portion of his estate,
than part with a good conscience, who is content to give away
good part of his estate merely to exercise a vertue in obedience
to God. He will give it if Christ call for it, who gives it if the poor
call for it. He is well secur'd from feeding pride, excesses, and
the other sins of fulness with his plenty, who gives all superfluities
away to feed the hungry, his wealth is otherwise emploied than in
ministring to vice: and however 'tis certain his heart is taken off
from the sins that are occasioned by riches, who heartily gives
away the occasion of those sins; and tho the gate of Heaven be
as strait as any needle's eie, yet this wealthy Man, this Camel in
one sense of the word as it do's signify a cable rope, when his
wealth is divided thus and scattered, when the rope is separated
into little threads, then it will go thro the straitest needle's eie,
and this rich man enter inter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And here were argument enough for the triumphs of comfort to
an heart that can discern this sign of his Election, this fruit of
the Holy Spirit, this instance of <hi>like-mindedness</hi> to Christ, this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of his conquest over that same Enemy, which is the Fleshes
auxiliary, and the Devil's instrument, without which neither of
them could much prevail upon us; for they do it by the aids
the World do's bring, by the temtations and the baits which it
do's minister. A consequent fit for Christ to glory in, <hi>I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the World,</hi> saith he, Matt. 16. 33. and truly if any man, the
religiously sincerely bountiful man hath don so to a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
He hath unglued his heart from it, they part with ease;
you see how he distributes it, and throws it from him: and this
is sure incouragement enough to set you upon searching whether
you can find this Evidence within you, if it were not a certain
sign also of more things, a sign of particular evidences and effects
of having overcome the world.</p>
                  <p>For first, it is a sign of a perfect contentedness in ones condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for apparently he is not unsatisfied with what he hath, who
not only is content, but who contrives to have less, and gives
away good part of what he hath. He cannot be discontented that
he hath no more than he hath, who is resolved not to have so
much, but searches for occasions to distribute what he hath. And
if this be an infallible sign of a contented mind, (still I speak
of the liberal heart, not only of a scattering hand,) it is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the greatest happiness in this world; for God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
one certain remedy for all the evils in the world, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
heart. This is the only aim of all the arts and all the
plenties of the world, it is for this alone men dig the mines of
treasures, search the whole circuit of delights, run thro the hurry
of an universe of pleasures, wherein, God knows, they seldom
find it, but all intend only content. Whether they would be
great or rich, or be luxurious, or every thing, it is because they
seek content in these things; which he that hath in whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
state he be, he hath the scope, the price of all the treasures
in the world, he hath the sum and comprehension of its felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:40114:163"/>
which therefore the liberal heart hath the sure sign of: yea
in this he hath the certain evidence of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> temper that he
so much exults in, Phil. 4. 11, 12, 13. <hi>I have learned in whatsoever
state I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased,
and I know how to abound; every where, and in all things I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer
need. I can do all things thro Christ which strengtheneth me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly he hath an evidence, that he is freed from envy, and
those black disturbing passions that attend it. For certainly he
do's not envy other mens greater condition, who willingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minisheth
his own. I am not troubled others coffers are more
full than mine, when out of choice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>emty mine, and rather chuse to
lay up my revenues in the bowels of the poor. I do not envy their
richer furniture, when I give mine away to furnish needy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring
families, and change the clothings of my roomes into
the clothing of the cold bare Christians; and I can much more
calmly see my chambers naked, than Christ's members. I have
no emulations at the full plenties of other mens provisions; for
why should I, when I send away my own provisions to chear the
hungry, to make the hearts of famishing souls rejoice? If I have
not so many plenties in my dining Room, yet I make more
feasts in the cottages, where every alms is a feast. 'Tis certain he
that will not use what he hath to his own interests and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
but gives them to advantage others, cannot envy the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of others: so that he is free from envy, that rottenness
of the bones, that consumtion of the soul and body too, that
which makes every other man's prosperity his own torment, and
tho he have a kind of malice wheresoere he sees any thing of
flourish or of excellency, yet by all those malices he only strives
to vex himself; from this the liberal heart is clear.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly from Covetousness also, and all the griping and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
passions that are in its train: for it is certain he cannot
be inclin'd to do ill to others for his own advantage, who out
of choice parts with his own advantages, that he may do good
to others. And indeed I need not prove this; for that a man
should be bountiful-hearted and covetous-minded is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
So that we see the man hath a certain Evidence of being
of a contented spirit, and being free from envy and from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,
which to be free from will appear to be the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
of a Christian, when you shall see that those three qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of discontent and envy and of covetousness are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of all the most un-Christian vices of the soul; which was
the last Proposition from the later part of the words, <hi>For if thine
eie be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.</hi> That, as I prov'd,
do's signify, if thy heart be discontented and unsatisfied in its
own condition, apt to envy another's prosperity, and covetous
of greater things than it possesses, the whole life will be full of
most un-Christian actions; they will betray the man, and fill him
full of all inquity. A subject this of a most vast extent, and truly
worth considering and staying on: but I shall only point at things,
and shew you how they are so in a word; for I will dwell no
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40114:164"/>
longer on this Theme. First then discontent in ones condition
is the Mother of many provocations of God: for</p>
                  <p>1. It seems with many murmurs and rebellions of heart against
the dispositions of God's Providence. You must not think, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
that a discontented Soul is only unwise, tho truly so he
be to great degrees. He whom a tempest storms in open field,
on whom the rain beats and the wind, is sure a fool if he sit
down and cry at it, and vex. What relief is it to him to vie
shours of tears with those the clouds drop, to return the blasts of
wind with sighs and murmurs, and storm at the tempest? Sure
there is no one so unwise, but would make hast and seek for shelter
rather, and not sit down to fret and weep at it. And yet that
is the fashion of the discontented heart; if the least cross be upon
their mind, their sad and troubled thoughts make it look very
big, (as thick and misty air do's make all objects,) they fancy
it insufferable, they look upon it as if God's <hi>indignation did lie
hard upon them, and he had vexed them with all his storms:</hi> and in
these storms why do they not flie to God for shelter, nor run
under the shadow of his wings for refuge, but vex and cry at
it, yea murmur and repine? And what an insolence is this to
be angry at the Almighty, because he do's not govern the world
as they would have him; to quarrel, because his Providence
disposeth of events otherwise than they think is for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests?
Some are discontented when God takes from them any
thing they did possess. Now since neither health, nor wealth,
nor any other good is thine or from thy self, but only lent,
vouchsafed during his pleasure and discretion, and whatsoever
he takes from thee is only thy not enjoying any longer what is
no way due to thee, when he in his wisdom and in his love also
to discipline thee calls for what he lent thee. Is this occasion
for a contest with the Lord? Must he lend thee his mercies,
when his wisdom sees fit to do otherwise in order to the ends of
Providence? What irreligious Rebellion is this, to have risings
of heart against God's dispositions, to fall out with their Maker,
if he will not lend them his mercies as long, and in as great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
as they would have him? Others are discontented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are not in a better, higher, or more plentiful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
and why do they not as well quarrel with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he did not make them Angels; for what they are is his
mere gift, and more than their deservings? He was no more
oblig'd to make thee what thou art, than he was bound to make
thee a Cherubim or an Archangel: and must thou murmur at
the Lord, because thou hast not the disposal of his gifts to lay
them out in what degrees thou pleasest? It is the sin of both
these discontents, that they do not submit their hearts cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to God's disposals. They that do not so, S. <hi>Peter</hi> saies, are
proud, and such as God resists and fights against. And surely then
the discontented is a strange person that is proud towards God,
and an unhappy person whom God resists and fights against.</p>
                  <p>2. He renounces his own Praiers; he begs of God, <hi>thy will be
don,</hi> and yet do's murmur that it is so: and what a strange Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:40114:164"/>
is this, who repines if he be heard, and is vext that God
do's grant his Praiers, is angry with the Lord because he do's what
he desires? And then shall such a person ever hope that God
should hear his Praiers at any time, who is displeas'd because the
Lord do's not deny him?</p>
                  <p>3. All concupiscences are the effect of this; for because they
are not satisfied with their own condition, they desire what is
not their own: and so the breach of the tenth Commandment
is the certain consequent of this disposition of mind, or indeed
rather it is but several instances of forbidding discontentedness
with our own condition; and in it, <hi>Thou shalt not covet thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor's
wife,</hi> is not meant, thou shalt not desire to commit <hi>adultery</hi>
with her; for that was forbidden in the seventh Commandment:
but as thou shalt not covet his house, which do's not signify thou
shalt not desire once to walk thro it, or to sit and dine in it,
but thou shalt not desire the possession nor propriety of what is
not thine own, shalt not desire it should be thy house, but be
contented with thy lot; so here, thou shalt not be troubled that
his wife or servant is not thy wife or servant, and think it as fit
thy Neighbor should enjoy the comforts of a happy wife, if God
have given him one, or the pleasures and splendors of an estate,
or the advantages of a commodious servant, as thou dost think
it fit thou shouldest enjoy what is thine; and not desire not
only to be theif, but not the owner of them: be content with
what is thine.</p>
                  <p>4. All the Seditions and Rebellions in the world, and those
armies of Sins that attend them, that wage their wars, which
are upheld by legions of villanies, as numerous as those of men,
all the disturbances of States and Churches are but the effects of
discontented spirits, men that were unsatisfied with their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
desir'd a change, and car'd not by what means they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past
it. They can charge thro seas of bloud and sin, over the
faces of men and conscience to get out of the condition, which
they are not well content with.</p>
                  <p>I could assign more sins that do attend a discontented heart,
when it hath opportunity to break into them: all the effects of
anger, and of malice, and of concupiscence, and a whole shole of
others are in its train, but that I must reserve one word for Envy.</p>
                  <p>2. Envy, to say all in one word, however slight a thing we
may esteem it. For to envy at another person's having better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
or greater dignities, or richer furnitures, or wider estates,
or handsomer provisions, this we think do's no mischief to the
persons, and therefore is no crying crime. Yet besides that it is
more unjust than hatred or than malice, for these have still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
that do look like reason. I cannot hate a man, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he do's me some wrong, and that is some reason; for I hate
his injustice: but envy hath not any least pretence. Is it a wrong
to me, because that person is better qualified, or better endowed?
Is he unjust because he is rich, or learned, or well provided?
and yet for this I envy him. Besides this, I say, to stab it with
one thrust, Envy hath all the vices and all the ruins in the world
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:40114:165"/>
for its issue, all sin and all damnation is its brood. The Devil
envied man's felicity, and therefore temted him, and so man lost
Original Righteousness, and he lost Paradise; and he envies his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
by Christ, and therefore temts him still until he ruin him
eternally. Whatever guilt, and whatever misery is in the world,
hence it springs, it is a feind-like devilish humor. And now would
you take the prospect of these two qualities, discontent and envy.
Lucifer was not satisfied with his condition, and he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cast from Heaven, and all his fellow Angels became Devils;
and then he envied man's condition, and chang'd his Paradise
into everlasting misery. These two qualities rob'd Heaven it self
of those inhabitants that should have fill'd it, and the Son of God
himself, and peopled Hell; it made Angels become Feinds, it made
God die, and made men damn'd, and there is enough for that.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Covetousness, I am sure I can say no more of that, than
what S.</hi> Paul <hi>hath said, nor more to my purpose, 1. Tim. 6. 6, 7,
8,</hi> 9, 10. Godliness with contentment is great gain; for we brought
nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out,
and having food and raiment let us be therewith content. But they
that will be rich, fall into a temtation and a snare, and into many
foolish and hurtfull lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for the love of mony is the root of all evil, which while some
coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
thro with many sorrows.</p>
                  <p>And oh that three such dismal qualities with their accursed
trains should breed in that same little part, the eie! An <hi>evil eie</hi>
is the womb wherein they are conceiv'd, and if that one small
faculty be so fruitful in guilt and in destructions, how shall we
reckon the whole man? <hi>Miserable men that we are, who shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us from</hi> a whole <hi>body of death,</hi> and from the state of those
deaths, and from darkness, in which this <hi>evil eie</hi> engages us? A
darkness which our Savior could not otherwise express, but by
astonishment, <hi>How great is that darkness!</hi> A darkness great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
because 'tis wilfully incurable, no state do's so withstand
the light as this. The Sun of Righteousness, the Day-spring from
on high, that came to visit us, could strike the light thro darkness,
and make the <hi>shadow of death</hi> bright Luke 1. 79. that did shed
<hi>light,</hi> that was <hi>a glory,</hi> Luke 2. 32. could not yet break in upon
a Country clouded with this humor: his Miracles and he were
both desired to withdraw, could have no least Reception, when
interest and profit came to be toucht; and a Legion of Devils,
that did plot together, could contrive no surer means to keep
out Christ himself, than by setting up an <hi>evil eie</hi> to look upon
him and his Miracles, than by engaging this greedy affection
against him, and that but in a small instance. We read a strange
story Matt. 8. 28. Marke the contrivance and the policy; the
Devils knowing that Christ would cast them out of the two pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
men, and by that Miracle so far show forth his power, that
it would probably bring all the Country to believe on him, they
desir'd to prevent this, and thereupon fall on this project, which
might incense the men of that Country against him; and in order
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:40114:165"/>
to it they besought Christ, that if he did cast them out, he would
suffer them to go into the herd of Swine; and tho he seldom
wrought any destructive Miracles, yet that the people might see
the virulency of these Devils, how destructive they were, if not
restrain'd by his omnipotent goodness, and so they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the mercy don to those that were possessed, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
see the mercy now approching to their Country by the coming
of Christ, if they will accept of it, and withal to try whether
their love to their Swine was greater than that to their own souls,
he permitted the Devils to go into the Swine, he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
them, and they went into them. They who fed the Swine
gave to the owners notice of their loss, and did let them know,
as the Swine were drowned on the one side, so two men possessed
with Devils were recovered, and that Christ had don this since
his coming thither. Hereupon the whole City, as being very much
concern'd in that which had happen'd, came out to meet and
see Jesus, who did such Miracles; and instead of being wrought
on by his cure on the men to desire his continuance among them,
the consideration of the loss of their Swine made them desire and
beseech him that he would depart out of their Coasts. Behold
an equal Enemy to Christ and all his Miracles, an Enemy that
was too hard for them, even a little worldly advantage! The
Senate of Hell hath no project like this to keep out Religion, as
this making Religion thwart an interest; rather no Christianity,
than abate gain or greatness, or any earthly satisfaction; rather
the Swine, than Christ himself.</p>
                  <p>But we have a worse instance yet than this, and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
as to our purpose. An <hi>evil eie</hi> could not endure to
see the Son of God alive, and when the second Person of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
was to be betraied and crucified, the Devil had no other
passion to employ on that design, but these same, discontent
and envy and a greedy mind, and all these but at little trifles.
We find that <hi>Judas</hi> bore the purse, and S. <hi>John</hi> saies that he <hi>robb'd it,</hi>
John 12. 6. was deceitful in the discharge of his office of relieving
the poor. Now it happen'd that a woman spent a box of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ointment upon Christ, at which <hi>Judas</hi> was discontent, and
envied it his Master, Matt. 16. 8. Mark 14. 4, 5. he <hi>murmur'd,</hi> and
had <hi>indignation at it,</hi> saies the places; his <hi>evil eie</hi> could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to see such a sum should pass his purse, (of which yet he
could have purloin'd but very little, for the sum was not great)
and missing that, for very envy (for it was immediatly upon it
Mark 14. 10.) his own covetous heart by the Devil's suggestion
put him upon his project of gain to make some advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by delivering Christ to the hands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and upon
his consenting to this suggestion the Devil was permitted by God
to have this power over him, <hi>to enter into him,</hi> John 13. 2. and
doing so incited him to make a bargain with the Rulers of the
<hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> their great Council, and with their Officers to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
up Jesus unto them; and he yielding to his incitation, and
after Christ's talking with him, and telling him distinctly of it,
and the sin and danger attending it, Mark 14. 21. and his not
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:40114:166"/>
yet relenting, the Devil entred into him again more forcibly
than before, John 13. 27. hurried him to the speedy execution:
and he went and <hi>covenanted with them that he should have thirty
shekels,</hi> Matt. 26. 15. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Luke 22. 6. and thanked them,
altho it were a low and a vile sum, as could be the price of a
slave, Exod. 21. 32. yet <hi>Judas</hi> thankt them for the offer, so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
he was and glad of an occasion to get mony. We see
the Devil enters at an evil eie, if that be envious, Satan gets in
strait at that eie himself in person, and he possesses hearts set
upon gain: and then no wonder if the Kingdom of darkness be
in such an heart, when as the King of Hell, the Devil dwells
there. Satan entred into him, and when he was there, what
design hath he to fill an heart with? nothing but that of getting
mony, this is effect enough of his possession. The Devil hath
don work enough in such a heart as he is entred into really, if
he but make it set upon desire of mony, tho it be but a trifle of
gain, but three pounds fifteen shillings. But, Lord God, what will
not a worldly heart adventure on; what will not a mind undertake,
which envies at another, and is greedy for it self? When such an
one did set <hi>Judas</hi> upon betraying Christ for almost nothing: one
vanity, one sport, one dress, one sin's engagement to damnation
costs a man more, than what an envious covetous Soul did sell
the Son of God, the Ransom of Mankind, the price of all the
Souls in the whole world for, yea and was thankful for it too:
so low, so fordid, and so base a soul it is that loves increase.</p>
                  <p>And now, my Brethren, there is no need that I should tell
you, that you must bring no <hi>evil eie</hi> to the Lord's Table to see
his body crucified, and his bloud poured out in the Sacrament;
no discontents, no murmurs, no envious intentions, nor cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
desires must come near that, for they were these betraied
him. If such a soul come thither, <hi>Judas</hi> is there again; the things
that sold him come again to tear his body, and to shed his bloud.
And do you think that such shall be receiv'd and entertain'd by
Christ? Oh no, the bread of the Sacrament will be their Sop; and
not Christ, but the Devil enters into such. Oh sure no heart so
fit to come to that same feast as the charitable; those that feed
him, he will feed: and I could tell you, charity (the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertory
I mean, an offering for the poor) was used as an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
part of the Sacrament, and was a service of so high esteem,
that preparation was requir'd for it as for the Sacrament; and
by the first Councils men guilty of gross sins might not offer,
their charities would not be receiv'd by the Church. Yea and
there was an excommunication from this duty, and to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from bringing their gifts for the poor was a greater cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
than to be shut out from the Sermon or the Praiers. But
these are things our world do's not take notice of, nor will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand;
to be censur'd from liberality, and to be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
from bounty, and that receiving of mens alms should be
a grace and an indulgence to the givers, are talks that men now
have no notions of, nor much care for. But let them be sure no
time so proper for our relieving the members of Christ, as when
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:40114:166"/>
the body of Christ is relieving us to life eternal; no occasion
more urgent for us to contribute towards the clothing of the naked
body of Christ, than when Christ is clothing us with the crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
glorious garment of his Righteousness; no opportunity more
pressing than this to visit his sick members, than when he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring
to us <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: nothing do's preach Charity like
a Sacrament, nor no Sacrament more than this at the time of
his Incarnation, when the Son of God did so exhaust himself for
us, as to emty immensity of God-head into a span of weak, poor,
helpless flesh, to become really one of the meanest objects of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
one that had no revenue in the world but Charity; for
while he liv'd he had not an hole to put his head in, nor when
he died a grave to put his body in, but as thro all his life his
sustenance was alms, so at his death his burying place was alms
too, and yet this was the Heir of both the worlds. And this he
did to settle us in an inheritance of infinite, eternal glory; and
the approching day began this state to him, a day sure to be
reckon'd not with the riots, but with the charities of hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
with feasts not for our sins, but feasts for Christ, and for
his members; feasts such as his own Table is fit to be the leading
entertainment in.</p>
                  <p>O Lord, who hast taught us, that all our doings without Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are nothing worth; send thy Holy Ghost, and pour into our
hearts that most excellent gift of Charity, the very bond of peace
and of all vertues, without which whosoever liveth is counted
dead before thee: grant this for thine onely Son Jesus Christ's
sake. <hi>Amen</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O great a flatterer is Man of himself, that from all
kind of Events, how various soever, he will adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to conclude himself in the right way to <hi>Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
and rather than want Argument, contradictions
shall conspire to make him happy. If he prosper,
then <hi>God allows his doings;</hi> and the success of actions
is his <hi>mark</hi> and <hi>Seal,</hi> that they are acceptable and
dear to Him: And if this Argument be good, The
<hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Benjamin while it conquer'd</hi> (as they did <hi>Conquer</hi> those that
fought <hi>Gods Battels;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judges xx. 18, 21, 23, 25.</note> and that by his immediate <hi>commission:</hi>) yet
all that while, those <hi>Sodomites</hi> and <hi>foul Adulterers,</hi> the men of <hi>Gibeah</hi>
were <hi>Saints;</hi> But when calamity does take away this Argument, then
on the other side the <hi>Gibbet;</hi> though the punishment of <hi>Villany,</hi> is only
execution of that Decree,<note place="margin">Rom. viii.</note> whereby <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>predestinated</hi> them, <hi>To be
conform'd to the Image of his Son.</hi> As if they died most like Christ, who
died with the most <hi>Guilt</hi> about them, and they will needs be <hi>Martyrs</hi>
when they suffer for their vices; and, if this Argument be good, <hi>Aegypt</hi>
was <hi>blest</hi> with all her <hi>Plagues,</hi> and the <hi>consuming fire</hi> that ran upon the
ground, was the <hi>light of God's countenance</hi> upon them. Yet both these
Arguments have been made use of lately, by each several party of us, in
the variety of Gods dispensations to us. Now this each could not do of
<hi>right.</hi> Some Parties of us made <hi>false</hi> and <hi>unjust</hi> pleas to them both.
Now to decide which did so, not <hi>à priori,</hi> from the <hi>cause;</hi> though that
alone does guild prosperity, and <hi>that alone too makes the Martyr, not the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40114:168"/>
sufferings.</hi> But men will never be agreed of that, while whatsoever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
(whether their cause prosper or be opprest) still proves them in
the <hi>right.</hi> But I shall do it from a plain <hi>notorious</hi> effect: nor do I
know what else can be more seasonable than while some men seem to stand
<hi>candidates</hi> for sufferings, and choose <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Schism,</hi> rather than lose
the reputation of not being <hi>afflicted</hi> with their Party; and while others
plead the merits of <hi>affliction,</hi> and Trumpet out their having <hi>suffered,</hi> as
a pretence for the <hi>ambition</hi> and the <hi>covetousness,</hi> the <hi>luxuries</hi> and <hi>intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi>
and all the other vices of <hi>prosperity,</hi> which their late <hi>sufferings</hi>
have before hand expiated; while it is thus on each side, to give both a
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> whereby to judg the Case, which my Text here presents; for,
<hi>He that hath suffered in the Flesh, hath ceased from Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words make a single <hi>Proposition,</hi> and therefore cannot well be
taken asunder, nor indeed need they; the Terms being very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
The Subject every one is willing to assume to himself; no one I
believe that hears me, but will say <hi>he hath suffer'd in the Flesh.</hi> Therefore
we have no more to do, but to see whether the other Term agree as
universally, which certainly it must, if our Proposition here hold good,
if <hi>He that hath suffered in the Flesh, hath ceased from Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore in order to this, I shall offer at Three things.</p>
                  <p>First; Discourse of the truth of the <hi>Proposition</hi> in General, and see
if we can discern how necessary, and how effectual this Instrument of
<hi>Reformation</hi> is, whether it be such as may build a confidence of assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
That <hi>He who hath suffered, hath ceased from Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly; Because discoursing in General, is not so <hi>practical</hi> and
<hi>useful,</hi> I shall endeavour to discover in particular, By what Artifice of
method the <hi>Flesh</hi> engageth men into courses of <hi>sin,</hi> and how it works
them up to the <hi>height</hi> of it, and then see how <hi>sufferings</hi> blast that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
and make the <hi>Arts</hi> of the <hi>flesh</hi> either unpracticable, or too
weak.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; I will attempt to view our own concerns in all this;
propose to consideration, Whether this method hath had this effect
on us; or, Whether indeed it be as easie to confute God's <hi>Word,</hi> as to
break his <hi>Commandments,</hi> and contrive that his <hi>truth</hi> shall no more
stand than his <hi>will</hi> does; but notwithstanding Scriptures bold affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
here, yet <hi>they that have suffered have not ceas'd from Sin:</hi> and
if so, then to propose the danger and infer Christ's Application that
at least we begin to cease, <hi>and sin no more least a worse thing come unto us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I. <hi>He that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from Sin: None
but He, and He certainly:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When it appear'd that <hi>Eden</hi> had too much of Garden for <hi>innocence</hi> to
dwell in, and although man were made <hi>upright,</hi> yet amidst such delights
he could not be so a whole day, but of the many <hi>inventions</hi> he found
out, the first was to <hi>destroy</hi> himself immediately, and under the shadow of
the Tree of <hi>life</hi> he wrought out <hi>death,</hi> and made the Walks of <hi>Paradise</hi>

course: He sets a guard of <hi>fire</hi> about <hi>Eden,</hi> about the place of <hi>pleasure,</hi>
as well as in the place of <hi>torments;</hi> and there was as much need of
<hi>flame</hi> to keep man out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> as <hi>flame</hi> to fright him from Hell. He
makes the Earth not spring with Garden any more, but bring forth <hi>thorns</hi>

which, if the Soul should <hi>cleave</hi> and <hi>cling</hi> unto the Earth, might gore
and stab it in the embrace; Nothing but <hi>sufferings</hi> will do us good:
The Earth was most accurst to man when it was <hi>all Paradise,</hi> nothing
but the <hi>malediction</hi> could make it safe and bless it to us; our happiness
must be <hi>inflicted, executed</hi> on us, and we must be <hi>goaded</hi> into <hi>blessedness:</hi>
and therefore God hath put <hi>afflictions</hi> into every dispensation since the

by the things that he suffered,</hi> Heb. v. <hi>v.</hi> 8. This therefore is the only and
most <hi>effectual</hi> way of teaching it, when God speaks in <hi>Judgment:</hi> and
indeed he counts all other of his Voices but as <hi>silence</hi> in comparison of
this; and though he gave his Law in <hi>Thunder,</hi> and sent his Prophets day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to denounce wrath to <hi>transgression,</hi> yet he reckons of all this as if he
had said nothing till he speak <hi>Plagues</hi> and command <hi>afflictions;</hi> Psal. l.

and <hi>Calamity.</hi> When Gods hand was not on them they ran after
other Gods, as if to be freed from Oppression had been to be set free
from Gods Worship and Service; but when he did return to <hi>slay them,</hi>
then <hi>they sought him, and they returned to enquire early after God, and
they remembred that God was their Rock, and the high God was their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.
Psal.</hi> lxxviii. 34, 35. So that from such induction the Prophet
might pronounce, that <hi>when Gods Judgments are in the Earth, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the world will learn righteousness, Esay</hi> xxvi. 9. and S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
in the Text, <hi>they that have suffered in the flesh, have ceased from sin.</hi>
Which calls me to my second Task;</p>
                  <p>2. To shew first, by what arts the flesh engages men into courses of
sin, and by what methods it does work them up to the heights of it.
That I may Secondly declare how sufferings blast those methods, and
make all the arts of flesh either unpracticable or too weak.</p>
                  <p>1. That the carnal appetite should reach after, and give up it self to
sensual delights is so far from strange, that it is its nature; 'tis the Law
of the members, the very signature of flesh, and inclination imprinted
into it, of which it can no more divest it self, than the heated Deer can
restrain it self from <hi>thirsting and panting after water-brooks:</hi> But when
Reason and Religion have set bounds to this appetite, for it to scorn
these mounds; for that <hi>Law in the members</hi> to fight with and prevail
against the <hi>Law in the mind,</hi> those original dictates born in it, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Principles infused into it, this is the Fleshes aim and sin. Now this
it does by exciting to ill actions, as being sauc'd with pleasures and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
and by indisposing to good actions, as being troublesom or not at
all delightful to the sense, and as for all other delights, it hath no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40114:169"/>
of, but indisposeth for them perfectly. So that this it does, it
engages too much in Pleasures here, and it takes off all cares or thoughts
of any joys hereafter; both these I will shew you, and thus it works;</p>
                  <p>1. It prevails with us to indulge our selves the full use of lawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and for this the Flesh will urge, it is the end of their Creation; to
do otherwise were to evacuate Gods purpose in the making; Did he give
us good things not to enjoy them?</p>
                  <p>Thus every sort of sin insinuates it self at first: Youth will not deny
it self converses with temptations, although he have reason to fear they
will commit a rape upon his warmer passions, which are chafed by such
encounters. But God has not forbid him Conversation; and why should
he be an <hi>Anchoret</hi> and recluse in the throngs of Cities and of Courts?
Another that would not by any means be luxurious or intemperate,
yet goes as near them as he can, and contrives to enjoy all those delights
that do indeed but sauce Intemperance, and make Excess palatable:
And truly why should he restrain himself from meats and drinks, and
be a <hi>Jew</hi> again? All these believe they live righteously, soberly, and
godly enough. This resolution works in every recreation, pleasure,
honour, and advantage of this World, men are content to make as near
approaches to the Sin as they can; and indeed believe they have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be morose unto themselves: I will deny my self nothing that God
hath not denied me, but enjoy as far as possibly and lawfully I may.
But then, by doing thus it</p>
                  <p>Secondly, does oft take in somewhat of the immoderate and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
which cannot be avoided, both because it is hard to set the exact
bounds and limits of what is lawful: The <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Line that meres
out Vertue from its Neighbour Vice, is not so plain in every place as to
chalk out exactly to this point thou mayst come, and no farther; hence
the man sometimes mistakes himself into a fault; however the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Lawful is, we know the confines and very edge of Vice. And
then to him that plays upon the brink of sin, it is a very easie step in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and indeed unavoidable, when a man is rusht and hurried on,
not only by his inward stings and inclinations, but by the practice of
the World, which makes use of that holy Name of Friendship, to bring
Vice into our acquaintance, and to befriend us into everlasting Death
(of such Friends I can have legions in Hell; and the God of this
World will serve me, upon this account, to procure for my Sin and my
Destruction:) but howsoever when the Appetite is heated, they are
not to be denied.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this happening therefore sometimes proves a Snare and bait
still to go on, both as it takes away the horrour and the aversation of
the sins which at the first seem uncouth, till a man be experienced in
them; and also as it smooths the way, for such beginnings do nurse up
a Habit and prepare a Custom, and make Vice very easie, which at first
it is not, while the Appetite is modest and not able to digest full Doses,
till use enlarge and stretch it.</p>
                  <p>And now the <hi>Mind,</hi> which by these means tasts diverse Pleasures,
and the Degrees of them, and finds a gust in them, yet not being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in any one (as 'tis impossible it should be) stirs up the Appetite
to vary and proceed; that that contentment which single pleasures could
not afford, diversified might make up. Wretched Nature using that as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40114:170"/>
an Attractive, which should repell; for who would hugg a Cloud? em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
that which does not, cannot satisfie? but only Flesh which for
that very reason, hunts on and follows the scent. And by doing so a
while, it brings upon it self.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Something like a necessity of doing so: Thus Continence
would be some mens Disease, and the Intemperate cannot live without
his Vice, but gapes as much as Thirst and Fever do, and if he have
not satisfaction, suffers as many qualms and pangs as his Riot used to
cause in the Apprentisage of his sin; so that there is a kind of necessity
of the practice, and he wisely seeming to make a vertue of necessity,
begins to think them the only happiness, at least of this life, freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reluctancy embracing them.</p>
                  <p>And now the Flesh is <hi>Callous,</hi> and if you doubt how it could so har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
it self, as not to be pervious to any stings of Conscience, but Proof
against all Pricks, though Experiment may persuade you; yet I will
shew you the Method.</p>
                  <p>As all Appetite you know is blind, so the Guides also of Carnal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite;
The senses are very short-sighted, they cannot look forward to
the next Life, to the hopes of Heaven, or the pains of Hell, to bring them
into the ballance with the present pleasure, and see which does over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh.
The Flesh only lives <hi>extempore,</hi> looks but upon that which is
before it, scarce on that. We have sufficient experience of this, for when
one Vice will not look forwards a year or two to the penury and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenness
some courses do pull down: And when another Vice, as if it
had learnt to fulfill our Saviours command, and <hi>take no care for the
morrow,</hi> will not think of the next mornings pains and Headach; Nay,
when the ambitious Usurper will not look just before him, to see where
he does place his steps, on Precipices and Sword-points, to note how the
Pyramids he does climb are made slippery with blood; Pyramids, did
I say? pointed Reeds rather, things that have not strength to bear, but
only sharpness to stab; and where the mans own weight makes his Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
fail and wound him both together, at once sink under him and
pierce him thorough. Nay, we see many whose sins inflict themselves,
who may be truly said to <hi>bear their Iniquities,</hi> yet chuse those sins that
bring their Plauges along with them; for we see men with most exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
difficulty practise a Vice only that they may have the Vice, swallow
sickness, drink Convulsions and dead Paralyses, foaming Epilepsies, only
that all this may be easie to them. And this is but one instance of the
many that might be made; just as the King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> that are Poison
that so he might be used to it: Strange! that a man should torture him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with all those deadly symptoms that Poison racks the body with,
only that he might eat Poison; yet just such is the Sinners Design, and
all the ease and pleasure he acquires at last in sinning, is but familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Poison, custom of Danger, and acquaintance of Ruine. Good
God! that men should train and exercise themselves so for perdition!
that they should go through a discipline of torments to get an Habit of
destroying themselves! that they should work out their own condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with hardships and agonies! that as if 'twere too easie to go down
the hill to Hell, the descent shall be made craggy, and they force breaches
into it, and great headlong Precipices to make the way more painful,
and more dangerous, to make the fall more wounding and more irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable!
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40114:170"/>
And what shall give a check where difficulty does provoke,
and torments do ingratiate.</p>
                  <p>Well: But though Flesh be so short-sighted and inconsiderate, the
mind might trash it by suggesting other sorts of punishments that do
await transgression. Why truly if rude and unmannerly Conscience do
sometimes thrust in the thoughts of Hell, the Flesh, which I told you,
is not terrified with any thing but what it feels (now Conscience pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
Hell as a thing of hereafter, not till Death be past) it satisfies Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
with a Repentance of Hereafter, <hi>before Death come I will be sorry
for my sins, and God is merciful.</hi> Conscience being thus quieted, and
both Reins and Spur given to the Flesh, it takes its full Carier, and leaves
behind all thoughts of Repentance, and indeed, of God, or Heaven;
the hope and joys of which, are the only possible method that is left
to take off the Man from his eager pursuit, or to divert him in his course.
But as to that also, that I may shew you the next heat.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mind</hi> that is immerst in body, and hath been long accustomed
to tast no pleasure but the carnal ones, its fancy fill'd with those <hi>Ideas,</hi>
it does imbibe such a tincture of sensuality, receives such an infusion of
Flesh, and so impregnated with the fumes of Carnality, which clog the
Spirit, that its complexion and temper is quite altered, it is diluted and
deprest, and so grown stupid and unactive to all higher things. Heaven
and all after-things, it may be, are the prejudice of such persons, not their
persuasions; some thin conceptions of such things have been thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, but never were improved; for their Mind hath otherwise been
employed, and they can have no appetite to them, because they have
never had any tast or relish of any thing but sensual. And indeed
that both longings after, and thoughts of a better Life should be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
dead in the carnal man, is but a natural and necessary effect of
the verge of his Delights. For what motive is there in Heaven to stir
up his appetite, to whom Heaven it self would not be a place of Joy?
For I am verily persuaded, were the Carnal man in those Eternal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
compast with streams of Glory, it were impossible for him to take
delight in them, and he would grope for Paradise in the midst of Heaven:
As much impossible as for the most unlearned Idiot to satisfie himself

<hi>shall not,</hi> but <hi>cannot enjoy the Kingdom of God:</hi> And why then should
they long after, or think of it? Nay, I would this unhappy Age, and
an unlucky <hi>axiome</hi> of <hi>Aristotles</hi> did not convince that they do think
there are no such things; <hi>Sensual pleasures, are corruptive of Principles,</hi>
saith he; and indeed where Damnation is the conclusion, 'tis a much

the Principles, than granting them, to lie under the torture of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40114:171"/>
liable to such an inference; they therefore that resolve to love this
Life and all the sinful pleasures of it, at the next step resolve there is no
other Life. And now this pamper'd and puft Flesh is got into the <hi>Psalmists</hi>
Chair,<note place="margin">Psalm i. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>the Chair of Scorners;</hi> and 'tis one of the Luxuries of their life
to scoff at them who are so foolish as to be Religious, and to deny their
flesh its present appetites and pleasures on such thin after-hopes; here
their <hi>Wit</hi> also is an <hi>Epicure,</hi> and feasts and triumphs, dictates, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
in that Chair; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in <hi>the Chair of Pestilences,</hi> as
the <hi>LXX</hi> translate, and very truly, for such men shed a Sphere of
Contagion about them, and their Discourses are <hi>effluvia</hi> of the Plague,
and the breath of Pestilence. But how to get Flesh down out of this
Chair, that's the difficulty; yet that my Text will tell us, for all this
progress of the Flesh is trasht and checkt by Sufferings, for, <hi>He that
hath suffered hath ceast from Sin.</hi> Which how, I will briefly shew.</p>
                  <p>The Fleshes first Art was by immersing it self in the full Lawful use
of Pleasures, and by consequence, in the immoderate; to prevail with
the Soul to find a gust in them, and from a continued enjoyment to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them necessary; and so from the importunities of a perpetual
temper and an accustomed satisfaction to think of nothing else in this
life. Now it is plain Affliction made this Art unpracticable, for that it
did do so, was every ones complaint; it rob'd them of the immoderate,
and even of the lawful use of Pleasures, it took off those customary
Delights by which the mind was habituated and glued to them, by not
allowing them; and made them so far from being necessary, that they
were not acquirable. Thus by denying us even the Lawful use of them,
it stabs the Flesh in its first onset: Indeed it does that for us which
every man in every state of life in his most plentiful prosperity must
sometimes do for himself; that is, Deny himself what he desires, and
might enjoy without offence: Which he that does not do, but constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gives his Appetite every sort and degree of lawful thing it asks, does
teach it to crave on, and be importunate, and insolent, and not endure
to be resisted, when it did always find him to be so obsequious to it.
If <hi>David</hi> never checkt <hi>Adonijah,</hi> did not at any time displease him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Why hast thou done so?</hi> he easily takes confidence to say <hi>I will be
King,</hi> and step into the Throne. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> i. 5, 6. But he that mortifies
sometimes, that does acquaint even his most innocent desires with a
denial, how can unlawful ones assault him? For can my Appetite hope
to betray me into superfluities, who have taught my self not to wish
for necessaries? Will he be tempted with Excesses, or hearken to the
invitations of Luxury, that will not hear his bowels when they croak
for bread? Or he gape for intemperate satisfactions, who will not let
thirst call, but shuts his mouth against it? Why should he covet more
that hath learnt to give away, and want that which he hath? Now
Sufferings inflict this temper on us, and acquaint us with the necessity
of all this, and in a while with the liking of it, teach us Content with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Lawful Delights? yea, by degrees make that content appear better
than an assured enjoyment: For were I offered the choice either of an
<hi>uninterrupted Health,</hi> or of a <hi>certain Cure</hi> in all Diseases, sure I had
rather <hi>never need a Potion</hi> than drink <hi>Antidote</hi> and <hi>Health</hi> it self. And
even so the lawful good things of this Life are at the best but <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies</hi>
and <hi>Reliefs,</hi> never good but upon supposition: Therefore
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40114:171"/>
while Affliction taught us to want, it hath destroyed this Art of the
Flesh.</p>
                  <p>As for the Second, Then the lulling asleep all sense or thoughts of
any Life hereafter, neither minding the fear of one, or hopes of the
other; Affliction surely met with this too: For Sufferings bring both
the <hi>hereafters</hi> to remembrance, the Sad one, while every Punishment was
an Essay and tast of that which is prepared for those that live after the
Flesh, and the more insupportable our <hi>Fiery Tryal</hi> was, the more it
caution'd us to beware of <hi>that Fire which is never quenched<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> And for
the other Life, surely when our Condition was such, that if we lookt
unto the Earth, behold nothing but <hi>Darkness and dimness of Anguish,
and darkness as of the shadow of Death,</hi> we could not choose but turn
away our Eyes and lift them up to Heaven. When the Soul is thrown
down by Oppression, it mounts by a resiliency, and with the force of
pressure is crush'd Upwards; or if the Load be heavy, so as to make it
grovel and lie prostrate, it is but prest into the posture of Devotion:
When she's disseised of all, turn'd out of every possession, then she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to think of an <hi>abiding City, and eternal Mansions.</hi> For the Soul
that is restless, when it sees nothing here below to stay upon, but all is
hurried from her, roams about for some hold to rest on, and being able
in that case to find nothing but God, there she does grasp and cling;
and when the storms splits all enjoyments, and devours Friends which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ke enjoyments comfortable, all perish in one wrack, then she sees she
must catch at him that sits above the Water-Floods. I told you out of
<hi>Job,</hi> Affliction did discover better than Revelation, and in the dimness
of Anguish we might see more than by Vision; and truly of two Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
which our Saviour gave to his most intimate Apostles <hi>Peter,
James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> the one of Glory on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> the other of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
in <hi>Gethsemane;</hi> shewing in the one <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Himself transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured,</hi>
a glimpse of beatifical Vision; and in the other <hi>Hell transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
and a sad Scene of all its Agonies, he thought this a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
sight, for when they fell asleep at both, at his Transfiguration,
<hi>Luke</hi> ix. 32. <hi>Peter, and they that were with him, were heavy with sleep;</hi>
yet he does not rouse them up to behold his Glory; when they did
awake, indeed they saw a glimpse of it, but <hi>straight a Cloud did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadow
it, verse</hi> 34. But at his Passion he bids them <hi>Watch with him,
Matth:</hi> xxviii. 38. and when he findeth them asleep, he says, <hi>What,
could ye not watch with me one hour? ver.</hi> 40. and bids them <hi>watch</hi> again,
<hi>ver.</hi> 41. and comes again <hi>a third time</hi> and upbraids their drowsiness,
<hi>ver.</hi> 45. So much more necessary was it to behold his <hi>Agonies,</hi> than to
see his <hi>Felicities:</hi> Glory does not discover or invite to Heaven, so much
as Sufferings drive to it; and we are more concerned to take a view of
that <hi>Garden in Gethsemane, than that of Paradise,</hi> and the going down
from the <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>Olives</hi> does more advantage us in climbing the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
hill, than all <hi>Mount Tabors</hi> height. Nor do Afflictions only drive
us toward Heaven, but they beget an <hi>hope</hi> of it. <hi>Knowing that Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
worketh Patience, Patience Experience, and Experience Hope, Rom.</hi>
v. 3. 4. And <hi>I will give them the Valley of Achor for a door of Hope,
Hos.</hi> ii. 14. As if Despair opprest them into Hope, and that low trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous
Valley opened into the highest Firmament. Now he that rides
at <hi>Anchor of this Hope,</hi> though his Anchor lie buried under Waves, yet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40114:172"/>
those rouling Hills of Sea, swell'd by storms of Affliction, and raised too
by his Tears, do without <hi>Hyperbole</hi> mount him to Heaven: He that
hath entertained these Expectations in earnest, how will he slight Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
here below? What will he not sacrifice to <hi>Christs</hi> Command?
See, <hi>Abraham</hi> that did but hope for <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that far off too, to
be possest by the Posterity of his Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> yet when God commands
him to slay <hi>Isaac</hi> before he had any posterity, and so to dash all his
own Promises, and quite cut off the very motive to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
yet he hopes and obeys even to contradiction,<note place="margin">Rom. iv. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Does both against
hope.</hi> And had we but the shadow of his hope, as he had but the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of our Promises, how would we sacrifice a sin at his Command,
and think a Fleshly lust a good exchange for the hope of Heaven, which
Tribulation worketh? and <hi>he that had suffered in the Flesh, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
cease from sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now my last work is to view our own Concern in this, and
surely that must be all Exultation and Triumph, and this not so much
that our <hi>sufferings are ceast,</hi> as that our <hi>sins</hi> are so; not that our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are sunk, but that our flesh is vanquisht, that <hi>sub hoc signo vinces</hi>
is thus also come to pass, with the Standard of the Cross, that Cross
on which our selves were Crucified, we have overcome; and with this
Christian Banner we have put to flight the Armies of our Heathen
Vices. For thus it must be, if my Text be true; and sure it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
it should be otherwise: For look upon the Muster-roll of these our
Foes which S. <hi>Paul</hi> does produce, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20, 21. and see which of
them could escape; it runs thus, <hi>Adultery, Fornication, Vncleanness, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciviousness,
Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath,
Strife, Seditions, Heresies, Envyings, Murder, Drunkenness, Revellings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To begin with the great Commanders, those that lead the Van and
bring up the Rear, <hi>Vncleanness,</hi> and <hi>Revellings;</hi> They that consider
how they not only suffered <hi>for,</hi> but <hi>by</hi> these Vices, which did mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
mens watches and attendances; sins that were not only like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chans</hi>
in our Army, and ruin'd it by bringing the accursed thing into it,
but were like <hi>Hannibal's Numidians</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, that did at
once betray to, and inflict Ruin; sins that did merit and effect Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and made as well as provok'd, overthrows; and sins that by
Gods goodness did cut off themselves, while they did bring men into
a condition that would not bear such Vices. These are the guilts of
Wealth and Splendor, that do attend Felicity and Pomp; it is not only
hopeful that men did resolve to be reveng'd on these great workers of
their mischief, and will no more reset such Traitors in their bosoms; But
sure these sins are ceast that did put out themselves.</p>
                  <p>Then for <hi>Seditions;</hi> They who consider when they broke the <hi>Scepter,</hi>
they left us nothing but the <hi>Rod of God</hi> instead of it; a Rod that turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
straight into a <hi>Serpent,</hi> that changed our <hi>Seas</hi> into <hi>Blood,</hi> or rather
made <hi>new Seas</hi> of our own <hi>blood;</hi> that brought <hi>Locusts</hi> over the Earth,
and <hi>Frogs</hi> into the <hi>Temple</hi> also, to croak there; that struck <hi>Lights</hi> here
worse than <hi>Egyptian Darkness,</hi> and <hi>destroyed all the first born</hi> of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
all the Nobles of the Land; these will easily believe that we have
selt this Rod too much to seize upon it hastily again; the <hi>Scepter</hi> is
restored, and this <hi>Rod</hi> like to that in <hi>Israel,</hi> laid up, I hope, within
the <hi>Ark</hi> together with the <hi>Tables of the Law,</hi> never to be dis joyn'd from
Gods Commands, nor taken thence against them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:40114:172"/>
Next for <hi>Heresies;</hi> Truly we have left us none to revive, or to make
new; the mischief both of them and their Cause, the want of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Church is now discerned and remedied: And for <hi>Divisions</hi>
and <hi>Schisms,</hi> they who reflect on the said issues of them, how well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
soever all their Causes were, will certainly avoid them: To see how
while we quarelled for the Fringes of Religion, we tore the seamless
Coat of Christ to pieces; yea, and the body too: How when we first
dislik'd a Liturgy, the daily Sacrifice of Prayer was made to cease, and
then the House of Prayer was demolisht; next, <hi>Christs,</hi> our <hi>Lords Prayer</hi>
was rejected, that Liturgy of his own framing, thrown away in the
Rubbish of his Temple, and then it was a sin to pray at all. His Table
we must have remov'd, and then his <hi>Supper</hi> was so too; and that great
Mystery of our Religion, the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of our Redemption, was buried
in the Ruins of his Altar. To see how thus out of heats of Religion
we destroyed all Religion, because that some adjacent Circumstances
did not please us, and fetcht a Coal from the Altar to set fire to and
burn down the Temple, because the building of some out-Court was,
we thought, irregular; is Document enough not to attempt this any
more for Religions sake: For now it would be in despite of Christ,
who hath almost verified the <hi>Jewish</hi> accusation of him, <hi>Destroy this
Temple also, and in three days he will build it up again;</hi> and hath built
it up we hope, as he did that of his own Body, never to fall again by
us: Surely we will not kill this Body of his out of Love to him, and
make his <hi>Temple</hi> his <hi>burnt Offering.</hi> When God hath set our sins in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thus before our eyes, shewed them us in their sad effects, there is
no fear that we should fall in love with them.</p>
                  <p>But where it is not thus, where Gods last and most working Method
hath been able to produce no good, I must, to keep my word,</p>
                  <p>Apply the Danger: In that case what remains but the <hi>Curse of the
ground, Heb.</hi> vi. 8. which, if after all the Husbandmans methods of Care
and Art, it brings forth only <hi>thorns</hi> and <hi>briars,</hi> it is <hi>rejected</hi> by him,
he will bestow no more labour on it, but can hardly forbear cursing such
an ill piece of ground, and <hi>its end is to be burnt:</hi> So we after Gods
Husbandry of Afflictions,<note place="margin">Psal. Cxxix. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> when the <hi>Plowers plowed upon our backs and
made long furrows,</hi> and the Iron teeth of Oppressors as it were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
us; if we bring forth only the fruits of the Flesh, we are reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
reprobated, God will bestow no more Arts on us, we are not far
from his curse, and there <hi>remains only a fearful looking for of Judgment
and fiery Indignation.</hi> If any did continue refractory to the Rod, sinn'd
under and against Judgment, and did commit with an high hand even
while the Lords hand was stretch'd out against them, what shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
what can express their guilt? To have beheld that tragical ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
we read of <hi>Lyons,</hi> where when the City was so visited with the
Pestilence that scarce any were free, that the Dead without a figure
buried their dead, falling down one upon another, each being at once
a Carcass and a grave; the Soldiers of the Cittadel would daily issue
forth and deflour Virgins now giving up the ghost, defile Matrons even
already dead, committing with the dust, warming the grave with sinful
heats, and coupling with the Plague and Death; would not this have
seemed the Landskip of Hell to us, when they suffer and sin together?
Yet when a Church and State were on their death-beds, Gods Tokens
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40114:173"/>
on them, visited with the treasures of his Plagues, and our selves sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that our Ruin, if any went a whoring after their own flesh, still
fulfilling the lusts thereof, and in the midst of Deaths searching for
sins; what was this but to do the same things whose story does af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
us, while the actions please? and in this case what method will
be useful? do we think our selves of that generous kind that will do
nothing by compulsion, but will for kindness; and though we would
not be chained, yet we will be drawn to Vertue by the cords of Love;
and now God hath shewn mercy on us, we will return him service out
of gratitude. Truly, I make no question but most of us have promised
some such things to God, how if he would but <hi>save us from our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
that we might <hi>serve him without fear,</hi> that we would do it <hi>in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and Righteousness before him:</hi> And if he would restore his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of Worship, how we would use them. Thus we did labour
to tempt God, and draw him in to have compassion; and this was
<hi>Ephraims</hi> Imagination just,<note place="margin">Jer. xxxl. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>I heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning himself,</hi> saith
the Prophet, <hi>as a Bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, turn thou me and I
shall be turned;</hi> turn my Captivity, and I will turn my life: But this
was as a Bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, that did not like the
straitness and pressure of it, and would promise any thing to get it off,
thought it more easie to reform than bear Affliction: But is this hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
think you? The Soldiers of <hi>Lyons</hi> that would ravish Death, and
break into the Grave for Lust, it may be would have been modest,
and retired from the fair Palaces that are prepared to tempt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
that Vice: Cold and insensible of all those heats that Health
and Beauty kindle; but remember it was the <hi>taking off Gods hand</hi> that
<hi>hardened</hi> Pharaohs <hi>heart,</hi> and a <hi>release from punishment</hi> was his <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for those that were humbled under the Rod, and when God
had retrench'd from their enjoyments, did put restraints upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
gave over sinning. I have a word of Caution for them, that
they examine well and take a care it be a ceasing from sin, like that
in the Text, a <hi>dying</hi> to it, that <hi>they no longer live the rest of their
time in the flesh to the lusts of men:</hi> For if this Old Man be only cold
and stiff, not mortified; by the calm and sunshine of Peace, likely to be
warm'd into a recovery; if thou owe all thy Innocence to thy Pressure,
wert only plunder'd of thy sins, and thy Vertue and Poverty hand in
hand as they were born, so they will die together, thy Vices and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
come in at once: What is this but to invite new Desolations,
which God in kindness must send to take away the opportunities and
foments of our ruining sins? 'Tis true, when God has wrought such most
astonishing miracles of mercy for us, when he did make Calamity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to our Happiness; when we were Shipwrackt to the Haven and
the Shore; when Ruins did advance us and we fell upwards; it is an
hopeful argument God would not do such mighty works on purpose to
undo them, we have good ground of confidence that he will preserve
his own mercies, and will not throw away the issues of his goodness
in which his bounty hath so great an interest and share. But yet if we
debauch Salvation, and make it serve our undoing, if we order these op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of mercy so, that they only help us to fill up the measure
of our sins, if we teach Gods long-suffering only to work out our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40114:173"/>
sufferings, these Mercies will prove very cruel to us, and far from
giving any colour for our hopes. When the Prodigal was received into
his Fathers house and arms,<note place="margin">Luke xv.</note> had a <hi>Ring</hi> put on him, and the <hi>fatted Calf</hi>
killed for him, if he should strait have invited the companions of his
former Riot to that <hi>fatted Calf,</hi> and joyn'd his <hi>Harlot</hi> to him with that
<hi>Ring,</hi> he had deserved then to be disinherited both from his Fathers house
and pitty, who would have had no farther entertainment, nor no bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
for him. To prevent such a fate, let us make no relapses, but quite
cease from sin; which if we do not, a little Logick will draw an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
inference from this Text; if <hi>he that hath suffered hath ceast from
sin,</hi> then <hi>he that hath not ceast</hi> from sinning <hi>hath not suffered,</hi> and then
what is all this that we have felt and so lain under? What is it if it be
not <hi>suffering!</hi> If this be but preparative, then what is the full Potion,
the Cup of Indignation, when all his Vials shall be poured into it? If
such have been the beginnings of sufferings, what shall the issues be?
If the morning dew of the day of punishment have been so full of
blood, what shall the Storm and Tempest be? the deluge and inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Fury? Take heed of making God relapse, 'tis in your power to
prevent it, your Reformation will be his preservative and Antidote.
That is the way to keep all whole; to settle Government and Religion
both; at once to establish the <hi>Kings Throne and Christs:</hi> For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
mens pretensions, these Thrones are not at all inconsistent:
For that there must be <hi>no King</hi> but <hi>Christ,</hi> that there cannot be a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
here of this World, because there is a Kingdom that is not of this
World is such another Argument, as that there cannot be an Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is an Heaven. Indeed if we fulfill my Text, then we shall
reconcile these Kingdoms, and bring down Heaven into us; for that's a
state where there is neither sin, nor suffering, where there shall be no
tears because no guilt to merit them, and no calamity to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ke them.
Now Reformation does work this here in some degree, and afterwards
our comforts that are checker'd with some sufferings, and our Piety
which is soiled with spots, shall change into Immortal and unsullied
Glories, he prepare us all <hi>Who washt us from our sins in his own Blood,
and by his sufferings hath made us Kings and Priests to God and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to whom be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

shewing where that general Proposition is of force, where it is not;
I shall as I proceed, view all the several guilts opposed to either notion
of Cleanness, and see how far each of them does remoye from any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in the Lords goodness to his Church, which is the natural Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of each part, and shall be mine.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Truly God is good to Israel,</hi> his Church. And sure this Proposition
is evident to us by its own light, to whom God proved his goodness
to astonishment, by exercising it to Miracle; while he at once wrought
Prodigies of kindness and Conviction; to which we have only this proof
to add, That God hath been so plentiful in Bounties, that we are weary
of every mention of them, and have so furfeited on Goodness that we
do nauseate the acknowledgment. So that his kindness in sustaining
his Compassions does vie with that which did effect them, who as he
will not be provok'd not to be good by such prodigious unthankfulness,
so neither will he by the most exasperating use of his Favours: God did
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40114:175"/>
complain of <hi>Israel,<note place="margin">Ezek. xvi. 17, 19.</note> Thou hast taken thy fair Jewels of my Gold and my
Silver which I had given thee, and madest to thy self Images: My meat
also which I gave thee, my fine Flour, mine Oyl, and Honey wherewith I
fed thee, and hast even set it before them for a sweet savour.</hi> And if
men now do offer things, in which God hath the same propriety, to
baser Idols, to their Vices; if they do sauce his meat, which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them, to sacrifice to Luxury, take his silver and gold to serve
in the Idolatry of Covetousness, and use his Jewels to dress Images also
for foulest adorations. If Atheism grow against Miracle and Goodness
too, and men do most deny God now when he hath given greatest
evidences of his kind Providence; I know not by what argument encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
unless his in the Poet,
<q>—Factum quod se dum negat hoc videt beatum,</q>
because they see they fare best now, though they deny him most;
teaching his <hi>goodness</hi> to consute his <hi>being.</hi> If they do look upon the
wondrous restitution of Gods Service as but a shifting of the Scene
of Worship, only another and more gaudy draught and Landskip of
Religion shot on the Stage, and do accordingly esteem it as a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and entertainment for their senses only; for nothing higher is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd,
I doubt me, in those Offices: If they assist in them not out of
Principle, but meer indifference to all, and therefore these at present;
It is not <hi>halting betwixt God and Baal this,</hi> it is the bowing of the knee
to both, which they can do to each alike, when either is the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
and truly count them Deities alike, I fear. Nay, when the only
Ordinance, the <hi>Sermon,</hi> is but a prize within the Temple, the Preacher
but <hi>Rhetor dicturus ad aram,</hi> that comes to do his Exercise before the
Altar, in which men are concern'd no farther than to hear and judg,
not to be sentenc'd by: If God endure all this, and do continue still
his Church, his Worship, and his other Mercies, then I may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that <hi>Truly God is good to Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I will not be this fastidious Remembrancer: These arguments
may prove his goodness, but sure these qualities will not preserve it
to us; the <hi>limitation,</hi> my next part, must suggest them; which tells us.

but a Congregation of such as are <hi>called to be Saints, 1 Cor.</hi> i. 2.</p>
                  <p>In the first <hi>Israel</hi> almost the whole Discipline of their Religion was
<hi>purity in type,</hi> and all the Ceremonies of their Worship were but <hi>figures,</hi>
rather <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Cleanness,</hi> when they came first to enter Covenant
with God at <hi>Horeb,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. xix. 10.</note> and to receive their Law, they were to <hi>sanctifie
themselves and wash their cloaths.</hi> What purity do those Commandments
require, which they must not hear with any thing that was unclean
about them? which they must wash all to receive? and indeed nothing
with them was enterprized without it; they were to cleanse themselves
from the impurities of meer Contingency; yea, they were bound to
wash their Dreams and purifie their very sleeps; and all this is expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40114:176"/>
by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> i. 16, 17. <hi>Wash ye, make ye clean, put away
the evil of your doings, cease to do evil, learn to do well.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in our <hi>Israel</hi> by our Covenant there is as much of this requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
for we were all initiated into our profession by Washing,<note place="margin">Tit. iii. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a Laver,</hi>

designati,</hi> set aside for Holiness, consecrated to cleanness, and
made the votaries of purity. How clean a thing then must a Christian
be who must be wash'd into the Name? nor is he thus wash'd only in
the Font, there was a more inestimable <hi>fountain opened for sin and for
uncleanness,</hi> Apoc. xi. 5. <hi>Jesus Christ hath wash'd us in his own blood;</hi>
And <hi>Heb.</hi> ix, 14. <hi>The blood of Christ did purge our Consciences from
dead works to serve the living God:</hi> How great is our necessity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
clean, when to provide a means to make us so, God opens his Sons
side, and our Laver is drawn out of the Heart of Christ: yet we have
more effusions to contribute to it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 11. <hi>But ye are wash'd, but
ye are sanctified by the Spirit of our God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. iii. 11.</note> and we must be <hi>Baptized with
the Holy Ghost and with fire.</hi> A Laver of flame also, to wash away
our Scurf as well as sullages, and beyond all these, some of us have been
purg'd too with the <hi>fiery trial,</hi> and molten in the <hi>furnace of Affliction,</hi>
to separate our dross and purifie us from alloy, that we may be clean
and refined too; may become Christians of the highest <hi>Carrect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such, among others, are the Obligations, such the Instruments of
cleanness in a Christian: Let us inquire next into the importance of the
quality, and the degree that is exacted.</p>
                  <p>And here I need not say that it stands in direct opposition to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
practices of Vice; this Scripture calls <hi>corruption and pollution,
2 Pet.</hi> ii. 19, 20. and the Sinner is there stiled <hi>the servant of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
sure a worthy relation this, a Servant is we know, meaner than
whom he serves, at least he is in that consideration as he serves; and
then I pray you, in what rank of things is he or she who is below
and baser than Corruption? <hi>David</hi> does also call such <hi>open Sepulchres;</hi>
things all whose horrour does not lie in this, that they enclose rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenness
and putrefaction, but open Sepulcres are gaping frightful noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somness;
and they do also shed a killing stench. A man that is ingaged
in conversations with impure sinners, is in a like condition with him who
hath no air to draw into him, but that of Funeral Vaults, and does suck
in only the breath of Pestilence.</p>
                  <p>But it is a small thing to say the cleanness of a Christian does ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
such licentious impurities; for it is such that though it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with those little stains that come by slips and failings of infirmity
(these are the <hi>spots of Children</hi>) and also with some single fouler acts,
into which the man may be surprized, provided they be suddenly
wash'd off in tears: Yet can it not consist with continuance in a known
sin, though it be but a breach of a single Commandment: And though
the man be strict in other things, yet if he do allow himself one Vice,
he is of the number of the <hi>unclean;</hi> for partial obedience does imply
also partial disobedience, and to the worst and foulest mixture; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no purity. <hi>Herod feared John the Baptist, knowing that he was a
just man and an holy, and observed him, and when he heard him he did
many things, and heard him gladly,</hi> Mark vi. 20. Could you but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
him one Crime, he were a most Religious person, but that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40114:176"/>
makes him the <hi>wicked Herod: The matter of Vriah</hi> threw dirt;
perpetual sticking dirt, into the Character of <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>man after
Gods heart.</hi> There are few persons but some sin or other finds a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
engagement on, and does insinuate especially above all others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them; the <hi>vice of Constitution,</hi> the Crime of my Bosom, 'tis my <hi>own
flesh and blood,</hi> I cannot tear that from me: Or else another sin does
get into my <hi>Coffers,</hi> the profits of it <hi>bribe</hi> me to make much on't, and
it brings such a reward with it I cannot be unkind to it; Or else the
custom of a Vice hath made it <hi>my acquaintance</hi> and <hi>my friend,</hi> and then
it is so joynted into me that there is no divulsion of it. Now when a
Vice hath got any of these relations to me, rather than use a violence
upon my self, I must find out some salve now to quiet Conscience, and
yet keep the Vice. And truly if it be but one thing that a man trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresses
in, he is apt to be gentle to himself, and finds plump grounds
to be so. The best man hath his fault, and this is his, only <hi>in this
the Good Lord pardon him;</hi> in other things he will be strict, but this is
his particular infirmity, to which his very making did dispose him,
having been poysoned by its Principles without his fault or conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, indeed, men have some one or other sinful inclination,
which is a weight and violence upon them, and which they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
from <hi>Adam,</hi> whose sin like an infection taken in by divers men,
breaks out in several Diseases, according to variety of Constitutions:
But truly <hi>Adam</hi> gave them no <hi>ill Customs,</hi> and they have no <hi>Original
habits,</hi> themselves did <hi>educate</hi> their inclinations into <hi>Vices:</hi> and for
those inclinations that are derived into them, the water of their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
was therefore poured upon them to cool those inbred heats, and
quench those flashings out of Nature, wash away those foul innate ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies
in that Laver of Regeneration; which therefore they who spare
and are tender to, because they are original and natural, they spare
them for that very reason, for which they there engaged to ruin them,
and do renounce their Baptism, as to the aims and uses of it. There
thou didst list thy self a Soldier to fight against the <hi>Devil, World,</hi> and
<hi>Flesh;</hi> now whichsoere of these gets most into thee, wilt thou think
fit to spare thy Enemy, because he is thy bosom one? the Risque is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
when the Foe is Rebel and Traytor too, is got in thy own Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
shuffled with thy own Forces, entred thy Holds and thy Defences,
and mixes in thy Counsels, does counterfeit thy Guard, so that thou
but command'st, and leadst on thy own ruin. Sure here is need of stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctest
care to rid thy self of so much treacherous danger; so far is it
from a defence to say, this is the single force and bent of Nature in me,
that if I no not therefore most resist it, I am perjuriously confederate
with my Destruction; and howsoever pure I keep my self from other
Vices, I am not clean. <hi>David</hi> will tell me when I am, <hi>Psalm</hi> xviii. 23.
<hi>I was uncorrupt before him, and eschewed my own wickedness.</hi> God hath
not given us Authority to pick and choose our duties; observe him
where we like, and leave the rest; and when in the severe contritions
of Repentance we come to judg our Lives, we have no leave to spare
a Vice because custom hath made it our Companion and Intimate, or
'tis as near to us as the close inclinations of our hearts. He that does
so, although he live a careful life in other things, yet all his Innocence
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40114:177"/>
is only this, he hath a mind to but one sin; and those he does not care
for he forbears, but that which pleaseth him, that he commits. And
sure God is beholden to him that there is but one way of provoking
which does take him, and therefore must allow him what he hath an
inclination to, and pardon him because he does abstain from those he
does not like.<note place="margin">James ii. 10.</note> I shall now only add that in this case S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>James</hi>'s Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism
holds, that <hi>Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in
one point only, he is guilty of all;</hi> he that allows himself to break one
Precept, does keep none, but shall be reckoned guilty of those things
which he does not commit. <hi>For whosoever keepeth the whole Law, and yet</hi>
thus <hi>offendeth in one point, is guilty of all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then I need not prove such have no Title to the <hi>goodness</hi> of the
Text, but may conclude, if God be good to <hi>Israel,</hi> it is to <hi>such as are of
a Clean Heart;</hi> And so I fall upon the subject, <hi>Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here I must first caution not to think the Heart is set as if it
were the entire and only Principle by which a judgment might be past
upon our doings; as if our Actions so wholly deriv'd denomination
from it, that they were pure which came from a clean upright heart;
In opposition to which, I shall not doubt to put, That the external
actions may have guilts peculiar to themselves, such as are truly their
own, not shed into them by an evil mind; and a man may be wicked
in the uprightness of his heart, when he does not intend any such
thing, but rather the clean contrary. Our Saviour tells his Apostles,
<hi>The time will come that whosoever killeth you will think he doth God
service, John</hi> xvi. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that he does offer
an <hi>Oblation</hi> or <hi>Worship,</hi> shall think his Murder <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> that that
would <hi>propitiate</hi> for other faults; his Crime should seem <hi>Religion</hi> and
<hi>attonement</hi> to him. (We have seen guilts put on such colours too:)
and yet by these same actions which their hearts pursued with Holy
aims, out of a Zeal to God, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 2. they sacrificed
themselves and their Nation to Gods Vengeance. Once more St.
<hi>Paul</hi> does find reason to call himself the <hi>chief of Sinners, 1 Tim.</hi> i. 15.
for the commissions of that time of which he says that <hi>he served God
with a pure Conscience, ver.</hi> 3. did what he was persuaded in his heart
he ought to do, pursued sincere intentions; and after says, <hi>he had lived
in all good conscience before God until that day, Acts</hi> xxiii. 1. So that
here was enough of the <hi>clean heart,</hi> a <hi>good</hi> and a <hi>pure conscience,</hi> and
could his fiery persecutions by vertue of that flame within be Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Holy Zeal? Could his Pure Conscience make his Bloody hands
undefil'd? Oh no! 'twas <hi>blasphemy,</hi> and <hi>persecution,</hi> and <hi>injury,</hi> for
all 'twas <hi>Conscience;</hi> for all his heart was clean from such intentions:
<hi>I was before a Blasphemer, and a Persecuter, and Injurious, ver.</hi> 13. We
may not think to shroud foul actions under handsom Meanings and an
Innocent Mind; a Conscientious man may yet be chief of Sinners; St.
<hi>Paul</hi> was so, he says, and a clean Heart will not suffice alone. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Heart</hi> is put here accumulatively, as that whose cleanness must be
added to the purity of Conversation to compleat it; and it implies
what elsewhere he does set down more expresly <hi>Clean Hands,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psalm xxiv. 4.</note> and <hi>a
Pure Heart,</hi> all which a clean Heart may be set to signifie, because
under Gods Holy Spirit it is the principal and only safe agent in the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of the rest, as that which only can make the other real, valuable,
and lasting.</p>

When a Disease hath once insinuated it self into the Vitals, spread
through the Marrow, and seised the garrisons of Life, the Souls strong
holds, and after fallies out into the outer parts in little pustles and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome
Ulcers; they who make application only to those outward
Ulcers, may perchance smooth and cure the skin, make the unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somness
remove and shift its seat, but all that while the man decays,
the Forts of Life are undermin'd and sink, the vitals putrefie, and the
whole Skin becomes but the fair Monument of its own rotten Inwards:
Just so we have a <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> an inward deep infusion, bed or seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot
of malignity, which sometimes shews it self in outward gross com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions;
but if we only use the Lance or corrosive to these, we may
perchance make a man shift a sin (thus it is possible that the <hi>profane</hi>
may alter into <hi>Factious,</hi> or contrary, the <hi>profuse</hi> Proud man turn <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous</hi>)
but till the ground of these be purg'd away the man's not
cur'd, but only the Disease is chang'd, and he is as unsound as ever.
Gods severe Judgments that did lie so long so close upon us, like
strong repercussives, may have stricken back the breakings out of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sins or inclinations: But then no care being taken of the Heart,
the first heat sent them out again, and Mercy made a restauration of Vices
too. But if the Heart once entertain a real and sincere sense of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
if it consent to thorough resolutions of Piety, as far as the man
discerns, so far the Cure is perfected, and such are fitted for Gods
goodness; for <hi>truly God is good to Israel, even to those that are of such
a clean Heart;</hi> And so I fall upon them both together, first in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sense propos'd.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Clean heart</hi> signifies sincere true-hearted men, I have not
only the assurance of Translations, and among them the <hi>Syriack,</hi> but
the Text it self does evince it, because such only are indeed of <hi>Israel;</hi>
for so our Saviour says, <hi>Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile,
John</hi> i. 47. One like the Father of them <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>1. In his Conversation with Men:</p>
                  <p>I am not here to say, Sincerity is much, most <hi>generous,</hi> when it looks
like a disingenuous fear to be afraid of my own mind, when my Heart
dares not look into my Face, or speak in my Tongue, but must lurk
under a disguise of words, or countenance, that are assum'd and not its
own. Nor is it Secondly, my business to say it is the greatest <hi>prudence,</hi>
or as we call it <hi>Policy,</hi> and that not only because it hath most reason
to attend and to expect Gods Blessing, which other false acts cannot;
but because though bold open Truth breeds Anger frequently, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerity
breeds hatred and contempt; there being no so ignominious
thing as Reputation of Falsness, which yet is unavoidable, for events
must discover insincerity, and then how piteous a thing he is when he
must turn and wind still in more Mazes, till he be quite lost in his own
shifts, and having no clue for his own Labyrinths, betrays himself
more by his not knowing where he is; and men must needs be much
more angry at pretences when they find them, than they were at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
truth at first; when they discern their wants and expectations
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40114:178"/>
too deceived, themselves refus'd and mock'd, find nothing but a Vizard
for a Friend: nay, find an Enemy indeed, for so is the Dissembler to
mankind. Great Casuists do tell us, that the moral Obligations to speak
truth depend upon a right that each man hath who is a member of
humane society; Man being a sociable Creature meerly by vertue of his
Speech: But speech could not contribute to cement Society, if there were
not an obligation to speak truth; hence they conclude, that Children,
Fools, and Madmen who are not truly members of Humane society,
and also open Enemies, with whom we are in a state of War, and have
broke that society as to all things but Laws and Articles of War; all
these and these alone we may deceive, and then surely the false insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
man either esteems all others Fools and Madmen, or holds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in a state of War with all Mankind, out of all Laws and Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Humane society, and is an Enemy to the World; a Creature by
himself, but that there are so many of them. But to pass by such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
Gods Precepts of not <hi>lying to one another,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. iii. 9.</note> oblige us and all

into Nourishment. Go prepare for your hungry stomachs only festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Smells, which may encourage fainting Appetite, but do but mock
its emptiness; go warm a cold part with a painted light, cover a naked
member with a shadow; when your own parts would take it well from
one another to be thus insincerely dealt with, then, not till then, will
it be tolerable to Dissemble. <hi>For we are members one of another;</hi> all

                  <p>2. And much more, Secondly, is he such onely to them that <hi>are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
in their Religion to him.</hi> Christ hath nothing but woes for Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites;
the 23d Chap. of S. <hi>Matth.</hi> is made up of them; when he would
word Gods Vengeance to Sinners, he says, <hi>he shall give them their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with Hypocrites and Vnbelievers.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. xxiv. 51.</note> Things strangely coupled sure,
that they whose Life does seem all Faith,<note place="margin">Luke xii. 46.</note> all Godliness, should be onely
fit Company in <hi>Tophet</hi> for the Unbelievers, rank'd and condemned with
them; that all their strong belief cannot remove them from an Infidel;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40114:178"/>
Sure they are far enough from the goodness of the Lord, when <hi>the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Hypocrites</hi> is Rhetorick of <hi>Hell,</hi> is its Torments exprest with Art.</p>
                  <p>They whose heart is not clean to God in their Pieties, but let their
strictnesses take in some temporal aim besides, as Reputation with their
Party, or getting Praise, or Wealth; they serve Mammon or Fame with
Gods Religion, and make the very Worship of the Lord be the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
of Covetousness or of Honour. If <hi>Jehu</hi> in his Executions on <hi>Ahab</hi>
and his Family intend the cutting off the <hi>Regal Line</hi> as well as <hi>Baals
worship,</hi> and with their Blood to purple his own Royalty, though God
did bid him shed that blood, yet does it stain his Soul with crimson
guilt; and God will punish him for his Obedience, <hi>I will visit the blood
of Jezreel upon the House of Jehu, Hos.</hi> i. 4. But he that lets a vicious
aim mix with his Vertue, and does good to an ill end, addresses <hi>Gods
Religion</hi> to the <hi>Devil,</hi> and makes <hi>Christ</hi> minister to <hi>Belial;</hi> he does sin
multipliedly, both in his vicious intention, and in debauching Vertue
to serve Vice, and he might much more innocently not have been Pious.
Neither is that Vertue or Heart sincere whose intentions are not purely
and meerly vertuous, but intend to compass some Religious end by
means that are not lawful; For such intentions are not clean but mixt
with Vice; and 'tis sure I cannot please God with such kind of holy
meanings.<note place="margin">1 Sam. xv. 9. 21, 23.</note> If <hi>Saul</hi> will sacrifice with the Sheep and Oxen he was bid to
destroy, his very worship loseth him the Throne of <hi>Israel:</hi> Nor an I
serve God with such Pieties. God never does require an action which
he sees I cannot compass without sin, for he requires no man to sin, for
that were to command me to break his Commands, and I were bound
to disobey him in obedience to him,<note place="margin">Job xiii. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Shall I speak wickedly for God,</hi> saith
<hi>Job?</hi> and then shall I <hi>do</hi> so? Such Religious intentions, the justice of
those ends, will never qualifie me for Gods goodness, when it but makes
Damnation just to me, for so S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 5, 6, 7, 8. In fine,
if there be any wickedness in the heart, it gives so foul a tincture to
whatever pious actions we perform, that they become sin to us. 'Tis
true,<note place="margin">Psalm Cxli. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Prayer is as the Incense, David</hi> says, <hi>and the lifting up of our hands
is like the Evening Sacrifice;</hi> but if the heart of him that Prays have
any heats of Malice in it, truly that man does light his Incense with
<hi>strange fire,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">James iii. 6.</note> kindles his sacrifice with the <hi>flames of Hell,</hi> for so S. <hi>James</hi>
does call those heats. He that gives God any of his performances, and
hath a naughty Heart, like <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> he presents his Offering
in an unhallowed Censer, and all his holy worship will get nothing else
from Heaven for him but a consuming fire as theirs did. He that will
offer any thing to God, must take a care it be not tainted with such mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which spoil all the Religion, making it not <hi>sincere,</hi> and also spoil
the Heart by making it not <hi>clean,</hi> and <hi>undefiled.</hi> The last remaining
sense,</p>
                  <p>A Clean and undefiled Heart.</p>
                  <p>Of those things which our Saviour says <hi>defile</hi> the man, some are
meerly sins of the Heart, such as may be consummated within the Soul;
and for the perpetration of which a spirit is sufficient to it self; such are
<hi>Pride,</hi> especially <hi>spiritual pride,</hi> the sin of those that think none holy
as themselves, and cast the black doom of Reprobation upon all that do
not comply with their Opinions and interests: such also are <hi>uncontented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with our estates, inward repinings at the dispositions of Providence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40114:179"/>
us,</hi> black <hi>malice,</hi> bitter <hi>envyings.</hi> Now in these as the mind does
need no outward members to consummate them, requires no accessary
Organs to work them out; so neither does it require any outward acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
guilt to make them liable to condemnation: we know 'twas one sin
of the spirit onely that made Angels Devils. If a foul body be abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to the Lord, shall a foul spirit be less odious? he that defiles his
Soul offends God in a much nearer concern of his, because that speaks nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
relation to him than the Body: this was only his workmanship, made
out of Earth, the Spirit was created out of himself; a foul body is but
filthy Clay, but he that does pollute his Soul does putresie the Breath
of God, and stains a beam of the Divinity.</p>
                  <p>The other sort of things that are said to come from the Heart, and
to Defile, are those which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>works of the Flesh,</hi> such as if they
be committed must be committed outwardly, <hi>Murders, Drunkenness, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellings,
Revenge, Wrath and Contentions, Seditions, Factions, Schisms,
all Vncleannesses,</hi> &amp;c. In these indeed the Heart can be but partial
Actor, the utmost it can do, is to desire and to intend them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
and manage the designs of compassing them; which yet Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or the Innocence of others may put out of the reach of mans
power, or his own temporal fears may make him not dare to set upon
them, though he do cherish the desires. Now if they be obstructed from
committing, most men use to conclude gently of their guilts while they
do keep within the Heart; the Execution of them is the onely thing
that does look mortal; and till the <hi>sin be perfected there is no death in
it.</hi> And truly I confess that, as it happens many times, on a sudden
surprize of soul, when a bright gilded temptation strikes the heart, and
dazles the mind, we see that the Will rushes on it instantly, consents
and wishes heartily; yet within a while the Spirit does recover out of
the surprize, puts by the thrusts of fancy, and the stabs of the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that Will languishes and dies like a <hi>velleity,</hi> as if it had been
nothing but a woulding; and now the man would not by any means
consent to the commission: In this case though there be a guilt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of, and cleansed with many tears, yet this is Innocence in the
comparison; but if the Will purpose, contrive, and do its utmost, it is
the same to the man as if he had committed. 'Twere easie to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
this, that whatsoever evil thing a man intends and does fixedly
resolve, he is guilty of, though he do nothing, or though the thing he
chance to do be never so much lawful. Those sayings of St. <hi>Paul, I
know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is no meat unclean of
it self, but to him that esteemeth any thing unclean, to him it is unclean,
Rom.</hi> xiv. 14. and <hi>he that doubteth is damned if he eat, ver.</hi> 23. These
could have no truth in them, unless the heart by choosing and pursuing
to the utmost any thing that it does judg unlawful, incurr'd the guilt
of that unlawfulness, even to Damnation; and all that meerly by it self
without the Action, which in that case had nothing sinful in it. A
weight that is upheld by a mans hand, and otherwise would rush down
to the earth, does surely gravitate as much, it is as heavy though
it do not fall quite down, as if it did, and, were it let alone, it would:
A setled tendency, a resolv'd inclination to sin, that presseth with its
utmost agitation is that weight, which though it may perchance be
stop'd in its career, yet it tends to the <hi>Abysse, its center,</hi> and will
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40114:179"/>
not rest but in that Pit that hath nor rest nor bottom; the Heart in this
case is as liable as it can be, because here it hath done its worst, and such
a Will shall be imputed to its self.</p>
                  <p>And now I need not tell those who are still designing sin, or mischief
in the heart, although it never dares come out of those recesses, how
far they are removed from the <hi>goodness of God to Israel.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tertull. de Anima. cap. 58.</note> A Father finds
a way to prove such souls have larger doses of Gods Vengeance, who
when he had asserted that the soul does not die with the body, and then
was ask'd what it did in that long interval, for sure it is not reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that it should be affected with any anticipations of the future
Judgment, because the business of the day of Judgment should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to its own day, without all prelibation of the sentence; and the
restitution of the Flesh is to be waited for, that so both soul and body
may go hand in hand in their Recompences as they did in their deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
joynt Partners in the Wages as they were in the Works: To this
he answers; The Soul does not divide all its operations with the Body,
some things it acts alone, and if there were no other cause it were most
just the Soul should there receive without the Body the dues of that
which here it did commit without the Body: That's for the former sort
of sins, those meerly of the Heart: And for the latter sort, the Soul is
first engaged in the commission, that does conceive the sin, lays the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of compassing, and does contrive and carry on the machination;
and then why should not that be first in Punishment, which is the first
in the Offence?</p>
                  <p>Go now and reckon that thy outward gross Transgressions are the
only dangerous and guilty ones and slight thy sins of Heart; but know
that while thy flesh is sleeping in the quiet Grave at rest and ease, thy
Spirit then's in Torments sor thy Fleshes sins, and feels a far severer
Worm than that which gnaws thy Body: Poor Soul! Eternity of Hell
from Resurrection to For-ever, is not enough to punish it, all that while
it must suffer with the Body, but it must have an age of Vengeance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
particularly for it self, to plague it for those things it could not
execute, and punish it for what it did not really enjoy; only because it
did allow it self to desire and contrive them; and it must be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for those unsatisfied desires: And though indeed desires where they
are violent, if they be not allayed by satisfaction, are but so much ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
yet do they merit and pull on them more; these Torments shall
be plagued, and the soul suffer for its very passion, even from Death to
the last Judgment; and 'tis but just that being it usurp'd upon the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and the sins of Flesh, it should also seize on and take possession of
the Vengeance appointed for those sins, it should invade and should
usurp their condemnation.</p>
                  <p>But why do I stand pressing aggravations against uncleanness of
Heart in an Age, when God knows Vice hath not so much modesty or
fear to keep within those close and dark restraints? Instead of that same
Cleanness which the Text requires, we may find Purity indeed of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
sorts, but 'tis either <hi>pure Fraud,</hi> or <hi>pure Impiety;</hi> the one of these
does make a strange expression very proper, <hi>pure Corruption,</hi> for so it is,
sincere and without mixture, nothing but it self, no spots of Clean to
chequer it, but all stain: The other is pure white indeed, but it is that
of <hi>whited Sepulcres;</hi> a Life as clean as Light, a bright pure Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40114:180"/>
but it shines with that light onely which <hi>Satan</hi> does put on <hi>when
he transforms himself into an Angel of Light,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. xi. 14.</note> and it is but a <hi>glory</hi> about
a <hi>fiend.</hi> But yet this shines however, whereas others do stand Candidates
of Vice, and would be glorious in wickedness; and that is such a splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
as if <hi>Satan</hi> should dress himself with the shine of his own flaming
Brimstone, and make himself a glory with the streamings of his Lake
of Fire. And yet thus is the World, we do not onely see men serve
some one peculiar vicious inclination, and cherish their own wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but they make every Vice their own, as if the Root of bitterness
branch'd out in each sort of Impiety in them, such fertile soyls of sin
they are, here insincerity were to be wish'd; and where there is not
<hi>cleanness</hi> that there were a <hi>Mask,</hi> that there were the <hi>Religion of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie.</hi>
We may remember God was good to <hi>Israel</hi> of old by Obligation
and performance; the one as great as he could enter, the other great to
Miracle and astonishment; when after seventy years Captivity and
Desolation, he did rebuild a Temple where there was no Monument of
its Ruines, and raised a Nation and Government of which there was no
Reliques. And yet at last when the Religion of some turned into <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
of others into <hi>Prophaneness;</hi> when the strictest Sect of them, the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi> became most holy outwardly, to have the better means

the <hi>Church of Israel,</hi> became lukewarm, supine, and negligent in their
Profession, yea, and licentious and Prophane, fit only to be joyned with
<hi>Publicans,</hi> in <hi>Christs</hi> expressions; when sin grew generally Impudent;
when they did live as if they would be <hi>Scandalous</hi> as well as <hi>vicious,</hi> as
if they lov'd the <hi>guilt</hi> as much as the <hi>delights</hi> of sin, and cared not to be
<hi>wicked to themselves,</hi> but must <hi>debauch,</hi> as if they did <hi>enjoy the ruine</hi> of
other persons, sinning just as the <hi>Devil</hi> does, who does not taste the
sin, but feasts upon the Sinners Condemnation: Then did God execute
a Vengeance whose prediction was fit to be mistaken for that of the
Day of Judgment, and whose event almost fulfill'd the terrors of that
day.</p>
                  <p>I need not draw resemblances, shew how Gods goodness to our <hi>Israel</hi>
does equal that to them; applying to our selves their Raptures; how
<hi>when the Lord turned the Captivity of our Sion,<note place="margin">Psal. Cxxvi. 1.</note> we also were like them
that dream,</hi> surprized with Mercy. Indeed as in a Dream; <hi>Ideas</hi> are not
always well connected, there is no chain or thred of fancies, and the
thoughts are not joynted regular and even; but there are breaches and
disorder in them still, the Images of sleep being like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s,
made of such things as do not well unite. So there is something I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
like this in our condition, for with our <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>silver,</hi> our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
things that are restored, there is <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Clay,</hi> not onely meaner
mixtures, but such things as will not close, or be soder'd, but do incline
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40114:180"/>
to part asunder, and would moulder and tend towards dissolution; and
just as in a Dream, the composure of things is no so undisturb'd, but
that there is some confusedness; neither our affections nor practices do
perfectly cement; but yet I hope it is no <hi>dream of mercy,</hi> 'tis not a
<hi>Phantasm</hi> or an <hi>Apparition of Gods kindness,</hi> but the Lord will be truly
good to us.</p>
                  <p>Yet if we do proceed as <hi>Israel,</hi> and equal it in provocations:—</p>
                  <p>But I will make no parallels, publique clamors do that too loud;
these do display the factions of iniquity among us, and muster up the
several parties of our Vices too; and each man is as perfect in the guilts
of all sides that he is not of, as if their memories were the books that
shall be opened at the Day of Judgment; some men can point you out
our <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Zelots;</hi> others can shew you our <hi>prophane licentious
Professors,</hi> Lay and Clergy both; and indeed we need not go far to seek
any or all of these; nor do we want our <hi>Sadduces.</hi> Now if all this be
true, then as those were the signs of the Son of Man's coming to them
in Judgment, so we may fear they are his Harbingers to us. If they
be, I am sure the only way to make his coming good to us, is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for it by cleansing from all filthiness and insincerity; then though
he come clothed with a Glory of flaming Vengeance, yet will those
streams of Fire find nothing to consume or wash away in us; but
through that flame the <hi>pure in heart shall see God,</hi> so as that that sight
shall be the Beatifick Vision: Yea, <hi>they shall see the Goodness of the
Lord in the Land of the Living, they shall see Jerusalem in prosperity all
their life long, and Peace</hi> here <hi>upon Israel,</hi> and <hi>in his light</hi> hereafter in
the <hi>Jerusalem that is above,</hi> To the state of which glorious Light He
bring us all, who is the <hi>brightness of his Fathers Glory: To whom be
Glory, and dominion for ever and ever.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE words are one Single Precept concerning one
part of the Celebration of a Day: I shall not
take the Precept asunder into parts, for it hath
none; but shall frame my Discourse to answer
three Enquiries that naturally offer themselves
to be consider'd from these words: And they
are,</p>
                  <p>1. What the Importance of the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
is? What is required in this Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Ye shall afflict your Souls?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. What Usefulness and Efficacy this Duty had upon that time in
which it was prescribed? what the <hi>Afflicting of the Soul</hi> contributed to
the work of that Day? that it should be made so indispensable an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
of its performances, tied to it <hi>by a Statute for ever?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Whether that <hi>for ever</hi> do reach us? which is the Application, and
brings all home to us.</p>
                  <p>First, What the Import of the thing commanded, <hi>the Afflicting of the
Soul is?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arab.</hi> and <hi>Targum of Jerusalem</hi> Translate it <hi>Fasting;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Maimonid.</note> yea, and
a Learned <hi>Rabbine</hi> says, that wheresoever these two words are put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that is meant. And indeed they are often joyned in Scripture
to express it, <hi>Psalm</hi> XXXV. 13. <hi>I afflicted my Soul with Fasting.</hi> And the
Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaking of this Day in my Text, says, <hi>Is it such a Fast
that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his Soul? Isa.</hi> lviii. 5.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40114:182"/>
Somewhat a strange expression it is; for Fasting does afflict the Body
properly, and yet we find the like too in the other Extream: We read
of <hi>pampering the Soul, Psalm</hi> lxxviii. 18. <hi>They required</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>meat for their Souls;</hi> not to supply the Hunger of their Body, that they
had before; but to indulge the Lusts of their mind; they did not want
for food, but variety; Festival diet, and a Table furnish'd they would
have; and this luxuriancy and wantonness of Meat the Scripture calls
<hi>meat for the Soul:</hi> Such as God says in other places <hi>the Soul lusteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
Indeed forc'd meats, and things that please meerly by being rare
and dear, or by being extravagant, these do not feed the Appetite but
Opinion, and the Mind; it is the Soul that only hungers after these:
Thus when I look after Wine in the glass, and make my Eye a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
of its accidents, and by the mode and fashion of it teach it to
please or displease my judgment, I do not thirst after the cool moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of it, but the sparkling flame, and do not drink the Wine, but the
flavour and colour, and this is all but Notion. Now certainly these
are not proper objects for our Appetites, <hi>meat for the Body,</hi> says the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and it is the Stomach and not the Imagination that is hungry; nor
is it Fancy or the Soul that thirsts, but 'tis the Palate, so that these are
unnatural and monstrous satisfactions.</p>
                  <p>And yet to bring mens selves to this, is one of the great masteries of
Wit and Art, to force themselves to find a relish in these things, and
then contrive them, is a piece of Skill which the advantages of parts
and fortune are desireable mostly, as they are useful to: And a well stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
Epicure, one expert in the mysteries of Eating, is a singularly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
and most grateful Person.</p>
                  <p>It were in vain to ask what else such men can be good for? that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Profession, they are out at most other things: Indeed the Soul
that dwells in Dishes, and is stew'd in its own Luxuries, grows loose
and does dissolve, its sinews melt, all its firmness of mind forsakes it,
the man is strong for nothing but for Lusts, his faculties are choak'd
and stifled, they stagnate and are mir'd within him, and there corrupt
and putrefie. And then what Cranes will force out thence, and wind
up such a Soul into the practices and expectations of Piety? will make
it mind and entertain the hopes and Duties of Religion? what macera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
what Chymistry will defecate a Spirit so incarnated, and rectifie
it into such a fineness as befits that state where all their blessedness
have no sensual relish, but are sublimed into Divine and purely Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
                  <p>Lord God! that thou shouldst shed a rational Angelick Soul into us,
a thing next to the Being of thy Self, to animate only the Organs of
Intemperance, and Gluttony, and their appendant lusts! Only inspire
us how to be but more sagacious, indeed but more luxurious Brutes,
when thou hast set us here to train and discipline our selves for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of such glorious Joys as are fit to entertain Souls of Reason with,
and to make them blessed; which to enter upon, our Bodies must drop
from us, our Souls must be clarified from Flesh, and Flesh it self refined
into Spirit; that we should make our selves Antipodes to this, walk
contrary to all, and so debase our spirits as that they are qualified for no
other satisfaction, but those of dull sense and carnality.</p>

                     <hi>Adam</hi> fell his great Fall by Eating, but ever since men fall further
by riotous intemperate Eating. He fell from Paradise, and they from
Reason; the Man sinks into Beast, and the Soul falls into very Flesh, and
hath no other faculties or appetites but fleshly ones.</p>
                  <p>Such people of all others are not to be raised up by Religion; their
fulness gives no place to that, but does exclude it. God did complain
of this of old, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 15. <hi>Jesurun waxed fat and kicked:</hi> that we
may see they want to brutish quality, who do allow themselves the
appetite of Brutes; they that <hi>pamper themselves like to fed Horses,</hi> will
also <hi>neigh</hi> like them and <hi>kick</hi> even him that fed them; <hi>thou art waxen
fat, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God that made him,
and lightly esteemed the Rock of his Salvation.</hi> When they came once
where they did <hi>suck honey cut of the Rock,<note place="margin">Deut. xxxil. 13.</note> and Oyl out of the flinty Rock,</hi>
they could not mind <hi>the Rock of their Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed this sensuality as it consumes Estates, eats Time, and all the
faculties of the Mind, so it devours all Religion too, it hath not only a
particular opposition to some one duty as the other Vices have, but by
a direct influence it destroys the whole foundation of Vertue and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to God; I mean subordination of the lower appetite to Reason
and Religion, which it renverses quite, and breeds an universal cachexy
of the Soul as well as Body.</p>
                  <p>For ever since <hi>Adam</hi> did eat of the forbidden Fruit, the <hi>carnal mind</hi>
we know <hi>is neither subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be,</hi> as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>Rom</hi> viii. 7. because Gods Commands are restraints upon
those things which Flesh desires eagerly. Now therefore while that
Mind is unsubdued, it must needs lust against the Spirit for those things
that are forbidden, nor endure to be limited; which he that feeds it, is
so far from working towards, that he does give it still more provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and more power, and makes the Flesh more absolute; for it is
clear that Plenty does encrease all its desires and their unruliness; it
ministers both vigor to it by which it is enabled to fulfill its lusts, and
it ministers aptness and incitation also, both by custom of satisfaction,
and by adding heat which makes it more prone to rebel, and more
impossible to be kept under. The progress of this is apparent in the
Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxii, 6. <hi>The People sat down to Eat and Drink and rose
up to Play:<note place="margin">Tertul.</note> Lusum non denotasset nisi impudicum;</hi> he means, <hi>to play the
wantons.</hi> But <hi>Jeremy</hi> is plainer, <hi>Chap.</hi> v. 7, 8. <hi>How shall I pardon thee
for this? thy Children have forsaken me, when I had fed them to the full,
they then committed Adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
houses:</hi> Nor stays it there, but does encrease as well as feed to an
Excess; we may discern that by the Wisemans Prayer, xxiii. <hi>Ecclesiast.
6. O Lord, Father and God of my Life, Let not the greediness of the
Belly, not the lust of the Flesh, take hold of me, and give not over me thy
Servant to an impudent mind, Gyant-like</hi> he had called it in the Verse
before; and sure the Wiseman in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> apprehended it as such,
and dreaded it accordingly; as if Bellies full gorg'd were those Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainr
which the Gyants cast up to storm Heaven on: He look'd upon
this Vice as that which would bid defiance to <hi>God,</hi> and out <hi>him,</hi> and
therefore thinks it necessary to beseech the Lord not to afford him so
much as would furnish Plenty, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxx. 8. <hi>Give me not Riches, feed
me with food convenient for me;</hi>

Belly; nor is it any wonder if a <hi>Soul made Flesh</hi> cannot well apprehend
a <hi>Deity that is a Spirit,</hi> or believe it, but thinks all Notions of such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to be contradiction, when once by the suffusions of Carnality all
the impressions of a Spirit are wrought out of it self: And truly this is
the most natural and certain way to become Atheists.</p>
                  <p>Whether this time that hath been almost always set aside for strict
Severities, and to work out Repentance (and if it be not so intended
now, I know not what pretence did call us hither) (for though there
be some relaxation of the severer Dyet of this time, sure there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
of that Penitence which the strictness of this time design'd)
and let some men talk what they please of the Intention of their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
yet these Assemblies certainly were not intended for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> increase of
Cattel, and advance of Fishing; these were for higher aims of Piety:
Now whether we employ if so much towards this as <hi>to afflict our Souls,</hi>
i. e. <hi>our appetites,</hi> and to revenge our superfluities upon our selves, and
to teach our desires to be denied: Or whether we do teach the Dyet
of this season to be but a variety of Luxury, and if the Law did not
command it, and so make it Pressure by giving it the inconvenience and
the uneasiness of being duty and obedience; our selves could make it
be one of the changes of our Vice, only another course, a diverse
service of the same Riot, and so defeat the Law by our obedience to it:
Or whether we do break the Law outright, and to our superfluities add
disobedience to Authority, whether we do the one or other is not for
me to say. But if the Nation and we our selves have any sins to be
repented of, and we design this season for that use (as sure some season
must be so employed, and why not this as well, rather indeed than any
other;) if we be not of those that would be glad to see all thrown
again into Confusion; glad to see a return of the same Vengeance, as
indeed a return of the same sins, and the abuse of Mercies seem to call
for it, while men do live as if they thought God had wrought all these
Miracles meerly to give them opportunity to serve their Vices or their
other ends, to put them in a way to get Places, Estates, and Dignities;
and by uncharitable gains, hard-hearted griping, yea by false unworthy
treacherous Arts, to heap up Wealth, to raise their Families, or feed
their Lusts: These, these cry out to God to renew his Commission to
the Sword, to pass through all the Land again, and embowel it self in
Church and State; these call for it as loud as the hatangueing Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Seditious Men; and the Lord knows there are too many hands
that would unsheath it, if God do not interpose to hinder, and well
we have deserv'd he should. But if we would endeavour to engage
him by Repentance, that will require the Afflicting of the Soul by some
severities. Do not mistake your selves; Repentance, as it cannot be
wrought out amidst our courses, that were contradiction to return, and
yet go on; so also it will not be wrought out amidst the Comforts as
we call the jollities, of life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> is very pleasant with those who did dislike that in their
Penitencies, they were by the Church prescrib'd to put off Mirth and
put on Sackcloth, and take Ashes for Bread; <hi>Come,</hi> says he, <hi>reach that
Bodkin there to braid my Hair, and help me now to practise all those Arts
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40114:183"/>
that are in Mode to attire it; give me the washes of that Glass, the blushes
of that Paper, the foyles which that Box hath to beautifie and dress my
Cheeks; come and set out and dress my Table too, let me have Fowl with
costly forc'd and not a natural Fat; or let me have cramb'd Fish, and
cram my Dishes also; get me chearful Wine too: and if any one ask why I
do thus indulge my self? Why I will tell him, I have sin'd against my
God, and am in danger of Perdition, and therefore I am in great trouble;
I macerate (do you not see the signs of it?) and excruciate my self, I
take these fearful careful ways that I may reconcile God to me whom I have
offended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alas, to <hi>humble</hi> ones self thus in <hi>fulness,</hi> and to <hi>afflict the Soul in
chearful plenties,</hi> is such a thing as none but he that sinks under the
surfeit of those Plenties understands. I'm sure the Lord, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
his People to repent, required them then to discipline, and use
severities upon themselves; they were to <hi>fast</hi> or <hi>dye:</hi> God took the
execution, <hi>for whatsoever Soul it be that shall not be Afflicted that same
day shall be cut off from among his People, Levit.</hi> xxiii. 29. Even cut off
by God himself.</p>
                  <p>And I do verily persuade my self, that one great cause, why men
that have sometimes thought to reform their lives, and do resolve
against their Courses, yet repent of their Repentance, their resolutions
untwist, and become frail as threds of Cobweb, the first assault of a
temptation does break through them, is, they do not use mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to work their aversations high and strong against their sins, and
fix their resolutions. The universal sense of the whole Primitive Church
gives me confidence in this persuasion, who for that very reason in their
penitential Excommunications did inflict such severities, as 'tis almost
incredible that Christians would submit to; yet they beg'd to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
into; and those had S. <hi>Paul</hi> for their precedent. But now Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
are but dislikes, little short unkindnesses at our sins, and would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to do better: On some moving occasion, if Gods Hand or his
Spirit lash, it may be Tears will gush out of the Wound, and we in
angry sadness do intent against our Vices; but when that fit is over,
and the Flesh by indulgences prepared to make or answer a temptation,
we fall again, and then it may be shake the head and curse the sin; but
yet again commit it, if the invitation be fair: And then are very sorry,
account our selves unhappy, who lie under such a violent infirmity, but
act it still. Now if we consider how it comes to pass that we go round
like men inchanted, in a Circle of Repenting and of Sinning, we shall
find it is for want of Discipline upon our selves; for had we strove to
make our humiliations more low and full of pungent sorrow, the Soul
would start and fly at the first glance of that which cost it so much
anguish; but who would fear to act that sin which puts him to so little
trouble to repent of? as a sad thought, a sigh, a wish, and a loose pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
thin intentions, and that's all.</p>
                  <p>Do not complain of the Infirmity of the Flesh for this, and say thou
wouldst live Spiritually, but the frailty of thy sensual part betrays
thee; its stings and incitations make thee start from duty, and goad
and force thee into actions which otherwise thou neither shouldst or
wouldst commit. 'Tis thou thy self that arm'st thy Flesh with all its
stings; thou givest it strengths, whereby it does subdue the Spirit;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40114:184"/>
thou waterest thy desires with Wines; thou feedest them with strong
meat and teachest them to crave; thou cocker'st them with thy indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and thou dost treat Temptations to sin, dost invite wickedness,
and nourish the occasions of Ruin; and then it is no wonder if thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
be not strong enough, there is no way but by Austerities to
mortifie all inclinations that stir against the Spirit, and by denying sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions
to thy Appetite, to calm and moderate thy affections to
every thing below, and then Temptations will have neither Aid nor
Avenue.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, <hi>You shall Afflict your Souls,</hi> cannot be meant only <hi>that
ye shall Afflict your Bodies;</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> also must be troubled, and we
must <hi>rent the Heart as well as Garments;</hi> that is indeed a Sacrifice fit
for a Propitiation day, for it is such a one as God will not despise, <hi>Psal.</hi>
li. 17. and without which all others are but vain Oblations.</p>
                  <p>God may call <hi>fasting</hi> the <hi>Afflicting of the Soul,</hi> because it is the most
appropriate and natural means to work it; but when he calls it so he
does intend it should produce it. Austerities are <hi>humilificandi hominis
disciplina,</hi> as <hi>Tertul.</hi> says, <hi>Humiliation Discipline;</hi> but yet they have not
always that effect. The <hi>Pharisee</hi> that fasted twice a week did not
mortifie at all, but his Humiliation made him lofty, his emptiness fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him with wind, and puft him up, and the <hi>Publican</hi> was <hi>more justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
than he. And late experiences have taught us, that Fasting does
not always humble, when it did gape for Sovereignty, and did afflict
then into Power only, when there attended it a <hi>sacra fames,</hi> an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
after Holy things, and such as all the relicts of old Sacriledg could
not allay, but it devoured Church and State, and yet crav'd still: And
<hi>the throat</hi> of these fasting men <hi>was an open Sepulchre indeed;</hi> open to
bury, and that could no more be satisfied than the Grave.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis not only these demure impieties, and those that are devout
in wickedness, and act it in Religion and the Fear of God, I have to
speak against:</p>
                  <p>But in the general, If Fasting do not humble, and those severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that wear the Flesh break not the heart too and make it contrite,
then they are lost upon us, and do not profit us. All these strictnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of <hi>bodily</hi> and outward <hi>exercise,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, are acts of
discipline prescribed to make the Sorrows of Repentance more severe
and operative, and so to be the Correctives of the distempers of the
Soul, to quell the risings of the Appetite and Passions, and bring the
sensual part of us under obedience to Reason and Religion; to make
all calm and even in us, and put us in the frame of Men and Christians,
of Rational and Pious Creatures. And if they do not work this in us,
if the Soul do not meet in the performances, they are not acceptable
in themselves at all; These are only the <hi>mint anise</hi> and <hi>cummin</hi> of our
Pieties; and as <hi>Origen</hi> says, the <hi>condimenta actuum</hi> the sauces of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
not the main standing parts of it, which he therefore that offers
solitary gives God <hi>a Sacrifice of Sallads,</hi> and thinks that will be a Sin-Offering.
They do mistake themselves who cherish any hope from
having spent a day, or <hi>Lent</hi> of abstinence; if the Excesses of their Vices
be not made over, and evacuated by it; if they continue still full
gorg'd with their iniquity; or who think all is well, they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd
by having bowed down the head like a bulrush; if the Soul were
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40114:184"/>
not also humbled in them; for as S. <hi>Paul</hi> does say, <hi>I may give all my
goods to feed the poor, yet have no Charity,</hi> and <hi>I may give my body to
be burnt,</hi> yet in those <hi>Martyr-fires</hi> there may be no heats of Love to
God, and then all these profit me nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 3. So I may
chasten my self too, and yet yet receive correction or be disciplin'd, and
then Gods punishments are still due to me.</p>
                  <p>That Church indeed which hath found out the easie expiation of
Indulgences, that hath the Treasure of Christ's merits and all the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogations
of the Saints at her dispose, and by Commission can issue
them at pleasure out, and apply those merits to mens uses not by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi>
but by a <hi>Bull</hi> or <hi>Brief,</hi> and not require <hi>Gospel conditions</hi> of
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> in the Persons that receive them, but <hi>visiting a
Church in</hi> Rome, <hi>ascending the steps in such a Chappel in the Lateran</hi>
on such a day, shall give a plenary remission from sin and punishment;
the saying of such a Prayer over daily shall do it for fourscore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years (could they but make a Lease for men to live and sin out
the indulgence too, that would get them good store of Chapmen) that
Church I say, may give encouragement to hope that God may be
compounded with at easie rates; that for a Surfeit I may give a Meal
and God will pardon it, and let me have Wine too into the bargain
(for they allow afflicting of our Souls in Wine) that some weeks change
of Dyet may go for a change of Life, for indeed these come up some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
nearer the just value than some of their Prices. But though
there be all the reason in the World they should let men out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
on what condition they please, when themselves onely put
them in, and make the breath of a few <hi>Pater noster</hi>'s quite blow out
those flames which burn no where but in their Doctrines: Yet when
without any commission from Christ they make <hi>Attrition</hi> able to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
men from <hi>Hell,</hi> and an <hi>Indulgence</hi> able to release them out of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory;</hi>
when they make <hi>new conditions of Pardon,</hi> that is <hi>new Gospel,
new ways of application of Christs Merits,</hi> and though our <hi>Saviour God</hi>
when he found in his heart to dye for us, yet in the Agonies of his
Compassion could not find in his heart to give us easier terms of Life
than such as do require <hi>Contrition, Humiliation,</hi> and <hi>Amendment,</hi> which
they commute so cheaply with his Vicar: We justly stand astonish'd
at such usurpation on <hi>Christ's Blood and Merits,</hi> that does assign them at
these rates.</p>
                  <p>I make no question but easie expiations get them many Converts.
<hi>Rome</hi> from its first foundation grew from being an <hi>Asylum</hi> to the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute;
but they that go away upon such hopes, 'tis to be feared that
easiness betrays them into sins from which those Expiations cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue
them, and at once makes them <hi>Proselytes</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> Nor
are our trusts much more secure, if we rely upon our <hi>opus operatum,</hi>
too, our little outward strictnesses, unless the Soul be engag'd, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
there be inward life of Religion, all those will not avail: If I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
my self my <hi>meals,</hi> and give my self my sins, that is so far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
that it aggravates: I am an argument against my self that my
crimes are incorrigible, when I will have them though I cut off the
Instruments and foments of them, and though I meddle not with the
Temptation, yet I seize the sin.</p>

reliance on it, I must transcribe the Copy of the Sufferings of that
Son, transplant the Garden of <hi>Gethsemane</hi> into my breast. If <hi>his Soul

O my Father let this Cup pass from me!</hi> The lustful Feavers of my

my riotous egestions have been; my Oaths that have struck through
the Name of God, must pierce my Soul with grief as pungent as his
Thorns and Nails. In a word, I must so <hi>afflict my Soul</hi> as to <hi>crucifie the
body of sin,</hi> and nail it to his Cross. And this is that which in its own

Secondly, What this Day was the Verse before the Text informs us,
it was their Day of Expiation or Atonement. Now that the <hi>Jews</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
Fasting and Humiliation expiatory Sacrifices, appears from a Form
of Prayer which even yet they use on such a day where he that fasted
says, <hi>O Lord the Governour of all the World, I have now finished my Fast
before thee, thou knowest that when we had a Temple standing, the man
that sinned was bound to expiate it by a Sacrifice, the Blood of which was
poured out, and the Altar consumed the Fat to make amends for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
but now by reason of our many wickednesses, we have neither a

O Lord my God the God of my Fathers, <hi>to accept of that little
portion of my own Flesh and Blood which this days Fasting hath torn from
me, in lieu of a Sin-offering, and be thou reconciled unto me for thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
sake.</hi> Thus when he cannot give a Lamb for his Transgression, he
gives some of himself, he offers <hi>Hunger</hi> for <hi>Shewbread,</hi> and <hi>Thirst</hi> for a
<hi>Drink-offering,</hi> he consecrates a <hi>Meal</hi> instead of a <hi>Beast,</hi> and sheds a
<hi>sower fasting sigh for Incense;</hi> and this he hopes God will accept as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.
And truly the Text says no day of Expiation could be kept
without it. Nor does the Scripture want great instances of its effect
towards Atonement of Gods wrath: How when Judgment was given
on a Nation or Person, and Execution going out against them, yet this
revers'd the Sentence; <hi>Ahab</hi> is a great proof of this, 1 <hi>King.</hi> xxi. 27.
<hi>And it came to pass when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his Clothes,
and put Sackcloth upon his flesh, and Fasted, and lay in Sackcloth and went
softly: And the word of the Lord came unto Elijah the Tishbite saying,
Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? Because he humbleth
himself before me I will not bring the evil in his days.</hi> On Fasting-day
secured a Life; the weaknesses it brought upon the body, upheld it
against all Gods threats, Vengeance pronounc'd and coming out against
him falls to ground if <hi>Ahab</hi> humble and <hi>afflict his Soul.</hi> Gods stretch'd
out Arm will not strike Sackcloth, nor wound through Fasting Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
One fit of it removes his Judgments a whole Age; and had
it been sincere and persevering, how had it wip'd them out to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingness?<note place="margin">Tertul. de pudicit. c. 13. &amp; de poenit. c. 10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ninive</hi> is another instance of the practice and success of this even
among the <hi>Heathens.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Nor should it seem to have less Efficacy among Christians: The
Primitive Fathers call these severities <hi>Satisfaction for sin,</hi> and <hi>Compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
the <hi>Price with which they are bought off,</hi> the <hi>things that cover
them,</hi> and <hi>blot them out,</hi> and which <hi>Propitiate and appease God for them;</hi>
not in their sense who force up these Expressions to a strange height of
meaning; and yet have quite beat down the Practice as to the publique
wholesom use of them out of the Church. But though these sayings
assign not the Power and just Efficacy of that discipline in it self,<note place="margin">Tertul. de Poenit. c. 6. Orig. Hom. 15. in Levit. Ambros. de Poenit. l. 2. c. 5.</note> yet
they do the acceptance and effect of it by virtue of Christs Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
A Fainting Body cannot bear indeed the weight of our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
nor will lowest prostrations in the dust bury them in the dust,
or Tears alone blot out our Guilt; but Christ having done that which
is effectual to all this,<note place="margin">Orig. Hom. 6. in Exod.</note> and requiring no more of thee to make that
thine (as he does every where most solemnly avow) but faithful hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of thy self in an afflictive sorrow for what's past,<note place="margin">Cyp. Ser. de Lapsis. Chrys. Hom. 41. ad pop. Antioch.</note> and so to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40114:186"/>
as to work out Repentance; the doing this is doing what he does
require, and consequently will accept: These satisfie the <hi>Command,</hi> and
therefore <hi>God,</hi> though not by a <hi>condignity of performance,</hi> yet as <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
which his <hi>Covenant of Grace hath set us,</hi> which when they are
fulfilled then God is satisfied, thy sins are expiated, and thou art par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned:
And so in this lower sense these are thy Satisfactions with which
God is well pleased.</p>
                  <p>And thus these self Afflictions of the Sinner supply Gods Indignation
and divert it; <hi>They leave no place nor business for it, and by these short
severities upon himself he does make void, he does expunge the Sentence
of eternal Torments,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian: As thou becomest severe against thy
self, so will the Lord abate of his severities, and he will spare, and he
will pity thee in that he sees thou wilt not spare thy self.</hi> How can he
choose but be appeased towards thee when he shall see thee executing
his Sentence even upon thy own self? and punishing his Enemies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be thy Members? so that by this means thou dost censure
thy self into Gods Absolutions, afflict thy self into his Pardons, and dost
condemn thy self into eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>Our Church says the same thing; <hi>That in the Primitive Church there
was a Godly Discipline; that at the beginning of Lent such Persons as were
notorious Sinners, were put to open Pennance, and punished in this World,
that their Souls might be saved in the Day of the Lord;</hi> and <hi>she does
wish</hi> (if her wishes be of any force and value when her Orders and
Constitutions are not) <hi>that Discipline could be restored.</hi> But this I
shall not press; if all those whom the Primitive Church Condemned,
or S. <hi>Paul</hi> sentenced were so used, if every Schismatick that lies tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself and others off from the Lords Body were rejected, and if
the Fornicator that joyns himself to his unclean Accomplice were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
from Christ, and not suffered to make <hi>his members be the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of an Harlot;</hi> if every scandalous debauching Offender that lies cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
Christs Body, spreading Contagion, thrusting the Gangreen for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
were <hi>cut off,</hi> and these and all the rest <hi>delivered up to Satan,</hi> alas
what part would Christ have left of his own Body? <hi>Sed illos defendit
numerus junctaeque umbone phalanges,</hi> and that I fear too in more senses
than the Poet means. Therefore I shall not urge the Churches Wish,
but onely see whether the Statute in the Text says any thing to this,
and whether the <hi>for ever</hi> do reach us: Which is my Third and last
Enquiry.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Divers of the <hi>Jews</hi> Rites are said to be, and be prescribed
<hi>for ever,</hi> although those very Rites and the whole oeconomy of their
Covenant were to be chang'd and cease; among other Reasons, <hi>as the
Fathers say,</hi> because they foresignifie and point at things in the new
Covenant, which were to last till Covenants and Rites shall be no more,
and so their meaning and signification was to be for ever.</p>
                  <p>Now truly that their Expiation Performances, those which I am up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
did so, the whole Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is employ'd to prove;
the Margin of your Bibles in this Chapter so refer you to the places,
that I shall not need to make it out. Christ did fulfill the Temple and
the Altar part, yea and the refuse outcast part of the Atonement satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Religion and the contempt of that days Offices, He was the
whole true Expiation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:40114:186"/>
Now does this Expiation as theirs did, require afflicting of the Soul
in its attendance, or was that but a Ceremony of their Rite? and
though a <hi>Jew</hi> must mourn and Fast to see his sin killing a Beast, and
when he does behold his wickedness eating up a Goat for a Sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he must deny himself his daily bread, and suffer thirst if his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
drink but the blood of Bullocks; yet when we behold ours em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
themselves in the Blood of the Son of God, not onely lay hands
and Confessions on his Head, but drive Thorns into it, make him cry
out, almost despair and Die; we need not be concern'd so much as to
do ought of that either in order to the better Celebration of that Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or on the very day of it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed if we consider most mens practices, it would appear most
probable that if we were to expiate our sins as the <hi>Jews</hi> did by sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
of our Flocks not of our <hi>Jesus,</hi> those satisfactions would more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
our Souls, and more restrain our Vices than that which was made
for us by the Death of Christ, and how can this be rectified, unless by
some severities upon our selves, we give our selves a piercing sense of
what our sin deserves, and grateful apprehensions of what our Surety
suffer'd for us? When in sad private earnest I have thought fit to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
my Soul with some austere mortifications, and when my fainting
Spirits are scarce able to sustain my Body that sinks under the load of
it self, then I may have some tender apprehensions of that weight
that sunk the Son of God, and 'twas my weight that he fell under. But
he that cannot think fit to revenge a year of follies and of Vices with
a few weeks severer life, sure thinks his Saviour suffered much in vain;
<hi>quorsum perditio haec?</hi> why must the Blood of God be paid for sin,
when I cannot afford a little self-denial for it? Why such great Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Holy <hi>Jesus,</hi> when I cannot find in my heart to bear a little
strictness for it?</p>
                  <p>But I could easily deduce (were I not to suppose it done before)
that sure as if the Church had thought a Statute had annext these two
for ever,<note place="margin">By Dr. <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> Paschal or Lent Fast.</note> they have been joyn'd from the beginnings of our Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
it was the Fast that did attend our Saviours sufferings that in part
caused the Contest about <hi>Easter,</hi> which <hi>Polycarpe</hi> S. <hi>John</hi>'s Disciple ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd;
and then there was a Fast so soon: and he that tells us this,
<hi>Irenaeus,</hi> Scholar to that <hi>Polycarpe,</hi> says some observ'd it <hi>many days,</hi> some
<hi>forty days</hi> also, if we can take the Antient <hi>Ruffinus</hi>'s authority but for
a Comma. And if the Antient Fathers do expound aright, Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
thought that men were interested so much in his Death, that they
would Fast by reason of it; <hi>When the Bridegroom is taken from them,
then shall they Fast in those days:</hi> Upon which words they say <hi>the Season
was determin'd to this Duty by the Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But they may say so, who knew how to persuade men to take up
restraints of strictest discipline and of severest Piety. But we cannot
engage them into Order or from Scandal; they made them <hi>fast,</hi> we
cannot make them <hi>temperate. Blessed Saviour!</hi> what kind of Christians
didst thou hope for thy Disciples, of whom thou wer't so confident they
would so concern themselves in thy Passion as to Fast because of it?
when in our times Christians will not be kept from their Excesses by it?
not in those days of Fasting which thy Primitive followers did Celebrate
with abstinencies, that did almost mortifie indeed and slay the Body of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40114:187"/>
Flesh as well as Sin, and we in imitation of them, in answer of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences,
will not abate a <hi>Meal,</hi> nor an <hi>intemperance,</hi> will <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>Riot</hi>
too, and make <hi>a Lent of Bacchanals:</hi> Thus we prepare load for thy
Day of <hi>Passion,</hi> sin on to add weight to thy Cross, and yet we our selves
will not be humbled under them. It is in vain to tell men thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectest
they should mortifie, that it will spirit their Repentance, for
they will have no kind of Penitence for sin, but such as will let them
return to sin again, suffer no discipline with which their Vices too can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consist, for they can scarce live if they make not themselves chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
with them, even in this time of Sadness, and in sight of the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
of thy sufferings for them.</p>
                  <p>Indeed when I consider how this Season is hodg'd in from Vice by
all Gods Indignation, <hi>threatned</hi> at <hi>first, suffered</hi> at <hi>last,</hi> pronounc'd in
<hi>Commination,</hi> executed in <hi>Passion: Ashwednesday</hi> gave us all Gods Curses
against Sinners, all which <hi>Good Friday</hi> shews inflicted on our Saviour.
Thus we began, <hi>Cursed are the Vnmerciful, the Fornicators, and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,
the Covetous persons, Worshippers of Images, Slanderers, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
and Extortioners;</hi> and we shall see <hi>the Son of God made this Curse</hi>
for them; yea we our selves said <hi>Amen</hi> to all, as testifying that that
Curse is due to all. When I consider this I say, I cannot choose but
be astonish'd to behold how men can break through all <hi>Gods Curses</hi>
and <hi>their own</hi> to get at Vice, first seal Gods Maledictions, then provoke
and incur them instantly, as if they lov'd and would commit a Rape
upon Perdition; as if because men have so long in <hi>Oaths beg'd God to
damn them,</hi> and he hath not done it yet, they would now do it in their
<hi>Prayers</hi> too; make their <hi>Devotions</hi> as well as <hi>Imprecations</hi> consign them
to the wrath of God. He that does <hi>love cursing</hi> thus in the <hi>Passive sense,</hi>
surely as <hi>David</hi> says, <hi>it shall come unto him, it shall be unto him as the
Garment that covereth him, it shall enter into his bowels like Water, and
like Oyl into his Bones, Psal.</hi> Cix. 17, 18, 19. And truly amongst those
things which we did Curse, there are that will fulfill all that most lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally;
the Riots of thy gaudy bravery that make thee gripe, extort,
spend thy own Wealth and other mens, undo thy self and Creditors,
be sordid and in Debt, meerly to furnish trappings to dress thy self for
others eyes and, may be, sins; these bring a Curse to cover thee as does
thy Garment, yea and they gird it to thee. The draughts of thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance
carry the malediction down into the Bowels like Water,
yea like the Wine into the very Spirits: There is another of them too
that will conveigh the Curse like Oil into the Bones, till it eat out the
marrow, and leave nothing but it self to dwell within them, yea till it
putrefie the Bones, till it prevent the Grave and Judgment too, while
the living Sinner invades the rottenness of the one, and torments of the
other; and then the <hi>Lents</hi> and <hi>abstinencies</hi> that the <hi>sin</hi> prescribes shall
be observed exactly, onely to qualifie them for more sin and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
may be at the best but to recover them from what it hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted;

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40114:187"/>
how disgustful soever, by the benefit of their Cure they excuse their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiveness,
and ingratiate the present injury they do the Flesh, by the
succeeding health they help thee to, and by the Death they do secure
thee from: Why sure (to omit, that the other have all these advantages,

his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and in them <hi>all Christians:</hi>
And they do easily divide themselves into two
parts. The</p>
                  <p>First is a <hi>positive</hi> part, wherein there is a state
of great and Blessed advantage, which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be in present possession of: In these words,
<hi>Ye are my Friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which there are <hi>two</hi> things that make up that advantage, 1. A
Relation, 2. The Person related to. <hi>Friends,</hi> and <hi>My Friends.</hi> The</p>
                  <p>Second is a <hi>Conditional</hi> part, wherein there are the <hi>terms,</hi> upon
which that Possession is made over, and which preserve the Right and
Title to them: in these words, <hi>If ye do whatsoever I command you:</hi> in
which there are <hi>two</hi> things required as <hi>Conditions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I. Obedience, <hi>If ye do what I command you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. That Obedience Universal; <hi>If ye do whatsoever I command
you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first thing that offers it self to our consideration, is the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a known common-place Truth, that a Friend is the most useful
thing that is in whatsoever state we are: It is the Soul of life, and of
content. If I be in prosperity: We know abundance not enjoy'd, is
but like <hi>Jewels</hi> in the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> useless while they are there: It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
nothing but the <hi>opinion of Prosperity.</hi> But 'tis not possible to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40114:189"/>
abundance otherwise than by <hi>communicating</hi> it: a man <hi>possesseth</hi> plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
onely <hi>in his Friends,</hi> and hath <hi>fruition</hi> of it meerly by <hi>bestowing</hi> it.
If I be in <hi>adversity;</hi> to have a person whom I may intrust a trouble to,
whose bosom is as open and as faithful to me, as 'tis to his own thoughts,
to which I may commit a swelling secret; this is in a good measure to
<hi>unlade,</hi> and to <hi>pour out</hi> my sorrow from me; thus I divide my grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
which would be insupportable, if I did not disburthen my self
of some part of them: Now there is no bosom so safe as that where
<hi>friendship</hi> lodges; take Gods Opinion in the case, <hi>Deut.</hi> xiii. 6. <hi>If thy
Brother the Son of thy Mother, or thy Son, or thy Daughter, or the Wife
of thy bosom, or thy Friend that is as thine own Soul.</hi> This is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
step in the Gradation; And there is all the reason in the World;
for though <hi>Parent</hi> and <hi>Child</hi> are as near one to other as any thing can
be to part of it self; <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> are but two different names of
the same one, yet these may become bitter and unkind: A <hi>Parent</hi> may
grow <hi>cross,</hi> or a <hi>Child refractory,</hi> a <hi>Mother</hi> may be like the <hi>Ostrich</hi> in
the Wilderness, throw off her <hi>bowels</hi> with her <hi>burthen;</hi> and an ungraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Son is <hi>constant pangs</hi> and <hi>travail</hi> to his <hi>Mother,</hi> his whole life gives
her <hi>after-throws</hi> which are most deadly: Dislikes also may rest within
the <hi>Marriage-Bed,</hi> and lay their heads upon two wedded Pillows; but
none of these unkindnesses can untie the Relation; that ends not where
the bitterness begins, he is a <hi>Parent</hi> still though froward, and a <hi>Child</hi>
though stubborn; but a <hi>true Friend</hi> can be nothing but <hi>kind;</hi> it does
include a <hi>dearness</hi> in its essence, which is so inseparable from it, that
they begin and end together: A man may be an <hi>Husband</hi> without <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi>
but cannot be a <hi>lover,</hi> that is a <hi>Friend,</hi> without <hi>loving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And sure to have no one <hi>Friend</hi> in this Life, no one that is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in any of my interests or me my self, none that hath any cares or
so much as good wishes for me, is a state of a most uncomfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.
The <hi>Plague</hi> that keeps Friends at a distance from me while I
live out of the sphere of my infection, and after gives me Death, hath
yet less of Malignity than this; that leaves me the Compassions, the
Prayers, all the solitary Comforts, all indeed but the outward entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of my Friends; that, though it shut the Door against all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
yet, puts a <hi>Lord have Mercy</hi> on the Door: But this I now described
hath none of that, hath no good wishes, nothing else but hate, is worse
than a <hi>perpetual Pestilence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet neither is this state so comfortless, in respect of this life, as not
to have a Friend in the concernments of the Life to come; none that
hath so much kindness for my <hi>Soul</hi> as every man hath for his <hi>Enemies
Beast,</hi> which if he see fallen in a Ditch he will at least give notice that
it may be help'd out thence: No one, that when a sin, like to that
<hi>Falling sickness</hi> in the Gospel (and it is such indeed without a Parable)
is <hi>casting me into the water,</hi> quenching my parts, my Reason, and the
Immortal spark within me; or <hi>throwing me into the Fire,</hi> raising Lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
heats within, which after will break out into Hell fires; none yet
that will stretch out his hand to catch me, or to pull me out: None
that does care to see me perish to Eternity, or that values my Soul,
which yet did cost the Blood of <hi>God,</hi> at a word speaking: This is to be
like <hi>Dives</hi> in the Flames, to whom they would not lend <hi>the help of the
tip of a finger,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke xvi. 24, 25.</note> or give the kindness of <hi>a drop of Water:</hi> I am as it were
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40114:189"/>
on the other side the <hi>Gulf</hi> already, Here is the use of Friendship, the
only noble one, that's worthy of that blessed quality: When I have one
that will be an <hi>assistant Conscience</hi> to me, who, when that within me
<hi>sleeps,</hi> or is <hi>benummed,</hi> will <hi>watch</hi> over my actions; will <hi>testifie</hi> them to
my Face, will be as faithful to me as the <hi>Conscience</hi> should be, hold a
Glass to my Soul, shew me the stains and the proud tumours, the foul
Ulcers that are there, and then will fret, and rub, or prick, lance, and
corrode, to cure those Tumours, and do off those spots, such an one is
<hi>a familiar Angel Guardian,</hi> is truly of that blessed Heavenly rank, and
onely less than the <hi>Friend</hi> in the Text, the <hi>Person</hi> related to, and my <hi>next</hi>
Part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Friends.</hi> There are <hi>three</hi> things from which men use to take the
measures of a <hi>Friend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, From the good things he bestows on them: He that thinks
to keep friendship alive onely with Air, that gives good words, but parts
with nothing, that entertains onely with Garbs and Civilities, is but the
<hi>pageant</hi> of a Friend: They that own having but <hi>one Soul,</hi> and seem to
clasp as if they would have but <hi>one Body</hi> too, cannot keep such <hi>distinct</hi>
and <hi>separate proprieties</hi> in other little things, as not to have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
one from the other. And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>friendship</hi> of these benefits is rated by the measures of
our <hi>need</hi> of them. When <hi>Midas</hi> was ready to die for hunger, his God
was kinder to him in a little bread, than in making all that he touch'd
turn into Gold: Great things engage but little where there is but little
use of them: And all these,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Are endeared by the <hi>Affection</hi> they are given with. Good
turns done with design, what need soever I have of them, are <hi>hire,</hi> and
not <hi>friendship;</hi> it is the kindness onely that obligeth, the gift without
the love does but upbraid and scorn my want.</p>
                  <p>Now to measure the <hi>Friend</hi> here in the Text, by these, were an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
undertaking, whose Friendship did exceed all bounds and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
I shall do no more towards it but read the words before my
Text, which were the occasion of it, <hi>Greater love hath no man than this,
that a man lay down his life for his Friends,</hi> and then it follows, <hi>Ye are
my Friends.</hi> The <hi>token</hi> therefore of his Friendship, the <hi>gift</hi> he gave
them was his <hi>life,</hi> rather that was the least he gave: He gave his <hi>glory</hi>
first, that so he might be qualified to give his life, for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 7. He <hi>lessened himself</hi> from the condition of being Lord of all,
into that of a Servant, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 9. being <hi>diminished, made
lower, meaner</hi> than his Creatures <hi>for the suffering of Death.</hi> Now with
the price of such Divine essential glory to buy onely a life, rather onely
a possibility of Death, that after he might give that life for us, and with
his Death purchase us an immortal life, is such a gift as no <hi>Romance</hi> of
friendship ever fancied or did aim at: We may have heard of two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
that would die for one another, that never quarrelled in their
lives, but for this, who should suffer first to save the other, and strave
onely for Execution: But for a Person of the <hi>Trinity</hi> to leave his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to come down to us; to dwell with Agonies that he might be at
one with us: and be tyed to the Cross, that he might be united to us;
this is a friendship fit for <hi>Ecstasies</hi> of <hi>apprehension.</hi> Of all the things that
court thy kindness here below, that spread snares, and lay baits for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40114:190"/>
thy friendship, if any bid so fair, so temptingly, if any will give such a
price, in Gods name let it have thy love, I shall not blame him that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth
his Affection there: But sure <hi>Heaven</hi> cannot give a greater gift
than this; for what can God give greater than himself? Yea I may say
God could not give so much, for he must be <hi>Man</hi> too, to give his <hi>life,</hi>
and this, saith he, <hi>he gave for his Friends,</hi> even in our stead, who must
have perish'd else eternally, which intimates the second thing, the <hi>need</hi>
we had of this.</p>
                  <p>A need great as the gift, necessity invincible, that could break into
Heaven, rifle the <hi>Trinity</hi> to serve it self, throw Death into those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of Immortality, and which would not be satisfied but with the
<hi>Blood of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now is not the kindness and the condescension of Friendship in
his expressions too, when he saith, <hi>greater love than this hath no man:</hi>
which was the third Endearment.</p>
                  <p>There never were such <hi>wounds</hi> of Love as those that tore this Heart;
never such meltings of Affection as dissolv'd this Lover into <hi>sweats of
Blood.</hi> There was no motive to all this, but his meer love: For all
this he designed to us <hi>before we were,</hi> and therefore sure <hi>before we were
deserving:</hi> And O our God! thou that from all Eternity didst lay
Contrivances to give thy Life for us, so to redeem, and then to glorifie
us; what were we then that thou shouldst do this for us? what were
we then when we were not? and yet that thou from the Abyss of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlastingness,
shouldst think thoughts of such kindness to us, and such
blessedness for us, who then <hi>were not,</hi> and <hi>deserved nothing;</hi> and who
since we were, <hi>have deserved nothing but Damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as there was no other motive to all this design but <hi>love,</hi> so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was there any thing but <hi>love</hi> in the fulfilling. Look on your <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
in the <hi>Garden,</hi> and upon Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and you shall find him
there in as great Agonies of <hi>Affection</hi> as <hi>Torment,</hi> and hanging down his
head upon the Cross with languishments of <hi>kindness</hi> more than <hi>weakness.</hi>
His Arms stretched out and rack'd, as if on purpose to the posture of
<hi>receiving you to his embraces,</hi> and his side opened not onely to <hi>shed
Blood</hi> for you, but to make you a <hi>passage to his very Heart.</hi> Look on
him offering up his Tears, his Prayers, and his Soul for Sin, and in the
midst of all, projecting happiness to you, as it were praying, O my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
here I charge my self with all the guilt of those my Friends, I thy
onely Son God, one with thee, am content to suffer Torments that they
all may be acquitted; Here I lay down my Life that they may have
eternal Life, let me be Crucified, so they be Glorified. Which was the
purchase and the gift of this his Passion to all his <hi>Friends,</hi> even to those
<hi>that do what he Commands;</hi> which is the first Condition that entitles to
his friendship, and my next Part.</p>
                  <p>Ye are my Friends if ye do what I command you.</p>
                  <p>I shall not urge, that Great men upon Earth will not take any to
their Friendship but upon these terms; nor will I plead the reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this in <hi>Christ,</hi> there being no cause why he should be a Friend to
any that will daily disoblige him and dishonour him: Nor will I press
the whole Oeconomy of Scripture, which says, all the advantages Christ
ever gave or meant us, and all the acts of Friendship that he ever did
for us were with this design. He gave his grace that brings salvation
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40114:190"/>
to save us into an estate of sober Vertue. <hi>Tit.</hi> ii. <hi>ver. 11, 12. He gave
himself</hi> also to Ransom us from our own evil doings, and to redeem us
into his Obedience, <hi>Tit.</hi> ii. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. Without which no dependance on
him will avail. <hi>Matth.</hi> vii. 21. He will own no acquaintance with, nor
services from them who have friendship with sin; though <hi>they have cast
out Devils in his Name,</hi> if they retain their Vices; though they <hi>do Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi>
if they do wickedly, he will bid them <hi>depart,</hi> profess <hi>he never
knew them,</hi> ver. 22, 23. He will not let such have a bare <hi>relation</hi> to
his Name, nor have the <hi>friendship of a Title, 2 Tim.</hi> ii. 19. All his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
also that he will give are promised to none other, but them that
<hi>do what he commands, Apoc.</hi> xxii. 14. that is, <hi>do Evangelically, heartily
and faithfully endeavour it,</hi> and do this with all diligence exprest by
words, that import all strife imaginable, as <hi>Running, Wrestling, Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Warring.</hi> And persevere also by <hi>patient continuance in well-doing,
Rom.</hi> ii. 7. and he hath nothing else but Vengeance for all others, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi>
i. 8. and we have neither <hi>Christ,</hi> nor <hi>Gospel,</hi> nor <hi>Religion,</hi> but with these
terms.</p>
                  <p>But I shall wave all this, and bound my self within the present words,
<hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his Life for his
Friends. Ye are my Friends if ye do what I command you.</hi> When Christ
is boasting of his <hi>love,</hi> making <hi>comparisons,</hi> and <hi>vying friendships</hi> with
mankind, nay more, contriving heights and depths of Mercy, such as
Man hath no comprehension, nor fathom for; when he was preparing
to do an act of compassion almost <hi>equal to his Divinity,</hi> when he had
resolutions of so much kindness as to give his life that he might shew
kindness. Yet could he not then find in his heart to offer or declare
one jot of kindness to the men that <hi>will not do what he commands,</hi> but
in the midst of such Agonies of <hi>compassion,</hi> he thought of nothing but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
indignation</hi> and <hi>eternal vengeance</hi> to the disobedient. <hi>I have but
now given my Body and my Blood even to the Traitor</hi> Judas,<note place="margin">Luc. xxii. 19, 20, 21. John vi. 70. Rom. v. 10. John iii. 16, 17, &amp; 6. 51. &amp; 2 Cor. v. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>to one who is
a Devil: I am going to give my life even for my Enemies, for the World:
But I will give no love to any, have no friendship with any but the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous:</hi>
no, though they be my own Disciples, <hi>ye are my Friends, ye</hi> my
<hi>Companions</hi> and <hi>Apostles are my Friends,</hi> onely on this condition, <hi>if ye
do what I command you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then is it not matter of Astonishment, to see men fancy they
have a right in all Christ's Actions and Sufferings, presume upon his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and their own happy condition, though they do nothing, or but
very little towards this, and the main of their life be disobedience, as if
all <hi>Christ's Commands,</hi> appointed them to do <hi>no commands,</hi> and <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
were but a <hi>liberty</hi> from <hi>virtue?</hi> To pass by those that do nothing
but Evil, that which the Devil does suggest, or their flesh dictate, and
to consider the Demurer sort of Christians, that pretend a respect to
Christ, and to Religion, and see what <hi>they</hi> will do.</p>
                  <p>Why sometimes you may find them troubled at their Vices and
themselves; and those troubles breath out in <hi>Sighs,</hi> and in <hi>warm wishes</hi>
that they could do that which Christ prescribes; to <hi>will</hi> is sometimes
strongly present with them, but to <hi>perform</hi> they know not how. Alas
Christ does not tell you that you are his <hi>Friends,</hi> if you <hi>wish well</hi> to
him, and his <hi>Commands,</hi> but he requires that you shall <hi>do them.</hi> These
are but vapours of a troubled Soul, which howsoever they may chance
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40114:191"/>
rise warm, catch a strong suddain heat, breath up in flashing thoughts.
They are but <hi>Meteors,</hi> little shooting flames that onely do <hi>catch fire</hi>
and <hi>fall</hi> and <hi>die;</hi> shew fair, but they warm nothing: And so these
thoughts do never, heat the Heart into <hi>Devotions</hi> and <hi>holy resolutions,</hi> the
fire is not strong nor does it live enough, to melt and work away the
filthinesses of the Soul: No, though they grow to <hi>aversations;</hi> For
you may find such men, when wearied with the pursuit of their sins,
<hi>hating</hi> their customs, and the engagements to the practice of them;
complaining thus, <hi>I know 'tis ill, and 'tis against my heart, that I obey
the motions of my passions or Lusts: The incitations of my Appetite, the
usance of the World, the Obligations of Civility or mistaken honour do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
prevail upon me, but 'tis with great reluctancy of mind that I yield
to them, but I cannot avoid it.</hi> There are not few that satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with this condition. Now sure Christ does not say, <hi>Ye cannot be
my Friends</hi> except you <hi>sin against me and against your Knowledg,</hi> and your
<hi>Consciences</hi> too. 'Tis strange that men should think the Heathen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of a Witch that cryed,
<q>
                        <l>—Video meliora, proboque,</l>
                        <l>Deteriora sequor—</l>
                     </q>
I know, and do approve of better things, but cannot choose but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
these that are the worser) strange, that this <hi>Fury</hi> that had the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
for Familiar,</hi> should make <hi>Christ a friend;</hi> that this should be the
state of <hi>Gospel Saints,</hi> and of <hi>Gods favourites.</hi> 'Tis possible some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
go yet further to good purposes towards <hi>Obedience,</hi> and have <hi>holy
Intentions,</hi> but this is not sufficient neither, if to <hi>do</hi> his Commands be
necessary: for to purpose and intend to do them, is not certainly to do
them. Yet where are any that do aim at doing any more? and there is
none of these but does presume upon his interest in Christ, and satisfies
himself and is secure.</p>
                  <p>Yet is it hard to find a ground of this their confidence, unless it rise
from the unhappy use they make of Gods <hi>preserving Mercies,</hi> and his
kindness to them in the concernments of this life. They see without
their cares, and upon very weak intreaties indeed, against all provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
both of God and danger; yet his protections secure them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they neither mind the asking them, nor mind the walking wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of them. The man whose Sins, not Prayers, prepare him for his
Bed, he sleeps well: perhaps more soundly than he who at his Bedside
throws himself on his face into Gods Arms, and there bequeaths himself
to the Securities of the Almighty: And he, whose Sleeps onely refresh
him for returns to Sin, does often live as long, as safely, and as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
as he that daily most Religiously does beg Protections from above.
And others that afford the Lord some <hi>little homages,</hi> themselves some
<hi>Prayers</hi> when their pleasures or occasions permit, God hath a care of
them, and their <hi>desires flow</hi> into them, all does succeed well with them.
Now they take confidence hence to conclude, these are the Tokens of
Gods <hi>friendship,</hi> and all his mercies will come in at the like easie rates;
that such <hi>a short Petition</hi> as committed them to the refreshments of the
<hi>night,</hi> and after which they wak'd into renewed strengths and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
<hi>such another</hi> shall lay them down in safety, to the sleeps of that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40114:191"/>
                     <hi>long night,</hi> that afterwards will break in <hi>happy Resurrection:</hi> For why?
God will not sure fail his own mercies, but be as friendly to their
Souls as he is to their Bodies.</p>
                  <p>And thus God's Preservations here, in meer defiance of our provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which are the <hi>arts of his long-suffering,</hi> his <hi>strivings</hi> of Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
meerly to give us opportunities of being reconciled to him, and to
<hi>invite</hi> us to be so, while we make them occasions of carelesness and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
they are so far from being pledges of his <hi>Friendship,</hi> that they have
all the aggravations of affornted goodness, become <hi>Temptations</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Ruin! 'Twere fine indeed it Christ's eternal preparations for
his Friends, would come in to us, without care or doing any thing, as
an accession to our pleasures; if when we had lived many years as in a
<hi>Garden,</hi> our days all <hi>flower'd</hi> with delight; we might expire into <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi>
and in soft Airs of Musick breath into <hi>Hallelujah</hi>'s But alas!
the smooth <hi>easie way</hi> leads <hi>down the Hill,</hi> and he must strive and <hi>pant</hi>
that will get <hi>up</hi> into the Mansions and the Bosom of his Saviour, and
whosoever will be <hi>his Friend,</hi> must <hi>do that he commands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But is there nothing less indeed will qualify? The Scripture saith,
<hi>that Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for Righteousness,
and he was called the Friend of God, James</hi> ii. 23. and then, is Christ
more inaccessible, and <hi>harder</hi> to be made a <hi>Friend?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why, truly <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> both are so much <hi>Friends</hi> to all <hi>true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi>
that the Life of Christ was given for them; <hi>for, God so loved
the World that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
in him should not perish, but have everlasting life, John</hi> iii. 16. Nor are
there any qualities more signally peculiar to <hi>friendship,</hi> more engaging
than confidence and trust, dependance and relying, embosoming my
self in him: Now these are but the exercise of Faith; and 'tis most
certain if we heartily endeavour to do what he commands, there is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
then for all this work of <hi>Faith,</hi> place for its applications and
assurances. My Text does make this good. But when his friendship
is made over on Conditions, as 'tis not onely in these words, but every
where in Scripture; (there being not one Promise absolute that does
concern <hi>Gods favour, justification,</hi> and <hi>eternal Life:</hi> he does not once
offer Remission of sins, but to those that amend their Lives; nay, does
express as if he could not give it otherwise, <hi>peradventure they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
that I may forgive them, Jer.</hi> xxxvi. 3.) The Promises therefore
being conditional, Faith must be answerable to the Promises that it does
rest on and apply; and at the most, can be but <hi>an assurance that you shall
be partaker of what's promised,</hi> that is to say, partaker of the <hi>favour</hi> and
the <hi>life of Christ, if ye do his Commands.</hi> But then if I perform not this
Condition, to trust upon his friendship which I am not qualified for;
to think by Faith to receive a Pardon, which in that case I am, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
offered me; to apply to my self Promises which were never made
me, for none were ever made to them that do <hi>not do:</hi> and to assure my
self Christ will transgress his everlasting Covenant for my Vices sake,
meerly to give me leave to enjoy my sins; will do that which <hi>God may
not do, forgive</hi> one that <hi>will not repent:</hi> If I believe thus against Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and against Decree, am confident whether Christ <hi>will or no,</hi> and
will <hi>rely</hi> upon him in <hi>despite of him,</hi> if such a faith will make us friends,
affronts do reconcile. This is indeed <hi>to lay violent hands on his favour,</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:40114:192"/>
and to invade his friendship, and without Metaphor, <hi>take Heaven by
force.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But sure I am, that this is not the Faith made <hi>Abraham</hi> be called the
<hi>friend of God</hi> in that place of S. <hi>James,</hi> but <hi>a Faith that was perfected
by doing, ver.</hi> 22. of that Chapter, a Faith that made him <hi>offer up his
onely Son upon the Altar, ver.</hi> 21. 'Tis true, <hi>he did in hope believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all hope, Rom.</hi> iv. 18. So that his faith was stronger than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
but yet his resolutions of obedience seem stronger than his
faith; for he did that even to the cutting of the grounds of all his
faith, and hope. He trusted God would make his Promise good to
him, make <hi>all the Nations of the Earth be blessed in the seed of Isaac;</hi>
though <hi>Isaac</hi> had no seed, nor could have, if he should be slain: And he
resolved at Gods command himself to slay that <hi>Isaac,</hi> so to make him
have no seed. His Faith indeed did not despute the great impossibility;
but his obedience caused it. He did not question, how can God perform
with me when I have offered up my Son? I cannot look that a large
<hi>Progeny</hi> should rise out of the Ashes on the Altar; nor will those Flames
that devour all my Seed at once, make my <hi>seed numerous, lasting</hi> and
<hi>glorious as the Stars in Heaven,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. xv. 5.</note> which he promised me: But much less
did he question, why should I obey in this? He that does his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
can but expect what he hath promised; but if I should do this
Command and slay my Son, I make his Promise void, and destroy my
own expectations: And if I disobey I can but suffer what he bids me
do; my own obedience will execute all that his Indignation would
threaten to my disobedience.<note place="margin">Gen. xxii. 4.</note> Though <hi>Abraham</hi> had <hi>three days time</hi>
and journey to the Altar, that Nature might have leisure the mean while
to reason with the Precept thus, and his Affection might struggle with
his Duty; yet he goes on, resolves to tear out his own Bowels, and
cut off his hopes, will Sacrifice his <hi>onely Son,</hi> and Sacrifice <hi>Gods Promises
to his Commands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then, he that will trust to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s example of <hi>believing,</hi> yet
will not follow him at all in <hi>doing,</hi> will obey no Commands; that is
so far from offering up an <hi>onely Son,</hi> he will not slay an <hi>onely evil Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,</hi>
nor part with <hi>one</hi> out of the <hi>herd</hi> of all his vicious Habits; will
not give up the satisfaction to any of his <hi>carnal, worldly,</hi> or <hi>ambitious</hi>
appetites; not sacrifice a Passion or a lust to all the Obligations that
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> can urge him with, he hath, nor <hi>faith,</hi> nor <hi>friendship,</hi>
no, nor <hi>forehead.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, he that hath <hi>Abraham's faith</hi> may
well assure himself he is <hi>Christs Friend;</hi> but 'tis onely on this account,
because he that believes as <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, he will not stick to <hi>do
whatever Christ commands;</hi> which is that universality of obedience, that
is the <hi>next</hi> condition that entitles to Christs friendship, and my <hi>last</hi>
Part.</p>
                  <q>Ye are my Friends if ye do whatsoever I Command you.</q>
                  <p>There is no quality so necessary to a Friend, or so appropriate to
friendship, as <hi>sincerity.</hi> They that have but one Soul, they can have no
reserves from one another: But disobedience to one Precept, is inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with sincerity, that hath <hi>respect unto all the Commandments;</hi> and
he that will not do whatever Christ prescribes, hath reserves of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for some <hi>darling sin,</hi> and is false to his Saviour. He is an <hi>Enemy</hi>
indeed, so that there is no friendship on either side. S. <hi>Paul</hi> says so
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40114:192"/>
of any of one kind; <hi>the minding of the flesh,</hi> saith he, whether it be
providing for the Belly, or any other of the Organs of Carnality, is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate,
incurable Rebellion:</hi> Now such a Rebel, is, we know,<note place="margin">Rom. viii. 7.</note> the worst
of Enemies. S. <hi>James</hi> does say as much of any of those vicious affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are set on the World: <hi>Whosoever will be a friend of the World,
is an Enemy of God, James</hi> iv. 4. And he calls them <hi>adulteresses</hi> and
<hi>Adulterers,</hi> who think to joyn great strict Religion to some little by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love
of an Honour, or a profit of this World. Such Men are like a
Wife, that not contented with the partner of her Bed, takes in another
now and then, she must not count her self her Husbands Friend, though
she give him the greatest share in her affections; no, she is but a <hi>bosom
Enemy:</hi> And so any one Vice allowed is a <hi>paramour sin,</hi> is whoredom
against Christ, and our pretended friendship to him in all other <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi>
is but the <hi>kindness</hi> and the <hi>caresses</hi> of an <hi>Adulteress,</hi> the meer hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
and treachery of love. If it be necessary to the gaining Christ's
<hi>friendship,</hi> that thou <hi>do his Commands,</hi> 'tis necessary that thou <hi>do them all,</hi>
that thou divorce thy self from thy beloved sin, as well as any other:
Because his Friendship does no more require other obedience than it
does that, but is as inconsistent with thy own peculiar Vice as with the
rest. Indeed it is impossible that it should bear with any, they being
all his murderers. If thou canst find one sin that had no hand in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Christ to Death, <hi>one</hi> Vice that did not come into the <hi>garden,</hi> nor
upon <hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> that did not help to <hi>assassin</hi> thy Saviour, even
take thy fill of <hi>that:</hi> But if each had a stab at him, if <hi>no one</hi> of thy
Vices could have been <hi>forgiven,</hi> had not thy <hi>Jesus died</hi> for it, canst
thou expect he should have kindness for his Agony, or friendship for
the man that entertains his <hi>Crucifiers</hi> in his heart? If <hi>worldly cares</hi> which
he calls <hi>Thorns,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. xiii. 22.</note> fill thy head with Contrivances of Wealth and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
of filling Coffers, and of platting Coronets for thee, as the <hi>thorns</hi>

<hi>these</hi> in his bosom, to gore his Heart as they did pierce his Head? If
thou delight in that intemperance, which filled his deadly <hi>Cup,</hi> which
Vomited <hi>Gall</hi> into it, can he delight in thee?<note place="margin">Matth. xxvi. 38, 39.</note> That <hi>Cup</hi> which made
him fall upon his face to deprecate, will he partake in as the pledge
of mutual love? He that sunk under, could not bear this <hi>load</hi> of thine,
when it was in his <hi>Cross</hi> upon his <hi>shoulders,</hi> will he bear it and thee
in his Arms, when thou fallest under it? When thou wilt <hi>cast a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
spewing on his glory</hi> too, if he own <hi>such</hi> a Friend? Thou that art
so familiar with his Name, as thou wer't more his Friend than any in
the World, whose Oaths and imprecations, <hi>Moses</hi> says,<note place="margin">Levit. xxiv. 16. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>strike through
that Name,</hi> which they so often call upon, thou mayst as well think
his Heart did attract the Spear that pierced it, and the Wound close
upon its head with Unions of Love, as that he hath kindness for thee.
If Christ may make Friendship with him, that does allow himself a sin,
he may have <hi>fellowship with Belial:</hi> For him to dwell in any heart that
cherisheth a Vice, were to <hi>descend to Hell again.</hi> But as far as those
Regions of Darkness are from his Habitation of Glory, and the Black
Spirits of that place from being any of his Guard of holy Myriads; so
for is he from <hi>dwelling with,</hi> or being <hi>friend</hi> to him, that is a friend to
any wickedness, to him that <hi>will not do whatever he commands.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:40114:193"/>
And now if these Conditions seem <hi>hard,</hi> if any do not care to be
his Friend upon these terms, they may betake themselves to others.
Let such make themselves friends of the <hi>Mammon of unrighteousness:</hi>
A Friend indeed that hath not so much of the <hi>insincerities</hi> as many
great ones have: For this will furnish them with all that <hi>heart</hi> or <hi>lust</hi>
can wish for, all that <hi>necessity</hi> or <hi>wantonness</hi> proposeth to it self to dress
out <hi>pomp</hi> or <hi>Vice:</hi> But yet when with enjoyment the affections grow,
and become so unquiet, work them so, as not to let their thoughts
or actions rest, make them quicken themselves, and like the motions
of all things that go downwards tending to the Earth, increase by the
continuance, grow stronger, and more violent towards the end, then
when they are most passionate, it fails them: And having filled their
life with most unsatisfied tormenting cares, it leaves them <hi>nothing</hi> but
the <hi>guilt of all:</hi> When their great Wealth shall shrink into a <hi>single
sheet,</hi> no more of it be left, but a thin shroud, and all their vast In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances
but <hi>six foot</hi> of Earth, be gone, yet the <hi>iniquity of all</hi> will
stick close to them; and this false Friend, that does it Self forsake
them, will neither <hi>go along,<note place="margin">Psal. xiix. 17.</note> nor will let its pomp follow them,</hi> raises a
<hi>cry</hi> on them as high as <hi>Gods Tribunal;</hi> the <hi>cry</hi> of all the <hi>Blood,</hi> all
the <hi>oppressed rights</hi> that bribery till then had stifled, the groans of all
those <hi>Poor</hi> that <hi>greatness, covetousness,</hi> or <hi>extortion</hi> had groun'd or
crush'd; the yellings of those <hi>Souls</hi> that were <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>arv'd</hi> for want of the
Bread of life, which yet they payed for, and the price of it made those
heaps which will that day appear against their <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Masters,</hi> and
prove their <hi>Adversaries to eternal Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let others joy in Friends that Wine does get them; such as have
no qualification to endear them, but this, that they will not refuse to
sin and to be sick with their Companions: Men that do onely drink
in their affections, as full of <hi>friendship</hi> as of <hi>liquor,</hi> and probably they
do unload themselves of <hi>both at once,</hi> part with their <hi>dearness</hi> and their
<hi>drink together</hi> and alike. I know not whether in be heats of mutual
kindness that inflame these draughts, and the desires of them, so as if
they did drink thirst; but sure I am, that these <hi>hot draughts</hi> begin the
<hi>Lake of fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let others please themselves in an affection that <hi>Carnality</hi> cements.
These are warm friendships I confess, but <hi>Solomon</hi> will tell us <hi>whence</hi>
they have their <hi>heat.</hi> Her house,<note place="margin">Prov. vii. 27.</note> saith he, <hi>doth open into Hell,</hi> and
<hi>Brimstone</hi> kindles those libidinous flames. There are <hi>strait bands, fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
in those affections indeed; for the same Wiseman says, <hi>The Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets
of that sinner are the Chambers of Death:<note place="margin">Prov. ii. 19.</note> That none that go unto
her return again, or take hold of the paths of life;</hi> it seems she is a
friend that takes most <hi>irreversible dead hold,</hi> she is not onely as <hi>insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate,</hi>
but as <hi>inexotable</hi> as the <hi>Grave,</hi> and the Eternal Chains of <hi>Fate</hi>
are in those her <hi>Embraces.</hi> But God keep us from making such strict
<hi>Covenants with Death;</hi> from being at <hi>friendship with Hell;</hi> or in a word,
that I say all at once, with any that are <hi>good Companions</hi> onely in <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Such men having no virtue in themselves, must needs hate it
in others, as being a reproach to them, and therefore they are still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging
it, using all arts and stratagems to undermine it: and having
nothing else to recommend them in mens affections, but their <hi>mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
of Vice,</hi> no way to Merit but by serving <hi>iniquity,</hi> they not onely
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40114:193"/>
comply with our own evil Inclinations, that so they may be grateful,
and insinuate into us, but they provoke too and inflame those tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that they may be more useful to us, having no other means to work
their ends. And then such friends by the same reason, must be <hi>false</hi>
and <hi>treacherous,</hi> and all that we declaim at, and abhor in Enemies, when
that shall be the way to serve their ends; because they have no Virtue
to engage them to be otherwise: And to be such, is to be constant to
their own designs, their dispositions and usances. These are the <hi>Pests</hi>
of all Societies, they speak and live <hi>infection,</hi> and friendship with them
is to couple with the <hi>Plague.</hi> These do <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> what the
<hi>Devil</hi> but <hi>began</hi> in <hi>Eden:</hi> Nurse up <hi>Original sin,</hi> chase inclination into
appetite and habit, suggest and raise desires, and then feed them into
Constitution and Nature: In a word, are a <hi>brood</hi> of those <hi>Serpents,</hi> one
of which was enough to destroy Paradise and Innocence. 'Tis true, a
man would think these were our Friends indeed, that venture to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henna</hi>
for us: Alas they are but more <hi>familiar Devils,</hi> work under Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
to bring us to Torments, and differ nothing from him, but that
they draw us into them, and he inflicts them. And when sinful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
come home in Ruine, and pleasures die into Damnation; then men
will understand these treacherous loves, and find such Friends are but
<hi>projectours</hi> for the Devil; then they will hate them as they do their
own Damnation, discerning these are but the kindnesses of Hell. Nay
it is possible, I may slander that place in speaking so ill of it. <hi>Dives</hi>
will let us see there are affections of a kinder and more blessed strain in
Hell, <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. from the twenty seventh Verse; you find he did make
truce with Torments, that he might contrive and beg onely a message
of Repentance for his Brethren; he did not mind at all his own dire
Agonies, he minded so the reformation of his Friends. Good God!
when I reflect upon these <hi>pieties</hi> of the Damn'd, together with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of those who have given their names in to <hi>Religion,</hi> when I see
Fiends in Hell do study how to make Men <hi>virtuous,</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth with all their art debauch them into <hi>vice</hi> and ruine; I cannot
choose but pray, <hi>Grant me such Friends as are in Hell.</hi> Rather grant
us all the <hi>Friendship</hi> in the Text. But then, we must have none with
any Vice. Friendship with that, engageth into Enmity with <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Christ</hi> I shew'd you. And to pass over all those after-retributions of
Vengeance Christ hath studied for his Enemies, when he, that now
courts us to be our Friend and we will make our <hi>Adversary,</hi> must be
our <hi>Judg:</hi> For were there none of this, and should we look no further
than this life; yet sure we of this Nation know, what it is to have
God our Enemy; who for so many years lay under such inflictions, as
had much of the character of his <hi>last execution;</hi> they had the <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
and the <hi>Confusion,</hi> the <hi>dire Guilts,</hi> and the <hi>black Calamities,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
the <hi>Despair</hi> and <hi>Irrecoverableness</hi> of those in <hi>Hell.</hi> And though
He be at Peace with us at present, at least there is a Truce; yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you in the presence and the fear of God, to think in earnest, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the present provocations of this Nation do not <hi>equal</hi> those that
twenty years ago engaged him into Arms against us, and made him
dash us so in pieces: Whether those Actions of the Clergy be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that made the People to abhor their <hi>Function</hi> and their <hi>Service,</hi> the
<hi>Offerings</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Lord, and made God himself spew them
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40114:194"/>
out. 'Twere endless to go on the <hi>prophaneness,</hi> to the <hi>loose impieties</hi>
and the bold <hi>Atheisms</hi> of the <hi>Laity,</hi> especially of the <hi>better sort;</hi> in
short, what one degree, or state or Sex is better? Sure I am, if we are
not better, we are worse beyond expression or recovery: who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
every method, and conquer'd all God's Arts of doing good upon
us, been too hard for his Judgments and his Mercies both.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, when we lay gasping under his severe Revenges, we then
pretended to be humbled, begg'd to be reconciled and be at peace with
him, and vow'd to his Conditions, promising obedience, and aliened our
selves from our old sins, his Foes. But then, when Christ came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this Amity, came drest with all his Courtship, brought all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations
of Love along, our <hi>Prince</hi> and our <hi>Religion,</hi> our <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>State, Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Beauty of Holiness,</hi> every thing
that might make us be an Happy and a Pious Nation, thus he did
tempt and labour to engage that Friendship which we offered him and
vowed to him: And we no sooner seiz'd all this, but we break resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as well as duty, to get loose from him; and laden with the
spoyls of our defeated Saviour's goodness, we joyn hands with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
resume our old acquaintant-sins, enrich and serve them with his
Bounties, make appear that we onely drew him in, to work such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
but to assist our <hi>Worldliness, Ambitions</hi> and <hi>Lusts,</hi> to be our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of Vice and provocation of him. And being thus affronted
and refused, his Enemy preferr'd, <hi>not this God, but Barrabas,</hi> any the
vilest thing for Friend, rather than Christ, must he not needs be more
our Enemy than heretofore? And if he be, that question will concern
us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. x. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Are we stronger than God?</hi> It should behove us not to fall out with
him till we are. See how he does prepare himself for the Encounter,

vindicative Justice, <hi>as a Breastplate;</hi> and, <hi>his Wrath sharpening as a
Sword;</hi> and, <hi>arming all the Creatures</hi> for Auxiliaries. Alas! when <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence</hi>
does express it self as scarcely strong enough for Execution,
but <hi>Almightiness</hi> will be armed also for Vengeance, will assume <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,</hi>
call in <hi>Aids</hi> for fury, who shall stand it? Will our Friends, think
you, keep it off us, and secure us? did we consider how uneasie God
accounts himself, till he begin the Storm, while he keeps off his <hi>Plagues</hi>
from overrunning such a Land, we would expect them every moment,
and they must come.<note place="margin">Isa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God can have <hi>no ease</hi> but in our <hi>ruine,</hi> if he does hunger and thirst
after it, go to his Vengeance as to a Feast? And if you read the 25th
Chapter of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> you will find there a rich Bill of <hi>Fare,</hi> which his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
upon his Enemies does make; view the sixth Verse. He that

And if the vicious Friendships of the World have so much more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
than Christ's love and favour, and the happy consequences of
it, as to counterpoise all the danger of such enmity, you may joyn
hands with them: But if His be the safer and more advantageous, then
hearken to his Propositions and beseechings; for He does beg it of you:

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Words are part of a Debate which God had
with the sinful House of <hi>Israel,</hi> in which there are
<hi>three</hi> things offer themselves to be considered.</p>
                  <p>First, The Sinners <hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>Choice:</hi> He will
<hi>Die;</hi> That's his End, yea, 'tis his Resolution, he
<hi>will die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods inquiry for the Ground of
this, he seems astonished at the Resolution; and
therefore reasons with them about this their so
mad choice, and questions <hi>Why will ye dye?</hi> Which words are also,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The debate of his Affections, the reasoning of his Bowels,
and a most passionate Expostulation with them on account of that their
Resolution, <hi>Why will ye dye?</hi> which as it is addrest by God directly
to the House of <hi>Israel,</hi> so it would fit a Nation perverse, as that; which
mutinies against Miracles and Mercies, is false to God, Religion, and
their own Interests; led by a Spirit of <hi>giddiness</hi> and <hi>frenzy,</hi> unsteddy
in all things but resolutions of Ruine, that would tear open their old
Wounds, to let out Life, and they will dye. And though the Lord
be pleased to work new prodigies of mercy for us, and to say unto us
in despite of all our Enemies both Forein and Domestick, <hi>Live:</hi> The
use we make of all is onely to debauch the Miracles, and make Gods
Mercies help to fill the measure of our Judgments; live as if we would
try all the ways to Ruine; and since God will <hi>thus deliver</hi> us from
dangers, we would call for them some other way. But to prescribe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40114:196"/>
to these is above the attempt of my endeavours: May the blessed Spirit
of Wisdom and Understanding, the Spirit of Holiness and Peace, and
Order, breath on their Counsels whom this is committed to. I shall
bend my Discourse to the Conviction of Sinners in particular, and
treat upon the words as if they had been spoke to us under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
                  <p>The first thing which my Text and God supposeth, is the Sinners Fate
and Choice: He <hi>will dye.</hi> Even the <hi>second Death,</hi> for <hi>it is appointed for
all men once to dye, and then cometh the Judgment</hi> which shall sentence
him to another death that is immortal, in which he and his misery must
live for ever; that is, he must die everlastingly: Such is first his <hi>Fate.</hi>

                  <p>That <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> are of so <hi>near,</hi> so complicated a relation, as that
though they were Twins, the birth and Issue of one Womb and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet they are also one anothers Off-spring, and beget each other,
while <hi>Sin bringeth forth Death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">James 1. 15.</note> as S. <hi>James</hi> saith, and is the Parent of
Perdition,<note place="margin">2 Thess. xi. 3.</note> and yet the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> is the <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith,
and Iniquity is but destruction's birth, onely itself derived. And
that this Death and Perdition is Eternal in the most sad sense of the
word there are a thousand Texts that say. This is the Message of God
in the mouth and Blood of his Son, who useth all the artifice of Words
affirmative, and negative, to tell us so, as if on purpose to preclude all
doubt and <hi>subterfuge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. xxv. 41, 46.</note> calls it <hi>Eternal fire,</hi> and <hi>Eternal punishment, where
their worm dieth not,<note place="margin">Mark ix. 43, 44.</note> their fire is not quenched, Torment for ever and ever,</hi>
and the like. Your Faith and certainty of which is as strong as your
Christianity,<note place="margin">Rev. xiv. 10, 11.</note> and therefore by attempting any farther proof of this, to
imply there is reason and necessity for doing so, were to suppose my
Hearers Infidels.</p>
                  <p>But then this being granted that such is the Sinners <hi>Fate</hi> to lay down
positively that it is his <hi>Choyce,</hi> and that he doth resolve for Death, is to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them worse than Infidels, more than irrational and brutish; Beasts
cannot so desire against the possibilities of Appetite, break all the forces
and instincts of Nature, as to <hi>will destruction,</hi> and <hi>choose misery.</hi> Yet
that the Sinner does so is the ground of Gods Expostulation here, <hi>Why
will you dye?<note place="margin">Psal. xxxiv. 12.</note> David</hi> enquires as if it were a Prodigy to find, <hi>What man
is he that lusteth to Live?</hi> And sure the <hi>vicious</hi> man does not, for <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
that is <hi>Virtue,</hi> says, <hi>He that sinneth against me woundeth his own Soul,
and all they that hate me love death, Prov.</hi> viii. 36. And 'tis most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that they who eagerly, and out of vehement affection pursue and
seize those things to which they know destruction is annex'd insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
they love and choose destruction, though not for it self, yet for
the sake of that to which it clings. He that is certain such a Potion,
howsoever sweetned and made palatable, is compounded with the juice
of deadly Nightshade, if notwithstanding he will have the Poisonous
draught, it is apparent he resolves to dye.</p>
                  <p>And that I may evince this is a setled obstinate incorrigible resolution
in him, and by what ways and steps it comes to be so, I will lay before
you the violent courses he does take to break through difficulties and
obstructions that would trash and hinder him: And when the avenues
to Death are strongly guarded, how he storms and forces them, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
all resistance possible, that he may seize on Sin and Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:40114:196"/>
And First, When such persons have entred the Profession of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in Baptism, and by early engagements tyed themselves to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of its duties, if Principles of probity in Nature, fomented by
others, instill'd with Education, have made impressions of duty on the
mind, and wrought a reverence and awe of God and of Religion, which
is a fence about them, and does keep off Vice, by making it seem
strange, uncouth and difficult, while these fears and aversations are root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in them; why then the first thing that they do, as soon as Youth
and the Temptations do stir within them, is to poyson these their own
Principles by evil Conversation, and from that and Example take infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which shall impregnate them with humours of being in the fashion
of the World: Thus they labour to strangle the <hi>then</hi> troublesom mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desties
of Nature and of Virtuous breeding; thus they look out ill Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to infect themselves: And surely they that seek the Plague and
run into infection, we have cause to fear they have a <hi>Resolution to dye.</hi>
But,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If notwithstanding this in the first practices of Vice, their
former Principles stir, and ferment within, and fret the Conscience, set
that on working; why then if the sin sting gently, do but prick the
heart, and make an out-let for a little gush of Sorrow, then in spight of
<hi>Scripture,</hi> they do teach themselves to think that grief Repentance, and
by the help of that conceit this sorrow cools, and doth allay the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the mind, washes away the guilt and thought of the commission,
<hi>they have been sad,</hi> and they believe, <hi>repented;</hi> as if those stings opened
<hi>the fountain for transgression,</hi> and those little wounds did flow with Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
for themselves: And by this means that sting of the old Serpent sin,
while it pretends to <hi>cure</hi> by hurting thus, proves indeed the <hi>Tempter</hi> to
<hi>go on.</hi> For if this be all, why should a man renounce all the Contents
and satisfactions of his Inclinations, and mortifie and break his nature to
avoid a thing which is so easily repented for? No, if it be no worse they
can receive this Serpent in their bosom, dare meet his sting, and run
upon these wounds, and they do so till the frequent pungencies, and
cicatrices have made the Conscience callous and insensible, the heart
hardned.</p>
                  <p>But if their first essays of sin were made unfortunate by <hi>Notoreity,</hi>
or some unhappy circumstance, and so the wound were deep, and the
Conscience troublesom and restless, because this is very uneasie, these
inward groans make discord in their chearful airs, make their life harsh,
they therefore find it necessary to confront the shame with Courage of
iniquity, go boldly on that so they may outlook it, fear their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
that its wounds may not bleed. And as those Fiends of Men
who Sacrific'd their Children in the fire to <hi>Moloch,</hi> that they might not
hear their Infants shreek, nor their own Bowels croak, had noises made
with Timbrels to out-voice them: So these to drown the cries and howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of their wounded mind, put themselves in perpetual hurry of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
and Vice, make <hi>Tophet</hi> about themselves, and with the noise of
Ryots overcome all other, because they will not hearken to those groans
that call for the Physician of Souls, and then sure these <hi>resolve to dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay if this will not keep them quiet, you may see them sometimes
ruffle with their own Consciences, desire present Convictions in the very
instant of Commission, men so set on Death, that they <hi>Condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40114:197"/>
in that which they allow.</hi> And though a man would think there
should be little satisfaction in those pleasures which Condemnation
thrusts it self into, and which have an alloy of so sad apprehensions; yet
such are it seems the satisfactions of sin: For while it slabs and gashes,
He brave <hi>Hero</hi> of Iniquity, can charge the wounds and take the Vice.</p>
                  <p>Yea Thirdly, though the Lord himself appear, and take part in the
Quarrel, joyn with our Principles and Conscience against the sin, and with
importunate Calls alarm us, give us no rest, ordain a Function of men
by whom he does beseech us, dresses their Messages with Promises of
that which God is blessed in, and arms them too with Terrors such as
Devils tremble at, and joyns his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> too, that <hi>Power of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,</hi>
sends him in Tongues of Fire, that he also may Preach this to our
very Hearts, and fright us with more flame: And yet the Sinner breaks
these strengths, and vanquishes the Arts and strivings of Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.
If these Embassadors speak Charms, it is but what God tells
our Prophet in this Chapter, <hi>ver. 32. And lo thou art unto them as a very
lovely Song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.</hi>
And it does dye like that, as it there follows, <hi>They hear thy
words but they do them not.</hi> And if they flash in Hell against their Vices,
in torrents of threatning Scripture, they concern themselves no more
than they would in the story of a new Eruption of Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> or <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suvius.</hi>
Yea they do <hi>quench the Spirit</hi> and <hi>his fires,</hi> do not <hi>like the
deaf Adder, stop their ears</hi> against his whisperings, and the charms of
Heaven (that were a weaker and less valiant guilt) but are Religious
in hearing them, curious that they may be spoke with all advantages to
make it harder not to yield and <hi>live,</hi> that so they may express more
resolution to perish, and with more courage and solemnity may sin and
dye.</p>
                  <p>Nay more, when God hath found an Art to draw themselves into a
<hi>League and Combination against their Vices,</hi> bound them in <hi>Sacraments</hi> to
<hi>Virtue;</hi> made them enter a <hi>Covenant of Piety,</hi> and <hi>seal</hi> it in the <hi>Blood of
God,</hi> and by that foederal Rite with hands lift up, and seizing on Christ's
Body, and with holy Vows oblige themselves to the <hi>performances,</hi> or to
the <hi>Threats</hi> of Gospel, which they see executed in that Sacrament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes, see there <hi>death is the wages of iniquity,</hi> they shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
its damned consequences, while they behold it <hi>tear Christ's Body,
spill his Blood,</hi> and <hi>Crucifie the Son of God;</hi> yet neither will this frightful
spectacle, nor their own <hi>ties</hi> hold them from sin and ruine, they break
these bonds asunder to get at them.</p>
                  <p>The Wiseman says that <hi>wicked men seek death</hi> and <hi>make a Covenant
with it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wisd. i. 16.</note> and so it seems: But sure they are strange wilful men, that
seek it at <hi>Gods Table</hi> in the <hi>Bread of Life,</hi> that will wade through an
<hi>Ocean of mercy</hi> to get at Perdition, and find it in the <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> will
drink <hi>Damnation</hi> in the <hi>Cup of blessing;</hi> men that <hi>poyson Salvation</hi> to
themselves: They that contract thus for Destruction, and tye it to them
at the Altar, with such sacred Rites and Articles, are sure <hi>resolv'd and
love to dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God had provided other Guards to secure men from sin
and Death, the <hi>Censures of the Church;</hi> of which <hi>this Time</hi> was the great
Season, and the discipline of abstinence we now use is a piteous relique,
all that the World will bear it seem: But as the Lord appointed them
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40114:197"/>
they were so close a fence,<note place="margin">Matth. xvi. 19.</note> that our Saviour calls them <hi>Keys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven,</hi> as if they lock'd us in the Path of Piety and Life; and
we must pick or break all that the <hi>Key of Heaven</hi> can make fast, burst
<hi>Locks</hi> as well as <hi>Vows</hi> before we can get out, have liberty to sin. God
having bounded in the Christians race as that among the <hi>Grecians</hi> was,
which had a River on one side, and Swords points all along the other,
so that Destruction dwelt about it on the borders: And God hath
mounded ours with the River of Hell the Lake of Fire, and with these
spiritual Swords (as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and S. <hi>Hierome</hi> call the Censures.) But
yet a Mound too weak alas! to stand the Resolution and assaults of Vices
now adays; which do not onely make great breaches in the Fence, but
have quite thrown it down, and <hi>slighted</hi> it; and the Church dares not
set it up again, should she attempt it they would <hi>scoff</hi> it down. Men
will endure no bar in the way to Perdition; they will have <hi>liberty of
Ruine;</hi> will not be guarded from it; so far from brooking <hi>Censures</hi> they
will suffer no <hi>Reproof,</hi> nor <hi>Admonition,</hi> not suffer one word betwixt them
and Death eternal.</p>
                  <p>But Fifthly, Though we will not let Almighty God restrain us with
his <hi>Censures,</hi> yet he will do it with his <hi>Rod,</hi> and set the sharp stakes of
<hi>Affliction</hi> in our walk, to keep us in; thus he makes sins sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
themselves, and then we straight resolve to break off from them;
and while we suffer shame, and feel destruction in the Vice we shrink
and uncling: And now the Sinner <hi>would not dye,</hi> especially if his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitance
have thrown him to the confines of the grave; and while he
took his full careers of Vice, the fury of his course did drive him to the
ports of Ruine, and Death seemed to make close and most astonishing
approaches, when standing on the brink of the Abyss, he takes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the dismal state that must receive him and his Vices, then he
trembles and flyes, his apprehensions swoon, his Soul hath dying
qualms, caused as much by the Nausea of sin as by the fear of Hell: he
is in agonies of passion and of Prayer both against his former courses, he
never will come near them more; and now sure God hath catch'd him,
and his will is wholly bent another way, now he will live the <hi>new life</hi> if
God will grant him any: But alas! have we never seen when God hath
done this for him, stretch'd out his Arm of Power, hal'd him from the
brow of the Pit, and set him further off, how he does turn and drive
on furiously in the very same path that leads to the same Ruine, and he
recovers into death eternal?</p>
                  <p>And now this Will is grown too strong for the Almighties powerful
methods, and frustrates the whole Counsel of God for his Salvation, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
his Calls and Importunacies whereby he warns him to consult his
safety, to make use of Grace in <hi>time,</hi> not to harden his heart against
his own mercies, and perish in despight of mercy. And when he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
Gods Graces and his Judgments thus, defie his Conscience and his
own Experience too, there is but one thing left wherein this Resolution
can shew its courage, and that is,</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>His own present Interests;</hi> All which the Sinner can break
through and despise, to get at Death. It is so usual to see any of the
gross wasting Vices when it is once espoused, murder the Reputation,
and all those great concerns that do depend upon a mans Esteem, eat
out his Wealth and Understanding, make him pursue pernicious ways
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40114:198"/>
and Counsels, besot him, and enslave him, fill his life with disquiet,
shame and neediness, and the sad consequents of that, Contempt, and
all that's Miserable and unpitied in this Life; and yet the sin with all
these disadvantages is lovely, not to be divorc'd nor torn off from him,
that I were vain should I attempt to prove a thing so obvious. I shall
give but one instance of the power of the Will, the violence and fury
of its inclinations to Ruine.</p>
                  <p>The man who for anothers inadvertency, possibly such as their own
rules of Honour will not judg affront, yea sometimes without any sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of a provocation, meerly becaue he will be rude, does that upon
which they must call <hi>one another to account,</hi> and to their <hi>last account</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
at Gods dread Judgment-seat; whither when he hath sacrific'd
two Families, it may be all their hopes and comforts in this Life; two
Souls which cost the Blood of God, having assaulted Death when it
was arm'd and at his heart, and charged Damnation to take Hell by
Violence; he comes with his own and his Brother's blood upon his
Soul to seize his Sentence, <hi>Go ye Cursed into everlasting Fire:</hi> 'Tis plain
against all Interests of this World and the World to come, this man <hi>will
dye.</hi> And yet this is one of the laudable and generous Customs of the
Age. Neither doth this man stand alone, the <hi>desperate Rebel</hi> would
come into the <hi>Induction,</hi> that without any hopes sets all on fire, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
all here, and to begin his Flames hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But I have said enough to prove the <hi>Resoluteness of a Sinners Will,</hi>
which is so great indeed that it is this especially which does enhance the
guilt of sin into the merit of an endless punishment, this persevering ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
does deserve Hell and make it just.</p>
                  <p>For whatsoever inequality there is betwixt the short-liv'd pleasures
of a sin, which dye while they are tasted, and put out themselves, and
those eternal never-dying retributions of Vengeance, (As sure there is
also betwixt <hi>the life of Man,</hi> and several of those <hi>petty felonies</hi> that <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit</hi>
it) yet the Law <hi>does</hi> not <hi>murder</hi> when it <hi>Executes.</hi> (I might have
instanc'd in the <hi>gathering sticks upon the Sabbath day in Israel.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. xv. 32, 35.</note>) For
since the preservation of publique safety and propriety is valuable with
the lives of many men, and to secure that and affright the Violation, it
was necessary to affix such punishments to such offences; they that know
the penalty, and wilfully, meerly to feed their other Vices, run upon it,
justly suffer it: So that Man might not rob himself of that Immortal
Glory which God had ordain'd him when he did see it absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
thus to hedge Vice with Eternal Death: And as he set Angels
and Flaming Swords to keep him out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> so to set Fiends and
Flames to guard Hell from him, and to entail those Torments on Man's
sin, which he had prepared for the Devil, and sealed the Deed in the
Blood of his Son. If notwithstanding men renounce the blessedness,
and against all their Interests and Obligations, in spight of all the Arts
and Powers of Heaven, they will have the Torments; and, (what they
never would attempt for Paradise) invade those flames to get to Hell,
'tis very just that God should let them have it; should not break his
Decrees, dispence with Holy Laws so confirm'd, meerly to gratifie those
that are obstinate for ruine, and against his whole Gospel quench Hell
fires because men are resolv'd to run into them. This <hi>Will does,</hi> as it
were, <hi>even the Scales</hi> betwixt the <hi>Sin</hi> and the <hi>Damnation,</hi> equal the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40114:198"/>
                     <hi>pleasure</hi> to the <hi>punishment,</hi> and fill the distance from a <hi>moment</hi> to <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though this Will do clear God's Justice, yet it does not satisfie
his Reason, he seems astonish'd at the choice; God himself cannot find
a Ground for such a Resolution; and therefore does enquire, <hi>Why will ye
dye?</hi> Which is God's question, and my second Part.</p>
                  <p>It is the present pleasure sin does tempt your sensuality withal, whose
agitations are so quick and strong that they surprize or break the forces
of your Reason, and your Principles, put the Mind in disorder, and
then seize it with such violence as to lead it captive to the Law of Sin
and Death? 'Tis true indeed thus both of them had their original, so
they prevail'd in Paradise, for <hi>when the Woman saw the Tree was good
for food, and pleasant to the eye, and a Tree to be desired to make one wise,
she took thereof and she did eat,</hi> although she knew that God had said,
<hi>In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely dye, Gen.</hi> iii. But
there was generous pleasure here, such as tempted the Soul, assaulted it
with the appearances of Wisdom, and divine Knowledg: <hi>Ye shall be as
Gods, Gen.</hi> iii. 5. And sure 'tis no great wonder if the proper pleasures
of the mind ingage it, therefore when God would give a Precept liable
to a Temptation of being broke, he laid it in the sphere of those things
that delight the <hi>Soul,</hi> of <hi>Knowledg;</hi> but far be it that those of sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
should ever have prevail'd; Man may yield to the pleasure of being
<hi>like God,</hi> but for pleasure to <hi>make himself a Beast</hi> is contradiction to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For pleasure is but satisfaction of our appetites, and the more
natural the inclination is, the higher and more powerful that Nature,
and the desire eagerer, so much the more delightful is the satisfaction.
Now it is certain that the reasonable faculty, the Soul or Spirit is the
highest and most proper nature of a man: In all the rest he's not a step
remov'd from Beasts, unless it be in shape, but in the accurateness of
his senses is below them far; and therefore must be so in sensual satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions;
but in his Soul he borders upon Angels, and does come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God.</p>
                  <p>Now then that Soul being mans peculiar nature, the highest part of
him, It follows its delights, Spiritual reasonable Joys must needs be
the most natural and most proper for it, most conform'd to it, and
therefore the most taking with it. This may be cleared most irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragably.</p>
                  <p>A Beast hath several ingredients of Nature in his making, he is an
heavy body, and a Vegetable, and he hath also Sense which is his highest
nature. Now though the onely inclination of heavy bodies be to fall
down to the Earth, and this be also natural to a Beast, we do not find
that 'tis his greatest pleasure, sure he had rather feed than tumble in
the Pasture; his chief delight lies in the satisfaction of his chiefest
faculties, wherein he does excel, his <hi>Senses;</hi> and as Beasts differ and
transcend in these, so do their pleasures also differ and exceed. A man
also, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, does live a threefold Life: At first he is but a
<hi>Plant-man,</hi> a growing span of living Creature, and he's born only into
Animality, a Life of Sense, and at last <hi>educated</hi> into <hi>reasonable.</hi> Now
the delights of his first Stages, whilst onely Vegetation and Sense live,
although proportioned to those states, yet have no savour to the mind;
he grows through Nuts and Rattles to the use of Reason, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40114:199"/>
of it also; these must keep even with the growing faculties and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
higher, rational, and manly: Which if they do not, but the man
still dwell upon the satisfaction of sense, he does confound the Stages,
contradict the progresses of Nature; he hath the age and strength of
Reason but to play the Child with, to exert it in those things that are
but a Man's Rattles, hath the sagacity of an Intelligence meerly to find
out how to be a brute with greater luxury and rellish.</p>
                  <p>Come therefore, shew me now the sins which the delights of Reason
do betray you to, and I'le admit the Plea: But if you live your own
<hi>reverse</hi> that you may dye; renounce all your own pleasures first, that
so you may renounce the joys of God and Heaven; and fall from Nature
that you may fall into Hell, this case hath no pretence; and those plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
cannot <hi>toll man</hi> on to death, which till the man be dead, and the
brute onely live within him cannot be his pleasures. And it is plain
they are not pleasures to a Sober man that lives the life of <hi>Reason,</hi> not
to say of <hi>Grace:</hi> Nor are they such to any man till he have train'd and
exercis'd himself into an habit of enduring them, and by a discipline of
Torment made himself experienc'd for Vice and for Damnation: Nor
is there ever any pleasure in some Vices. What is there in the dismal
Wishes of mans imprecating passion? there cannot be musick in those
harsh horrours, and yet the Sinners <hi>will destruction</hi> so as that they <hi>call to
God</hi> to pour it on them, and tear it down from Heaven, so that Pain
and Disease seem to sauce those delights, and Death to be the tempter to
the pleasure; 'tis evident mens reasons and their Practices must be first
debauch'd, that they may count them Pleasures, and therefore pleasure
cannot be the first mover in the Sinners race to Death.</p>
                  <p>But I will grant, that the Spirit and Flesh of Man by their so strait
alliance and perpetual converse, may grow to have the same likes and
dislikes, have but one appetite, and this alas! be that of flesh; to whose
onely satisfactions the man useth himself, by long Custom of which, the
Soul doth so imbibe the Inclinations of the Body, that nothing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind can possibly be relish'd. In this case sensuality hath pleasures,
yet such as cannot answer Gods enquiry; for do but consult mans other
Choices and you find a present satisfaction cannot work his Resolutions
to forego great after-hopes, or run upon a foreseen ruine. Who will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
his right to the Reversion of a Crown, which from his Father he
shall certainly inherit and succeed to if he do out-live him, for a present
Scene of Royalty, and choose a painted Coronet, the pomps and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of a Stage, and the applauses of a Croud before the real Glories
of his Kingdom, the love and the obedience of his Subjects? And yet
my Soul, the disproportion of the Sinners terms is infinitely greater;
and there is no hazzard, which to make his choice of present things
more flattering, the others hopes are liable to: For that Heir of the
Crown may die before the Crown fall to him; but it is impossible that
we should miss of ours except we put our selves by, by such choices;
except we change it thus. And on the other side we know, men will
adventure the Sentence of the Law by Robberies and murders to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for Lusts, while they hope to be undiscovered: But sure a Prison
made delightful by all arts of pleasure, and all plenties of it, will not
hire a man to own those actions which shall forfeit him to certain shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Execution the next Sessions, and yet this is the Sinners state exactly,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40114:199"/>
he is ti'd and bound in the chain of his sins, they are it may be chains
of Gold and softned with delices, but they reserve him to the Judgment
of the great Assise: And yet he chooses these and puts them on as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of delight and honour.</p>
                  <p>Once more; Do not men choose a present Agony to keep off an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terevil,
they tear their bowels with a Vomit to prevent a Surfeit, they
cup and scarifie, and with all artifice or pain upon themselves kill a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
yea they are well content to prolong torment so they may but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
life; and though the preservation of it prove onely continued
pangs, and all they can effect is onely this, that they are longer dying,
yet they are glad to be so in all cases, except where the prescription is
<hi>Virtue,</hi> and the <hi>death</hi> prescribed against <hi>Eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now why do you choose thus onely in Sin and Hell? 'Tis clear the
very pleasure you change Heaven for, cannot invite you from this Life,
and then you that will suffer any thing rather than you will dye, <hi>Why</hi>
against all resistance <hi>will you dye for ever?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is Secondly, because you know not what it is to dye the second
Death? at least your notions of it are so slight and easie, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fright you from a pleasure or cope with a temptation to it; and so
though present satisfactions are not able to engage you upon present
ruin they can upon the after-death.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the Sinner would have reason if it meant no more than hath
been taught of late by one that hath gained many Proselytes among the
<hi>Virtuosi</hi> of Religion; <hi>After the Resurrection the Reprobates shall be,</hi> saith
he, <hi>in the state that Adam and his Posterity were in after his Sin</hi> (i. e.)
<hi>the state we are now in, Live as we do, Marry and give in Marriage, and
cease to be when they have got some heirs to succeed them in Tophet.</hi> Poor
unhappy Souls these! that never had any sin to merit being there, nor
any Sentence to condemn them thither but this mans: Who must put
them there successively one after other, to find employment for Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fire. A Doctrine such as had an Angel Preach'd from Heaven by
S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s award he must have been <hi>Anathema;</hi> when the Devil made
Religions, and Theology came from the bottomless Pit, he never found
out such an Engine to conveigh men into it as this pleasant notion of
the punishment of sin therein; as if <hi>Leviathan were made to take his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime
in that Lake also,</hi> by such interpretations, which surely were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
to make out the Assertion of that <hi>Romish</hi> Priest, who says, <hi>that
those in Hell love to be there;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tho. de. Alb.</note> nay more, that <hi>'twas impossible for God to
do a kinder thing for them than to put them there.</hi> Doctrines to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd
as Hell it self; and yet upon these grounds he builds their
Church by demonstration, so strong as that <hi>the Gates of Hell cannot
prevail against it;</hi> and in truth they have no reason to assault it on these
terms. But to pass by such dotages and frenzies, you will be able sure
to check all those presumptions which grow from <hi>sleight impressions</hi> of
the second Death, if you but take that prospect of it which the close
of this time gives: look forward through this season, which is designed
for you to <hi>prepare the way of the Lord to his Passion</hi> in, and you shall
see the Death that does await iniquity.</p>
                  <p>If you behold him coming to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with <hi>Hosannas</hi> and <hi>Palms</hi>
about him, as if Death were his <hi>Triumph,</hi> his Passion so desirable, that
he rode to meet it, which he never did at any other time; and then
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40114:200"/>
complaining he was <hi>straitned until it were accomplish'd;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luc. xii. 50.</note> as he had throws
of Longing after it,<note place="margin">Matt. xxvi. 30.</note> and <hi>singing</hi> when he went out to it, you would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Sinner never chose his death, sweetned by his most pleasant
sin, with a more chearful eagerness. But then open the Garden and you
see his apprehensions of it <hi>throw him on his Face to pray against it.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. xxvi. 39.</note> See
how he sweats and begs, his very Prayer is a Passion, the zeal of it is
Agony! and canst thou choose that he so dreads and deprecates? and
when he durst not meet the apprehensions, wilt thou stand the storm?
see what a <hi>sting death</hi> hath, when it makes out-lets for such clots and
globes of Blood, and stings the Soul so too, that it pours out it self in
Sweat. And then he sinks again under the deprecation of it, and prays
that <hi>that Cup may pass from him.</hi> Blessed Saviour! when thou hadst
just now made thy Death thy Legacy, thy Sacrament, dost thou intreat
to scape this death? if <hi>this Cup pass from thee,</hi> what will the <hi>Cup of
Blessing</hi> profit us? thou hadst but now bequeathed a Cup to us which
was <hi>the New Testament in thy Blood,</hi> and now wilt thou not shed that
Blood? But dost thou refuse thy Cup? Oh 'twas <hi>a Cup of deadly Wine,</hi>
red with God Indignation, poison'd with Sin! And can the Sinner thirst
for the Abyss of this, the Lake that hath no bottom? and when <hi>he goes
again, and prays the same words the third time,</hi> be yet not onely so su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
as not ask to scape it, seldom and very sleight in any Prayer or
wish against it, but also so resolv'd to have it, as to gape that he may
swill it down to everlastingness? Follow him from that Garden and you
see him even dying under his Cross, he cannot bear that when it is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with sin,<note place="margin">Heb. i. 3.</note> who yet <hi>upholdeth all things by the word of his Power.</hi> 'Tis
said the time will come when the Sinner will cry out to the <hi>Hills to fall
on him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luc. xxiii. 30.</note> any weight but that of iniquity, the burden of that is intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
'tis easier for him to bear a Mountain than a Vice, and yet Christ
saith <hi>he hath a beam in his Eye,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. vii. 3.</note> and can he shrink at any weight whose
part, that is most sensible, tender to an expression, can bear that which
shoulders must fall under, onely Pillars can sustain? Oh yes; that which
did sink the shoulders of Omnipotence: Then the <hi>Mountains</hi> rather
<hi>and the Rocks to cover;</hi> but in vain, they will not cover, for thy very
Groans will rent them: Christ's were so sad that his did, <hi>they tore the
Rocks,</hi> and that which is much more inflexible, the <hi>Monuments:</hi> Death
started at them, and the bonds of the Grave loosened, and the Dust was
frighted into Resurrection; and more, the Hypostatick Union seem'd
rent by them, the God to have forsaken his own Person. And can the
Sinner hope to stand this shock? will the courage of his Iniquity make
his heart harder than those Rocks, more insensible than the Grave, and
better able to endure than he that was a God? and will you die into this
state eternally? which it was necessary for him to have the assistance of
Divinity in his Person, that he might be able to endure one day, and
which yet notwithstanding made one day intolerable.</p>
                  <p>The sum is this, a Person so desiring Death and yet so dreading it, and
sinking under the essays of it, and this Person the Son of God, and that
dread meerly because there was sin in the Death, (for if this were not in
the cause, no Martyr but had born death with more courage but that Son
of God) all this as it does leave no Reason for the Sinners choice of death
Eternal, so neither doth it leave a possibility of bearing it: And if so,
give me leave in God's Name to Expostulate, the last imployment of these
words, <hi>Why will ye die?</hi>

After this killing Prospect, while the damp of it is on you, let my
Bowels debate with you, which yearn more over you than they did over
my Beloved Son in whom I was well pleased; when I have sent my only
Son, God, one with my own Self, to be made Man, that he might suffer
what was necessary to be suffer'd to preserve you from eternal sufferings;
when I have laid on <hi>him that was brought up with me from everlasting,<note place="margin">Prov. viii. 30.</note> and
that was daily my Delight,</hi> all your Iniquities and my own Indignation,
that so you might be freed from both: When I have found out, made an
Expiation, with which I am more pleased than ever your transgressions
offended me, which hath quite blotted out your sins and my Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
when your Redemption from death is made, the Ransom paid,
the Price is in my hand, why do you then refuse your selves, your own
Eternal Blessedness which was thus dearly purchas'd and is ready for
you? Why will you seize that Indignation which you are redeemed from,
and force those sufferings on your selves, which have been laid already
and inflicted on another? 'Tis a small thing that you refuse me, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of my Expence, that which I gave my Son for; but do you renounce
Happiness because my Love and Blood is in it? and will you die because
you may, and I desire you should live? when my Son went from the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
felicities of my Bosom to embrace Agonies, and dy'd for you;
why will you also die? as you have slain his Person, will you Crucifie
his Kindness too? and crucifie your selves rather than have it? and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us'd him most despightfully, will you therefore use his favours so?
and not let his Death and Passion do you any good? contemn his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Salvation, his divine Acts of making you for ever Blessed? is
your Saviour and Life it self so hateful to you? and after such Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of your persons is there no redemption of your Will from perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
nothing of value that can bribe your choice against it? nothing
that can betroth you into a desire of Life, and take you off from your
resolves to die? had I set no advantage on the other side, if sin had
sweetned misery to your Palate, it had been no such great despite
and contradiction to Appetite; but when Heaven and the Joys of God
are in the Scale against it, to <hi>prefer Misery</hi> is Wretchless beyond aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<hi>Oh why will you rather die?</hi> Those very things that tempt your
Wills were they abstracted from the death they do inveigle you into,
were they sincere and innocent, if they were set against that Life, that
blessed life, immortal Life, would vanish quite in the comparison when
you should see they are but frolicks of delight, that never take you but
when you are turn'd up to them, in moods and fits; and the complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
you take in them are but starts of Appetite, that swells and breaks
out to them and then falls again, and so the pleasures die even in the
birth, and therefore cannot satisfie; indeed do but disquiet an immortal
appetite such as man's is, so that it were impossible to choose a life, these
rather, although there were no misery annex'd to them, if you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd:
For it were to resolve that a few drops were more than an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
Ocean of Delight, a Moment longer than Eternity, a Part were
bigger than the Whole, an Atome greater than an Infinite. Now there
is nothing then that can prefer these to your choice but the Death only;
and <hi>Oh will ye without and against all Temptation, Will ye die?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O thou <hi>my Soul!</hi> take other Resolutions, thou seest the things that
men with so much care and sin provide to make their lives delightful here,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40114:201"/>
although success answer their care, are vain and helpless things, and life
it self as vain, and I must die, and drop from Heaven; and therefore be
thou sure to take a care their treacherous comforts do not make me die
into the everlasting want of them and of all comforts.</p>
                  <p>The Artificial pleasures of the Palate whether in meats or drinks,
forc'd tasts, that do at once satisfie and provoke the Appetite, will rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
ill when I begin to swallow down my spittle; but sure I am, I am
invited to the <hi>Supper of the Lamb, to drink new Wine with Christ in my
Father's Kingdom;</hi> The <hi>fatted Calf</hi> is dressing for my Entertainment, and
shall I choose to be a while a Glutton with the Swine, rather than the
eternal Guest of my Father's Table and Bosom? and refuse these for a
few sick Excesses which would end in qualms, and gall, and vomits, if
there were no guilt to rejolt too, and which will kindle a perpetual
Feaver? The Honours and the Glories of this Life will lose their
shine when I am going to make my Bed in the Dark, in a black lonely
desolate hole of Earth; my Gayeties must die, when I <hi>must say to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
thou art my Father, and to the Worm thou art my Mother and my
Sister:</hi> And if there were pride or ambition in them, their Worm will
never die, that Pride will make me fall as low as <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that Glory
will go out into <hi>utter darkness,</hi> and that Ambition change my Honour
into everlasting Shame, Envy, and Torment: But sure I am that there
are Glorious Robes, and Thrones, and Scepters in God's Promises; and
let thy gayety, <hi>my Soul!</hi> be in the Robe of Immortality, the Throne
of thy Ambition that of Glory.</p>
                  <p>When I shall lie tortur'd or languishing in my last Bed, Palaces and
Possessions will no more relieve me, than the Landskip of them in the
Hangings can do it. And if there were Covetousness, Bribery, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
or Injustice in them, I shall be carried out of these, and have no
other Habitation assigned me, but with the Devil and his Angels, shall
inherit and possess nothing but the Almighty's Indignation for ever.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>in my Father's House are many Mansions,</hi> Places prepared for me,
and an Inheritance as wide as Heaven, as Endless and Incorruptible as
Eternity, and God Himself: And sure if I may choose, there I will live
where there is neither <hi>Will</hi> nor <hi>possibility to die;</hi> where there is <hi>Life,
fulness of Joy, Pleasures for Evermore.</hi> To which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <bibl>PSALM LXXIII. v. 25.</bibl>
                     <q>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none
upon Earth that I desire besides thee:</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Text is the result of the Pious man's Audit, the
foot of the account in summing up his whole that
he hath either in Possession or Desire; and instead
of nice Division of the Words I shall observe in them
these Subjects of Discourse.</p>
                  <p>First, the different tenure, or condition of Estates
in the two different Countreys we relate to, this
here is a Land onely of <hi>desires,</hi> the other is a place
of <hi>enjoyments, Have in Heaven, Desire on Earth.</hi> Yea</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though our estate here in this Earth be present, and that
other seem removed far off, yet the possessions of that are present and
in hand, but the most native satisfactions of the Earth are still at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
onely the object of our aims and expectations <hi>I have, now I have
in Heaven, on the Earth I but desire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Here is the matter of both these desires and enjoyments to
the Pious man; <hi>No Person</hi> or <hi>no thing</hi> (for so it bears also) <hi>but God:
There is nothing upon Earth that I desire besides thee.</hi> And as to <hi>Heaven</hi>
the negation is express'd emphatically by a Question, <hi>Whom have I in
Heaven but thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet least this Question should look like an Expostulation, and he that
asks it seem unsatisfied with his Portion, we will therefore,</p>
                  <p>Lastly, see the Importance of it to the Christian, since our <hi>Saviour</hi> is
gone up into Heaven, see whom the Christian hath there: And if the
Psalmist could find none but <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> (if he were the Author)
could not see the <hi>Son of David</hi> there, yet since <hi>Christ is set at the Right
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40114:202"/>
hand of God,</hi> the Christians present Interest in Heaven is such, that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with contempt on all that worldly men applaud themselves in the
enjoyment of, rejecting all but <hi>thee O Christ,</hi> he justly triumphs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
of this question to himself, and being satisfied in <hi>having thee,</hi> he
does renounce even the <hi>desiring any thing but thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of these in their order beginning here on Earth, where our tenure
even of earthly things is but <hi>desire,</hi> this World does give no satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in hand, but still they are onely the objects of our Expectations and
wishes.</p>
                  <p>When God hath given Man an erect Countenance, Eyes that do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
look towards him, and the very frame of him is such, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is his constant Object; it were no wonder if his looks and thoughts
were always there, since both the duty and necessity of that does seem
imprest upon him in his making, and to <hi>desire things above,</hi> is, as it were,
<hi>the Law in his members.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when he swims in delicacies here upon the Earth, is immerst in
the plenties of all kinds, that these should give him nothing but <hi>desires
of themselves,</hi> that the delights should not be present to him, but he
should still pursue and need that which he is encompast with, that
while with open mouth and in a most intemperate current he swills
down the pleasures, yet his open mouth should gape only with thirst,
and he be sensible of nothing but the want of these, is strange even to
astonishment: Yet such it seems the nature of them is. When S. <hi>John</hi>
would enumerate all that is in the World the particular that he gives
in is thus, 1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 16. <hi>All that is in the world, the lust of the Flesh,
the lust of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life.</hi> He does not say, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of these Lusts that are to serve and satisfie them, for there's no such
thing as satisfaction, but onely lust; and if we make enquiry into the
particulars we shall find it.</p>
                  <p>To begin with that of the Eyes, <hi>Covetousness,</hi> or <hi>the love of Money:</hi>
'Tis evident that where an Object is not useful to the faculty, it cannot
satisfie, for satisfaction is fulfilling of our needs and uses, but Money
is not useful to the sight, nor indeed does it prove useful to, or serve
any of the Covetous mans occasions or faculties; rather the contrary in
every kind, he does bereave himself of good because he hath it; He is
in agonies of trouble and sollicitude, lest he should need, and not have
that, which when he hath acquir'd he will still need, and will not have
enjoyment of. Nor is it possible it should be otherwise, for since there
is no natural original or cause of this his Appetite, for 'tis not emptiness
that makes him hungry, who is more ravenous the more full he is,
whose most empty bowels shrink and cling together, and having learn'd
not to expect repast, while his bags and desires stretch, and are enlarg'd
by being stuff'd.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it fear of future want that makes him eager to provide so, for
why should he be so unsatisfied in his providing against want, that will
want more the more he is provided?</p>
                  <p>And since as there is no natural cause, so there is also no natural mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
for this Appetite of his; for Natures measure is our real uses of the
Object. But this man heaps up useful things that he does never mean to
use: Since therefore it hath neither bound nor cause in Nature, 'tis
monstrous, and must needs be an unlimited lust, uncapable of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40114:202"/>
And all this man's Wealth does purchase nothing for him but <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,</hi>
and is not the <hi>content</hi> but the <hi>Lust of his Eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the same reasoning will conclude the next, <hi>the Pride of life,</hi> which
is the Lust of a Sense as wholly unconcern'd in all the Pomps and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
of Pride, as the Eye is in Wealth: 'tis a Lust of the Ear, all is
but the man's passion to hear himself, his trappings, or condition com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
The Learned man that's proud, does think of no return for
all his toyls and watches, all the present racks and tortures of his mind,
and all the after-ones that he does pull upon his body, but to be spoken
well of: He fasts, mortifies, and denies himself more than the Covetous
man can do, meerly to fill himself with wind; he reconciles the <hi>Babel</hi>
of all Languages, and Sciences too in his own head but for a word,
onely to hear an <hi>Euge,</hi> and this with such solicitude that if the breath
of mens Applause should fail him he would straight expire, as if his
Soul <hi>breath'd</hi> onely at his <hi>Ear.</hi> If my pride lies in gayeties, all Natures
Wardrobe must be rifled, the beauties of the Universe desloured, the Art
and Sweat too of all Nations employed to attire my person, or to dress my
Room, rather indeed to dress the Tongues and furnish, out the talk of
other persons, who must entertain mine Ears with the discourse of my
own splendors; which is all the use I can make of it; the Eastern Rocks
must send me Diamonds, meerly to dart a line of light into anothers eyes,
which may return to me in a report that I have such fine Jewels, and I
have nothing else of all my sumptuous glories but the meer <hi>Eccho</hi> of
their shine, which is reflected and beat back to me in commendations.
With so much expence anxiety and sin, I do provide onely for other mens
discourses, or it may be, envies. Now these are none of my enjoyments,
and therefore I have nothing of them but the <hi>Lust</hi> and the <hi>desire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for <hi>those of the flesh,</hi> the third remaining kind, they seem indeed
to be exempted from this reasoning; the sensual person gorges his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and in <hi>Solomons</hi> phrase <hi>makes his Soul enjoy good:</hi> Yet the same
<hi>Solomon</hi> salves that appearance too, in saying <hi>when provisions encrease,
they are encreased that eat them;<note place="margin">Eccles. v. 11.</note> and what good is there to the owners
thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?</hi> My broad and my
cramb'd Tables do not more enlarge or serve my appetite, give me no
satisfaction but onely that of seeing many Dishes full, and many men
consuming them, as if <hi>Luxury</hi> also were <hi>a lust of the Eye.</hi> It hath been
said indeed, that the Eye is the Gluttons most unsatisfied and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
part, and it must needs be so if its lust lie to all that other men
devour, and if it crave not onely for the mans own stomach, but for
throngs of Clients, Parasites, and attendants. And 'tis too plain the
other Twin <hi>Intemperance</hi> lusts by the same rules and laws: It does not
onely claim its seat in the <hi>Eye,</hi> which makes it self a Judge of Liquors
for the Palate, and does not choose them by the uses of their moisture,
but by their body, by their <hi>air,</hi> and by the <hi>mode,</hi> and other <hi>Rules of the
authentick standard Drinkers;</hi> as if men thirsted in the fashion onely:
But this Eye also, as the Riotous mans did, gapes for company, and
thirsts to see the Vice go round, it drinks in nothing with so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
as the Wine, when a weaker Companion returns it back again in
Vomit, at that foul horrid spectacle it sparkles and triumphs. Now
'twere in vain to ask <hi>Solomons</hi> question, <hi>What good is there in this?</hi> or
what enjoyment? to urge that meats and drinks cannot give satisfaction
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40114:203"/>
to the Eye that hath no Palate, and then cry out <hi>Oh Prodigy</hi> that it
should Lust thus! As for the other kind of Riots, where with arts of
Epicurism men contrive to feast and entertain their private Appetites,
and put a Patrimony into sauce for their own Palats, men sordidly Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xurious.
'Tis evident that these are studied to provoke, men choose
such Wines as they may longest drink, and with elaborate condiments
make forc'd <hi>hunger</hi> as well as <hi>dishes,</hi> so that the Riotous <hi>design onely to
Lust,</hi> and the whole mystery of Luxury is to <hi>create desires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, for that one that hath ingross'd the name of <hi>Lust,</hi> it gives in a
full Evidence against it self. For the <hi>Adulterer,</hi> much more irrational
than the most <hi>greedy Miser;</hi> is insatiate in <hi>desiring</hi> what he <hi>hath,</hi> and his
Lust will not use his remedy, lest so it should allay and quench the Lust:
And whilst with so much feaver of desire, he courts nothing else but
the <hi>change,</hi> and values that alone equal with all the discontents of this
life, all the miseries of that to come, and will <hi>go to the Devil</hi> meerly for
<hi>variety,</hi> as it is plain: Adultery hath nothing <hi>proper</hi> to it self but the
<hi>desire,</hi> is a meer loosness of the Fancy, which ranges in wild lusts, and
which hath no enjoyment that's peculiar to it but the lusting onely; so
'tis also plain that this Lust must be endless, for that principle of Change
which gives it all its incitation must never let it rest; for then 'tis not
variety. S. <hi>John</hi> said therefore most expresly, <hi>All that is in the World
is Lust;</hi> men onely can <hi>desire here,</hi> pursuing their <hi>desires</hi> just as they
do their shadows, no eagerness or hast can bring them nearer, still they
onely pursue, yea like him that would hugg and force a Cloud, his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
arms return upon his breast with strokes; and while they seek to
catch the Object wound his Bosom: And thus it must be till we fix
our passion there, where onely there is satisfaction even on <hi>God;</hi> the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the pious mans desire, and my next Part.</p>
                  <p>Nothing besides thee, <hi>or</hi> with thee: <hi>so it signifies also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is nothing upon Earth that I desire with thee.</p>
                  <p>Had he said, <hi>Nothing without thee,</hi> the emptiness of every thing below
which the Lord and his Blessing is not in, had made this his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
just and necessary: But sure when God hath put other needs in
my making, and hath provided supplies for them, those also are as just
and necessary objects of desire, while they are with and under him:
But yet, he that had brought all his affections into <hi>Davids</hi> frame, might
well say he desired nothing upon Earth <hi>besides,</hi> nothing <hi>with God;</hi> for
he had weaned his very Flesh and all the craving appetites of Sense from
their own objects, and had fix'd them upon God in all their strength
and vigour. <hi>My Soul,</hi> saith he, <hi>thirsteth for thee,</hi> (elsewhere, <hi>my Soul
gaspeth unto thee, even as a thirsty Land,) and my flesh also longeth after
thee, Psalm</hi> lxiii. 1.<note place="margin">Psal. xxxvi. 9.</note> How! My Soul thirsteth for thee? <hi>with thee
indeed is the Well of Life:</hi> But Thirst is an Appetite, gasping a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
defailance and impatience of the Body; to both which the Soul is
a meer stranger, as it is also to the ways by which the Body does desire;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or the Soul is drawn by moral engagements, by persuasions and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
there is place for deliberation and Choice in her Desires, she
can demur in her pursuits, divert her Inclinations, and quench a Desire
with a Consideration; but the Flesh pursues in a more impulsive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
is drawn and spurr'd on by such impetuous propensions as are
founded in matter: You can no more persuade a thirsty Palate not to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40114:203"/>
thirst, than you can woo a falling Stone to stay its hast, or invite it to
turn aside from its direction to the Center. Yea but the Soul also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts
it self in all these appetites of flesh and matter, and with all their
violence when it looks on God, when we have once had a taste, or when
indeed we but discern our needs of him, whether our Temporal, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
those of the Soul or Flesh, all the desires of both then fly at him,
and with a tendency most close and uncontrollable, then nothing besides
him. For all the appetites of Body croud into the Soul that they may
catch at God, that <hi>Thirsts</hi> and <hi>Gaspes.</hi> And the Soul does put on the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
impetuous agitations of the Bodies Appetites; <hi>My Soul thirsteth for
thee,</hi> and <hi>my Flesh also longeth after thee.</hi> What <hi>Longing</hi> is, whether an
Appetite or Passion of the Flesh or Mind, whose signatures are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
indeed upon the Flesh than those of any other, yet whose impulses
are so quick and so surprizing, as they were Spirit; I shall not now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire:
but sure if the Flesh long it should be for some carnal Object,
for that is proportion'd to it; Flesh and the Creature use to close in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and they imbibe each other, as if they knew to fill and satisfie
each other; yea some there are that have brought down their Souls to
the propensions of Flesh, have given to their very Spirits an infusion of
carnality, for <hi>they mind onely fleshly things.</hi> But by the rates of <hi>David</hi>'s
practice it should seem the pious man does the just contrary; sublimes
his <hi>Flesh</hi> into a <hi>Soul,</hi> drains all the carnal Appetites out of it, weans it
from all its own desires, and teacheth it those of the Spirit onely, makes
it <hi>long for God.</hi> Now he whose flesh is defaecated thus, and as it were
inur'd to the condition which it shall put on, when it awakes from its
corruption, as if it were already in that place, whose happiness and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
have no use of Body, and were in that state where their Bodies
<hi>neither hunger or thirst,</hi> for these he hath translated from his flesh; 'tis
<hi>his Soul onely thirsts,</hi> and that <hi>for God:</hi> As if he were indeed <hi>like An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
now,</hi> how can this man <hi>desire any thing on Earth besides the Lord,</hi>
who is and does already what they are and do in Heaven, <hi>where we have
nothing but thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding this <hi>exalted temper,</hi> though we should arrive at
this <hi>Seraphick constitution of desires,</hi> and though God hath now made
himself to us the proper object of these appetites, for since God struck
the Rock for us <hi>which Rock was Christ;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. x. 4. John vi. 32, 34. ver. 55.</note> since the <hi>true Bread came down
from Heaven,</hi> if our <hi>Flesh long for God</hi> there is a satisfaction ready, he
hath made <hi>his Flesh be meat indeed;</hi> if our <hi>Souls thirst for God,</hi> he can
furnish <hi>drink for a Soul, the Blood of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet while this Soul sojourns in this earthly Tabernacle, the man
will still want other supplies, and may be not desire them; or can he
choose indeed? For they that tell us stories of some men, whose hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and thirsts after God as they devour'd all other desires in them,
so also gave themselves no other satisfaction but <hi>panem Dominum,</hi> that

find it hard to make out how bare <hi>Species</hi> could nourish and sustain a

and although it <hi>was his meat to do his Father's Will,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John vi. 54.</note> yet when he
was an hungered <hi>Angels came and ministred unto him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. iv. 11.</note> and then may not
our earthly needs desire something besides him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40114:204"/>
That while we are upon the Earth all those necessities are in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
is certain; but that we need not desire for them, or any thing
besides Him, is as certain: Because to them that desire him <hi>all these things
shall be added,</hi> they are annex'd by Promise, <hi>Matth</hi> vi. 33. it is for such
to be sollicitous who would have something they must have <hi>alone;</hi>
something that cannot come <hi>along with God.</hi> But if I be assur'd that all
my needs shall be supply'd in him, I need <hi>desire nothing besides him;</hi>
now this Promise he must perform; for he that when he put Man in a
state of Immortality in Paradise, provided him a Tree of Life that might
for ever furnish and sustain him: For that Age also that he does design
a man a being for his Service here upon the Earth, he must allow him
necessaries for his being and his Service, otherwise he can nor serve, nor
be: And then if they be certain what need he desire them? <gap reason="foreign">

saith S. <hi>Chrysostome;</hi> These are not objects for our careful
wishes, but our trusts and confidences, we may assure our selves of these
if we have him, these are his Appendages, and then why should I put
them with him into my Devotions? when my Soul lies gasping towards
God in Prayer, my desires seizing on his Blessednesses, to take them off
from him, and to make my desires turn aside to little earthly things and
fix them there, is to affront not my <hi>God</hi> onely, but my <hi>Prayer</hi> too; and
when these things are sure, seems to betray a mind too Earthly and too
apprehensive of these needs: Surely I were most strangely necessitous,
or strangely greedy, if both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>that which shall be added to him</hi> were
not enough for me: More wretched, or else more unsatisfied than Hell, if
the Almighty were not sufficient for me; if he be my provision, then I
need desire nothing besides him.</p>
                  <p>But yet Necessities will crave; Hunger does croak aloud, Thirst
makes the insensate Earth to gasp; as if with open mouth it gap'd not
onely to receive but beg Gods showers, and God expects to be intreated
for these things:<note place="margin">Psal. Cxlvii. 9.</note>

desires other things; and Christ himself hath put into his little Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
these needs and these desires, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread;</hi> and
my Text does but regulate not exclude these desires, if we shall read
it in the old Translation, <hi>there is none upon Earth that I desire in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of thee</hi>

<hi>equally with thee, like thee,</hi> so we translate the same word, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. I shall
not doubt to beg what my needs crave: But if God, and any the most
signal earthly advantage stand in competition, and I cannot have one
with the other, his Providence or his Commands have made them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent,
that I will not desire <hi>with him,</hi> then he shall be my Choice
alone: Rather Obedience and my God than any satisfaction how desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
soever!</p>
                  <p>This is the Touchstone of a Pious mans desires; 'tis not unusual for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to things below, more to possess our thoughts, employ our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
than any other, and we are far more sensible of their impressions,
more busie in the pursuit, and more tender in our cares of them: But
if upon contest betwixt God and our inclinations, upon debate betwixt
a Pleasure and Command, we can decree for God and for Obedience,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40114:204"/>
pass Sentence with the Precept, we are safe, here the desire is not inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
'Tis a known instance, and you may have seen, a tender Mother
spending almost her whole time in caressing her little Infant, you would
think she had Eyes for no uses but to view it, and that she had her Arms
and Breasts but to embrace and suckle it, to whom these are so wholly
given up as if they had no part for any other, as the Husband, had no
share in her entertains and caresses of whom are far more sleight and not
so pressing: But should it come to this pinch once, that she must straight
resolve to part with one of these, however close her Arms would grasp
her Child to rescue him (to force whom thence were like the tearing of
her bowels from her) yet would she give those bowels to redeem her
bosom guest, and the Husband would be the Choice; so that although
the other inclinations were more expressive, these are the stronger and
the better setled. So it may happen, we may be more sensibly affected
to some dear things here below, our thoughts, and Eyes, and our em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
cling and fasten more to these; but if it come to this that we
must leave one, break with the Duty or the Passion; if we resolve how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
not to part with God, but lay hold there and let the other go, then
our affections are not onely regular when we <hi>desire nothing in comparison
with him,</hi> but our <hi>desires</hi> are <hi>enjoyments, seize and take possession</hi> of him,
and <hi>we have him:</hi> So my Text implies here, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven
but thee?</hi> importing that <hi>we have him:</hi> Which brings me to the other
parts that yet remain to be discours'd of.</p>
                  <p>Three things are here to be considered.</p>
                  <p>1. That <hi>Heaven is the place of Possessions</hi> in opposition to this Land of
<hi>Desires.</hi> 2. That <hi>God is the possession there.</hi> 3. That <hi>the Pious man hath
this possession in present.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first of these is so much common place, I shall not stay upon it;
those onely qualities that make this World to be a Land of Desires, have
no place there, to wit, the <hi>instability</hi> and <hi>emptiness</hi> of all things in it, he
that lays hold on them does but grasp <hi>Mercury,</hi> which the more he clasps
the more he forces it to slip away, and he retains onely the soyl and the
defilement of it, like Lightning which but passes by, stays not to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
onely dazels, and, it may be, scorches: So the shine of Earthly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
startles the mind, amuses us, inflames desires of them, and goes out.
But then above the tenure is Eternity, and that assures immutability;
yea, if it be <hi>nunc stans,</hi> an indivisible Infinity of permanent duration,
whose every point does coexist to every point, <hi>a perfect and entire pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
all at once, of an interminable life that never can be all possest;</hi> then
nothing can pass by us, or cease from us, but we shall always every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have, what we shall have in every any moment: Our enjoyment
also being like him that we enjoy, <hi>all in the whole and all in every part;</hi>
being not onely endless in the mass, but every moment of it is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:
And then there can be nothing but enjoyment; no place for desire
there, where there is nothing absent, where all past and all futurity is
always present; and where also the Infinite and all-sufficient God is the
Possession; which is my next Proposition, and that God himself affirms.</p>

he <hi>hath present possession of,</hi> which my third Proposition and my Text as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts,
in saying, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> importing <hi>thee I
have.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:40114:205"/>
The things we call most our possessions hee both personal and real,
and our <hi>portions</hi> and <hi>inheritances:</hi> Now <hi>David</hi> claims God under both
these dues,<note place="margin">Psal. Cxix. 57, 16. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou art my portion O Lord and the lot of mine Inheritance;</hi>
as other men maintain themselves by these, so I live upon thee: And
that we may not think that God is such but in <hi>Reversion,</hi> those are <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
possessions which men reap the uses of <hi>in present</hi> to themselves.</p>
                  <p>Now what is there of God the Pious man hath not the present uses
of?<note place="margin">1 Pet. iii. 12.</note>

In a word, all the Securities that Gods Preserving Mercies sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
the watches of his Providence, the Blessings that fulfill his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of goodness, all are exerted upon his occasions, are made the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

                  </p>
                  <p>And then give me O Lord! seizin of this the Pious man's Estate, I
shall not envy other mens possessions; though one lay House to House,
and Land to Land till he become the Lord of his Horison, and his Eyes
cannot travel out of his Demesne: For notwithstanding that we may
have known ill Courses or ill Accidents consume all this, or Force throw
him out of all, and that great Lord have no House but a Goal, nor Land
enough to make a Grave: But sure I am, that I shall be provided for
in all necessities, unless there happen such a one for which there's no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
in God; nor can I be disseis'd, they must void Heaven e're they can
disfurnish me: <hi>For thee I have in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet, though chance nor violence cannot put me out, yet I may
forfeit this Possession too;<note place="margin">Isai. lix. 2.</note> for <hi>Sin</hi> will <hi>separate betwixt me and my God,</hi>
cast me out of his presence and enjoyments, as sure as it did <hi>Adam</hi> out
of Paradise. And then alas! if I had none but him in Heaven, he is
now become my Adversary, holds possession against me, as he did that
of Paradise with flames; so he does <hi>Rain snares, fire and brimstone thence,</hi>
and <hi>this is all the Sinner's portion, Psalm</hi> xi. All that I am like to
get, unless I have a person that will attribute the cause, or mediate,
there is no hopes of a recovery for me if I have <hi>none in Heaven but
thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now here my last Consideration will come in.</p>
                  <p>If while my Soul lies grovling under fearful Apprehensions of its For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture,
casting about for help and finding none upon the Earth, if it
look upwards and enquire <hi>whom have I in Heaven?</hi> have I none there
but my offended Adversary God? it may resolve it self with comfort he
hath other interests there. For,</p>
                  <p>First, I have an <hi>Intercessor</hi> there, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 34. a Master of Requests,
one that will not onely hand in my Petitions, get access for my Prayers
and my tears to God, but will make them effectual: For saith S. <hi>Paul,
Seeing we have a great High Priest that's passed into the Heavens, let us
come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy and find Grace
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40114:205"/>
in time of need, Heb.</hi> iv. 14. 16. For though my supplications have not
strength nor ardour that can mount them into Heaven, and are too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
however wash'd in my repenting Tears, to draw nigh to the Lord,
yet being put into the High Priests Censor with the Altar coals to give
them holy flame, and wrap'd up in his Cloud and Smoak of Incense that
will cover all the failings of my Prayers, they may get access into his Ears
and his Compassions. Indeed how can they choose when Christ does
joyn his Intercessions? for my requests will go where the High Priests
do go; he carries them, now He himself doth <hi>sit at the right hand of
God:</hi> The intercessions that are made for me are made upon the Throne,
and therefore cannot be repuls'd from thence, and such desires command
and they create effects.</p>
                  <p>But should my Prayers fail,<note place="margin">Psalm iv. 1.</note> and should God <hi>hide himself from my Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,</hi>
withdraw himself and <hi>hide his face</hi> from them, although they
be even before his face. Yet.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I have an <hi>Advocate</hi> there too, 1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 1, 2. <hi>If any man
sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, and
he is the propitiation for our sins;</hi> one that not onely <hi>pleads</hi> for me, but
brings the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of my Forfeiture in his hands, makes the <hi>just va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
plead;</hi> appears there with his Blood, and proves a recompence.</p>
                  <p>'Tis <hi>Jesus Christ the righteous Advocate,</hi> that does <hi>propitiate</hi> and <hi>atone</hi>
son, what he <hi>pleads</hi> for; <hi>purchase</hi> what he begs. 'Tis true, that poor
Worm, saith he, hath provok'd thee often Lord! but thou didst <hi>smite
the Man that is thy fellow</hi> for it;<note place="margin">Zech. xiii. 7.</note> Behold my Hands, and look into my
Sides, see there thy Recompence; wilt thou refuse that Satisfaction thy
self didst contrive, and thy beloved Son did make? why did a Person of
the blessed Trinity descend from Heaven and Divinity to be made Sin
and be a Curse; but to Redeem him from the Curse and Sin, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
him again to the possession of Heaven and God? Why was I Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
but that thou might'st be aton'd and he be pardon'd? Thus he
solicites for us there, presents himself in our stead, as our Attorney.
He was not a publique Person onely on the Cross, but he is so at the
right hand of God; as he was there our Representative and bore our
sins, so he is here our Representative and bears our wants; was there our
Proxey to the Wrath of God, is here our Proxey to his Mercies and
Compassions. He looks upon himself as in our case, whose Cause and
Persons he supplies, and so is prompted to desire and beg for our poor
sakes, and he looks upon us as on himself, and so obtains as for his own
beloved sake, pleads as our selves, and then as to himself he does decree
Sentence and grant: For</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I have there a <hi>Judg,</hi> and this is he, <hi>who sits at the right
hand of God to Judg the quick and dead;</hi> I might have said a <hi>Saviour,</hi> for
he was exalted to a <hi>Saviour to give Remission of Sins:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts v. 31.</note> But my <hi>Judg</hi> is

                  <p>And it is strange that they who can look upon Hell, and charge

                  <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">1 Cor. xv. 23.</note> we have our <hi>first fruits,</hi> for so S. <hi>Paul</hi> does call our <hi>Saviour;</hi>
and then in whatsoever sense that which is done to the first Fruits is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to the Harvest (all this being hallowed in their Consecration)
in that sense we our selves are raised to the right hand of God together
with this our First Fruits. And now O Lord! <hi>whom have I in Heaven
but thee?</hi> I have <hi>my self</hi> in <hi>pledg</hi> and <hi>earnest</hi> there.</p>
                  <p>And then they that rather than have these Interests, these Heavenly
possessions in present, will have onely desires here on Earth, are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of a preverse and Reprobate choice. Sure it would make Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
sick to think of the comparison betwixt the after-expectations of a
Pious man, and those things which our worldly persons call present En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments;
how for the little spangles of their pride, they are so taken with
its rustling Pomp, they reject Glory that can never wither, fade, or sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
forfeit the being cloath'd upon with Immortality. How they lose
all that everlasting Heaven means, for little things that go by in a Whirl-wind,
come in storm and so they pass away; refuse inmortal <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs</hi>
for a Song, cast away solid Joys, and an Eternal weight of Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for froth, for the shadow of smoak. Perchance this may be said for
them, the nearness of the object does impose upon them, they choose
something in present rather than dry future hopes. But then when that
advantage to lies on the other side, their Choice hath no Temptation;
when the Pious mans possessions are in hand, the others onely in desire;
in view indeed they may be, he does catch at and pursue them still;
But the hinder Wheel of the Chariot that presses and with larger turns
and rowlings hastens after, may as soon hope to undertake the first, as
that man reach a satisfaction; still it removes, and he does onely heat
his appetite in posting after it, onely get more desire. Now 'tis prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
that these great Men of Sense should be men of such Faith and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
as to trust and hope in things that have so constantly, so daily
mock'd their confidences and desires, yet be not onely Infidels to all
Gods blessed preparations which they have nor reason nor Experience
against, but also have no sense nor relish of himself in present: <hi>Not taste
nor see how gracious the Lord is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis said, that the desires of Earthly sensual things do make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of the Torments of Hell: Now though this Doctrine be false
and pernicious, yet 'tis plain that Torment must attend strong passions,
and most infinite desires which are radicated in the Sinner's heart, and
which he carries hence and cannot there deposite, and to which yet satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
are impossible, against his knowledg to be mad, to have what he
knows all the World cannot make it possible for him to have, this tears
his Soul. Affections, these that may be said in some sense to fulfil some
of the expressions of the Torments of that place, their Envy makes the
<hi>gnashing of their Teeth,</hi> and their <hi>Desires</hi> are their <hi>Vultures.</hi> Thus <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi>'s
riotous hunger that does gnaw his bowels, is his <hi>Worm that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dies;</hi> and his intemperate thirst his <hi>everlasting burnings;</hi> and his
Water that he cannot reach or taste of, is his <hi>Lake of fire</hi> without Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor;
So that desire alone without its satisfaction, is so much of Hell,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40114:206"/>
and yet this is the worldly sensual mans estate exactly here on Earth;
for he hath nothing but <hi>desires</hi> and <hi>lusts;</hi> and his condition is not easier at
all, for how is <hi>Tantalus</hi> more wretched than a <hi>Midas,</hi> or than any covetous
wretch, who in the midst of affluence and heaps, hungers as much as
<hi>Midas</hi> did for <hi>meat</hi> and for <hi>Gold</hi> too, and an touch neither for his uses?
so that the Worlds delights are very like the miseries of Hell, and men
with so much eager and impatient pursuit do but anticipate their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and invade Damnation here.</p>
                  <p>And if the case be so, sure there is no great self-denial in our <hi>Psalmist</hi>
here, when he resolves to <hi>desire nothing upon Earth in comparison of his
God:</hi> 'Tis no such glorious conquest of my Appetite to make it not pursue
a present Hell, and an eternal one annex'd to it before a Saviour: Yet the
World does so.</p>
                  <p>Some there are that desire Money rather; and although when <hi>Judas</hi>
did so, this desire could not bear it self, but cast all back again; and
though it did disgorge, it burst him too; the Sin it self supply'd the
Law, and his guilt was his Execution. Yet this will not terrifie, men
will do the like, betray a <hi>Master,</hi> a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and a <hi>God;</hi> onely not for so
little money peradventure. Others, when the <hi>Lord</hi> paid his own Blood
for their Redemption, yet if their wrath thirsts for his Blood that does
offend them, their revenge makes their Enemies the sweeter blood,
though their own Soul bleed to death in his stream. To others the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servings
of the Partner of an unclean moment, are much greater than all
that the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> knew to merit at their hands or purchase for them.
And it is no wonder they are so ungrateful to their Saviour, when they
are so barbarous to themselves, as to choose not to have present Divine
Possessions rather than not suffer the vengeance of their own Appetites;
choose meerly to desire here, though that be to do what they do in <hi>Hell,</hi>
rather than <hi>have in Heaven.</hi> O thou <hi>my Soul!</hi> if thou wilt needs desire,
propose at least some satisfaction to thy Appetite, do not <hi>covet</hi> onely
<hi>needs thirst</hi> for a <hi>feaver,</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> meerly to <hi>inflame desire</hi> and <hi>Torments:</hi>
But seek there where all thy wants will find an infinite happy supply,
even in thy Saviour;<note place="margin">Rom. ii. 4. Ephes. i. 7. Zech. xiii. 1. Hagg. ii. 7.</note> covet the <hi>riches of his Grace and Goodness,</hi> thirst for

him? when <hi>we have him in Heaven,</hi> and we have nothing upon Earth

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall not break this single short Command asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
into Parts, but shall instead of doing that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>three Advents</hi> of our Saviour in this Life,
before that last to Judgment: For each of which
as it must concern us, there must be preparation
made by us. In pressing which I do not mean to
urge you to do that which none but God can do;
<hi>It is not in man to direct his own ways,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. x. 23. Prov. xvi. 1.</note> much less
the <hi>Lords; The very preparations of the Heart are
from him.</hi> Therefore supposing the preventings of his Graces, I shall
subjoyn, that the Comporting with those graces, the using of his
strengths to the rooting out of our selves all aversation to Virtue, and all
love of Vice; and planting other inclinations, even Resolutions of good
life, is the onely thing that can make way for Christ and for his benefits.</p>
                  <p>Now of those Advents, the</p>
                  <p>First was, when he came Commission'd by God to reveal his Will, to
propose the Gospel to our belief, the coming of <hi>Christ</hi> as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> which
particularly is intended in the Text.<note place="margin">ver. i. 2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus
Christ, as it is written, prepare ye the way of the Lord.</hi> The</p>
                  <p>Second was, that coming which the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> did foresee, and in
the astonishment of Vision ask'd,<note place="margin">Isay lxiii. 1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Who is this that comes from Edom?
with dy'd garments from Bozrah, travelling in the greatness of his Strength?
Why is he red in his Apparel, and his garments like him that treadeth
in the Wine-fat?</hi> And it was the Prospect of him when he came to tread
the <hi>Wine-press of the Wrath of God,</hi> to Sacrifice himself for us upon the
Cross, his coming as a <hi>Priest.</hi> The</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:40114:208"/>
Third is, when he comes to visit for Iniquity, coming coersively as a
<hi>King</hi> with his <hi>Iron Rod,</hi> to execute his threats on the rebellious; those
<hi>that will not have him reign over them:</hi> This coming also was consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in my Text;<note place="margin">Matth iii. 2, 3.</note> for in the parallel place of S. <hi>Matth.</hi> it is said, <hi>Repent,
for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, for this is he of whom it was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the Prophet Isaias, saying, the Voice of one crying in the Wilderness,
prepare yet the way of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For each of these in order, I shall shew you what prepares his way,
beginning with the first, His coming as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> appearing in the
World to reveal his Fathers' Will, the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Now the Preparative for this Appearance is discovered easily; we
find both in this Chapter, and the parallel places, that <hi>John</hi> came to
make way for it by the <hi>Baptism and Preaching of Repentance;</hi> and it
was Prophecied of him, <hi>that he should go before him in the Spirit and
power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the Fathers with the Children, and the
Disobedient to the Wisdom of the Just,</hi> (to the minding of just things)
<hi>so to make ready a people prepared for the Lord,</hi> Luke i. 17. And this is a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
so necessary, that the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> affirm, it is meerly for the
want of this that he does yet defer his coming: And though the appointed
time for it be past, yet because of their sinfulness and impenitence he does
not appear;<note place="margin">Talm. Hierof. Jaanlth. f. 64. 1.</note> adding <hi>If Israel Repent but one day presently the Messias com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
And it is thus far true, that though it hindred not his coming, yet
it hindred his receiving; although it did not make him stay, it made him
be refus'd. I may lay all down in this Proposition.</p>
                  <p>Where there is not the preparation of Repentance, where there are
not inclinations and desires for Virtue; if Christ come with the glad
tidings of the Gospel, He is sure to be rejected, his Religion disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd.</p>
                  <p>If the Word of the Son of God might be taken in his own case, this
would be soon evinc'd,<note place="margin">John i. 11:</note> for when <hi>He came unto his own,</hi> they were so far
from <hi>preparing his way,</hi> that <hi>they received him not,</hi> but did reject and would
not entertain him as one sent from God; of all this he onely gives this
account, that he found no other opposition but from vicious humours.
<hi>John.</hi> viii. 43, 44, 45. <hi>Why do ye not understand my speech? even because
ye cannot hear my Word: Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of
your father ye will do; and because I tell you the truth ye believe me not.</hi>
As if he should have said; the reason why you do not regard me or my
Doctrine, but reject us both, is not because my Doctrine hath not means
to convince your understandings, but 'tis not agreeable to your inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
The Works that I have done to make my person be received, and
my Words credible, are such as no heart how hard or blind soever can
withstand; but the Doctrine I bring along is most unwelcome, ye cannot
abide to hear it. Now as he that shuts his Eyes, or turns away his Face
because he hates to look upon an object, may not see it though it be all
cloath'd with day; as visible as Sunshine; so your blindness proceeds
hence that <hi>ye hate the light because your deeds are evil.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. iii. 19. 20.</note> Neither do
you love to hear that which you have no mind to practise; and you will
not be persuaded to believe that is your necessary duty, which you are
not willing to perform; but will rather choose to think I do my Works
by a confederacy with <hi>Belzebub the Prince of Devils;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. xii. 24.</note> although it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
that those Lusts which you will do, and which my Works and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40114:208"/>
come to drive out of the World, they are <hi>Lusts of the Devil;</hi> and
<hi>I, because I tell you the truth,</hi> truth I confess somewhat severe, and not
so agreeable, <hi>therefore you will not believe me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And is it not strange when nothing can be acceptable to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
but as it hath appearance of Truth, and when Truth comes with
evidence and demonstration, though it be but speculative useless truth,
yet it does seize and force aslent, that yet Christ's truths, which did not
want conviction, for they came to them with that infallibility which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
can give, should be therefore not believ'd because they were truths?
not strange at all: for his truths were not for their turns, nor humours.</p>
                  <p>And therefore he says to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxi. 32. <hi>Ye repented not that ye
might believe</hi> them. As if they assented not with their Understandings
but their Appetites: And we our selves have seen too much unhappy evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of men, whom <hi>Libertinism</hi> hath made <hi>Antimonians,</hi> whom a desire
of being <hi>loose from duty</hi> hath made <hi>Solifidians,</hi> of them whom <hi>sensuality</hi>
hath made <hi>Atheists;</hi> men that become Proselytes to their Lusts; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
of their base affections.</p>
                  <p>And we cannot expect it should be otherwise. For certainly that men
who are averse to the duties of Christianity, and cannot bend their minds
to the observance of that which Christs commands, should not care to
believe they are his Precepts or their duty is but very natural, they were
unwise should they do otherwise, it being far more reasonable to deny
the duty and obligation, than granting both, to trample on that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
which they do acknowledg, and to renounce that Duty which
they do confess. Is it not far more prudent to believe that there is not
a God that does regard our foolish actions here below, (which are not
more worthy or more likely to enter into his considerations, than the
buzzings of flies into the notices and observations of a Statesman;) than
if we do believe one does severely mark, will take a strict account of,
execute a vengeance for them, yet not incline our minds to leave them?
if we did suffer this belief to creep into our minds, to lie close unto our
hearts, sure it would fret off our aversness to Piety and inclinations to
sin; we durst not entertain them both together, these thoughts would
prove very ill company; they would distract and tear the mind, our
Souls would tremble and disjoint, and we be sure to put one of them
off.</p>
                  <p>Covetous and Adulterous <hi>Felix</hi> when he began to think that S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Sermon of a <hi>Judgment to come</hi> might be true,<note place="margin">Acts xxiv. 25.</note> straight be began to <hi>shake,</hi>
and then immediately to turn the Sermon off, <hi>bid S. Paul depart till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time.</hi> Nor can there any other reason be assigned for this; for in
the Systeme of Christs Religion there is not any thing but is so suited to
the very Constitution of a natural being, that the Soul would instantly
imbrace and suck in, if the prepossessions of Vices, which the mind will
not resolve to part with and repent of, did not infect, taint the Palate with
prejudices, did not keep out the belief. For the morality which it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
did long before the birth of this Religion make its way into the
Tenents and the Faith of every Sect of whole Mankind, it broke through
all the oppositions of corrupted Nature and deprav'd Habits; nor could
all the Devils arts (who then govern'd the World) stifle or quench the
Light of Reason, which through all that darkness did discover such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
in Vice, such strict agreement betwixt that which we call Virtue,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40114:209"/>
and a rational Creature, that they accounted it, and truly, the essential
duty of his nature; he that was wicked was reputed false to his own
being; as great an aberration from, and contradiction to Nature, as an
<hi>Animal</hi> that were <hi>insensible,</hi> or as <hi>cold fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this all the most distant Factions conspir'd in despite of Principles.
The <hi>Stoick,</hi> who by fettering all Events, all Consultations and Designs in
the lines of inexorable Destiny does seem to make all Virtue worthless,
all endeavours towards it useless, yet requires it with as strict necessity
as his Fate prescribes with; his reasons are as ineluctable as her Laws.
Nay he does seem to break his <hi>Adamantine Chain,</hi> to make way for this
<hi>Chain of Virtues,</hi> though his <hi>Jupiter</hi> were bound by that, yet for the sake
of these he leaves <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, our appetites, and actions in our power,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that so there may be
place for doing well while it is in our choice, and we are free to do it.
And on the other side, the greatest enemies to their necessity and to
choice too, the Sect that made all actions and things in the whole World
to be, not effects of any Agent that intended them, but meerly <hi>sports of
Chance and matter;</hi> who taught that their own souls were but the concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some Atoms casually met together without any direction and to
no end; yet the great Master of it in his <hi>Ethicks</hi> would not suffer any of
this blind Contingency to have to do in Humane actions, regulating them
by strictest Rules and Laws, and in plain contradiction to his Tenents
(from which our Age derives the most of their impiety) although he
held there was no God look'd on, nor after-life attended, none that did
see, or would reward or punish any of his actions, yet requires highest
Virtue, yea, and liv'd such too they say. In a word, many of them rais'd
Morality to such a pitch, as if it had arriv'd at the same heights from
whence our Christian Revelation did pretend to come. And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so peculiar to Christs Doctrine in the points of Morality, but you
may find it recommended by the Heathen as a thing which no external
obligation did impose, but the Law of their making did prescribe, which
they read in themselves, and Christian Morality is but a fairer and more
perfect Copy of the impressions of Reason on our Soul, clear'd from the
blurs and defects which they had been tainted with; but <hi>Naturales Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulae</hi>
Natures Decalogue, wrote by the Finger of the Lord: So that to
quarrel with Christ for requiring it, is the same thing as to be angry with
our Saviour because <hi>the nature of the Fire is such as does require that it
should burn.</hi> Nay many of them were so sensible of the unhappy state
of their Corruption, found so great pressures in themselves from the
weights of their vicious inclinations, discerned so perfect an antipathy
betwixt their being and their actions, that when with all the arts of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and the practice of their Philosophy they could not ease themselves,
they went to <hi>Sorcery</hi> and <hi>Magick</hi> for a Cure, receiv'd Catharticks, and a
discipline of purity from Hell, the Region of uncleanness; the Devil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them believe he would assist in casting out himself: Such were the
stress, the restlesness, the groans, the cry of Nature to be rid of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity.
These poor Souls were mistaken in their Method; but if the
Devil by those worships of his which they were us'd to, had not stop'd
the avenues, sure one would judg they had <hi>prepar'd the way for Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
there being no obstuction to it, nothing that can hinder its accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but the low esteem and aversation of Virtue: For if men believe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40114:209"/>
the Moral truths, they have no reason in the world to doubt the Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
these being intended for the most part as encouragements to those
other, as God's last attempts to kindle in us love of Virtue by such strong
incentives; that, that wherein <hi>Philosophy</hi> was <hi>ignorant,</hi> and the <hi>Law weak,</hi>
as having neither Promises nor Terrors equal to the force of our Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that the <hi>Gospel</hi> might effect, as having both to the utmost possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Divine Contrivance: Now this requires us to believe those Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturals
mostly for this reason, by believing them to make us perform
what it enjoyns. And it is apparent that because men would not do this,
therefore they will not believe those. Shew me but any one that is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere

upon that confidence they had of him by reason of his Piety: But in
reason why should he that does embrace the Piety, disbelieve that which
was propos'd to his belief only to urge him to embrace, only to crown
that Piety? Indeed he that accounts his Vices but sleight tricks of wit,
or folly; onely pleasant satisfactions to the desires of his Nature; (for
he understands no nature but his carnal one) he hath no reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there was a Passion of the Son of God,<note place="margin">Rom. viii. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>by making him a Sacrifice for
sin so to condemn sin in the flesh;</hi> is not prepar'd to think that there is
an Eternal weight of Indignation due and ready for it. He that hath
but mean thoughts of Virtue, counts it onely <hi>pedantry,</hi> or as it were the
<hi>Flatus of the Mind,</hi> making the <hi>Soul Hypocondriack,</hi> it is impossible that
he should think God was <hi>Incarnated</hi> and <hi>died</hi> to teach it by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Example, and to purchase graces to enable us to live it; or that
there is a Resurrection to reward it, a Trinity engag'd in working out
Salvation for it. I must confess I would believe, that men persuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that the reason of their disbelief is onely this, that these things are
not testified sufficiently; because I find <hi>the Man in Hell would have one
sent to his Brethren from the Dead, to testifie unto them of that place of
Torments,</hi> Luke xvi, 28. as if those Truths did want witnessing. But
this is not because enough hath not been done for their conviction in the
truth of Christ's Religion; for there is hardly any thing besides in the
whole World that men believe, but they believe upon less grounds. The
whole World was convinc'd in such a manner, as that millions chose to die
rather than not confess it; that many Ages prov'd but Centuries of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
unto that Truth; all Torments were more eligible than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of this Religion, which was confirmed so, that against all arts and
power of Opposition, against the Wit and Fury of the World, though all
the Subtlety, and all the Strength of Earth resisted it, yet it over-spread
the Universe. Besides it is most prudent to believe it too, for <hi>if there
be another World what then?</hi> There was enough done therefore; but
Corruptions suffer them not to attend to that which hath been done.
And 'tis no wonder they should do so at this distance, for they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
with Christs Miracles when present; and they were so uneasie under
the conviction of them, that rather than be prest so by the mighty power
of his Works, they did design to rid themselves of him that wrought

them, <hi>John</hi> xi. 47. you may find them strugling with his demonstrations
to keep off the Evidence, <hi>What do we? for this man doth many Miracles.</hi>
Yea, they do conspire against the Miracles themselves, and would put
<hi>Lazarus</hi> also to <hi>death,</hi> because he was <hi>raised from the dead;</hi> they could
not let the Evidence and the Conviction live, but they must murder that
too. Nay more, as if the pertinacy of their prejudices could do migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
Works than Christ, and could controul, and were above the power
of his Miracles, it is said to have bound his hands, and <hi>he could do no
mighty Works at Nazareth because of it,</hi> Mar. vi. 6. At least as saith
<hi>Theophylact,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

men were not capable they should be done. So that Christ did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
from Reason and Experience,<note place="margin">Luke xvi. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>If they believe not Moses and the
Prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead.</hi>
Such an amazing argument might probably astonish, but would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
unless it met with honest inclinations; for after the surprize of it
were over and had vanish'd, then the corruption that Bosom Sophister,
would stir, and goad; and urge incessantly; so that to ease himself, the
Man must find out some cross Scruple to weaken the force of that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and the <hi>Conviction</hi> would vanish like the <hi>Ghost.</hi> And if we should
examine the Experience of our selves and others, we should find that just
according to the rate of virtuous inclinations and dispositions of heart
to part with sin, so are men prepar'd for the belief of Christ; so are their
cares and regards of his Religion: He that is honestly inclin'd opens his
Soul to Christianity, for it speaks to his heart, 'tis right to the grain of
his Soul, he looks upon the Promises as made to him, and lays them up
as Gods encouragements of his inclinations, every thing in the Gospel
fits the temper of his mind. And he that is but pretty well disposed,
that loves Virtue for the most part, but does allow himself some one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
he always hearkens to Religion where it sets it self against
those Vices, which he hates, but as to his own particular evil inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
there he is a little Infidel, cannot persuade himself that God will be
so stern against a single pleasure, that one petty indulgence should be so
considerable, that it should provoke to those extremities the Bible threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens;

to get head and to command; and then by conversation with others that
mind nothing but satisfaction of those bents of the Brute part, that allow
themselves all the desires of constitution, are come to swill the pleasures,

enduring to be bound up in those narrow paths of Piety and Virtue, they
burst all the Obligations to them; seek little things to cavil at, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride,
hoping with those their poison'd Arrows, through the skirts, and

the Passage <hi>from the Garden in Gethsemane to Golgotha;</hi> There you
will see he does begin his Journey with the Amazements of an Agony,
and ended it in something like the horrors and the outcrys of Despair;
he travailed under such a load as made his life gush out through all the
parts of his whole Body, the weight of it did make his Soul faint by
the way; and when he was upon the Tree, crush'd it out, and made it
expire sooner than the stress of Nature would have done, and forc'd it
to burst out away <hi>in Prayers and strong Cries,</hi> that so he might sooner
escape from under that sad pressure. And then do but consider and look
on him under that representation which S. <hi>Paul</hi> does shew of him, how
all that time that he was creeping under that dire burden in that dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

                     </gap>, saith <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> in
that Way he pursued me till he catch'd me; his Agony was but his strife
to overtake me, his Sweat the issue of his Race: When he came down
from Godhead in his Incarnation, he pursued us then into our <hi>nature,</hi> he
laid hold of our <hi>Flesh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. Cxxix. 15.</note> and followed us from Heaven to the <hi>lowest parts
of the Earth.</hi> But when he went thus to his Cross here, he pursued us
then into our <hi>guilts,</hi> he laid hold of our <hi>sins,</hi> and <hi>took them up and bore
them on the Tree,</hi> then <hi>he descended into Hell</hi> to follow us. This as it
was formally done once for all, so in its virtue, influence, and bless'd ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
'tis still in doing, as to thee, and me, and all of us; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
season is to represent it so. Now sure we need no motives to
prepare the way for him <hi>who runs that he may obtain our Salvation,</hi> who
though he laboured under such a dismal burden, yet still presses on to
catch us, so to rescue us from sin and Hell: If he think fit, and can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to strive thus, I will make all ready, and stand fair to have my guilt
seized from me, and to be laid hold on for my Blessedness, to be the
Prize, the Crown of all Christ's Agonies, that which he thinks worthy

Now the same Preparation is required here, that made way for his
other coming, that is, Repentance, in one word, a disposition and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
desire of heart to part with every evil and corrupt affection, to quit
every sin. Sin lying in the way made it so dreadful, God <hi>laid upon him
the iniquity of us all,</hi> and that weight threw him prostrate on the Earth,

weight of those that were clog'd with Impenitence, this was more heavy,
more afflictive to him than his Cross. To bewail this and the issues of
it he left off to consider his own Sufferings and required others also
to do so,<note place="margin">Luke xxiii. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Weep not for me, weep for your selves.</hi> And sure it was for

so amazing to him:<note place="margin">Luke xxii. 43, 44.</note> It was for this the Angel that came from Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
to comfort him, left him still in Agonies, could not do it, because

                  <p>A Progress this, I confess, that is not usual to our King, nor is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Method of his Government:<note place="margin">Isai. xxviii. 21.</note> God call'd it his <hi>strange Work</hi>
under the Law, and much more is it so under the Gospel, when he Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns

a triumphal Garland, as he were all Ensign of Victory, all verdant
spreading Conquest. Yea, and when <hi>the Ax is at the root of the Tree,</hi>
we know not whether it designs it for the <hi>Temple</hi> or the <hi>Kitchen,</hi> to make
a <hi>Fire,</hi> or to make a <hi>God.</hi> The Day that cometh shall declare all, when
the delay both of Rewards and Punishments shall be compensated with

                     <hi>that walk after their own lusts,
and say, where is the promise of his coming?</hi> For except that the Fathers
fell asleep, some men are dead and others risen in their place, all things
else continue as they were from the beginning, there always were vicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situdes
of Flourish and Decay in every Nation, and in these things there
are no footsteps of a Providence or Judgment: In days when men resist
and deny thy Hand because they do not feel it; and since thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are removed out of their sight, defie Thee too, and dash thy self
out of the World; in such days 'tis but just that thou shouldst come to
their conviction, and confute them with thy Judgments into Ruine.
And truly since it must be horrid provocation that makes him come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the compass of his Covenant to Revenge, the Executions are most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
very fatal, as if they were what they seem to prevent, the last Day,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40114:211"/>
and the final Doom upon such Nations. For to the <hi>Jews</hi> they look as if
they had fulfilled all that the Prophecy was mistaken to foretel, and were
as irreversible and utter as the Sentence of the Day of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Now to prepare for such Approaches of the Lord our King, there is
one onely means, that is, resolving Fealty and Allegiance to him, and
that not formal onely, or but idle Homage, but renouncing all Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy
with his Enemies, Sin, and the Devil, and serving him with all
the heart and all the strength. For he is that King in the 19. of S. <hi>Luke,</hi>
who did not onely cause his contumacious Enemies, <hi>such as would not
have him to reign over them</hi> to be slain before him, <hi>v.</hi> 27. making his way
over their Necks whose Hearts he could not set up his Throne in; not did
onely cause those Servants who were so far from preparing his Way,
that upon confidence <hi>he delay'd his coming they smote their fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and did eat and drink with the drunken;</hi> were unjust to others,
and indulg'd themselves in all licentious living, cause them to be <hi>cut
asunder, and to have their portion in the Region of weeping,</hi> where these
intemperate should have onely tears to drink, and for their Riots onely
gnashing of teeth, Teeth ready to revenge their former Luxuries on
themselves, gnashing as to devour one another, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiv. 48. But
he is that King too that Executed <hi>Sloth</hi> as well as <hi>Treason,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> xxv.
30. who having given one a Talent, trusted him with abilities of doing
service in the station he had put him in, which for his not endeavouring
to do, though he corrupted not his faculties, because he buried them
and did not use them, but indulg'd to idleness, condemn'd him therefore
to <hi>utter darkness,</hi> to the proper Mansion of the slothful, all whose time
can be nothing but <hi>night,</hi> since his whole Life is but as sleep. But in a
word, S. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath said all, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
hand; as it is written, prepare ye the way of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here to stop, and to reflect at once upon our selves and this which
hath been said: And first, on this <hi>last way</hi> by which he comes as a <hi>King</hi>
in Executions.</p>
                  <p>Here I cannot but take notice, that we have some that do design
and act among us as if they were <hi>this King's Harbingers,</hi> his <hi>Pioneers</hi>
rather, to prepare the way for his invasion on us; or were his <hi>forlorn
hope</hi> sent out to give the onset of his Executions, and were sure of <hi>Him</hi>
in the <hi>reserve</hi> to second them: Truly their Threats and their Attempts
are big and Insolent, and most mens expectations are not very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
                  <p>To say with some, this Confidence of theirs is built on the non<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Laws (which seems slighter than in the old Comparison
of Cobwebs) for notwithstanding their fine close contexture, there are
holes left for Spiders to creep through; and not the great Flies onely,
every ruffling and befriended Sinner whether by his Money or Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but the lesser too, now they have learn'd to fly in Swarms, break
through, to say that were a Complaint out of my sphere.</p>
                  <p>And <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> truly when I think on the temper of their fury, how it is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the fire of Execution, charges Death not onely in the Field, but
on the Scaffold too; I must needs think it hath some stronger Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and there is something of Religion in it.</p>
                  <p>Now really there can be nothing else of that but an opinion of the
great defection of Vertue in their Enemies: Open Prophaness, publique

to <hi>the Throne of Grace,</hi> his <hi>Cross;</hi> the Second thing.</p>
                  <p>And should we not prepare his Way to that by our Repentance, we
were false to our own actions that pretend to do it, unjust to the time
that calls for it, but most unkind to Christ and to our Souls.</p>
                  <p>What in that fatal Race, and under all that load he did stretch and
press on so to lay hold upon us, to seize our sins and Sacrifice them in
himself, that then we should retain them, should not let him have
them, but cling to them still; that when he was upon the Cross with
naked Breast and open Arms, as it were ready to receive all wounds sin
could inflict, and every wickedness of ours had a stab at his Heart, that
we should still reserve the envenom'd Ponyard, keep the malice of the
wickedness to Crucifie Him to our selves afresh, and kill our selves also for
ever! That we should suffer him to swoon and Die under the burden of
our guilt, yet we our selves resolve to keep and not to quit the guilt! For
do not you deceive your selves, Christ did not take away the guilt of any
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40114:212"/>
one sin, from any man that does not part with it, but still retains the sin;
that would imply a contradiction: Such men are so far from preparing
the Lords way to his Cross, that that whole Journey was to them in
vain: They will not let him have their sins to bear upon the Tree, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
their Priest a Sacrifice for them when he was going to the Altar.</p>
                  <p>Indeed they that come to the Celebration of his Passion thus dispos'd,
plant troubles in his way to his Cross, and make it more grievous; yea
they obstruct his passage thither even when they wait upon him to it:
Those that come with indevotion to attend that sad Procession, such as
they usually go to their Prayers with; these are so far from making his
Way smooth and easie, that 'tis they that throw him in that Journey
prostrate on his Face, and cast him into Agonies of Prayer, so to expiate
and instruct their little sense of that to which such Sufferings were due,
and which must have such deprecations. They that come thither with
their swelling scornful Prides and their Ambitions, lay Hills in his way,
and when he is so heavy laden and so weak, they make him climb up
Precipices, whence their Scorns too throw him down again with his
Cross and Incumbrances upon him. All these heights must be levell'd
and <hi>the Mountains be brought low,</hi> if we prepare the way for him. The
Gaudy people, they that spend the severe hours of this sad Season, and
of the preparation for that Passion in the Arts and labours of Attire,
that mortifie and punish themselves onely in cares and in Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
to make and dress up Beauties, and the study of these enters with,
thrusts out the grand concerns of their own Souls, and the employments
of this time, even which they are about: These doubtless are attir'd in
Funeral conformity to wait upon him to his Cross, on which he had no
other dress but the rags of his own Skin: Come they not rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his nakedness, and shame him from themselves, that so he may go
by and not take notice of them in his passage, nor be concern'd for them
in his Sufferings? The Hypocrites either to God or to their Brethren,
that have onely the Ceremonies, the Civilities of Honesty of Religion,
make shew of both, but yet are false to God, and insincere with Man,
cruelly betraying or deluding, yea enraging those necessities which with
fair speeches they pretend to smooth and salve; they act over again the
treacherous malice of his Persecutors, who under the kindness of the
Cup of Consolation which was given to them that were condemn'd to
Die, namely, <hi>Wine mingled with Myrrhe</hi> to chear the Heart and cloud
the Understanding, and so lessen sense of Suffering, in scorn and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
gave him <hi>Vinegar and Gall,</hi> which though it counterfeit the other
taste, serves onely to prolong life for more future Torment. The Swearer
stabs him all along his Journey; and the Men of Black Designs and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
they pour Venom in those Wounds.</p>
                  <p>But why stand I thus to enumerate particulars? All such come not
to the Redemption of the Day, but onely to the Scene: Amidst other
like Entertainments of this Holy severe Time which the Theater affords,
they come also to see the <hi>Tragedy of Jesus,</hi> to behold the dead march to
<hi>Golgotha,</hi> indifferent and unconcern'd in that (as in the rest) whether
there were such a procession in earnest, or whether he did come at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
which casts me on his other coming, the last thing, his coming in
the first Revealing of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:40114:213"/>
And here I hope I shall have no reflections to make as to preparing
for this coming. Christ certainly did find his Way prepared so to this
Nation, that we believe he was more early entertain'd in it, than almost
any where in the whole <hi>Gentile World:</hi> And ever since his cares for it
were so particular, that they, who would fulfil the Revelation in this
Church, seem to err with some reason, when as his regards were so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
for this, as if he had not concern'd himself in any other. And sure
none other ever had so long, such opportunites and advantages; so that
I cannot press you to <hi>prepare the Lord's Way,</hi> since <hi>he is among us. Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
art thou O Lord!</hi> and <hi>wonderful in thy Mercies! yet if I might
plead with Thee concerning them,</hi> I would enquire what hast thou done
here all this while after thy so long abode among us? what are we the
better? The last attempt of God to reclaim Man, when he had shewed
the World all other means were fruitless, was by <hi>Thee his Son!</hi> by whom
he did conveigh all the full measures of his Graces; and now what effect
of these is there in us? Shew me how all this care and cost hath made
<hi>us</hi> be <hi>more just, sober,</hi> or <hi>chast;</hi> in any way <hi>more virtuous</hi> than those
<hi>Heathens</hi> whose <hi>Religion came from Hell?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke x. 18.</note> We find Thee saying, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
Sathan as Lightning fall from Heaven,</hi> his Power vanishing like that
which does but flash and perish, never can be recollected. But alas!
that falling flash hath kindled foul heats that will break out into Fire
and Brimstone. <hi>Idolatry</hi> 'tis true, is profligated hence; the <hi>Devil</hi> is not
worshipped as he was with a Religion of Impieties, Uncleannesses, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
and the like: But yet the same things are now made to consist
with thy Religion, as well as with that of the Devil, and we can do all
those things and be Christians. Some, as if their Profession were a Charm
which made them shot-free from Gods threats do they what they will,
they will adventure any the most desperate Impiety and choose Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in a sin, and yet believe, be confident, and so secure. On others it
does work indeed the <hi>Form of Godliness,</hi> makes them such perfect <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants
of Religion,</hi> that they oft fall in love with their own <hi>Vizour,</hi> and
please themselves as if their <hi>dress</hi> were <hi>Nature,</hi> while yet under that
<hi>form</hi> there are the greatest falsnesses, and black treacherous designs, the
most unjust and Bloody practices that even make the <hi>Form of Godliness</hi>
look dismal; and yet all this joyned with so much <hi>superciliousness,</hi> with
such <hi>difference to Christ,</hi> that you would say the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were now all
of <hi>Christ's side.</hi> And is this all the Lord came hither for? to be a <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary</hi>
for the <hi>prophane,</hi> a <hi>Cloak for Hypocrites?</hi> Give me leave to relate
a Story I have read <hi>of four or five Vessels of</hi> Portugals <hi>who were Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack'd
to the drowning of almost five hundred men,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Voyages of Mendez Pinto,</hi> Chap. 19.</note> onely fifty three esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and they were left naked and hurt upon an Island Desolate,</hi> as the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> Wilderness, which needed the same Miracle to sustain them, and
found the like: For God as it were <hi>rained Fish upon them;</hi> and so did
that which kept them alive, <hi>till at last they espyed a large Boat of</hi> Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses
<hi>making to the shore to take in Water in that Island, and the people
coming all to Land for their refreshment; which they seeing, resolved to
make themselves the Masters of their Boat and Goods, and go away in it:</hi>
A man would have thought their own sad state in that Land of Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should have taught them Compassion; at least Gods Mercies to them
should have taught them Justice to others. But when men have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
great signal instances of Gods Protecting mercies, they think then
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40114:213"/>
that they are his Favourites, and then they may do any thing: <hi>They
therefore got into a Wood near the Shore and Boat, and it was ordered among
them, that when the Captain should pronounce</hi> Jesus <hi>three times, then they
should run out of the Wood and seize the Vessel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lord! would not such a word be a Spell and Charm against unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
inhumane, and unjust Designs? would it not exorcize all impious
Contrivances? It is no new thing to preface mischief with an holy
Name, and bring in Jesus in the Prologue to Iniquity; to talk of God
and act the Devil. <hi>They seiz'd it, and driving from the Land, left the
true Owners of the Vessel to possess their misery; Being secure, they search'd
and found no person in it but a Child of thirteen years of age, and they
fell to what Victuals they met, and having eaten, with hands lifted up they
praised God solemnly, and then proceeded to cut out and share the Silks and
Riches of the Vessel: The Boy seeing all this, and drown'd in Tears would
not be comforted by them, who promised him all friendly usage; but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
rather to go Die with his Father than live with such wicked people:</hi>
Being reprehended for that Speech, <hi>Would you know,</hi> said he, <hi>why I said
it? Because I saw you when you had fill'd your Bellies praise your God with
hands lift up, and yet for all that, like Hypocrites, never care for making
restitution of what you have stollen, but be you sure that after Death you
shall feel the rigorous Chastisement of the Lord Almighty.</hi> The Captain
admiring would needs persuade him to be a Christian: Whereunto ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
beholding him, he answered; <hi>I understand not what you mean,
declare it first, and you shall know my mind: And being told by them of
the blessed Authour and the purity of our Religion,</hi> what God did to Redeem
us from our sins, and what holy Laws he hath left us: <hi>With Eyes and
Hands lift up, he weeping, said; Blessed be thy Power O Lord! that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
such people to live on the Earth that speak so well of Thee, and yet
so ill observe thy Law as these blinded Miscreants do, who think that Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
and Preaching are things that can be acceptable to thee: And so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to his Tears and obstinacy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To see the strictness of the Christians Obligations, and the loosness
of their Lives, to see their Practices dash against their Professions! 'Tis
such a thing as makes them be the Scorn of honest Heathen Children.
And is this all that men are required to <hi>prepare the way of the Lord for?</hi>
Is this all he can do after so many Centuries of the abode of him and his
Religion among us? While there is no more of his influence appears, I
must suspect he is not here, <hi>the Lord is not among us,</hi> but is gone. And
certainly if it be possible to drive him out, if there be any Art of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, we have Professors of that Mystery, and the <hi>Drolls</hi> are <hi>they.</hi>
That men should sin against him by transgressing of his Laws is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for there is invitation to it in the Blood: That some did count
him an Impostor is not strange, they had not met it may be, with
means of Conviction, or were prepossest with prejudice; but while men
own his Person and Religion, to have a <hi>God</hi> onely to make them <hi>sport,</hi>
as it hath no temptation, so it hath no measures of its guilt: <hi>Atheism</hi> is
an honest refuge from this Vice; it being much more sober and rational
to think there is no God, than 'tis to make a mock of him whom they
profess to be so. This is indeed to prepare his way to his Cross, for so
the <hi>Jews</hi> and Soldiers did, they put a <hi>Scepter in his hand</hi> onely to take
it out and smite him with his Scepter, they <hi>bowed the knee and cry'd
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40114:214"/>
Hail King,</hi> and so humbly spit in his Face, and they <hi>put a Crown,</hi> but
'twas of <hi>Thorns,</hi> on his Head: thus they <hi>Worship'd</hi> him <hi>in scorn</hi> and <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd</hi>
him with his <hi>Dignities.</hi> And so we serve <hi>Religion:</hi> When we
would have a Scene of Mirth, that must be put in a ridiculous disguise
to laugh at, the <hi>Son of God</hi> must enter <hi>Travesty,</hi> and our Discourse is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the <hi>Gospel in Burlesque.</hi> And is it not time for him to retire?
But O <hi>prepare not this path</hi> for him to <hi>go away in.</hi> The Heathens
thought it much more possible to Chain their Deity, than to be safe if
he were gone, Any the strangest contradiction is more easie, than Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
without him. Now if you but make up S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chain, that
will hold your God sure:<note place="margin">2 Pet. i. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Add to Faith</hi> (that's the first Link that unites
us to him,) <hi>Vertue, and to Vertue Temperance,</hi> and the other Graces
nam'd there.<note place="margin">Malach. iii. 7.</note> If he were going; yet <hi>Return unto me, and I will return
unto you saith the Lord:</hi> If you do but prepare to meet him in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this Season, you are sure to find him at his Cross: and if we do
but lay hold on him there, and by the mortifications of a true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
partake in his Death; He that is <hi>the Way and the Life</hi> will through
that dust and ashes from that Death, make a way for us to his Eternal
Life. To which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <q>This is the Victory which overcometh the World,
even our Faith.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese Words, though they explicitly make onely
one single Proposition, yet they imply several.</p>
                  <p>First, That <hi>the State of Christianity is a state
of Warfare;</hi> He that is born of God must fight
we see, for <hi>he must overcome;</hi> which is the</p>
                  <p>Second; In this War he must not satisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with being on his Guard; defensive, looking
to secure himself, but he must Assault and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
nothing else will serve his turn but Victory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Enemy</hi> which he must have no Peace with, but must
vanquish, <hi>is the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Faith is sufficient forces to assist him in his Conquest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Faith where it is rightly made use of is a certain Victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I shall not handle these in <hi>Thefi</hi> thus, but for the more practical
treating of them shall make and answer three Enquiries.</p>
                  <p>First, What the way is that the World does wage War in? where its
Strength lies? and how it manages that force so as to get advantage
over men? and how it does improve each such advantage till it gets a
perfect Conquest?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What the strengths of Faith are? how it charges, breaks
the forces of the World, and does enable the Believer to overcome?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How far the Believer must pursue his Conquest? what must
be the measures of his Victory? that he may know how to vanquish it
so as that the World may not rebel again; not do like <hi>Joash</hi> smite three
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40114:215"/>
times, then leave, but Smite until he make an end of danger: Having
answered these, I shall endeavour to apply all to our selves.</p>
                  <p>Now for the better handling of the first of these, I must shew you
how the Will of Man may be attaqued and taken.</p>
                  <p>To which purpose I observe, that whatsoever liberty there is in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
choice, yet every appetite seems in some sense determin'd in its
tendencies to fix on that which appears simply best for it, for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
which it chooseth in; I do not say that whensoever Reason pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
concludes a thing is best that the Will is determined instantly
to that; for by a too unhappy evidence we know, that if the lower Soul
does but becken the <hi>Will</hi> another way, she can suspend and stop her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,
and too oft finds cause to go along with that against the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of the Mind: But this I say, that in her last Executive Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
she always tends to that which hath the fairest and most vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
appearances of being best for her at that present time. If it seem
strange how, since the Understanding can account the certain expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of an happy everlastingness much better for the present, than a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany
worldly satisfaction; (for we have our Rules and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
by which we rate and choose Reversions rather than Possessions,
and those of the other World exceed these beyond all the measures of
proportion, and the Understanding does inform impartially of this:)
How then if the <hi>Will</hi> can let those go and take these it can be said al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to choose the better for the present? if it may be said to do so
though it let those go, then by what wash or Chymick Artifices does
she blanch or paint these so as to make them look better for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent?
Now we may discover how these both may be, if we onely reflect
upon the manner of the actings of our own Souls. Where the things
that stand in competition for our choice are both of the same kind, and
have one common measure of their good or ill; (as for example, are
both painful, or both profitable, or delightful) and no con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ideration of
any other motive comes into the Ballance; here the <hi>Will</hi> must needs
choose the best, refuse the worst. For meerly out of aversation to pain
to run into the stronger Pain, avoid the less; or out of Covetousness to
refuse greater Wealth; or for delights sake onely to prefer that which is
less delightful, are practical contradictions. Where the Objects are of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
kinds, one for example, profitable or delightful, but not without
sin; and the other Vertuous, and spiteful Reason taking Vertues part,
suggests the motives to it, Gods Commands, his Promises, and Threats;
here, though the inferiour faculties prostitute all their baits, they cannot
equal those proposals to the <hi>Will</hi> 'tis true; yet by their importunacies
still pressing her, goading her by their stings, they can and do prevail
with her to call the Understanding off from her attention to those other
motives, and employ the thoughts upon the present Object that does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
her so, and which by the agitations it does cause within the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
part, puts the mind in disorder presently, distracts the thoughts,
then seizes them; so that the Understanding being now intent to this,
the better motives are let go and sink, and then the onely ones in view
are those of sense, which straight the <hi>Will</hi> rushes into the imbraces of, and
the other being vanish'd and no better than appearing, 'tis plain in those
she sixes on the best. But if the mind will not be taken off, but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
fly in the Man's Face and will not let him rest, nor his <hi>Will</hi> fix,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40114:215"/>
why then in this unquietness of hers she sets the thoughts on work and
will not let them fix till they find out some <hi>salvo</hi> that can satisfie Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality
and Conscience too, that will let the Man have the sin and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him of Gods Favour: And if either <hi>application of Gods Decrees</hi> and
<hi>Promises without Condition</hi> absolutely to himself, and <hi>the assurances of Faith
and trust</hi> will do it, (as we may know it will in some) or if not that,
then if <hi>hopes of mercy, resolutions of repenting afterwards</hi> and <hi>leaving off</hi>
the sin, (as this does do with most) then it is evident in choosing to
obey his inclinations, with such <hi>salvo</hi> the man chooseth that which does
appear best for the present. But if the mind unsatisfied with these, and
not daring to trust such rotten planks against the very face of storm, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the uncertainty, at least, of these Principles, and the unsafeness of
those after-hopes, not fit to be security against God's Threats, and would
convince the man that conscience of resisting a temptation, and by that
keeping himself free from the clutches of the Devil, and the fears of Hell,
together with present assurance of God's favour, are more satisfying at
the present than the pleasures of the sin: Yet those pleasant apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Conscience of resisting re-encountering with the seeming im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
of resisting alway that which presses so, and will some time or
other seize upon him, and finding the temptation to have sharper stings
than his Religious fears of things which are not present, and of which he
hath had no experience: And besides, he having never had any great sense
of God's favour and rewards, the Landskip of them is but dim and
faint upon the mind like those representations blind men have of Beauty
(to whom if you discourse of exact features, perfect harmony of colours,
of a graceful presence, chearful air, and a good mine, and all those other
know not whats, that being seen commit a Rape upon mens faculties,
yet his conceptions of them are but very dark, who never hath had any
notices of these but such as his Ears give) and though the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chance to be positive and resolute in its determinations concerning
them, yet still the apprehensions of them are not clear; futurity, which
is one sort of distance, making objects, as all things afar off do, look but
confused, and their <hi>Ideas</hi> not distinct, nor bright or brisk, therefore they
move the <hi>Will</hi> but very coldly: Whereas the other pleasure being known,
the apprehensions of it are more vigorous, the draught is strong and lusty
on the Fancy, there is force in every line, the very image of it lives, and
therefore is more efficacious, and by that prevails, that looking fairest
and most tempting at that present, so that from this experience of our
selves in every sort of instance thus deduc'd, the <hi>Will</hi> does seem always
to fix on that which appears simply best for it, for that instant which it
chooseth in; the man still takes what he likes better at that present,
and he likes better that which looks better for that present: And things
are made to look better by these Arts which I have shewed you.</p>
                  <p>This being now the temper and the disposition of the <hi>Will,</hi> and such
the method of her actings, this is the thing the World makes use of,
here's its strength, namely, in making things look better for the present.
Which how it manages so as thereby to get advantages upon us, how
it does improve each such advantage till it get a perfect Conquest, I
shall give you in few words; by shewing you how the World gets first
possession of our Souls, and there raises in us passionate desires that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
present satisfaction, which it hath at hand to serve them with,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40114:216"/>
which by these arts are made look better than any other expectations.</p>
                  <p>It was observ'd by the Philosopher most truly, that a Child is born
onely an <hi>Animal,</hi> is to be <hi>Educated, and brought up into a Man:</hi> His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is the birth of time and institution, for a while nothing but sense
does live in him. Now all that while he is incapable of being affected
with any other things, but such as strike the senses, things of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
World; and by that means only such possess his mind and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
too, the uses and advantages of every thing about him are those he
is first sensible of, and those alone: and so the World does make the first
impressions on our Souls, it does prevent all other in our inclinations,
hath our first love and enjoys our first embraces, from which it must
be with great reluctancy that we are torn; and whereas these impressions
should be weakened and defac'd by the infusion of other Notions and
Principles, and the Soul should be weaned from too great liking of these
sensitive satisfactions by the cares of those which should be as <hi>assistant
souls</hi> to us, denying us every thing that was not very requisite or very
moderate, that we might learn to want them, and be taught not to desire
them. The contrary alas! is practis'd every way, as soon as e're the mind
is capable of being trained into the World's snares we betray it into them,
we teach it how to understand and be affected with the bait, and those
pomps which we but just before made them renounce, we make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any things know, and be pleas'd with; and the first blossom of the
mind wherein the Soul exerts it self for the most part is Pride: And
for the rest the old complaint is true, <hi>ante palatum eorum quàm os institui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
we teach their Palates sooner than their Tongues, and they can cry
for what they cannot name; and yet among their first half words they
can name Dainties; and what will he not lust for when he is grown up,
that is taught to desire provocatives e're he can chew them? Thus we
teach the gayeties and the delights of the World how to insinuate into
and take the heart; we water and keep warm the seeds of Worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
that are there, make them sprout and cherish them, nurse up
original propensions into temper: And as Understanding grows up, we
impregnate it with Principles and arts of serving them, turn Reason into
a sagacity and skill of catering for those Inclinations, making them
like <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s observation backwards, educating them into Creatures of
meer sense, teaching them to be <hi>rational understanding Brutes.</hi> Yet the
World thinks <hi>sic fiunt homines,</hi> this is call'd <hi>making them Men betimes:</hi>
And when they are thus made, when the age of satisfying all their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
is come, and when Temptations are understood, and multiply by
Conversation, and the World hath Objects for them all at hand; Objects,
that what ever way they turn their Eyes are still before them and thrust
themselves into the mind and the advantages that do attend them, and
by constant importunacy stir and work desires and serve them too; then
we are in that state in which the World hath those advantages I told you
of, whereby it does not onely war against the Principles of Reason and
Religion in us, but it also leads the Will into Captivity, and enslaves her
to it self. For it is plain the World hath got possession of the heart, and
hath a strong party of heady passions, which whensoever a Temptation
does alarm them, presently are up, raise a mutiny, and with the heat of
Fancy and commotion of affections they disorder the Understanding so,
that it cannot rally up considerations against the assault, but either it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40114:216"/>
concludes, or disputes very faintly: If it do make an effort and struggle,
it is but with a slender company of thin weak notions of things afar off,
which the man hath had no proof of, nor hath any great confidence in;
which while it is in recollecting and enforcing, the World hath its powers
ready, seizes on the Will by the means of a corrupted fancy that does
give it earnest, foretast, even the possession of the well-known pleasures
that it does invite to, and so melts him down into the sin. Now while
the present Profits, Pleasures, Honours that I have from the World fill
me, while they feed and cloath me, and provide me all that my neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
or wantonness can wish, and furnish me in hand with whatsoever
any of my natural or my forc'd Appetites do gape for, and lull me with
that constant variety of those delights which it procures, the use of
which hath so drunk up my Spirits, and my Soul hath so imbib'd the
joys, that I know not how to retrench from them, nor from that which
is to furnish them. Must I leave all these for things that I have had no
taste nor rellish of? leave all in present for some future hopes which
I have no great confidence of compassing if I should try? and which I
also see that very few venture for? Whereas Mankind is swallowed up
in the pursuit of these, and to be stor'd with them does not onely serve
my needs and Luxuries, but it is the onely state of Reputation and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
'Tis not from a rich stock of vertuous qualifications, nor from
great and glorious Actions that Esteem and Dignities do generally grow,
but from worldly advantages, these constitute conditions, and these are
their onely Characters. And being it is so, they that are in a Sphere
above the ordinary ranks of people, must contrive those things that are
become essential to their condition; and they must have worldly Pomps
although with the expence of Piety, or Charity, and Justice, yea, of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Christian Duty; of Morality indeed, and Heathen vertue, of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
it self: They will extort, be ravenous and cruel, will be false and
treacherous, cheat and betray to get, and purchase at the price of the
most disingenuous, sneaking and unmanly sins: To undermine another
they will dig to Hell, as if they meant to give fire to their Mine with
the flames of that place whence they have the malice and the arts to do
it: And as if they did not care to sink him thither who stands in their
way to stop their rise; they are content to dye their purple with their
own most guilty blushes, and the blood of any one that is their Rival
or Competitor.</p>
                  <p>Add to this, that when these pretences of Condition have got footing
in the heart, besides those passionate desires which they stir for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they work out most unquiet Emulations, Envies, Discontents at
others. In whatsoever any other does exceed me, his Abundance is my
want, straight I am in necessity, not from my own needs, but from his
possessions, and I suffer his enjoyments; I labour, fret, and sink under the
burden of his Honours, and his greatness is inflicted on me. Nor can
I ever be at rest till I am got from under the sad pressure of that deep
necessity of having what I see another have. And thus it will be, till
Ambition have no further Object, till there be no greater heights to
mount. And now this Lust is in its pride, and the victorious World in
its Triumphal Chariot. Not that I dare pretend that I have shewed you
all the Chains by which it drags captive Souls after it, or all the Arts of
Tyranny that it does execute: I could name many more, but he alone
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40114:217"/>
is able to discover all,<note place="margin">Matth. iv. 8, 9.</note> that <hi>in the twinkling of an Eye did once shew all
the Kingdoms of the World, and all the beauty of them, and who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to bestow them all</hi> for <hi>but one single act of Worship,</hi> and whose gift
the Glories of it are for the most part, and purchased by those very means.
My business is to pull it down from this great height, and shew you
how to triumph o're these Conquests; which my Text says is done by
<hi>Faith, for this is the Victory that overcometh the World even our Faith:</hi>
Which how it does, is my second next Enquiry.</p>
                  <p>It seems a prejudice to this Assertion of my Text, that the great
pretenders to Faith, the men that lay the whole stress of their Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Being on believing onely, have been branded to be very Worldly;
and the Factions of Godliness were the mysteries and arts of Thriving;
as if their <hi>Faith</hi> laid hold <hi>indeed upon the Promises of this Life,</hi> and if it
<hi>overcame the World,</hi> it was for them to <hi>seize</hi> and be <hi>possessors of.</hi> But
this is not the Victory my Text secures, a Conquest for the Faith onely
of <hi>Mahomet</hi> to make: And while Christian Votaries do onely mind such
Conquests, and are candidates of <hi>Turcism,</hi> do they not call it in, and
make way for their Sword and their Religion? But the Faith that lays
hold on Christ's Promises cannot consist with any such affections. For
since Christ's Promises are made onely to those that overcome all such
desires, and that do it to the end, and none other can be safe; It is
impossible for him that does not overcome to trust upon those Promises,
and to apply them to himself by Faith: For at once to believe I shall be
saved, and yet believe those sayings which affirm none such can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
these are most inconsistent. It being then as casie to make contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
be at peace, as <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worldliness,</hi> they cannot suffer one the
other; it follows: He that hath this Faith in sincerity must needs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the World. And to shew you in a word how it is done, you need
not but to consider, that Faith is as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>the substance of things
hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen, Heb.</hi> xi. 1. Which as the
<hi>Syriack</hi> translates, does say, that Faith is such a certainty of those things
that we hope for, as if we actually had them; and it is the revelation of
those things that are not seen, it hath so strong a confidence in God,
that the Believer assures himself of all Gods Promises and Threats, as
much as if they were in sight; and though <hi>we see them through a glass
but darkly,</hi> yet we see them by it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 12. it being <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. It represents the things of which we have no demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Sense or humane reasoning, as convincingly to the mind as if
they were before our Eyes: And it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the substance, the subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
and the very being of things that are not yet in being, but in hope:
So that the Eye of Faith, like that of God, does see those things that are
invisible, and futurity is present to it. Now by this alone it is of force
to break the powers of the World, which as we saw while the things
of the other World were look'd upon as at a great distance, afar off, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
advantage of their absence storm'd the mind with present forces,
and had supplies at hand for fresh assaults, so overcame it. Whereas,
had the powers of the World to come been present (now by Faith they
are made so we see) the other which are so inferiour that there is no
more comparison than of immensity to a point, a moment to Eternity,
could not stand before them. 'Tis too notorious that this is the case:
For should a man cry fire in the House, how it had seiz'd the strengths
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40114:217"/>
of it, were blotting out the glories of it in thick Smoak, devouring all
their shine in flame, we would leave our Devotions, our most eager
pleasures to prevent this, and no speed were swift enough to serve our
cares and fears.<note place="margin">Isai. xxx. 33.</note> But though a Prophet of the Lord cry <hi>Tophet is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
the pile thereof is Fire and much Wood, and the Breath of the Lord
like a stream of Brimstone kindling it,</hi> and do this till his Lungs crack,
not one heart is mov'd, nor brings a drop of tear to quench the flame,
because these fires are not present as the other, neither have men any
sense of them, were they alike convincing, alike present to the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
'twere impossible according to what we have demonstrated (that
the Will in her choices and her aversations, where the Objects are of alike
kind, and have one common measure of their good and evil, is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
to avoid or take that which appears the greatest always; 'twere I
say impossible) not to fly these which the <hi>Devils do believe and tremble
at,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">James li. 19.</note> with greater dread wherever they appear: Now a strong lively Faith
must paint them out and shew them in each sin the World insnares into.
Neither would any of those rotten planks, which, while the Will does
fluctuate betwixt her worldly inclinations and these fears, and is toss'd
about, offer themselves, as I declared to you, for her to escape upon,
though she does dash her self upon God's Threats choosing the present
sin; such as the <hi>application of Decrees or Promises made absolutely to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
without any condition, confidence in Gods Mercies, hopes of Pardon;</hi>
none of these would be security to one that were convinc'd in earnest.
He that did believe and as it were discern that height which his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
goads him to aspire to, were upon the brink of the bottomless Pit,
whither when he arriv'd, that very sin that tempts him with the glories
of the prospect, would then tumble him down headlong into that Abyss,
he would no more dare to ascend it by such false and guilty steps upon
such hopes of mercy, trusts on Promises or Decrees, than he would dare
to throw himself off from a Pinacle in confidence God was <hi>Almighty</hi> and
<hi>Almerciful, able</hi> enough, and <hi>kind</hi> enough to stretch out his right hand
and catch him in the fall,<note place="margin">Psalm xci.</note> or trusting to that Promise, <hi>He will give his
Angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up,
lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone:</hi> Or leaning upon any
such Decree as makes the term of life <hi>immovable</hi> and fatal;<note place="margin">Job 7.</note> neither to
be hastned or retarded; none of these will make him mad enough to
break his Neck, neither would the same presumptions encourage him to
cast away his Soul, had he but equal apprehensions of the danger. And
it is plain, all the temptations of the World, and all these false encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
cannot work upon a man, when Death once looks him in the
Face; and the great Champions of Prophaneness are tame then, not that
God's Threatnings are more true, or made more evident to sense or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
than they were before, but their Faith is active, and they apprehend
more strongly then.</p>
                  <p>To see my self trampled upon by pride and malice, or worse yet, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of him whom my blood it may be help'd to streams of plenty, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
like <hi>Lazarus</hi> the portion of his <hi>Dogs,</hi> Dogs that are taught to <hi>snarle</hi>
and <hi>bite, and make more sores, not lick them;</hi> this is a state more killing
than my want, able almost to tempt a man to any courses. But then
if with the Eye of Faith I do but look beyond the gulph, and there
behold the Rich man in his flames begging for water, and although it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40114:218"/>
be the Region of eternal weeping, yet not able to procure one drop of
his own tears to cool his Tongue. O then I see 'tis better to be <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
although there were <hi>no Abraham's bosom!</hi> But if my Faith look
through that bosom also into that of God, and there behold the <hi>Son of
God</hi> leaving all the essential felicities of that Bosom to come live a life of
Vertue here on Earth, and to teach us to do so; choosing to do this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in a state of the extreamest poverty, consecrating want and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
contempt and scorn, making them thus the Ensigns of a divine
Royalty.</p>
                  <p>And to encourage us not to sink under any of the Worlds assaults, he
hath proposed Rewards of Vertue, such as God is blessed in; did my
Faith give me but a constant view of all this, sure the paint and varnish
of these little things below, the twinkling exhalations of the glories of
this World could not dazle my mind and captivate my Soul, I should
burst these entanglements to catch at those. 'Tis evident, and 'tis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd,
that when our belief shall be all Vision, and our expectation
possession, when our Understanding shall become all Sense in Heaven,
and we see and tast and have those glories, then we cannot sin, cannot be
tempted from them: And therefore by the measures of the nearness of
these Objects, of our sight, and of our interest, so are our strengths to
stand and overcome Temptations. Now Faith is <hi>sight, gives presence</hi>
we have seen,<note place="margin">1 John v. 1.</note> and it <hi>gives interest</hi> too, <hi>He that believes is born of God,</hi>
saith the Apostle, and therefore hath a right: Now to be born of one is
to receive from him a principle of life: He then that hath receiv'd from
God a Principle of life such as he can derive, life like his own, such as
is led in Heaven; when he does consider his original and looks upon
himself as <hi>born of God,</hi> and consequently <hi>heir of Gods possessions,</hi> which his
Faith gives him a prospect of, how will he look down on the tempting
glories of this World, on all that makes it grateful and desirable, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
abject things, and sleight and undervalue whatsoever worldly men,
poor Souls! do fear or hope, or long for, and pursue? The Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
say that the whole Globe of Earth to one that looks upon it from
the Fitmament is but as a point, and sure it is demonstrable it must be
so: And then how low and how contemptible must it needs seem to
him that looks on it as from the Region of the Blessed, from Gods Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
and when his Soul having defecated and freed it self from all
earthy, muddy, gross affections, and become expedite and light, expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates
through those unbounded, unfathom'd extensions of Heaven and
glory, and looks upon all as his own, that he is very shortly to come
to take the full enjoyment of, and hath already seisin of it by his Faith,
how will he despise those narrow, those ridiculous bounds which the
great ones of this World with Fire and Sword contend for? when he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ees this little point half cover'd with the Sea, almost as much too hid
from us and not to be discovered by our arts or industry; of that
which is, much Desart, some parts Frozen, some burnt up, and not inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited;
and then the little remnant of this point to be the strife and the
vexation of Mankind, while multitudes of Nations tear one anothers
bowels, spill the Blood and Souls of Myriads for some little patch or other
of it; and those that are not doing so, yet in their sphere too they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
deceive, do any thing to get; and all the rest are in perpetual hurry
of vexatious employments, or of toilsom pleasures, or of ruining Vices:
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40114:218"/>
Will he not look on this more unconcern'd than we do on the busie labours
of a little World of Ants about a Mole-hill, which Philosophers compare us
to? The spectacle is much more to be pitied indeed; the crouds and
Squadrons of those Ants, though they should have as many traverses and
walks as men have, they have not Soul enough to have their guilt: Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
had they Humane understandings, they would then divide their Mole-hill
into Empires, would be false and treacherous to one another, Cheat,
Defraud, Oppress and Murder one another for the present share; and had
they Reason, they would be more Brutes, than now they are but Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires:
For Beasts have less folly too because they are not Men. But he
whose Faith mounts him to Heaven his Birth-place, where he nestles in
the secret Bosom of his Father, he needs not be concern'd in any of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of this World, he is above them all, without the sphere of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
or magnetism, without the dangers of temptations from them: The
World is but as his slave, and it hath no command upon him, he treads it all
under his feet, and therefore certainly hath overcome it: the <hi>Condition</hi> and
<hi>degree</hi> of which Victory is the next and last thing we are to enquire into.</p>
                  <p>If you ask the <hi>Stoick</hi> who is this great Conquerour that overcomes the
World, he will answer somewhat to this purpose. It is not any of those
great successful Robbers that with Armies forrage Nations; it is not he
that peoples the whole Sea, filling it with his Navies; nor he that sets
his Confines on the remotest parts of the Inhabited World, that can call
all his own that the Sun views, so that it shines not out of his Dominions:
But the Man that hath conquer'd his own Inclinations to the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
he that hath rais'd his mind above the Crosses or Contents of this
World, that can march among them both dreadless and unconfus'd; the
man whose Soul is nothing dazled by the brightness of Wealth, it shall
not blind his Eyes, but through the varnish or the glory that the shine
of it does shed, he can discover and will hate an evil action: he that
can severely look on all those blandishments that Prosperity furnishes
and decks out pleasure in, and can sit continent and abstemious in the
midst of its delights, that when it is all Halcyon day with him, nothing
but Sunshine, and he swims in the calm streams of flowing Plenty, is
not melted by one or other, does not become loose and dissolute at all;
the man also that is not shaken by the tumults of Adversity, when like
an Earthquake she renverses all, his mind then stands unmov'd, that does
not so much suffer, as receive and welcom all that happens, as if he
would not have it happen otherwise: In a word, it is the man that hath
rais'd his mind above all casualties, the man that does but remember
that he is a Man, that is, considers if he do abound, and the World pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
it self to his Delights, that this cannot continue long; or if the
World conspire to make him miserable, remembers that he is not so, except
he think he is so, a man greater than his perils, stronger than his desires:
And thus far the <hi>Stoick's Wiseman</hi> is victorious. <hi>Christ's Believer</hi> goes a
little farther: That man hath the World <hi>Subject</hi> to him; but the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
does not stay at that, he must not treat it as a <hi>Subject,</hi> but a <hi>Traytor,</hi>
one whose Service is Conspiracy, that does attend on us onely to watch
and to betray us, to know our weak part, and to storm us there. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the Lord commanded <hi>Israel</hi> concerning <hi>Amalek,</hi> that did by them
as the World doth with us in our journey to <hi>Canaan,</hi> comes upon advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
and smites the feeble, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxv. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Therefore said the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40114:219"/>
Lord, remember what Amalek did to thee by the way, how he met thee by
the way and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind
thee, when thou wast faint and weary, therefore thou shalt blot out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of Amalek from under Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. So must we also with the
World, put all to death, not spare the best and goodliest as <hi>Saul</hi> did; yea
more, put all to the pomps and cruelties of Death as <hi>Gideon</hi> us'd the men
of <hi>Succoth,<note place="margin">Judg. vlli. 16.</note> tear their flesh with thorns and bryars;</hi> or as <hi>David</hi> us'd the
<hi>Ammonites,<note place="margin">1 Sam. xii. 31.</note> put them under Saws and Iron Harrows;</hi> so the Christian must
serve the World: VVhatever Instruments of Tyranny that us'd upon
his Saviour on the Cross, those he must exercise on it again, those <hi>Thorns,</hi>
those <hi>Nails,</hi> that <hi>Spear</hi> he must employ like <hi>Gideon's Bryars,</hi> and like
<hi>David's iron Harrows,</hi> it must be <hi>Crucified,</hi> and then he is a glorious
Conquerour, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 14. <hi>God forbid that I should glory save in the Cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the World is Crucified to me and I unto
the World.</hi> He that does march under the Banner of the Cross that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
Ensign,</hi> as he thereby declares himself upon such terms of enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with the World that he does look upon himself as one despis'd by it,
counted as an accured thing, for so was that that was Crucified, as it is
written,<note place="margin">Gal. iii. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Cursed is every one that hangeth on the Tree:</hi> So also he does
look upon his Standard as the Instrument of Execution to the World,
on which <hi>it must be Crucified unto him,</hi> and so it is: He is so taken off
from finding any stirring delights in the glories of it, that he accounts
it a dead thing, that hath no more attraits than a Carcass; yea, he does look
upon this World as on a detestable and accursed thing, as it was indeed;
whose Thorns and Briars do not onely scratch and tear, and do it most
when we embrace it most, but also are a Refuge for the cursed Serpent
to lurk in, and add his Stings to their sharps, that <hi>Devil Serpent</hi> that was
doom'd into it, and is always in it, and then <hi>most</hi> when it is <hi>most Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</hi>
Now he that hath thus us'd the World, he that hath nail'd it to
the Cross of Christ hath <hi>overcome the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Should we now cast an eye at once upon our selves and that which
hath been thus deduc'd tracing all back again; then</p>
                  <p>First, It would appear so evident that I were vain, if I should stay
to prove that those which have such desires to any of the profits, heights
or pomps, or any dear thing else whatever of this World, as that they
are impatient if they miscarry in them, and full of strange complacencies
if they do answer their desires, these have not <hi>overcome the World</hi> to any
such degree. For had I overcome and Crucified it, sure I should not be
so affectionate as to desire, court, and pursue what I had Executed; I
should as soon adore the Paintings of my Enemies Tomb, embrace and
make love to his Carcass: And were <hi>I Crucified to it,</hi> had I but one
Thorn of my Saviour's Crown struck through my Head, but one Nail
in my Foot of those that nailed him to his Tree; were my Soul fastned
to a Cross, how were it possible I should run gadding after the gay fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the World, hasty in my desires of it: Nor could I be impatient
if the World do not answer my desires and expectations, disquieted and
discompos'd, if I be disappointed, when any thing in it is not subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to my heights, and I miss of those respects I look'd for; were the
World vanquish'd, Crucified to me, should I look for services from my
dead Enemy whom I had slain? or be troubled if the person on the Cross
did not do fitting reverences to me? or be impatient if I had not respects
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40114:219"/>
and the Attendances of Pomp from one upon the Gibbet? or if <hi>I were
Crucified to it,</hi> certainly these heats would not warm the dead; these
are none of the troubles of an Executed person when he is rack'd upon
that instrument of Death, he is not grieved because the Nails were not
of Silver, the Spears head not bright, or the Cross was not hung with
Arras: Aud suppose it were, sure I were very weak if I should please
my self with that, and let such poor contents thrust out all the just
sadness of my Sentence and demerit: And yet it is as strange to find
delights in having any of the Worlds advantages, and pride my self in
the possession if <hi>I be Crucified to it.</hi> But much less is it Crucified to
them that will do actions of injustice for the sake of any of the Pomps
or profits of the VVorld; there are that grind, and screw, and rack all
that they have to deal with; others that deceive and rob in Vizours,
plunder in the disguises of fair words and of false arts; Some that dress
their Pomps in none of their own trappings, such as they never mean
to have a right to, because they never mean to satisfie for them if they
can avoid it; they furnish the grandeur of their own condition with the
goods of others which they never care to make their own by any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
at least not in such ways and seasons as the needs of those
that own'd them, and the rules of Justice do require; they cram and
sauch their Dishes with the vital Blood indeed of those who starve for
want of, and who own all that which does provide them their excesses.
Now would a man do this to entertain, and feed, and dress the Carcass
of his vanquish'd, his dead Enemy? would he be so vain, so guilty to
provide to deck the Cross on which he Crucified his Foe? least of all
would he retrench from the proportions of Charity or Piety, deny the
calls of Mercy and compassion or Religion for his profits sake, or to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
out the trains of Pomp, take <hi>the Lords portion</hi> to serve the dead
World with? If it were <hi>overcome and Crucified,</hi> they would not feed it
with <hi>hallowed things</hi> (and the Poor's portion is such,) nor rob the Altar
to give it excesses, take Consecrated things to make a cursed Carcass gay
and proud,<note place="margin">Matth. xxv. 45.</note> strip Christ's Body, starve their Saviour (so He does inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
to deny a portion to the naked and hungry) to make Pomps and
Riots for an Executed World. In any of these cases he is far from being
overcome: And if so, the</p>
                  <p>Second Proposition will apply it self to such, and must conclude they
have no <hi>Faith;</hi> for if they had that were <hi>a Victory;</hi> and however good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they pretend, they are but Infidels: But it may be they will boldly
own the Consequence, for now adays it is not gentile to believe any
thing of <hi>Christ's Religion.</hi> And sure 'tis for the Reputation of the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
and courage of our love unto this World, that when the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
of the <hi>Gadarenes</hi> would not suffer <hi>Christ</hi> in their <hi>Coasts,</hi> and for
their <hi>Swines</hi> sake drove him out, when that of <hi>Judas</hi> would not let him
be upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> but for thirty Silver pieces did betray him up to
Death; that of this Age proceeds, and will not let him be in <hi>Heaven</hi>
neither, but it <hi>scoffs him thence,</hi> and his <hi>Faith from the Earth:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they like this VVorld so well, they will not suffer there should be
any other. It is not my part to Combat these; I undertook only to shew
a way to <hi>overcome the World,</hi> if they will not use it let them enjoy their
Bondage. And yet without all doubt these candidates of Infidelity and
Atheism have faith enough to do the work in good degree; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40114:220"/>
there's none of them but does believe but he shall die, and it is easie
for his Faith to look through that <hi>thin vapour</hi> which our life is stiled
by, to the end of that <hi>small span,</hi> and there see a <hi>Bed,</hi> though gay now
and soft as the sleep and sins it entertains, then with the Curtains close,
the gayety all clouded in a darkness, such as does begin the desolateness
of the Grave; if you draw the Curtain to his Faith it sees a languishing
sad Corps which nothing in the VVorld can help or ease, forethrowded
in his own dead hue, himself preluding to his winding-sheet, in which
within a little while he shall be cast from the society and sight of men,
and shall have nothing else of all his VVealth and Pomp: To see all
this is no great monstrous difficulty for his Faith. Now though while
he is in his prosperity and health, and the VVorld serves every of his
desires, and if I should tell him all his superfluities, all that is beyond a
meer convenience are but empty things, meer shadows of delight, that
onely mock his fancy; should I tell him that the silver furnitures of his
Tables, and those more wealthy shining ones those in his Cabinet, and
the Silken ones of his Rooms, and the more exquisite pieces of rich Art
which people must have skill to understand the pomp of, must have been
the Disciples of the Pensil to discern how they do serve Pride; tell him
these are phantasms, onely dreams of Pomp, advantages no where but
in imagination, I shall not persuade him, but he will despise me. But
then if he will ask his Faith how all these will look to him in the state
which is now before his thoughts, what his opinion of them will be
then? he knows he may as well go to his Pictures now, and entertain
his Mirth and Luxuries with them, and hearken to their painted sounds,
and dine upon the images of Feasts, as hope in that sad hour from all
his Wealth to find coment or ease, though his hand sweat under the
weight of Winter Jewels they will not heal one aking joint: His Plate
the greatest Riot of his Table will not make one morsel tast savory;
yea more, he knows that then all the worldly uses of these superfluities
such as <hi>satisfying curiosity,</hi> and <hi>emulation,</hi> and the <hi>estimation of the World,
to be the talk of people,</hi> and the like; these will appear most evidently
to be insipid things, meer conceits of delights; things of which there
can be no real enjoyment or advantage any time. And if it then appear
evidently that in themselves they are so, then they are so always; and
a constant Contemplation of that time will make them always seem so.
So that a Faith that cannot see into another VVorld, that will but look
through this, must needs take off our hearts from the entanglements
of those advantages, when it appears how small a thing can dash them
all so as that we cannot enjoy them while we have them, and that the
enjoyment of them while we do is but imaginary.</p>
                  <p>And really when we consider how unquiet and disturb'd a thing Man
is, except he raise himself above the Power of all these, how till the
Mind escape out of the whirl and circuit of the Worlds allurements, it
cannot but be in perpetual agitations; at every ebb or flow of things
without, there is a tide within of swelling or sinking affections; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
change abroad does make a change of thoughts and of designs,
cross Accidents have cross Passions, and I am as much an Universe
of various thwarting contradictious affections, as the World is of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:40114:220"/>
How the Beasts are free, serene and quiet Creatures in comparison,
for they not understanding many Objects, consequently have few incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
and their satisfactions very obvious; whereas the Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
mind of Man that looks into a world of things, and out of them
creates a world of temptations, finds out varieties of Pleasures or of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
and then starts as many eager affections in himself to pursue them;
his copious understanding does but procure him various Lusts, and his
Reason does but make him sagacious in searching out occasions of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.
Nor is it possible it should be otherwise, for while my inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are chain'd to those external movements, and my slavish mind at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
upon those inclinations, I must needs suffer as many servitudes as
the world hath changes of temptation: And then putting these two
Considerations together, how unsatisfying and how uneasie too it is to
be engaged in the Advantages of this World, which are meerly Dreams
of good things that disturb our rest and make our sleep unquiet, with
the working of Imagination, yet do but delude the Appetite, and we
find we have had nothing when we awake; sure if I thought there were
no other World, yet would I not be greedy after the great things of
this, when 'tis more easie far to want them, here would I indulge my
self the sensuality of a Contented mind, the luxury of an Ataraxy, of
an indifference as to all these things, of being quiet and untroubled by
not having them, free from the hurry and disorder of them. The <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists</hi>
did so account it certainly, when they call'd this living accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our Nature, as if all the other were a Violence upon us; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same ground they accounted it not hard to overcome the Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this World, it was onely not to invade and use a force upon
themselves and vanquish their own natures: And sure we that are <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
and are so no farther than as we have <hi>this Faith</hi> here in the Text,
we must not count it hard; we who have the Revelations and Example
of the <hi>blessed Jesus,</hi> all that he hath done to make it easie, now saith he
<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> Courage, for I have overcome the
World: They are but broken forces we are to resist, we have the
Strengths of Heaven on our side, and therefore sure we may adventure
to encounter them; and if we do begin to faint, we have an <hi>Almighty
Captain of Salvation,</hi> and if we have but Faith to lay hold on him, and
be not false to our own selves, but keep our hold, if we be foiled, Christ
must be vanquish'd too, and we may fear impossibilities as well. When
those poor Heathen march'd on naked, had none of our Weapons to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
the VVorld, or to defend themselves, had neither <hi>Shield of Faith,</hi>
nor <hi>Helmet of Salvation,</hi> no <hi>Sword of the Spirit</hi> the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and
yet master'd it in great degrees, shall we that are <hi>harnessed turn our
selves back in the day of Battel?</hi> and confute this Scripture; and make
good that <hi>they do overcome the World most easily who never heard that
Jesus was the Son of God?</hi> 'Tis not onely base for us to faint most who
have most advantage, but it is a contradiction for them to be overcome
that have the Victory: Now <hi>this is the Victory that overcometh the
World even our Faith;</hi> the Victory that overcomes both Worlds indeed;
it tramples upon this, and lays hold upon that to come, out-doing what

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Ancient Observation of this Time would ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
my Choice, make the Text Seasonable in
the most Severe sense it can put on, when in their
<hi>Exomologeses</hi> they ate onely the Bread of Sorrow,
and tears were their Drink day and night, so as
that in the Agonies of their Repentance they did
<hi>Crucifie</hi> without a Meraphor, and <hi>mortifie</hi> the
Body of <hi>Flesh</hi> as well as <hi>Sin.</hi> But it seems to
have happened in our Sins as in our great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
men are grown more skilful, and have found out much more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ways of Cure, there is no need of going through a discipline of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
a whole course of Medicinal Cruelty, but they can heal, at least
palliate with more ease and speed. Besides that, Christianity is now of
a more delicate and tender make, and cannot bear austerities, neither
come I here to call for them, or to provoke their Constitutions; if they
have found a softer and more pleasant way to Heaven, on Gods Name
let them walk in it; onely in our walk we are now coming within ken
of <hi>the Cross of Christ,</hi> and we can bear commemorations of his Passion;
they make the closing Ceremony of this Season, which was set aside on
purpose by the preparations of Humiliation to fit us for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
and expiations of that Day, by Repentance <hi>to put off our Old
Man, the whole Body of Sin,</hi> that we may hang it on his Cross as we go
by. That is the onely use of this time, and the onely application of
that Day. Which I crave leave to shew you how to make at once: And
without this that Ceremony howsoever solemn, will be meerly Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40114:222"/>
not Worship; the observation but dramatick; and we shall have no
part in the Atonement, onely in the Scene of that days Tragedy, rather
than Sacrifice: He onely Celebrates that Passion, onely he partakes that
Offering, who can say with S. <hi>Paul, I am Crucified with Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which words we shall first endeavour to discover what this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What the Nature is of that Condition and estate which S.
<hi>Paul</hi> does affirm here of that Person; and that</p>
                  <p>First, In it self, <hi>Crucified; I am Crucified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In its adjunct; <hi>with Christ,</hi> Which because it cannot
signifie conjunction in time, he is not now upon the Cross, that I might
say, now <hi>I am Crucified with him,</hi> nor when <hi>He</hi> was, was <hi>I,</hi> that I
might say then <hi>I am Crucified with Christ;</hi> but we shall find it hath
other importances. First it implies a likeness to Christ's Passion, I am
Crucified <hi>as he was,</hi> so it means through the whole <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>crucified with Christ</hi> is what S. <hi>Paul</hi> elsewhere expresses by the being
<hi>made conformable to his death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It imports more, even Communication and partaking with
him in his Passion, <hi>being planted together in the likeness of his death,
Rom.</hi> vi. 5. and <hi>I am Crucified with Christ,</hi> does mean <hi>I have a fellowship
of his Sufferings,</hi> as he words it <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It means also a conjunction of causal Relation, that there is
a Vertue and Efficacy in the Cross of Christ to work the Sinner into
Crucifying of his sin so the particle must needs import, <hi>Ephes.</hi> ii. 6.
<gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>he hath set us together with him in heavenly places in Christ
Jesus.</hi> Where we are neither in conformity, nor fellowship, but onely
in our head and in our cause; so <hi>I am Crucified with Christ</hi> does mean
his Passion hath an influence to Crucifie and cause in me the death of
Sin.</p>
                  <p>Of these in order; and</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>what</hi> this Person is? I say not <hi>who?</hi> we know it was S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
but <hi>what?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. v. xxiv. Coll. iii. 5.</note> and the reason of the Enquiry is because we find indeed else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<hi>crucifying the Flesh with the Affections and Lusts</hi> required, and we
are also bid to <hi>mortifie our members that are on the Earth; such as Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and Vncleanness, Covetousness</hi> and the like. But these are not <hi>I,</hi>
how am I mortified in these? Is it because it may be they are grown so
dear to me, that I am Crucified in their destruction? and long practice
and acquaintance hath riveted them into my very heart? Now the
Wen we know though an excrescent tumour, but an accessory bag of
noxious humours, yet if it lay hold on any noble part, take in some
Nerve or Artery, then he must cut the thread of Life that cuts it off:
So he must rent my heart indeed that tears my pleasures from me; Life
it self does seem to have so little salisfaction without them, that it is a
death to me to part with them. Or else hath the <hi>Old Man</hi> no Soul? is
he all Flesh? and hath Iniquity debas'd the whole of him, so that his
very Spirit is become <hi>Body of Sin,</hi> so as that Wickedness should be our
very Being, be all one with us, and <hi>I,</hi> and my <hi>corruptions</hi> prove deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of one importance, signifie the very same? so it is indeed:
Besides the carnal part that is <hi>sold under sin,</hi> and consequently does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the <hi>Cross,</hi> that punishment of <hi>Slaves,</hi> the part also that is in the
quite opposite extream, that <hi>lusts against the flesh,</hi> that must be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.

there in the place, and buttress'd by false reasonings and Discourses.
Now all these Fortresses of Vice that maintain and secure a man in sin must

to sollicitations of flesh is most corrupted, and most dangerous,
in that which way soever it inclines, it draws the whole Man after it:
If any thing in us be crucified in a Conformity to Christ, it must be
this; for in that death wherein Christ offered up himself upon the Cross
(where although the Divine Nature gave the value, 'twas onely the
Humane Nature made the Offering) there it was the <hi>crucifying his
own Will,</hi> that above all other the ingredients made his Death a Sacrifice,
and the price of our Redemption. God that had given him his Blood
and Life, might call for it again when and how he saw good, and being
due, it was not properly a price that could be given him for sin; but
his free voluntary choice, his being willing to endure the Agonies and
Contempts of the Cross, his stabbing his own natural desires with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
determination,<note place="margin">Luke xxii. 42.</note> 
                     <hi>Not my will, but thine be done:</hi> This his own Will
was his own Offering; and such is ours, <hi>if we be Crucified with Christ,
made conformable to his death; if we present our selves a Sacrifice accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Lord;</hi> for our will is not given up to him, till it do perfectly
comport with his; but that it cannot do, till we renounce our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
till we have brought our selves to an indifference in outward
things, to such a resignation as she is storied to have had, who being in
her Sickness bid to choose whether she rather would have Health or
Death, made answer, <hi>Vehementissimè desidero ut non facias voluntatem

Which calls me to the next Enquiry, to the nature of the duty here
intended, I am <hi>Crucified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is design'd by it S. <hi>Paul</hi> does perfectly declare <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 6. <hi>Our
old man is crucified with Christ that the body of Sin might be destroyed,
that we should no longer serve sin:</hi> So that it means a through Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and abandoning of former evil Courses: A Duty which there
are few men but in some instants of their life think absolutely necessary,
and persuade themselves they do perform it. At some time or other
they are forc'd to recollect and grow displeas'd and angry at their
sins, and have some sad reflections on them, beg for mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and do think of leaving them; and when they have return'd to
them again, they shake the head, and chafe, and curse at their own
weakness, and renew their purposes it may be; and do this as oft as such
a Season as this is, or other like occasions suggest it to or move them:
And with this they satisfie themselves, and hope if God do please to
take them hence in some such muddy, gloomy fit of their Repentance,
all's well. Now shall we call this being Crucified? are there Racks and
Tortures in this discipline? hath a Spear prick'd them to the heart,
and no blood nor no water, no tears gush out thence? hath it made no
issue for some hearty Sorrow to purle out?</p>
                  <p>Indeed I must confess, the Scripture does sometimes word the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of this Duty in expressions that are not so sower, but of an easier
importance;<note place="margin">Ephes. iv. 22.</note> as first, <hi>put off the Old Man,</hi> as if all were but <hi>Garment;</hi>
put it off I say, not as they strip'd our Saviour in order to his Scourgings
and his Cross, but intimating to us what an easie thing it is to cast off
Sin for them, who do begin with it betimes, before it get too close to
the heart. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </hi>
even as easie as putting off thy Cloaths, and thy Repentance is but
as thy Shift, thy change of life like changing thy Apparel.</p>
                  <p>But alas! for all the easiness which this expression hints, where the
sins also lie in the Attire, as besides emulation, pride, vainglory, great
uncharitableness and inhumanity, cruel injustice and oppression often do,
when many are undone through want of those dues which do furnish o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men with the excesses of this kind: when the sins therefore lie in the
Attire, and they may <hi>put them off</hi> without a Metaphor, yet it is so hard
that it cannot be done; sometimes the worth of a whole Province hangs
upon a slender thread about a Neck, a Patrimony thrust upon one joint of
one least Finger, and these warts of a Rock or a Shell-fish with the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages
eat out Estates and starve poor Creditors; for whom indeed they

hardned Sinners must not think that there is any thing of true
Repentance in their easie, perfunctory, sleight performances; there is
something like Death in the Duty, which yet is required of us farther
under variety of more severe expressions; for we are bid thirdly to <hi>slay
the Body of Sin,</hi> Rom. vi. 6. <hi>to mortifie our members,</hi> Col. iii. 5. and to
<hi>Crucifie,</hi> Gal. vi. 14. which how it may be done, the next consideration
of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s condition in the Text, and my next part declare. <hi>I am Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
with Christ,</hi> that is, first <hi>as he was,</hi> by being <hi>made conformable to
his Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truly should we trace him through all the stages of his Passion,
we should hardly find one passage but is made to be transcribed by us
in dealing with our sins.</p>
                  <p>First he began it with <hi>Agony,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. xxvi. 37.</note> when <hi>his Soul was exceeding heavy,</hi> for it
labour'd with such weight of indignation as did make the Son of God to
sink under the meer apprehension:<note place="margin">Vers. 38.</note> And he was <hi>sorrowful unto Death,</hi> so
as that his whole Body did weep Blood. The Sinners passion, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is exactly like it, it begins always with grief and sense of
weight, whoever is regenerate was conceiv'd in sorrow, and brought forth
with pangs, and <hi>the Child of God</hi> too is <hi>born weeping.</hi> And for loads,
the Church when she does call us to shew forth this Death of Christ,
as if she did prescribe that very Agony, requires that we should find that
<hi>Garden</hi> at the <hi>Altar,</hi> makes us say <hi>we are heartily sorry for our misdoings,
the remembrance of them is grievous unto us, the burden of them is intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
So that the <hi>Sinner's Soul</hi> must be <hi>exceeding heavy</hi> too.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There he is betrayed by his own domestick, sold for the
poorest Price imaginable, as a <hi>Slave</hi> for <hi>thirty pieces of silver.</hi> I shall
not mind you what unworthy things the love of Money does engage
men to; to sell a <hi>Christ,</hi> a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and a <hi>God!</hi> and rather than stand out,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40114:224"/>
at such a base rate, as we scorn to buy a <hi>sin</hi> at; every single act's engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Damnation, costs more than the Ransom of the World is sold
for; and the Blood of God is purchas'd cheaper than any one opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Vice does stand us in! But I onely mind you here, that he shall
have a better hire that will but be a <hi>Judas</hi> to his own iniquities: do but
betray the Regent sins, deliver them up and thou shalt have everlasting
Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We find him next carried before the <hi>High Priest.</hi> And the
strictest times of Christianity would serve their sins so, to receive his
doom upon them, to be excommunicated into Reformation: But I shall
not urge how we can discover to a <hi>Physician</hi> our shames, all our most
putrid Guilts as well as Ulcers, and make him our <hi>Confessor</hi> in our most
secret sins; neither will I be inquisitive why the <hi>Physicians of our souls</hi>
are balk'd; but will pass this part of the Conformity, and follow <hi>Christ</hi>
to <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi> And for this part we our selves are fitted, the whole
furniture of a Judicial Court, all that makes up both Bench and Bar is
born within us. God hath given us a <hi>Conscience</hi> whereby <hi>we are a Law
to our selves,</hi> Rom. ii. We have <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which
the <hi>Jews</hi> did want; <hi>such evidence as is sufficient to condemn us;</hi> the same
Conscience that is privy to our doings, and stands by our thoughts, and
sees through our intentions, is a <hi>thousand witnesses:</hi> And that there may
be a <hi>Prosecutor, our own thoughts accuse us</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul;</hi> and if we will
give them way, will aggravate each Circumstance of guilt and danger,
bark, and howl, and cry as loud against us, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did against <hi>Christ,</hi>
for Sin is of so murthering a guilt it will be sure to slay it self: and that
he may not want his deserved Ruin, the Sinner makes his own <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
yea, and his own <hi>Sentence</hi> too, for <hi>our own heart condemns us,</hi> saith
S. <hi>John:</hi> And when ever it does so, Oh that we would follow it through
all the gradations that brought Christ to Death! and use our wickedness
as he was us'd; <hi>strip</hi> it from its Cloaths, bare it from its fair pretexts it
useth to be dress'd in! Lay our <hi>anger</hi> naked from all those excuses which
our provocations, that either wrath or humour will be sure to think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
do make for it! strip our <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vanity</hi> from those paints
and dresses which the Custom of the Age, that does require and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
strange things, dawbs the sin with! use our <hi>Luxuries</hi> and <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances</hi>
so, and the other greater and more <hi>thirsty dropsie,</hi> that of Wealth,
and of unjust unworthy gains, which there are richer Luxuries in too!
And there are none of these but have their pleas, their colours which
they set themselves out in, to please the Appetite and to deceive the
Mind, all which we must strip off; and then when we have laid them
naked, <hi>spit upon them,</hi> vomit all our spleen and contumelious despite at
that which hath made us so ugly in Gods sight; <hi>scourge</hi> it with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities,
and <hi>buffet</hi> it as they did Christ, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>himself, 1 Cor.</hi>
xvi. 27. And when the Body of Sin is thus tamed and weakened, it
will be easie then to <hi>lead it out and crucifie it.</hi> A Crucifiction this that
does make our Good-Friday be a day of Expiation and Atonement to us:
A sight which next to that of his own Son upon the Cross, is the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to the Lord; when he does see us execute his Enemies although
they be our selves, and Crucifie the dear Affections of our bosom as God
did. This is indeed to <hi>be conform'd unto the death of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>

If I might have leave to go before you and to let you into the Example,
draw the Curtain from before the Passion, I would call my Sins out,
drag them to behold that Prospect, hale them into the Garden, shew
them how he was us'd there. You my <hi>Extravagancies of my youth</hi> my
mad follies and wild jollities, come see my Saviour yonder, how he
swoons when guilt began to make approaches towards him! and can I
make my self merry with nothing else but that which made him die?
tickle, chear, and heighten my self with Agonies? You my <hi>intemperate
Draughts,</hi> my full Bowls and the riotous Evenings I have past, look yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what a sad night do these make Christ pass! look what a Cup he
holds, which makes him fall lower to deprecate, than ever my Excesses
made me lie. You my <hi>lazy Luxuries, Fulness of Bread, and Idleness,</hi>
whereby I have controul'd Gods Curse, and onely in the Sweat of others
Faces eat my Bread, and in that dew drank up the Spirits of those mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
that toil to faintings to maintain my dissolute life, see how he is
forc'd to bear the whole Curse for me! how the <hi>Thorns</hi> grow on his head,
and how he <hi>Sweats</hi> all over. You my <hi>supine Devotions</hi> which do scarce
afford my God a knee, and less an heart, not when I am deprecating an
Eternity of all those Torments which kill'd Christ! look yonder how he
prays, behold him on his Face petitioning, see there how he sweats and
begs. You my little <hi>Malices</hi> and my vexatious <hi>Angers,</hi> that are hot and
quick as Fire it self, and that do fly as high too, that are up at Heaven
strait for the least wrong on Earth! look how he bears his, how his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
seems wounded onely in a wound that fell upon his Persecutors!
and when one that came to apprehend him wrongfully was hurt,<note place="margin">Matth. xxvi. 51.</note> as if
the Sword of his defence had injur'd him, he threatned and for ever
curs'd the black deeds of that angry Weapon,<note place="margin">Verse 52.</note> and made restitution of
what he had not taken, made his Adversary whole whom he had not
hurt!<note place="margin">Luke xxii. 51.</note> See how with his cruel Judges he is as a <hi>Sheep,</hi> that not <hi>before
his shearers</hi> onely, but before his <hi>Butcher too, is dumb.</hi> You my <hi>Scorns,</hi>
and my <hi>high Stomach</hi> that will take no satisfaction but Blood and Soul
for the faults of inadvertency, for such as not the <hi>wrong,</hi> but <hi>humour</hi>
makes offences: lookhow they use him, they <hi>buffet,</hi> and <hi>revile and spit
upon</hi> him. Ye my <hi>dreadful Oaths</hi> and bitter <hi>imprecations</hi> which I use to
lace my speeches with, or belch out against any one that does offend me in
the least, making the <hi>Wounds</hi> and <hi>Blood of God,</hi> and other such sad words,
either my foolish modes of speaking, or the spittings of my peevishness.
There you may see what 'tis I play with so, you may behold the Life of
Christ pouring out at those Wounds which I speak so idly of, and what
I mingle with my sportive talk is Agony, such as they <hi>that beheld afar
off struck their breasts at,</hi> and to see them onely was a Passion. Ye my
<hi>Atheisms</hi> and my <hi>Irreligion</hi>—but alas you have no prospect yonder,
it's but faint before you who out-do the Example; whatsoever <hi>Judas</hi>
and the rest did to the <hi>Man Christ Jesus,</hi> you attempt on <hi>God,</hi> you invade
Heaven, <hi>Sentence, Cruicifie Divinity it self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now having shewed my Sins this Copy of themselves, what they
are in their own demerits, when my bowels do begin to turn within me
at that miserable usage which Christ underwent, it will be a time to
execute an act of Indignation at my self, who have resetted in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
all these Traytors to my Saviour; made those things the joy and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of my life which had their hands in the Blood of my God;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40114:225"/>
and what a stupid sensless Soul have I, that was never troubled heartily
at that, which did make him almost out of hope? and if this be the effect
of sin, then it is time for me to throw it off, <hi>O my Jesu!</hi> sure I am, I am
not able to support the weight of that thou didst sink under. Thou
didst come <hi>to bear our sins in thy own Body on the Tree,</hi> therefore in thy
Body they were nailed to the Cross, and then certainly I will not force
and tear them thence: No, there I leave them, and will never re-assume
them more; which resolution is the effect of that <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> which
is in <hi>the Cross of Christ</hi> to the <hi>crucifying of sin,</hi> which is the second sense
in which the Christian does profess with S. <hi>Paul, I am Crucified with
Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are some Learned Men, that when they would assign reasons
sufficient to move God to lay the punishment of our iniquities upon his
Son, and execute that Indignation that was due to us on the most innocent,
most <hi>Holy Jesus,</hi> give this onely, that this was the highest and most sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
way imaginable to discover Gods most infinite displeasure against
Sin, and by consequence to terrifie men from the practice of it: For if
any thing in Heaven or in Earth could <hi>make us fear, and from henceforth
commit no such evil,</hi> it was surely this, to see Sin sporting in the Agonies
of Christ, Iniquity triumphing in the Blood of God: To see those dire
instances of the deservings of a Sinner, those amazing prelusions to his
expectations; and consider it was easier for God to execute all this upon
his Son than suffer Sin to go unpunish'd. Indeed they make all that is
real in the whole account they give of satisfaction made to God for sin to
consist in this, that <hi>the temporal Death of Christ</hi> (which God by vertue
of his absolute Dominion may inflict on the most innocent, taking away
that which himself had given, especially since Christ who had that right
over his own life, which none else had, did of his own accord submit to
it; and he <hi>laid down his life, who had a power to do so.</hi>) That Death I
say,<note place="margin">John x. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>might justly be ordain'd by God for an Example of his Wrath and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
against Sin, and then might be accepted in the stead of their death,
who were warned by that example, and affrighted from committing sin.</hi> And
truly there is colour for it, for all satisfaction seems either of a loss su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd,
which is acquired by compensation, or the satisfaction of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
which is commonly appeased by the sufferings of the injurious party;
or else the satisfaction of our fears and doubts, that we may be secure
not to sustain the like again, which is most likely to be best provided
for by punishment: For sure one will not venture upon that which he
must suffer for the doing.</p>
                  <p>Now of all these the first, the satisfaction of <hi>compensation,</hi> as it cannot
properly be made to God who could sustain no real diminution by Man's
sin:<note place="margin">Job xxxv. 8, 9.</note> For <hi>though thy wickedness,</hi> saith <hi>Job, may hurt a man as thou art, yet
if thou sinnest what doest thou against God? or if thy transgressions be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed,
what doest thou to him?</hi> but onely as the <hi>breaking of his Law does</hi>
in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s expression <hi>dishonour him</hi> amongst men; so also it were easie to
demonstrate that this one example does exalt more of Gods attributes,
and to a greater height,<note place="margin">Rom. ii. 23.</note> than either if his Law had been obey'd or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
if that either were our business, or if this sort of satisfaction did
not properly belong onely to the offended party, not the supream Judg
or Governour as such, under which notion God is here to be considered.
As neither does the second satisfaction, that of <hi>anger,</hi> the Judg being to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40114:225"/>
be like his Law, that hath no passions or affections. And truly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e the
things that do satisfie our angers and revenges are no real goods, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions
of them are unnatural, and therefore surely not Divine: Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
appetite that hath learn'd to desire mischief, hath also taught us
to delight in misery, and be satisfied with the griefs of others, which
being nothing to us cannot be our good: And although we are stil'd
Children of Wrath, as if our portion were to be onely Plagues, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
Perdition, and the fearful issues of Gods Fury: Yet since to
be angry signifies in God no more than this, to testifie what great abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
he hath to sin, how contrary to him, how not to be indur'd it is:
It was impossible for God when he had once resolv'd to pardon sin, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
that more than by resolving not to pardon it without such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
so that it did satisfie his anger perfectly. But all true satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
lies in the <hi>provision that is made by punishment against future of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is that which the <hi>Magistrate</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> requires, <hi>nec enim irascitur,
sed cavet;</hi> for by Punishment they cannot call back the offences that are
past, undo or make them not have been: but they can make men not to
dare to do them again, nor others by their example.</p>
                  <p>This is the end why they annex Penalties to their Laws, expresly said
so, <hi>Deut.</hi> xix. 20. Which end therefore when they attain by Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Magistrate</hi> is <hi>satisfied.</hi> For it is not so much the
Death of the Offender that is satisfaction of the Law, as the Example of
Terror that it gives; and therefore humane Lawgivers have oft thought
fit to change the Penalty; and where Death was appointed, to assign
other sufferings that consist with Life, and prolong Misery and Terror, as
Proscription, and the Gallies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Accordingly to propose an Example of
Terror to us, God laid all the severe inflictions of the Passion-day upon
his own Son. Now it is evident that the example of a Man suffering for
the breach of Laws does certainly hedg in those Laws, keep them more
safe from violence; therefore we see those Laws are best observ'd which
the Magistrate's Sword does most guard; and Experience would quickly
make it good, a Land would prove but a meer Shambles, and a Man's
life cheaper than a Beast's, if <hi>Murtherers</hi> and <hi>Duellists</hi> shall get impunity
more easily than he that <hi>steals an Horse</hi> or <hi>Sheep.</hi> When on the other
side, that Nation from whom we most receive the <hi>fashions</hi> of our <hi>Vices</hi>
also, whom the <hi>honour of that sin</hi> is most peculiar to; though they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to value it above Estate, and Life, and Family, and Soul, yet we
know could be beaten from it be some sharp Examples. And then when
our Lawgiver, as he spake his Laws at first with Thunder and with
Lightning, as if they brought their Sentence along with them, and the
very promulgation was a Copy and Example of their Execution: So
also he did write those Laws in Blood, to let us see what does await trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
how he that spar'd not his own dear Son, will certainly not spare
any impenitent, this could not chuse but have some influence, if 'twere
consider'd. Should we call to mind the kindness God had at this time to
lost Man, how he so long'd to pity him, that he resolv'd not to pity him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
how yet in all those turnings of his bowels within him, his repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
over Man, when his Compassion was at such an height as to give
his well beloved Son to satisfie for our transgressions; in the midst of all
those inclinations to us, at that very time how yet he did so hate our sins,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40114:226"/>
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>athing else could satisfie him, but <hi>the Blood of God:</hi> How he made
the Son of God <hi>empty himself</hi> of his Divinity and of his Soul, and all to
raise a sum only to purchase one example of that Indignation that attends
a Sinner; it will be easie then to recollect how unsupportable that Wrath
will be to the impenitent in the Day of his fierce Anger; when he shall
have no kindness left for them, but the Omnipotence of Mercy will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Almighty Fury: Who shall be able to avoid or to endure the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues
of it? shall I think to scape them when he spared not his own Son?
or shall I venture upon bearing that to all Eternity which that Son was
not able to support some hours? Thus as S. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses, <hi>God sending
his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,</hi> a Sacrifice <hi>for sin, condemned sin
in the flesh,</hi> that is, he shewed what did await iniquity, that men by so
great an example of his Wrath, might be frighted from the practice. <hi>Et
si quis morte Christi admonitus paeniteat, iste per mortem Christi peccato
mortuus esse dicitur,</hi> saith <hi>Origen</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 1. He who seeing that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Christ Crucified for sin is warned by it into Repentance, he is
<hi>crucified with Christ.</hi> God dealing with us as Men do with a young Prince,
that must be disciplin'd by the correction of another for his faults; and
in this sense also, our chastisement was upon Christ, and by his stripes we
are cur'd.</p>
                  <p>And now though I propose not this as if I thought this Reason were
sufficient of it self, which seems to give no good account how any could
be ransomed e're Christ suffered: (which yet certainly they were, the
vertue of his Death extending to all former Ages, as it proved most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 25. a place which <hi>Crellius</hi> himself does give no satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to) if the satisfaction, of his Death consisted onely in its being an
Example, it could no more satisfie for the sins of former Ages, than it
could be an Example e're it was in being: If that Death were accepted
in the stead of their death, who by that Example are frighted into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
what was accepted for their sins, who had no such vision of it,
as that it could not or did affright them, yet repented? Yet to them that
have beheld it in its vigour, they that can controul this check to Vice,
and when to shew us an Example it cost God the life of his own Son, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the prospect of whose Cross he hath not any Terrour to propose, this
being the contrivance of the Divine Mind, and the stress of all his most
Almighty Attributes conjoyn'd in one compounded Miracle, can yet
make all this vain and fruitless and have no effect, are not feared nor
warned by it; but as if it signified no peril to their sins, they can come
once a year to entertain themselves with the Example and go from the
Agonies unconcern'd to the sins that inflicted them, and that shew forth
themselves in them: Who act as if those were the onely soft and pleasant
things that crush'd his Blood and Soul out, as if those which did make the
Son of God cry out as if he did almost despair, were the onely fit things
to make men jolly: And do thus as they did it in despite to this great
method of Salvation, as if they did <hi>enjoy the indignation of the Wrath of
God,</hi> as if those <hi>Agonies</hi> like the other <hi>difficulties</hi> of their sins did more
provoke to them, or like the <hi>Paschal bitter herbs</hi> that typified them, were
as <hi>sawce</hi> to the Riots of their Vices. These certainly are men of a most
desperate appetite and courage. But 'tis much more to be lamented that
the Law of God does not seem better guarded by this dire Example than
it was of old among the <hi>Jews,</hi> when it shew'd the Sinner his deservings
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40114:226"/>
onely by the dying of his Breast, and had no other sence nor satisfaction
than the <hi>blood of Bulls and Goats:</hi> It is not very visible that it hath
wrought upon consideration so as to make us <hi>more fear and beware;</hi> nay,
we may question whether the example of my <hi>Bullock dying for my sin,</hi>
would not restrain and terrifie me more than that of <hi>Jesus crucified</hi> for
it: If I were to expiate the Blood with which I word my <hi>Anger</hi> and my
<hi>Oaths,</hi> with the blood of my own Flocks, if that <hi>Luxury</hi> which pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
every Element and brings a little Universe at once upon my Table
to treat it self withal, were but to kill one <hi>Heiser for the Temple,</hi> and I
to expiate each <hi>surfeit</hi> by one such <hi>Beligious Riot:</hi> Were I to quench the
feavers of an <hi>Intemperance</hi> with a <hi>drink-offering,</hi> 'tis possible I should not
be so prone to sacrifice to my <hi>Genius,</hi> if I must sacrifice to <hi>God</hi> for doing
so, and I should be more tender of my <hi>Beasts</hi> than I am of my <hi>Saviour.</hi>
Now how comes this to pass? It is impossible that we should be so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
of our own demerits, should we see them represented in the
suffering of a <hi>Beast,</hi> as when they are shewed to us in those of <hi>the Son
of God.</hi> What is it then? Should we account <hi>our selves</hi> to suffer in <hi>our
Beast?</hi> His Death were our own <hi>loss</hi> and <hi>punishment:</hi> And had we no
<hi>communion</hi> in this <hi>Death of Christ?</hi> was not that <hi>our own?</hi> or account we
our concern and share in that <hi>less valuable</hi> than in that of our <hi>Beast?</hi> Far
be this from us, we are no further <hi>Christians</hi> than we can affirm with St.
<hi>Paul</hi> (who challengeth a <hi>fellowship in all Christ's sufferings,</hi> and boasts
it, saying) <hi>I am Crucified with Christ.</hi> Which brings me to the last sense
of the words; <hi>I have a share and am a Partner in that Cross, and all the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions
that were wrought upon it.</hi>

the Remissions that he purchas'd on it? <hi>Blessed Jesu!</hi> we should have

ours eternally; that Agony which an Angels comfort could not calm,
that dreadful Terrour which exprest it self in the cold Sweat of clotted
Blood, that greater Terrour which came so near Despair as to make thee
cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> all should have been
our portion to everlastingness, and spent their fury on our Souls: And

dost thou <hi>communicate thy Agonies in Eucharistick wine?</hi> and is this
to <hi>be Crucified with Christ?</hi> so he does account it seems. He that by

are accounted to him, he is esteemed to have a fellowship in all
the sufferings, to have had an hand in all that was done for Man on the
Cross, they are all reckoned his: And as Christ bore the <hi>guilt</hi> of all our

doings on the Tree, so he will have us bear the <hi>name,</hi> and <hi>merit,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

in the likeness of his death,</hi> by being made conformable to that in
crucifying of our sins, we are inoculated as it were, and both together
ingraffed in into the Cross, and so there is deriv'd to us the vertue of
that Stem, that Root of Expiation and Atonement; and by this insertion
being as the same S. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 9. <hi>found in him, we have his
Righteousness.</hi> That poor Soul that does throw himself down in the strict

as <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> interpret. He may take confidence to say,
<hi>Behold Lord, if the satisfactions of thy Eternal Justice be acceptable to
thee, if the blood of God that is offer'd up without spot be a well-pleasing
Sacrifice, look down at once on thy Messiah and on my poor Soul! turn not

                  <p>We have gone through all the Parts, all the Considerations of this
Expression, and have no more now to take notice of but this, that all of
them must go together, that they never are fulfill'd asunder, but he only
whom the efficacy of the Cross of Christ hath wrought on to the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of sin, he onely hath the satisfactions of the Cross imputed to him,
he is planted with, ingraffed into Christ: For <hi>if any man be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Christ, he
is a new creature, old things are done away,</hi> 2 Cor. v. 17. Whosoever is not
such he hath no interest in the <hi>Jesus</hi> of that day. He may perchance in
some one of those easie Saviours which these times afford, wherein Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
call'd <hi>holy,</hi> or a <hi>sanctify'd Faction</hi> give such interests, and to <hi>be in a
party</hi> is to <hi>be in Christ;</hi> or else he may <hi>depend</hi> upon that Christ, that may
be had with meer <hi>Dependance,</hi> that <hi>is ours if we persuade our selves he is so.</hi>
Now sure, he that is persuaded he is Christ's, is either truly so persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or else falsly; if but falsly, that will not advantage him, for God
will never save a man for believing a lye; but that he should truly be
persuaded so without this Duty is impossible, for <hi>he that is Christ's hath
crucified the Flesh with the Affections and Lusts:</hi> therefore by good Logick
<hi>he that hath not crucified them is not Christ's,</hi> and evidently <hi>whosoever is not
crucified at all,</hi> he <hi>is not crucified with Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And sure I need not put you in remembrance, that the man in whom
sin reigns, and whensoever his Lusts and Passions bid him go he goeth,
or come he cometh, or do this he doeth it, that <hi>the body of sin is not cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
in him;</hi> that which were nailed and fetter'd on the Cross and slain
there could not command and rule him so.</p>
                  <p>Or if sins dominion be not so absolute but God hath got some foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
so as that his Law hath power in the man's mind so as to make
him make resistances against his sin, and he dislikes it but alas commits
it still, yet what he does allows not, but returns to do it at the next
Temptation, afterwards would fain be good yet does not find how to
perform, something governs in his members, <hi>leading that Law in his
mind into captivity to the law of sin,</hi> this man although he hath <hi>the body of
death,</hi> yet 'tis not <hi>crucified and slain;</hi> for it does <hi>live</hi> and exercise the
greatest tyranny upon him, forces him to serve and to obey against his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40114:227"/>
mind, it overcomes his own heart, and all inclinations to good, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
God within him: Till men have left off the custom of the works
of sin, and all gross deeds of the flesh it were as vain to prove <hi>they are
not crucified,</hi> as that <hi>he is alive that walks and eats.</hi> Those works they
are the <hi>fruits of the flesh,</hi> the off-spring of its lusts, and were that cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and we by likeness to Christ's death planted into the Cross, we
could no more produce them, than that <hi>dead Tree</hi> the Cross <hi>could bear
fruit,</hi> or than a Carcass could have heat to generate, the Grave become
a Womb, or the dust bring forth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Yea more, they perform not the outward actions of life
who have but the image of death on them; and a man asleep works not,
yet is alive, his fancy and his inwards work; and if sin be onely kept
from breaking out, and men commit not gross deeds of the flesh, but yet
indulge to these things in imagination and the heart, cherish them in
phansie, and design, and wish, onely restrain the practice, or indulge to
spiritual wickednesses; you may as well say that a man is dead because
he does not walk abroad, because he keeps within doors, and lives only
in his Closet or his Bed Chamber, as say that sin is crucified, which
while it <hi>stirs but in the heart, it is not dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Once more, we part from all acquaintance with the dead,
the Corps of one that had the same Soul with us; howsoever we may
have some throes of grief to leave it, yet we put it from us, we admit
it to no more embraces; but if 'twere the loathsom Carcass of a Villain
Traytor that was Executed, we turn from the sight as from a Fiend, it is
a detestable and accursed spectacle. And so he that hath put his Body
of sin to death would have great aversations to it, yea how dear soever
it had been, he would no more endure the least acquaintance with it,
than he would go seek for his old conversations in the Chambers of
Death; he would shun the sight of any the most bosom custom, as he
would the Ghost of his dead Friend, he would abandon it as a most
ghastly dreadful spectacle; he would also <hi>bury these his dead out of
his sight.</hi> Thus he must needs be dispos'd that hath <hi>crucified his Old
man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And they that are thus <hi>dead with Christ shall also live with him,</hi> yea
those that are thus <hi>crucified with him, he hath</hi> already <hi>rais'd up together,
and hath made them sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus.</hi> There
already in their cause, and in their right and pledge, and there hereafter
in effect and full enjoyment.</p>

which therefore seem to have pretences to vye with
Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> for <hi>there</hi> also <hi>the Lord commanded the Blessing.</hi> An

all this having the <hi>Law of Moses</hi> too; when they had all these

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40114:229"/>
expresly. And <hi>their Countrey being</hi> as <hi>Josephus</hi> says, <hi>the receptacle of all
discontented fugitive Jews,</hi> a great part of it too planted with them by

                     </gap>, just as the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
states it to our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> iv. <hi>Our Fathers Worshipped in this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
but ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to Worship:</hi>
So that if we audit the account of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> guilt, <hi>they separated
from the place of Worship which God had appointed, and set up another;</hi> in
a word, they were <hi>Schismaticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether this be such a guilt as should make those terms equivalent
<hi>He is a Samaritan and hath a Devil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John viii. 48.</note> I shall not say; but it is such as
makes our Saviour say somewhat exclusively,<note place="margin">John iv. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Salvation is of the Jews.</hi>
All the Blessings and Salvations of the Law did indeed hover on Mount
<hi>Gerizim,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">see <hi>Hieron.</hi> in <hi>Epitaph Paulae.</hi>
                     </note> were given thence, that was the place of them; but they were
<hi>cut away</hi> when <hi>Schism</hi> came: The <hi>Church</hi> is not a <hi>place of blessing</hi> when
'tis built <hi>against the Church;</hi> The <hi>Altar</hi> hath no Horns to lay hold on for
refuge, but to push and gore onely, when it is set up <hi>against the Altar;</hi>
And <hi>Gerizim</hi> is <hi>Ebal</hi> when it stands in competition with <hi>Mount Zion.</hi>
Well; this onely thing does breed the greatest distances imaginable in
the Nations, nothing more divides than <hi>Separation</hi> and <hi>Schism;</hi> and then
these <hi>Samaritans</hi> as all <hi>Separatists</hi> do, grew such Opiniastres and so
violent in their way, as to deny humanity to those that would not join
with them; they would not grant the Civilities of Passage to one that
intended for <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to Worship: They refuse it to our Saviour here
<hi>because his Face was thitherward,</hi> ver. 53. A Schismatick will reject a
Christ if his Face be fromward their new Establishment, if he but look
towards the Antient Worship: At this the <hi>Sons of Zebedee</hi> are offended,
zealous for their Master, as being most particularly concern'd in him,
two of his nearest intimates; and their zeal would needs break out into
flame.<note place="margin">2 Kings i. 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> And why not? a rudeness to <hi>Elijah</hi> was reveng'd by him with
Fire from Heaven, which consumed twice fifty Soldiers and their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
though they came to do the King's Command: And shall these
hated Schismaticks be rude to Thee? and reject the Messiah, and yet go
unpunished? <hi>Lord, shall we command fire to come down from Heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
them, even as Elias did?</hi> Which our Saviour answers with this
sharp rebuke, <hi>Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to divide but to explain my Text, and so instead of parts present
you with some Subjects of Discourse.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Spirit</hi> here is meant that disposition and complexure of Christian
Piety and Vertues, that course and Method of Religion which the Spirit
does prescribe to Christ's Disciples, and does guide them in; or in a
word, <hi>the temper of the Gospel</hi> is so called: And this in opposition to <hi>the
Law,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. viii. 15.</note> the difference of these being express'd by a diverse manner of <hi>Spirit;</hi>
the one is called <hi>Spirit of Bondage,</hi> the other <hi>Spirit of Adoption;</hi> so here
<hi>Ye know not of what Spirit ye are,</hi> ye do not judg aright, if you believe
the temper of the Gospel is like that of the Law: The course that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to my Disciples differs much from that of Prophets under the Old
Testament, you must be guided by another Spirit than <hi>Elijah</hi>'s was in
calling for Fire, if my Spirit dwell in you, For <hi>I came not to destroy
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40114:229"/>
mens lives</hi> on any such account. In this sense it affords these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>First, To destroy Mens lives, or other temporal rights on this account
meerly, because they are <hi>Apostates, Schismaticks,</hi> or otherwise <hi>reject the
true Religion,</hi> or <hi>Christ himself,</hi> is inconsistent with the temper of the
Gospel, This is that which Christ reproves here, telling them that
would do so, <hi>Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Because the <hi>Spirit of Elias,</hi> which the <hi>Gospel Christian Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
here is set in opposition to, oppos'd the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> destroy'd those
that came commission'd from the Prince, and Christ designedly does say
ye must not do now what <hi>Elias</hi> did, therefore, to attempt upon or against
the Magistrate, on the account of <hi>Christ,</hi> or of <hi>Religion,</hi> is inconsistent
with the <hi>Spirit of the Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, Of the first that to destroy mens lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here I must observe, that since these fiery Disciples that did give
occasion for our Saviours rebuke, here were no Magistrates, nor did
Christ himself that gave the rebuke assume,<note place="margin">Luke xii. 14.</note> but renounce openly all such
Authority;<note place="margin">John xviii. 36.</note> therefore no observation grounded on these words can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
the Magistrates just Power in punishing Offences done against his
Laws, although pretences of Religion and Conscience give colour to
those offences; the Gospel does diminish no rights of the secular Powers:
Now Supreme Magistrates, though as such they have no right to <hi>judg
in Articles of Faith,</hi> to define what is true Religion, what not; for then
the Pagan Princes who had never heard of Christ, and yet are as much
Magistrates as any, would have right to judg what Doctrines Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
down to be believed.</p>
                  <p>But certainly when Christ Commission'd his Faith to run through all
the World not onely independently from all the Powers of it but in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
opposition to them, they can have no right to judg in that, which
whatsoever they shall Judg we are alike bound to receive (the Faith
of Christ) without any the least difference to their judgment. But
though they have no right to judg of this, they have <hi>Authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
what Faith shall have the priviledges of their State and what
shall not; which shall be publiquely profess'd, and which they will inhibit
with Penalties:</hi> For sure the Priviledges of the State and power of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
are the proper rights of the Supreme Power, and therefore none
but that can judg and determine of them. In a word, since it is most
evident that the tranquillity of a State does depend upon nothing more
than the profession and priviledging of Religion; it follows that those
Powers to whose Judgment and Decrees the care and Tranquillity of the
State is committed, must have the power to judg and to determine what
Faith shall be publiquely profess'd and priviledg'd by the State: In which
Judgment and administration if they err, and priviledg a false Faith and
inhibit the true; they use their Power ill, and are responsible to God for
doing so, but they do not invade or usurp a Power that is not their own.
Rather 'tis most certain if the Principles of any Sect, or else if not they,
yet the pursuance of any Principles do tend directly towards, or are
found to work Commotions and Treasonable enterprises, the Supreme
Power hath as much right to restrain, yea and Punish them, although
with Death according to their several merits, as he hath to punish those
effects in any other instances wherein they do express themselves.</p>

Nor must Religion secure those practices which it cannot <hi>sanctifie,</hi> but
does <hi>envenome.</hi> For by putting an everlasting concern into mens Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and actions their undertakings are made by it more desperate and
unreclaimable. What Wounds and what Massacres must the State ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from them that stab and murder it with the same Zeal that the
<hi>Priest</hi> kills a <hi>Sacrifice?</hi> that go to act their Villanies with <hi>Devotion,</hi> and
go to their own <hi>Execution</hi> as to <hi>Martyrdom?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twere easie for me to deduce the practice of this Power from the
best Magistrates in the best times, if that were my business; who had
onely this temptation to say thus much, that I might not seem to clash
with the Magistrates Power of coercion in Religious causes when I did
affirm, that <hi>to destroy mens Lives or other temporal Rights on this account
meerly because they are Apostates, Schismaticks, or otherwise reject the
true Religion, or Christ himself, is inconsistent with the temper of the
Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you would discover what the temper of the Gospel is, you may
see it in its Prophecy and Picture in the Prophet <hi>Isay,<note place="margin">Isal. xi. 6, 7, &amp;c. &amp; 65. 25.</note> The Wolf shall
dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lye down with the Kid, the
sucking Child shall play on the hole of the Asp, and the weaned Child shall
put his hand on the Cockatrice den, and the Serpent shall eat the dust.</hi>
Whatever mischief these have in themselves, there's nothing of devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or of hurt to one another in this state; 'tis like <hi>Paradise restor'd,</hi> the
prospect of the Garden of the Lord. Rather whereas <hi>there</hi> these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
onely <hi>met, here</hi> they <hi>lye down</hi> and <hi>dwell together:</hi> And the <hi>Asp</hi> and
<hi>Serpent</hi> that could poyson <hi>Paradise</hi> it self, have now no venomous tooth
to <hi>bite,</hi> no not the <hi>heel,</hi> nor spiteful tongue to <hi>hiss.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to speak out of Figure, the Gospel in it self requires not the Life
of any for transgression against it self, it calls all into it, and waits their
coming; those that sin against it, it useth methods to reform, hath its
Spiritual Penalties indeed, whereby it would inflict amendment and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
on Offenders: But because final impenitence and unbelief are the
onely <hi>breaches</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of this Religion, therefore it does wait till
life and possibilities of Repentance are run out; and then its Punishments
indeed come home with interest, but not till then. The Law 'tis true
was of another temper, it required the <hi>life</hi> of an <hi>Apostate</hi> to <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
whether 'twere a single Person,<note place="margin">Gal. iv. 1, 3.</note> or a City, <hi>Deut.</hi> xiii. To the <hi>Jew</hi> that
was a <hi>Child,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> says, and so not to be kept in awe by threats of
future abdication, things beyond the prospect of his care, but must
have present punishments, the Rod still in his eye; and was a refractory
Child that seem'd to have the <hi>Amorite</hi> and <hi>Hivite</hi> derived into him, a
tincture of Idolatry in his Constitution, that was as ready to run back
into the <hi>superstitions</hi> as the <hi>Land of Egypt,</hi> as eager for their <hi>Deities</hi> as
their <hi>Onions,</hi> and had the same appetite to the <hi>Calf</hi> and to the <hi>fleshpots,</hi>
to make the one a <hi>God,</hi> the other a <hi>Meal;</hi> to such a People Death, that
was the onely probable restraint, was put into the Law by <hi>God</hi> who was
himself <hi>Supream Magistrate</hi> in that <hi>Theocraty,</hi> against whom 'twas exact
Rebellion and Treason to take <hi>another God,</hi> and therefore was by him
punish'd with Death. But the Spirit whom Christ sends breaths no such
threats, for he can come on no Designs but such as Christ can join in,
but saith Christ, <hi>I came not to destroy mens lives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:40114:230"/>
Secondly, The temper of the Gospel is discovered in its Precepts. I
shall name but one, <hi>Matth.</hi> v. 43, 44. <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been
said, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour and hate thine Enemy: But I say unto
you, love your Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. Where if <hi>Enemy</hi> did not mean the man
whom private quarrel had made such, and Him it could not mean, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
said to them that they must <hi>love that Enemy,</hi> Exod. xxiii. 4, 5. But,
as the <hi>Jews neighbour</hi> was <hi>every one of his Religion,</hi> and he liv'd near
him that lived in the same Covenant with him, so <hi>enemy</hi> being oppos'd
to that, must signifie one <hi>not of his Religion:</hi> An <hi>Alien,</hi> an Idolater, with
any of which they were indeed to have no exercise of love or friendship,
no commerce: and to some Enemies, the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> no mercy, but they
were to hate them to destruction, <hi>Deut.</hi> vii. If so, then our Saviours ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
here, <hi>But I say unto you, love your Enemies,</hi> does say that <hi>we must
love even these;</hi> the <hi>Christian</hi> hath no <hi>Canaanites,</hi> but the most prosliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
adversaries of his Religion he must love, and pray for them although
they persecute him: (Which makes appear it does at least include Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Religion, for Persecutions seldom were on any other ground,
and Religion which should have nothing else but Heaven in it, as if it
had the malice and the Flames of Hell, breaths nothing else but Fire and
Faggot to all those that differ in it.) But whether it be an addition
and mean thus or no, since it is sure that both they and we are bound
to <hi>love the Neighbour,</hi> and Christ hath prov'd, <hi>Luke</hi> x. that the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
he whom our two Disciples would consume, that <hi>Schismatick</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecter
of Christ</hi> is yet a <hi>Neighbour,</hi> therefore <hi>him</hi> also we must <hi>love</hi> and
<hi>pray for.</hi> Now 'tis a strange way of affection to destroy them, to <hi>love</hi>
them <hi>thus to the death,</hi> to get admission to their <hi>hearts</hi> with a <hi>Swords
point,</hi> to <hi>pray for them</hi> by <hi>calling for Fire down from Heaven</hi> to consume
them. S. <hi>Greg. Nazian.</hi> calls the founder of that Faction that began this
practice in the Church, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and if so, we know well of
what Spirit he is that does call for fire to devour those that differ from
him in Religion; 'tis sure one of this Legion, or it rather is the leader
of them, that did dwell in Tombs, and does in flames, things which he
loves so to inflict; one that was the first Rebel too, which leads me to
my second Observation: That</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To attempt upon, or against the Prince on the account of
Christ, or of Religion, is most inconsistent with the Spirit of the Gospel.</hi>
For it was the Spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> who destroyed those whom the Magistrate
did send, that Christ opposes here the Spirit of the Gospel to, in this
severe rebuke, <hi>ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other warm Apostle meets a greater check in the like case, S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
zeal, that they say made him <hi>chief of the Apostles,</hi> as it made him
promptest to <hi>confess</hi> the Lord, so it did heat him to be readiest to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi>
him; as fiery to use his <hi>Sword</hi> as his <hi>Tongue</hi> for his Master: But his
Master will not let a Sword be drawn in his own cause;<note place="margin">Matth. xxvi. 52.</note> 
                     <hi>put up again thy
Sword into his place:</hi> The God of our Religion will not be defended by
Treason, and from Murder by the wounding of another, nor will his
Religion suffer a Sword out of the sheath against the Power of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
no not in behalf of <hi>Christ himself;</hi> but goes beyond its proper
bounds to threaten things that are not Gospel punishments, even exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in this life,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> to them that do attempt it, <hi>They that take the Sword,
shall perish with the Sword.</hi> Here the <hi>Gospel</hi> becomes <hi>Law,</hi> and turns <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:40114:231"/>
for the Magistrate though persecuting <hi>Christ himself.</hi> Our Saviour
does not think it sharp enough to tell S. <hi>Peter</hi> that he <hi>did not know what
Spirit he was of,</hi> for when this Disciple would have kept these sufferings
from his Master onely by his counsel,<note place="margin">Matth. xvi. 13.</note> he replies to him, <hi>get thee behind
me Satan:</hi> He was then of that manner of Spirit; therefore now that
he does so much worse, when he attempts to keep them from him with
a Sword, and drawn against the Power, as if Christ did not know how
to word <hi>what Spirit</hi> such attempts did savour of, he does not check
and rebuke now, but threaten and denounce. And 'tis obvious to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that this same <hi>Peter</hi> who would needs be fighting for his Master,
in few hours with most cursed imprecations forswears him:<note place="margin">Matth. xxvi. 74.</note> And so

Interest; and that <hi>warm</hi> shine that kindles there pretended <hi>Angels of
Light,</hi> is but a <hi>flash of Hell, a glory about a fiend.</hi> Therefore afterwards
none was more forward than S. <hi>Peter</hi> was to press submission to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
though most unjustly persecuting for Religion; talks of no Fire
but the <hi>fiery trial</hi> then,<note place="margin">Verse 12.</note> in <hi>Epist. 1. Cap.</hi> iv. and <hi>If ye suffer for the Name

Law most excellently ordained by the Spirit of God, who knew best to
temper his Law with the mixture of what is profitable to us, and honest in
it self.</hi> They knew what <hi>manner of Spirit</hi> that of Christianity was: It
does assume no power to inflict it self: 'Tis not commission'd to plant
it self with violence, or destroy those that refuse or oppose it. It wages
War indeed with Vices, not with men: And in the Camp of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
as once in <hi>Israel, there is no Sword found but with Saul and Jonathan
his Son,</hi> onely the Princes Sword. Our <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Dove,</hi> no Bird of
prey that, nor indeed of gall or passion: If Christian Religion be to be
writ in Blood, 'tis in that of its own confessors onely; if mens false O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
make no parties nor mischiefs in the State, we are not to make
them Martyrs to their false Opinions; and if they be not so happy as to
be Orthodox, send them down to Hell directly: tear out one anothers
Souls to tear out that which we think an Errour. Sure they must not
root out <hi>smutted Corn</hi> that must not root out <hi>Poppy;</hi> we may let that
which is a little blasted grow,<note place="margin">Matth. xiii. 29.</note> if we must let the <hi>Tares</hi> and <hi>Darnel</hi> grow.
The Soldiers would not <hi>crucifie Christ's Coat,</hi> nor make a <hi>rent</hi> there

that they do rent his <hi>Flesh</hi> to catch it, and to gain an inclosure of the

what they call dross in a Furnace of consuming flame: The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Spirit's fiery Tongues must kindle no such heats, but his <hi>effusions</hi>
call'd <hi>Rivers,</hi> came to quench such fires: <hi>Effusions</hi> that were mistaken
sor <hi>new wine</hi> indeed, but never look'd like <hi>Blood.</hi> Nor are they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to this Spirit, those that have him call'd down on them in their
Consecration, impowered for such uses. When Christ sent his Disciples
to convert the World,<note place="margin">Luke x. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold saith he, I send you forth as Lambs among
Wolves:</hi> And sure that does not sound like giving a Commission to tear
and worry those that would not come into the Flock: The Sheep were
not by that impowered to devour the Wolves. Our Lords directions
to his Apostles when a City would not receive their Doctrine was <hi>shake
off the dust of your feet;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. x. 14. Luke x. 11.</note> let nothing of theirs cleave to you, have no
more to do with them; cast off the very dust that setled on your Sandals
as you pass'd their Streets. And surely then we must be far from ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
to give ruin to, and seize the Sword, the Scepter, and the Thrones
of Kings, if they refuse to receive Christ or his Kingdom, or his Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
or his Vicar. If I must not have the dust of any such upon my
feet, I must not have their Land in my possession, their Crowns on my
head, their Wealth in my Coffers, their Blood upon my hands, nor their
Souls upon my Sword. It will be ill appearing so when we come to
give an account how we have executed our Commission; and shall be
ask'd, did I send you to inflict the Cross, or preach it? to save mens
Souls or to destroy their lives, yea and Souls too? And when in those
Myriads of Souls that have perish'd in the desolations which such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
have wrought their Blood shall cry from under the Altar, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sacrific'd to that Duty and Religion which was the utmost that they
understood (if so be that there were no Treason to discolour it) and
they that did inflict all this appear but <hi>Christian Dioclesians,</hi> and stand at
that sad Day in the train of the Persecutions, on the same hand: O then
those Fires which these Boutefeus called for and kindled shall blaze out
into everlasting burnings!</p>
                  <p>And now it may seem strange that they who most of all pretend the

that of <hi>Gospel;</hi> always endeavouring to do that which our Saviour here
checks his Disciples for proposing, and did threaten <hi>Peter</hi> for attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
There are among our selves that seem to live by Inspiration, that
look and speak as in the frame of the Gospel, as if every motion
were impulse from Heaven: and yet as if Christ had fulfilled his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to them without Metaphor, <hi>baptized them with the Holy Ghost and
fire,</hi> onely that they might kindle fire, and <hi>the unction of the Spirit</hi> did
but add Oyl to those flames; as if <hi>the cloven Tongues</hi> of fire in which
the <hi>Spirit did descend,</hi> were made to be the Emblems of Division, and
to call for fire; these mens <hi>life,</hi> their <hi>garb,</hi> their very <hi>piety</hi> is <hi>faction:</hi>
they <hi>pray, rebel,</hi> and <hi>murder,</hi> and all <hi>by the Spirit.</hi> 'Tis true indeed they
plead now what we seem to say, that they should not be persecuted for
not being satisfied in their Conscience; so they mince their breaking of
the Laws for which they suffer. But do these know themselves <hi>what
manner of Spirit they are of?</hi> or are we bound not to remember when
they had the Power how they persecuted all that would not do at once

Opinions of particular persons howsoever horrid in my arguments this
day; but I onely ask whether it be not very probable this instance was
the thing to be attempted on this day? Whether the resolution was not
publish'd, the Pope's Bull if not made yet produc'd at least to caution
any Priest that should receive it in Confession, and should be so honest
as to abhor the Fact,<note place="margin">Placentin. Rom. 3. Colonien. Rhemens. Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramont. And he names more Popes.</note> yet from betraying it and hindring the Execution

desperate malecontents; but a long contrivance and of many heads, and
its taking its effect was the great care of their Church.</p>

And I will try it by the <hi>publique Acts and most establish'd Doctrines of the

does declare against all practices against the Prince for the cause of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>

<hi>infallibility of Spirit,</hi> also in the <hi>publique Acts of the Church repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative,</hi>
in <hi>General Councils</hi> does abett the doing them, not onely for

                  </p>
                  <p>First, If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have reason to expect infallible assistance
of the Spirit in any case,<note place="margin">Accordingly the School-men do account it <hi>de fide</hi> that the Pope cannot err in this.</note> it is as much in <hi>Canonizing of a Saint</hi> as in any
other, it being as unhappy to determine a false Object for Religious
Worship to their Church as a false Article of Faith; there is as much need
that there should be an infallible proposal of the one as other; for
when she does Decree by the Authority of the Omnipotent God such a
one is a Saint, receiv'd in Glory, and so renders him the Object of their
Worship, if he should chance to be a Reprobate; to cause the People to
fall prostrate to the Shrine of one that's damn'd, and call his flames to
warm Gods Altar and the Votaries breast, to make the whole Church
worship one that is in Hell, is liable to greater aggravations of impiety
than an erroneous Opinion in very many of their points of Faith can be.</p>
                  <p>But it is known their Church hath Canoniz'd one of this Nation,

                  <p>Secondly, It is notorious that in their first <hi>General Council</hi> at <hi>Lyons,
Anno</hi> 1245. the Emperour <hi>Frederick the second,</hi> by the Sentence of the
Pope and the whole Council after long deliberation and producing several
Arguments which they say are not sleight, but effectual to prove the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion
of Heresie, <hi>is depriv'd of his Empire, all his Subjects are absolv'd
from their Oath of Allegiance, and by Apostolical Authority forbidden to

                  <p>Thirdly, I should have urged the well known Canon of the <hi>General
Council of</hi> Lateran, (the greatest their Church ever boasted

Allegiance, and expose his Lands to be seiz'd by Catholicks;
who shall exterminate the Hereticks, saving the right of the
chief Lord: Provided he give no impediment to this. But
the same law shall be observed to those that have no chief
Lords;</hi> that is, who are themselves Supream.</p>
                  <p>This I should urge, but that some say that penal Statutes which are

Fourthly, In the <hi>General Council of Constance,</hi> that part of it I mean
that is approv'd by their whole Church. The Pope and Council joyn

Subjects in any case to resist and stand against the Superiour Powers: that
we must indeed believe undoubtedly that we may not obey Kings, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
or any other, if they would command us to do any thing contrary to
Gods Commands. In such a case we ought to say with the Apostle, we must
rather obey God than Man. But nevertheless in that case we may not in

2 Book of Hom. 4 part of the <hi>Serm. against wilful Rebellion.</hi> The
very same thing is defined in the first of the Constitutions and Canons
Ecclesiastical of the year 1640. <hi>for Subjects to bear Arms against their
King, offensive, or defensive, upon any pretence whatever, is at least to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the Powers which are ordain'd of God: and though they do not invade
but onely resist, S.</hi> Paul <hi>tells them plainly, he that resists receives unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
damnation.</hi> This was the Doctrine of the Church in those her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions;
and although there was no Parliament then sitting to enact
these <hi>Canons</hi> into <hi>Laws,</hi> yet since that time the Law of <hi>England</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
to say the same;<note place="margin">Subscription to the Act for uniformity. 14 <hi>Car.</hi> 2.</note> and we obliged by it to acknowledg, <hi>that it is
not Lawful upon any pretence whatsoever, to take up Arms against the King,</hi>
by this Parliament, whose memory shall be for ever blessed.</p>
                  <p>And now it is not hard to know <hi>what manner of Spirit</hi> our Church
is of, even that <hi>Spirit</hi> that <hi>anoints the Lords Anointed,</hi> that is, which
<hi>Commissions them, Gods Spirit,</hi> as we find it phras'd in Scripture: And
'tis obvious to each eye that there is much more resemblance betwixt

                  <p>But far be it from me to conclude hence that all of their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
do allow their Doctrines: Though they stand on the same bottom
that their Faith of <hi>half-Communion,</hi> and <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> do; even <hi>Acts
of the same Councils,</hi> yet I doubt not multitudes of loyal Souls of this
our Nation do abhor the Tenents, by what Rule of theirs I know not I
confess. Nor shall I enquire what <hi>Security</hi> a Prince can have of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi>
of those, who by the most infallible Rules of their Religion can
be loyal onely on Condition, by the leave of those who are his Enemies,
on whose will and power all their <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> are <hi>depending.</hi> If the
most essential interest of Princes will not move them to consider this,
sure I am I shall not undertake it: But I shall take the confidence out
of the premises to infer, that <hi>no Religion in the World does more provide
for the security of Kings, than the Christian as it is profess'd in our Church
does.</hi> And when we see the Interest of the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> were twist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God in the preservations of this day, nor could be separated in
the late dismal Confusions, but died and reviv'd together in the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
they that hate the execrable mischiefs of those times, or love
the Crown, or do not come to mock God when they come to give him
thanks for his great glories of this day, cannot choose but have <hi>good
will for our Sion,</hi> cannot have an unconcernedness for this Religion, a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40114:234"/>
cold indifference to it or any other; which where-ere it is, alas I fear
betrays too openly <hi>indifference</hi> and <hi>unconcernedness</hi> for <hi>Religion it self.</hi>
For if I should appeal to our most Sceptick Statists, and not beg one
Principle of a Religion, but take their own: <hi>Religion was contriv'd,</hi> they
say, <hi>by pretending to engage a God to uphold his Vicegerent, and by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
after, everlasting punishments before mens fears,</hi> (for they saw pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
ones restrained not Treason) was contriv'd I say, <hi>to uphold States:</hi>
Then that must be the <hi>best</hi> with them that <hi>best upholds,</hi> and then I
have evinc'd the <hi>Christian</hi> is secure, as 'tis <hi>prosess'd by our Church.</hi> But
then shame to those who to gratifie their lusts meerly, labour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
themselves and others there is no such thing in earnest as a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
to punishments:</hi> who by publique raillery in sacred things, and
turning all to merriment, endeavour to take off the sense of all Religion,
and have done it in great measure; and so thrown down the best-Basis
on which Government subsists: which they themselves confess was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be fram'd on purpose for it. For <hi>if there be no after fears, he
that is stronger than to need to fear the present may rebel, kill Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Atheists</hi> are <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> I am sure in Politicks; more traiterous
than our mad <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> or than the <hi>Canons of the Popish Councils:</hi> To
these Sadduces in Christianity we may say, <hi>ye know not what spirit ye are
of,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts xxiii. 8.</note> who know not <hi>whether there be any Spirit.</hi> But it is indeed because
they are all flesh themselves:<note place="margin">Gal. v, 19, 20, 21.</note> But then <hi>if the works of the flesh be manifest,
Adultery, Fornication, Seditions, Heresies, Murders, Drunkenness, &amp;c.</hi> we
know <hi>what manner of Spirit they are of;</hi> even the <hi>spirit</hi> that did <hi>enter
into the Swine,</hi> the <hi>Legion</hi> indeed <hi>of Spirits,</hi> one Spirit is not Devil
enough to animate the flesh into so many of those works. But <hi>the fruits
of the Spirit</hi> that Gospel Spirit which we Christians are of,<note place="margin">Ver. 22, 23.</note> are <hi>love,
peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, joy
in the Holy Ghost;</hi> and they that do bring forth such fruits are <hi>baptised</hi>
indeed <hi>with the Holy Ghost;</hi> and if <hi>with fire, fire that came down from
Heaven</hi> too, 'twas onely to consume their dross that they may be pure
mettal, fit as for the <hi>King's Inscription, meek Christians, good Subjects,</hi> so
for <hi>Gods Image</hi> to be stamp'd upon, that is, <hi>renewed in Righteousness and
true Holiness. Fire</hi> this that will sublime our very flesh into spiritual
body, that we may begin here that <hi>incorruptible</hi> which our <hi>corruptible
must put on, when our vile Bodies shall be made like to the glorious Body of
our Saviour:</hi> To which state that <hi>Spirit which rais'd up Jesus from the
dead</hi> bring us, <hi>by quickning our mortal Bodies.</hi>

bring men to Repentance is nothing strange; for
this is but to take care that all that ever he hath
done for them be not in vain and lost: But that in
<hi>Hell,</hi> a place which nothing but Repentance can destroy; there should
be such designs seems stange, yet not if we consider the condition of
the place, whose Torments are not onely of so dire a nature, that he

nothing being judged more effectual to terrifie men from those pains,
than the exceeding greatness of those pains, which he that feels thinks
the relation alone will do; for he said, <hi>Nay Father Abraham, but if one
went unto them from the dead they will repent, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words do willingly suggest occasion for several Inquiries, and
some of those of the nicer and more curious kind, but truly I shall not
attend to those suggestions, but shall chuse to handle some few of the
most obvious and popular Considerations that the words break into,
and they are three.</p>
                  <p>First, The Rich man's Charity to his Brethren, his unsatisfied desire
and care that they may be brought to Repentance, expressed in these
words, <hi>Nay Father Abraham,</hi> though <hi>they have Moses and Prophets,</hi> yet
let them have <hi>one method more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have here his choice of that <hi>method,</hi> that which he
thought would do though nothing else would; in these words, <hi>If one
went unto them from the dead they will repent.</hi> In the handling of which,
we shall examine what the grounds were upon which this Rich man was
so confident that that would work upon them; and here we find he chose
with several advantages.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>One from the dead;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That one <hi>Lazarus;</hi> and he</p>
                  <p>First, One <hi>out of Abraham's Bosom:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, One that had seen him also in his Torments and
could <hi>testifie</hi> of them, <hi>v.</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We have here these fancied hopes all dash'd in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
answer, <hi>And he said unto him, if they believe not Moses and the Prophets,
neither will they be perswaded though one rose from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First of the first, the Charitable, careful contrivances this Rich man
in Hell had for his Brethren upon Earth: <hi>Nay Father Abraham, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is commonly reported of men who know themselves infected by
the Plague, that they desire to infect as many others as they can; they
contrive to spread the Contagion, and love society of Ruin; and we are
sure it is so in that Plague of the Soul, <hi>Sin.</hi> This humour did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
it self to debauch <hi>Heaven,</hi> and unpeople <hi>Paradise,</hi> but all the Ages
of the World make up its Triumph, and every sin that ever was, and
misery that shall be, is its issue. <hi>Lucifer</hi>'s pride would have a train of
<hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Mankind</hi> to wait upon him in Destruction: And in such an
attendance, though to his everlasting cost, he does still pride himself;
he feeds upon that Envy that devours him, and chears himself with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
fewel to his flames that do torment him; and upon this account
<hi>enjoyes</hi> his <hi>own Agonies</hi> and <hi>God's Indignation:</hi> And then it is no wonder
if his Agents upon Earth enjoy the sport; and if the Devil does not
more please himself to see his Dominions enlarg'd and the business of
Hell go forward, than wicked men do in having others become like
themselves; as if they did derive to themselves, and possess the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
as they do the guilt of those whom they draw in; and the delight
like the sin, were <hi>all in all, and all in every part</hi> of the whole Company
that joyn in wickedness. But it should seem 'tis otherwise with the
Sinners in Hell. Our Rich man here when he saw his own estate reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diless,
so vast a <hi>gulf</hi> betwixt him an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>

the least drop of refreshment, no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> hopes nor wishes of it could
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40114:236"/>
pass thence to him; but Torment sealed upon him by an irreversible
Decree; he begins then to contrive for his Brethren, how their falling
into the like estate with him might be prevented, <hi>ver.</hi> 27, 28. Nor sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with this, when <hi>Abraham</hi> replies, they are provided well enough,
<hi>they have Moses and the Prophets,</hi> the one Preaching the Law to them,
whose <hi>Rules</hi> they have made as familiar to them as their <hi>dress,</hi> they <hi>put
on</hi> daily Gods Commandments, and their duty; make his Precepts their
<hi>frontlets</hi> and their <hi>wristbands.</hi> And the other the <hi>Prophets,</hi> are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned
from God to lay before their eyes the issue of transgressions,
give them a <hi>vision</hi> of the Judgments that await their sins, and come to
them burdned with the foreknowledg of the Sinners expectations; so
that except they will resolve to chuse destruction wilfully to assault their
own perdition, there is no fear they should come thither; those tell them
as much as any from the dead can do: Ah! but thinks he, all those
methods I had, yet I am here; and then let them have one other; for as
now after this little tast of Torments were I to live again, I should most
certainly avoid this place, and lead another kind of life than that which
does expire into this <hi>Tophet;</hi> So if one went to tell them how it is with
me, sure then they would repent and not come hither; therefore I pray
thee send; <hi>Nay Father Abraham, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot here assent to Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi>'s account that all this earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was onely pride in our Rich man, and a desire to have the glory
of his Family advanc'd; which as he laboured to raise here by Wealth,
so now finding by sad experience that was but a weak foundation to
build a lasting House upon, and that all the shine of it was but false trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
light, such as did end in flame with him; and having made dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of other greater glories, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> possess'd, he
would have his Family as high and bright as they; and this their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
which he took such care for, was but in order to that exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>If it were so, truly it is the first pride I ever read of that would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
it self with no meaner a dress than the Robes of Immortality, and
was ambitious of the Throne of Glory. I have heard I confess of a
proud lowliness, where the humility is but the manage and the art of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lofty, is onely assum'd condesc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntion whereby men but descend to be
extol'd, and stoop to take advantage for their mount: But never heard
of any pride that aimed to raise it self by the humiliations of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that laid its groundwork in that dust and ashes, cloath'd it self
in the sackcloth and neglected rudenesses of a pious penitent sorrow:
The prides of this side Hell are of a different garb I'm sure, if theirs be
such; if they design by those just means to settle the inheritance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in their Families, sure the <hi>vices of Hell</hi> may be fit patterns for our
<hi>Religious performances,</hi> and 'twere to be desired that all Christians had
this mans ardencies and flames in their affections to their Houses.</p>
                  <p>Yet neither can I from this one particular instance draw any general
proposition concerning the kindness of that place to Sinners upon Earth,
although all those that make this History not Parable would give me co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
for it: But waving that, since Christ hath so framed the
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (which is a relation of such words as they would have spoke, had
they spoke on this occasion) I shall take that as ground enough to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it to the conviction of those who are so far from these Charitable
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40114:237"/>
designs to the Souls of others, that they contrive nothing more than how
to have the company of their Friends in those ways that lead to this
place of Torment; prevail with them to join in sinning, and shew a Vice
how to insinuate into them.</p>
                  <p>The kindnesses of our man here in the flames were divine God like
Charities compared to these. Our Saviour says, <hi>Take heed that ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
not one of these little ones, for I say unto you that in Heaven their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
do always behold the Face of my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Matth.
xviii. 10. Which one expounds, <hi>if we neglect to do what is in our power to
preserve the meanest Christians from Vice, and sleight their sinning, their
Tutelary Angels that have continual recourse to God, and are high in his
favour, will make complaints of us in their behalf,</hi> at least they will if
we <hi>offend them,</hi> and any action of ours prove an <hi>occasion of their sins.</hi>
And if a favourite of Heaven shall accuse us to the Lord for that, Then
how will he complain of us when we <hi>tempt?</hi> when he shall have to say
against us, that we have ensnared and drawn such a Soul into a Custom
that will ruin it eternally; and when he shall bring against us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
out of <hi>Hell</hi> here, and the kindnesses of one among the Devils shall
come in Judgment against us; where we see the Rich Man thought not
of his own condemnation so much he thought of the averting that of his
Brethren. We might suppose a man in his condition could not consider
any thing but his own Tortures. O yes, to preserve others from them;
yet, when the man in Hell does so, the men on Earth do think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than to entice others into them. And is it not a strange Age
then, when to tempt is the onely mode of kindness, and men do scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know how to express themselves civil to their Friends but by pressing
them to sin and so be sick with them? as if this were the gentile use of
Societies, to season Youth into good Company, and bring the Fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Vices into their acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis well if they stay there; it happens so that Parts and Wit,
Faculties and Acquisitions do ingratiate men into these treacherous kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and qualifie them for the desires and friendships of such persons
as entertain them by softning them into <hi>loosness</hi> and then into <hi>prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
debauch their <hi>manners,</hi> and then their <hi>Principles;</hi> teach them to
sport themselves with <hi>Vice,</hi> and then with <hi>Holy things,</hi> and after with
<hi>Religion it self;</hi> which is a greater <hi>Luxury</hi> than that their Riots treat
their Appetites withal, the <hi>Luxury of Wit.</hi> And thus they educate them
into <hi>Atheism,</hi> and these familiar Devils are call'd Acquaintances and
Friends: And indeed the Companions in sin a man would think should
be dear Friends, such as pour an heart into one another in their common
Cups, shed Souls in their Lusts, are friends to one another even in ruin,
and love to their own Condemnation, are kind beyond the <hi>Altar-flames,</hi>
even to those <hi>everlasting fires;</hi> such communications certainly cement af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
so that nothing can divide them: And let them do so, but <hi>Lord
send me the kindness of Hell rather,</hi> one that will be a friend like this man
in his Torments, that with unsatisfied cares minded the reformation
of his Friends, <hi>Nay Father Abraham, but if one went unto them from the
dead they will repent;</hi> which brings me to the <hi>Choice,</hi> the second thing.</p>
                  <p>If a Ghost should indeed appear to any of us in the midst of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions,
it would certainly hurry us from our Enjoyments; and there
are no such ties &amp; unions by which the advantages of sin do hold us fix'd
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40114:237"/>
and jointed to them, but the shake and tremble we should then be in,
would loosen and dissolve them all, and make us uncling from them, if
we may believe discourses that tell us such a sight is able to startle a
man however he be fix'd by his most close Devotions; for what the
<hi>Jews</hi> were wont to say, <hi>we shall die because we have seen an Angel of the
Lord from Heaven,</hi> most men do fear if they should see the <hi>Spirit of a dead
man from the Earth.</hi> Indeed the affrights which men do usually conceive
at the meer apprehension of such an Apparition, do probably arise from
a surprise, in being minded hastily of such a state for which they are
not then prepared so as they would wish or hope to be, to which they
think that is a Call, for <hi>we shall die</hi> said the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But not to ask the reason of this now, but find the reason why our
Rich Man thinks when <hi>Moses and the Prophets</hi> cannot make a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
such a <hi>Ghost</hi> should: We have it in <hi>ver.</hi> 28, they do but <hi>discourse</hi>
to us, but one from the dead could <hi>testifie,</hi> he could bear witness that it
is so as they say, speak his own sight and knowledg, and therefore
though <hi>they hear not Moses and the Prophets, yet if one went unto them
from the dead they will repent.</hi> For</p>
                  <p>First, One from the Dead could testifie that <hi>when we die we do not
cease to be;</hi> and he would make appear that our departing hence is not
annihilation, and so would dash the hopes of <hi>Epicures;</hi> such as I was,
and I may fear they are; who as they live like Beasts do think to die so
too: and who are <hi>rational</hi> in this alone that they desire to be but <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</hi>
And all the rest of men whether worldly or sensual, that enclose
their desires and enjoyments within this life, and above all the <hi>Atheist</hi>
that dares not look beyond it, all these would be convinc'd by such an
evidence. Indeed this would take away the main encouragement of all
ungodliness, which upon little reasonings how thin soever, that there's
no life after this does quicken and secure it self, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 2. and therefore
every Sect of men that did prescribe Morality did teach an after life,
nothing was more believ'd among the Heathen; Their Tribunal below,
where three most severe Judges were appointed, meant the same thing
with our <hi>last Assize,</hi> and their <hi>Elizian fields</hi> were but <hi>Poetical Paradise,</hi>
their <hi>Phlegethon,</hi> River of Fire, was set to express our <hi>stream of Brimstone
flame:</hi> Thus <hi>Resurrection in fable made them vertuous;</hi> the guess at it
made <hi>Socrates</hi> die chearful, and though his hopes had <hi>faint</hi> weak Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
they had <hi>Heroick</hi> almost <hi>Martyr resolutions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And on the other side, of those that among them deny'd an after life,
though we are told that <hi>Epicurus</hi> was a vertuous man, yet his Sect did
give name to Vice; and is still the expression for it, and all that did
espouse the Tenents of it,<note place="margin">

one coming from the dead would rectifie, and so contribute to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
Especially if</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That one were <hi>Lazarus,</hi> if he that at the <hi>Supper of the Lamb</hi>
sits next the <hi>Father of the faithful,</hi> and <hi>the friend of God,</hi> in one of the
higher Seats of <hi>Paradise,</hi> in <hi>Abraham's Bosom;</hi> if he would go and speak
his knowledg of the Pleasures of that Bosom which he tasts, and of the
glories of that Place, and but compare them with the little gayeties of
my Fathers House; shew them the difference betwixt their <hi>Structures</hi>
and <hi>that Foundation whose builder and maker God is,</hi> betwixt the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
of their riotous Palats, and the Festivals of the Blessed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then sure they would disrellish those, and catch at these, which do
exceed them by a whole Infinity, and will out-live them an Eternity.
And here should I attempt, what he would have had <hi>Lazarus</hi> perform,
to dash out the blessedness of that place, making the <hi>first draught</hi> of
them with notions of delight, not such as the Understanding cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
but such as seize the heart with pleasure in this Life, and that
give it the strongest agitations here; and sweetning that by those tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendencies
which I could fill it up with, and should I <hi>raise</hi> it then with
<hi>shadow,</hi> evince that reason, though it cannot fathom, can yet by sure
Discourse conclude the greatness of those Glories, which I would leave
for your expectations to loose themselves into; should I attempt all this
I were an insolent undertaker. Yet were it very easie to describe them
so as that viewing them with the things below, these would vanish
in the comparison. And to do so much was the utmost that our Rich
Man could design by sending <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who if he could have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
might probably have done the work; for if <hi>Faith</hi> did but do what
<hi>Lazarus</hi> did, <hi>look into Abraham's Bosom,</hi> were it but turn'd into a little
<hi>Vision,</hi> and but as clear <hi>an evidence of things not seen</hi> as <hi>eye-sight</hi> hath
of its temptations, had the <hi>spiritual</hi> Object but that advantage the <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
hath of being <hi>present,</hi> (now it is the work of <hi>Faith</hi> to give it that
advantage) sure it would be impossible for the sensitive Objects, the
pleasures or the Profits of this World, which ae so far inferiour to the
other in desireableness, and onely make advantage of their being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
when the other is so far off, 'twould be impossible for them to gain
our wills consent at any time; and therefore when those glories shall be
present to the Soul, 'twill be impossible for any other Object to steal, or
ravish, any way to engage one thought away from them: In Heaven
they cannot wish to sin. Nay the flash alone of that glory fascinates
the heart; <hi>Peter, and James, and John,</hi> saw but a <hi>glimpse</hi> of it, and that
<hi>transfigur'd</hi> too, (onely the other way that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were, for
the glory suffered an <hi>exinanition</hi>) and they but wak'd into the sight of
it, so that 'twas but an <hi>apparition of Heaven;</hi> and yet they never would
have left the place which it once lightned, <hi>Master it is good for us to be
here,</hi> let us go down no more, never converse with any thing beneath
<hi>Mount Tabor, but let us build three Booths,</hi> such <hi>Tents</hi> would be like that
which <hi>He</hi> hath <hi>spread,</hi> and such <hi>Booths</hi> be some of the <hi>many Mansions
of his House, who spreadeth out the Heavens for a Tent</hi> for himself to dwell
in. But the truth is while men do onely hear of Joys above, and have
but thin neglected notions of them, and on the other side a sense of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
profits, pleasures, honours which the World affords, they will not
be affected with the future dry hopes of those as with all these in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40114:238"/>
will nor have as effectual a tast of the <hi>Supper of the Lamb,</hi> as of
their own <hi>delicious daily fare,</hi> nor be as much wrought upon by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of being <hi>Cloath'd upon</hi> with the white Robe of <hi>Immortality,</hi> and by
the mentions of a <hi>Crown,</hi> although of <hi>Glory,</hi> as they are pleas'd with
their own <hi>Royal Purples,</hi> they have much surer Conviction of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of present things, than of those far removed futurities; but now
if <hi>Lazarus</hi> would go from <hi>Abraham's Bosom,</hi> he might Convince them
from his own Experience, and then <hi>they would Repent.</hi> Especially</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because <hi>Lazarus hath seen me in my Torments,</hi> and can give
account of them, wherefore <hi>I pray thee Father Abraham send him,</hi> for if
<hi>such an one</hi> went unto them from the Dead, one that could testifie of
this place, he would tell them such sad stories of my condition here, how
in lieu of all my <hi>sumptuous fare</hi> I have nothing now but <hi>gnashing of teeth,
streams</hi> indeed <hi>of Brimstone,</hi> and a <hi>lake of fire,</hi> but <hi>everlasting feaver of
thirst</hi> for my delicious intemperate Palate; my short-liv'd sins turn'd to
eternal Agonies; sure this would prevail with them to cut off their sins
by Repentance, before Death cut off their sin and them together; and
so they might prevent the coming hither. And very probably it might
have taken; for upon such Conviction 'tis hard not to resolve to change,
for who is he that can resolve thus with himself, <hi>well I will now content
my self with everlasting Condemnation and this sin, for I see they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent,
now this I cannot leave therefore let the other come;</hi> they that
were once affected with the apprehensions of the greatness and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of that Damnation cannot resolve thus, and therefore we see fewer
men adventure to transgress <hi>Man's Law,</hi> whose Punishment is near and
most assur'd, than <hi>God's Commandments.</hi> And when their fears of the
Lords Judgments stare them in the face, they quickly tremble into the
terrours and the agonies of Penitence. For who dares sin, and who
does not repent upon his Death-bed? he sinks at the remembrance of his
former draughts, when he does apprehend his next is like to be in the
Infernal Lake, he hath the frost of the Grave on him when he but thinks
of his lascivious heats, and does think too that his hot lustful Bed will
turn him off straight into <hi>Tophet:</hi> And then if <hi>Lazarus</hi> could raise
these apprehensions in them, <hi>sure they would repent.</hi> 'Tis plain these
were the grounds our Rich Man built this his request upon, I do not
lay them as infallible, I make no question but that men are able to defie
their knowledg, and charge through their own belief to sin and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
but commonly men do not lay things deep enough to their
heart to be throughly convinc'd in earnest, and thus he believed; for had
<hi>Abraham</hi> granted his desire, and <hi>sent Lazarus</hi> to <hi>testifie</hi> the Glories he
had tasted in himself, and the Torments he had seen their Brother in,
all he could hope from this was but to make them more believe the one
and other; therefore he thought for want of this they would miscarry,
and this alone would do it; so that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> may conclude, that in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of one that dy'd without Repentance, having resisted all God's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
and knew upon what score he did it, and suffered the deserved
pains of so doing; the reason why men do not repent, is because they
are not sufficiently convinc'd of the next Life, and of its two Eternities
of Joy and Torment, they do not credit them, but notwithstanding all
that God hath done his truths want witnessing, for <hi>if one went unto them
from the Dead,</hi> one that could <hi>testifie, they would Repent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:40114:239"/>
I should now make reflections on this and our selves together, and
truly all this would bespatter fouly such as go on in a Vice, for it does
conclude concerning them that they do not believe Gods Truths, but in
the midst of their professions of Religion are Infidels; 'tis plain they
are so in the aknowledgments of one of their own Tribe, who in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
of his Torments does confess this of them from his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
But worse things will appear when we have seen that God hath
done all this to us with more advantage than this man in Hell did think
sufficient, or indeed desire; which was my next undertaking, and I shall
manage it in the same order.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>If one went unto them from the dead,</hi> says he, <hi>they will Repent.</hi>
And now to answer that, <hi>Christ is come from the dead;</hi> an Article this is
that made its way through all the Swords, and all the Racks, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
Engines that the powerful witty malice of a whole World could
find out and execute: And shall it find its death among the softs and
glories of its own victorious profession? when it was instant Ruine to
ackowledg the belief of it, then Myriads ran into the flames, at once to
own and to partake <hi>Christs Resurrection:</hi> but now they that profess it
are so well here in this Life, that in defiance of their own profession, they
will not think there is another Life.</p>
                  <p>It is not out of Principle they doubt (as it were easie to demonstrate)
but out of improbity; They have an aversion to severe Piety, and are
uneasie under any thing that does engage to it, and must therefore work
themselves out; and here they storm; Unkind men to themselves! not
onely in imprudence, who adventure all upon such hazards; but in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraging
themselves, who being men of reason, and that set it up to such
an height as to make it contend with God, and dispute out his Power of
raising them again, yet can think such a reasoning Soul was given them
for no other end but to procure for, and to animate the Organs of their
sensuality. But this is dash'd if <hi>Christ be risen,</hi> because <hi>His Resurrection
did make Faith that he would Judg the World in Righteousness, on purpose
to make them Repent;</hi> Acts xvii, 20, 21. So that this his first expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is most fully answered to us.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, if <hi>Lazarus</hi> would go, one out of <hi>Abraham's Bosom</hi> then
<hi>they would Repent.</hi> And hath there not a <hi>greater</hi> than <hi>Lazarus</hi> been
with us? one not out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s but <hi>Gods Bosom?</hi> even the Son of
his Bosom, one that himself prepar'd those Joys for them that would
believe him and obey him: one that from all Eternity <hi>enjoy'd</hi> them in
the Bosom of the Divinity. And who could better reveal them to us
than the Author and the God of them? who knew them more than
he that did create them and possess them? Yea when this Son of God
would be Incarnate and take Flesh, and was to carry it through all the
Miseries that Sin deserv'd and God's Wrath could inflict, he thought these
Joys encouragement enough to do it willingly, these Pleasures were
worth Agonies which none but a God could suffer, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 2. Now sure
he that prepar'd these Joys did understand them, and he that is the
<hi>Word of God</hi> knew best how to reveal them too. And now how poor
a wish was that of our Rich Man? Let <hi>Lazarus</hi> go tell them: why a
<hi>Person of the Trinity</hi> hath told us; indeed how could God do more than
come himself to reveal the truth of them, and himself die for them to
reveal the greatness of them? Good God! that no body could serve thy
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40114:239"/>
turn to tell us of the pleasures of thy Bosom but the Son of thy Bosom!
that thou shouldst think it worth an Incarnation to reveal them, and we
not think it worth a little Reformation to have them; that he should
part with Blood and give his Life for those Joys, and we not be content
to forsake a Custom, to give away the pleasures of a Lust, the neither
pleasures nor profits of an Oath, the sick delights of an Excess, nor the
vexations of a Passion in exchange for them! what will <hi>Hell</hi> say to us
when one there said, if <hi>Lazarus will go they will repent?</hi> If</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Thirdly, one that saw me in <hi>Hell,</hi> and so can <hi>testifie</hi> the
Torments of this place, yet God hath out done this too. Our <hi>Creed</hi>
will tell us who <hi>descended into Hell,</hi> and the <hi>Psalmish</hi> saying concerning
him, <hi>God should not leave his Soul in Hell.</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi> asks, <hi>Quis ergo nisi
infidelis negaverit fuisse Christum apud inferos?</hi> 'Twere easie for me to
produce enough besides that say so. <hi>Clem. Alex, Origen, Hier. Greg.

Oecumenius, &amp;c.</hi> But because we are not agreed what he did there, I'll
take a surer <hi>medium.</hi> That no <hi>Lazarus</hi> can decipher the condition of a
Sinner after the pleasures of his iniquity have left him to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
of it, so well as <hi>Christ</hi> who not onely did <hi>prepare</hi> the Plagues, and
therefore can describe them, but also himself <hi>bore</hi> the pains, and found
a few hours bearing them to be too heavy for him, is most evident.
His <hi>Agonies</hi> will give you a relation beyond the skill of <hi>Lazarus</hi> that
saw the Torments, or of <hi>all</hi> that <hi>suffer</hi> them. Look but into the <hi>Garden,</hi>
and see if you do not behold there a more dismal Landshape than that
which <hi>Lazarus</hi> had beyond the Gulf, and was desir'd to give account of?
there you shall find Christ at the first approaches saying, <hi>my Soul is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
sorrowful unto death,</hi> Matth. xxvi. 38. As if the onely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of his sufferings had inflicted them, and he could not live under
the thoughts of them: and then <hi>he went a little farther and fell upon his
face and prays, saying, O my Father if it be possible let this Cup pass from
me.</hi> And what was there in this Cup which so empoyson'd it as to make
it dreadful to the Son of God? Oh 'tis the Sinners potion that he must
swill to everlastingness, and when he was in this condition <hi>there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Angel from Heaven strengthning him,</hi> Luke xxii. 43. yet <hi>v.</hi> the 44.
we find him <hi>still in an Agony.</hi> Angels cannot comfort one that is sensible
of the guilt of sin upon him; and <hi>he prays more earnestly in</hi> that same
place, <hi>Abha Father all things are possible with thee, take away this Cup from
me.</hi> He does not leave an Attribute unattempted, he does adore the
<hi>Majesty,</hi> for he falls upon his Face and Prays: A Person of the Trinity
prostrated in the dust to deprecate those pains; he wooes him to it,
<hi>Abba Father,</hi> canst thou deny thy well beloved, onely begotten Son, thy
Son that is thy self, when he comes to thee with such tender compella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of kindness? with words of so much bowels? <hi>Abba Father:</hi> he
takes hold too of his <hi>Omnipotence, all things are possible with thee;</hi> and
he does it with all the earnestness possible to such a Person: for saith St.
<hi>Luke</hi> there, <hi>he does it more earnestly, and his sweat was as it were great
drops of Blood falling to the ground,</hi> and what Agony is there in the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when there is Agony in the deprecation of them? such a Passion
could not be prayed against with earnestness enough, but that that very
earnestness will prove a Passion: Yea and he <hi>goes again the third time
and prays the same words,</hi> as if, if nothing else, importunity should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40114:240"/>
and when we shall consider that the Person doing this is the Son of
God, to whom nothing could be truly insupportable, yet that he should
not be able to bear sin; the weight of that we see makes him cry out
<hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> as if God could forsake that
Person in whom the Godhead was of his Person: Or indeed as if the
condition did even separate between him and himself.</p>
                  <p>And now could any <hi>from the dead</hi> have given such a frighting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?
is there not as much warning in this prospect, as if our selves
had tasted all of it? for is it not more that these Torments should be so
terrible to him than that they should be insupportable to us? Blessed
Saviour! if the first apprehensions did assault thee with such killing fury,
can we resolve to stand the storm? if we do not resolve that, then if all
this will not scare us, but notwithstanding all these fears we will have our
delightful, yea and our tormenting sins, what other method will be able
to recl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>im us? <hi>they that hear not Moses and the Prophets,</hi> nor yet <hi>Christ,
neither will they be perswaded sure though any other come unto them from
the dead.</hi> And so I fall on my last part in these words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If they hear not Moses and the Prophets neither will they be perswaded
though one rose from the dead.</hi> Here the expression should be first taken
notice of: For that is chang'd, it should go regularly thus, as in the
proposal, <hi>Nay Father Abraham, but if one went unto them from the dead
they will repent,</hi> so in his answer, <hi>if they repent not for Moses and the
Prophets, neither will they repent though one rose from the dead.</hi> But here
'tis otherwise; as if to <hi>repent</hi> and be <hi>perswaded,</hi> yea and to <hi>hear Moses
and the Prophets</hi> were the same things. And if it were our Age had got
a fair pretence for bringing all Religion to the <hi>Ear;</hi> but sure Repentance
costs the <hi>eyes</hi> and heart more than it does that part, and yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
useth oft the like expression: So in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 16. it is said of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi>
that <hi>by continuing in his Doctrine he should save them that hear
him.</hi> So also 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 2. <hi>by which ye are sav'd if ye keep in memory
the things which I have Preach'd unto you.</hi> 'Tis pity when the <hi>Ear</hi> and
<hi>Memory</hi> are so priviledg'd, that the <hi>Tongue</hi> hath not the like advantage;
but <hi>not every one that saith Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven;</hi> yet to <hi>know</hi> hath as great, for <hi>this is Life eternal to know thee
the onely true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent,</hi> John xvii. 3.
Which Life Eternal, and the being sav'd, or justified, we may not think
are so attributed to these, as if to <hi>hear,</hi> or to <hi>remember,</hi> or to be <hi>perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
that is to <hi>believe</hi> or <hi>know,</hi> any or all of these alone, shall be rewarded
so; or that these necessarily do produce all the rest that is necessary to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
those ends: But onely that it is so reasonable that they should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them, that the Scripture does presume they will; and therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
<hi>He that says he knows God and keeps not his Commandments is a Lyar.
1 John</hi> ii. 4. <hi>and he that sinneth hath not seen him neither known him, 1 Joh.</hi>
iii. 6. Nor <hi>heard</hi> of him it seems by the Text here: For it is so irrational
that they who have had notice of the advantages of serving God, and
the sad issues of Iniquity, should not reform; that the Scripture does not
suppose them guilty of it, but does chuse to word it thus, <hi>they hear not:</hi>
A sharp rebuke for them all whose Religion is much hearing without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the men whose <hi>Soul</hi> dwells in their <hi>Ear,</hi> and that dwells by the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,</hi>
that these should be adjudged as men that <hi>never heard;</hi> and so they
shall in every respect indeed, but in the innocence of not having heard,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40114:240"/>
that they do hear so much shall aggravate their Sentence: and yet their
Crime is that <hi>they hear not Moses and the Prophets,</hi> and then <hi>neither will
they be perswaded though one rose from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where I note Secondly, that our Saviour does not intend here to
commit <hi>Prophecy</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> and set them one against the other, to
shew which were most efficacious in begetting Faith: for Predictions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods exerting of his <hi>Omniscience,</hi> as <hi>raising from dead</hi> is the exerting
of his <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> the one a miracle of <hi>Knowledg,</hi> as the other is of <hi>Power,
Prophecy</hi> therefore is not to be oppos'd to <hi>Miracle,</hi> because it works meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as one; indeed it is a miracle in <hi>Expectation,</hi> or at <hi>distance,</hi> and the
other <hi>present:</hi> Nor are they to be made to vie, since both conspire, and
both are best in different cases: Besides our Saviour is not talking here
of <hi>begetting Faith,</hi> but <hi>making men repent,</hi> and the whole meaning of the
words is briefly this. Thy Brethren being <hi>Jews</hi> have <hi>Moses and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
those contain all the <hi>motives of Repentance,</hi> Gods <hi>Commands,</hi> his
<hi>Promises,</hi> and <hi>Threats;</hi> even <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> as themselves confess, all
these have been confirm'd already by great Miracles, and as such have
been long since received by the whole <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, with so immovable
an Opinion of the truth of them, that there needs no new Miracle to give
accession of credit to them. And then what can one coming from the
dead perswade? new motives he can bring them none; Man's nature is
not capable of any other kinds, for he can act but from his <hi>affections,</hi> or
his <hi>Reason;</hi> all which are baited to the height by those <hi>motives</hi> they have;
the Understanding and the Appetite whether it <hi>love,</hi> or <hi>hate,</hi> or <hi>hope,</hi> or
<hi>fear,</hi> (which set on work whatever we perform) all these I say <hi>Heaven</hi>
and <hi>Hell</hi> are Object for even to the utmost possibility of motion; If he
can bring no new ones, those they have when they are once truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
then they have all the vigour they can have; <hi>belief being the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of those active motives to their work,</hi> but all the <hi>strength</hi> to act
being in those <hi>motives themselves; all</hi> I mean in opposition to the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</hi>
I know that there are other strengths of <hi>Grace,</hi> but those do help
as well the Miracle as Motive; those have influence on the believing too,
by their <hi>exciting</hi> and <hi>assisting:</hi> (But this strength which may be common
to both is not to be considered when one vies with the other:) What
therefore shall he go for who can give no new motives nor strength to
those they have? If any should not be confirm'd enough in that which
<hi>Moses and the Prophets say,</hi> how shall they be convinc'd that this Ghost
is of more credit than they were? but if he should be so far heeded, as
to add new Confirmation to them, yet if improbity hath been able to
dead the force of the activity of all that <hi>Moses</hi> says, although acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
with that veneration which the <hi>Jews</hi> receive <hi>Moses</hi> with, <hi>whose
credit</hi> they themselves do say <hi>no Miracle can be wrought so great as to be
able to add to, or diminish from:</hi> why then that same improbity within a
while will with more ease work off the force of this new Confirmation,
so that it will be vain. Indeed 'tis possible that the surprize of such a
Miracle just as any other sudden and amazing accident may make a man
consider, what though he did afore believe, yet he did not <hi>mind</hi> nor <hi>lay
to heart;</hi> yet when the astonishment of that is over, the motives then are
left to their own strength, and can work onely by their own activity,
which we see hath been able to do nothing; so that a Miracle at most
can be but a <hi>more awful remembrancer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:40114:241"/>
Now sure to bring this to our selves, we want none such, nor do they
prove much useful: Occasions of astonishment and such <hi>fatal remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi>
have come and taken up their habitation in our Land, and make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
towards, hover over every place. <hi>Long Bills of mortality,</hi> and
<hi>sad knells,</hi> and <hi>dreadful passing bells,</hi> these are all <hi>messengers from the dead,</hi>
that come posting to us swift as <hi>Gods Arrows:</hi> And one would think we
should take notice of their message, hear them when they pass so near us,
when they seem to call out to our selves, <hi>when a thousand do fall besides
us, and ten thousand at our right hand;</hi> wherefore should not <hi>an Army of
such Carcasses</hi> become as moving as one <hi>Ghost?</hi> should <hi>Lazarus</hi> come forth
with all <hi>his sores,</hi> they would not be so terrible as these <hi>carbuncles</hi> and
<hi>ulcers of the Plague:</hi> And the <hi>destroying Angel</hi> out of <hi>Heaven</hi> with his
Sword drawn, one would expect, should be as efficacious as a <hi>Preacher
out of Abrahams Bosom.</hi> And yet men do not seem to hearken any more
to these than they do to us, when we either Preach, or which they think
much less, when we read Scripture to them, that is, when <hi>they hear Moses
and the Prophets.</hi> Men have the same security as to their sins which they
had in the freest times, whatever fears possess them, they are not the
fears of God, <hi>those that make men depart from evil,</hi> none of those that
fright into Repentance; we have no Religious cares upon us now more
than at other times, but Vice as if that also had a Sanctuary under <hi>the
Lords wings,</hi> and might retire <hi>under his feathers to be safe,</hi> dreads no <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of the Night,</hi> nor <hi>Arrows of the Day,</hi> but walks as open and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd
as ever. And now should we behold a mad man on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
spending his onely one remaining minute in execrations; the pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a shrowd upon his face, but Bloud and crimson Sins upon his
tongue; the frost of the Grave over all his parts, but a lascivious heat in
his discourse; in fine, one that had nothing left alive of him but his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
would not an horrour seize you at that sight? and the same frost
possess you but to hear him? and yet his madness is his excuse, and his
disease his Innocence. Should we see one that had no other madness, no
other sickness but his sin do thus, would it not be more horrid? and is
it not the same to see a Nation as it were upon its Death-bed, visited with
all the treasures of Gods Plagues, his tokens on it, and every place and
man in fearful expectations, and yet no allay of Vice? Wickedness as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
as ever? while it is thus, with what face can we beg of God to
<hi>keep from us this Plague and grievous sickness?</hi> when we do onely mean
to make this use of such indulgence, to cherish another Plague in our own
hearts? What can we say to prove it would not be a mercy to us to be
suddenly cut off, even in the midst of our iniquity? when by our going on
in sin in the midst of Destruction, we make appear if he should let us live,
yet we would only live to finish our iniquities: And longer time would
have no other use but to fill up a greater measure of sin. What answer
do we make to all these Messengers of Death that come so thick about
us? what do we that may justifie Gods care in sending us so many warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?
But 'tis no Wonder if the onely neighbourhood of Death have not
been able to prevail upon us; have you not seen one whom his own ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
or Gods immediate Hand, hath by a Sickness, or by some sad Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
cast to the very brink of Death, so as the Grave seemed to begin
to take possession of him? and all his hopes sickned and di'd? so that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
from that condition may be well, as 'tis in Scripture often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40114:241"/>
a Rising? have you not seen him in that state, when he supposed that
sinning was now done with him, and the next thing was Judgment, when
God's Tribunal seemed to be within his view, and Hell to gape for him
as wide as the Grave, both opening to receive their parts of him at the
same time, and himself ready to divide himself into those two sad Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?
With what effectual Sermon will he then Preach to himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his sins? and that you may be sure shall work upon him; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
resolves against his Vices, he will not carry them along with him
out of this Life, but cast them off as too sad dangerous Company, nor
yet if God shall lend him life will he retain them, but it shall be a New
Life which he will lead: And yet when God hath rais'd him up, after a
while he returns to his Vomit, his Sins recover with his Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he owes
his Innocence but to his Weakness, nor is it more long-liv'd; his holy
purposes decay as his strength grows, and die as soon as setled health
does come: And he who never would commit the Sin again when he
was Dying, mends into it again: And then what hopes is there in this
mistaken Method? when we see men come themselves from the Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
themselves, yet cannot make themselves Repent. But if we are not
all concerned in this, take a more spreading and more visible experiment.
If ever one came from the Dead, this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> came thence: And
by as great a Miracle of <hi>Resurrection.</hi> But where is the Repentance such
a Miracle may have flattered our Expectations with, as I am confident
the resolutions of it did in that sad dying state? are not some men as
violent in those <hi>wicked practices</hi> that <hi>merited</hi> our former Ruin? and others
in those cursed <hi>Principles</hi> that did <hi>inflict</hi> it, as they ever were? 'tis said
by many that <hi>have evil will at Sion</hi> (and it is our concern to take a care
they speak not truth) that in the Church some that are risen up again
have still the <hi>silence of the Grave upon them,</hi> and are as dumb, as if their
mouth were yet full of their monument Earth: And yet as if it were
not full of Earth, nor had been satisfied with it in the Sepulchre, they
gape still like the Grave that never can be satisfied. And we see others
who as if this Resurrection were but a start out of a sleep, or lucid inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of former madness, have their hands ready not onely to tear off the
hair, the unessential accessary beauties of the Body of the Church and
State, but to scratch the Face, pull out the Eyes, and tear open those
Wounds which their last fit of Fury did inflict, so to let life out again.
And as for the Community of the Nation, 'tis true we are as it were risen
from the Grave, but have we not brought up with us the Plague sores?
are not the Spots upon us still? the Venom, Ulcer, and infection about
us? Yea more contracted Stench and Putrefaction? such as Death and
the Grave do add? and coming from the dead we will not yet part with
these, but dress our selves in those infected and defiled grave-cloaths,
and <hi>rise into corruption,</hi> and so confute Gods Method of a Resurrection.
'Twere happier if we would so far confute the Text, that coming our
selves from the dead, we would renounce communion with all Deaths
adherencies; begin the <hi>incorruptible,</hi> which shall be consummated when
we shall rise again a Church triumphant: when <hi>Death shall be swallowed
up in Victory,</hi> and neither <hi>Sin</hi> nor <hi>Repentance</hi> shall be any more, but Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and Life, and Glory too shall be Immortal and unchangeable.</p>

First of the first Effect, <hi>This Child is for the Fall of many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here I shall but onely name that way whereby many men set

                     </gap>ing: We know many celebrate this
great Festival with Surfeits and Excesses, the usual appendages of Feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Oath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and Curses the ingredients of Gaming; Dalliance and Lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viousness
the attendants of Sporting; of all which this seems as it were
the <hi>Anniversary,</hi> a set time for their return. Thus indeed the <hi>Israelites</hi>
did solemnize the Birth of their <hi>Idol-Calf, They sate down to Eat and
Drink, and rose up to Play.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. xxxii. 6.</note> And must we celebrate <hi>this Child</hi> too like
that <hi>Calf,</hi> because he was born among <hi>Brutes?</hi> And must his Votaries
also be of the <hi>Herd?</hi> And he live and be worship'd always in a <hi>Stable?</hi>
Because <hi>God</hi> became <hi>Man,</hi> must <hi>Men</hi> therefore become <hi>Beasts?</hi> Is it fit to
honour that Child with Iniquity and Loosness, that did come into the
World upon designs of Holiness, to settle a most strict Religion? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more incongruous than this; and certainly there is nothing
of Gods Counsel in it. But to you whose time seems nothing else but a
constant Festival, always hath the Leisure, and the Plenties, and the
Sports of one, who as to these things keep a <hi>Christmas</hi> all your life, this
Season as it does not seem to challenge those things to it self peculiarly,
so I shall not now insist on them; but proceed to those ways by which
<hi>Simeon</hi> did Prophecy, <hi>This Child would be for the fall of many in Israel.</hi>
And they are three,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>This Child</hi> whom I but now declar'd <hi>God had prepar'd to be the
Glory of his People Israel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 31, 32.</note> yet his Birth was so inglorious, and his Life
answerable to it shall be so mean and poor, and his Death so full of shame
and curse, that these shall prove a <hi>scandal</hi> to his People, who shall be <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended</hi>
at them; and being prepossess'd with prejudices of a Pompous
Royal <hi>Messiah,</hi> they will not believe in this, but reject a Saviour that
comes upon those disadvantages, which will therefore prove occasions of
falling to them.</p>
                  <p>That is was so is expresly said,<note place="margin">Rom. ix. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold, I lay in Sion a Chief Corner-stone,
a stone of stumbling,<note place="margin">1 Pet. ii. 6.</note> and a Rock of offence.</hi> And that it was so upon
this account is clear,<note place="margin">John ix. 29.</note> the Great ones cry out of him, <hi>This fellow we know
not whence he is:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark vi. iii.</note> They that seem'd to know whence did upbraid him
with it,<note place="margin">John vii. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>Is not this the Carpenter?</hi> And therefore with a deal of scorn
they question, <hi>Do any of the Rulers or the Pharisees believe in him?</hi> Yea
Christ himself knew this would be so great a Scandal, that in the 11. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> in the close of many Miracles which he wrought on
purpose to demonstrate he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> he adds <hi>vers. 6. and blessed is
he that shall not be offended in me.</hi> As if he thought his mean condition
would prove a greater argument against him than his mighty Works
were for him: And it were a vaster Prodigy to see the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the
World, the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> poor and abject; than to see one <hi>cure the
Blind,</hi> and <hi>heal the Lame,</hi> and <hi>raise the Dead;</hi> and they might think they
had a stranger Miracle to confirm their unbelief, than any he would work
to make them believe in him.</p>
                  <p>And really, that the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which the <hi>Prophets</hi> did
express in terms as high as their own Extasies and Raptures, in transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
words, as if it vied with Gods Dominion, both for extent and for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
should prove at last an Empire onely over <hi>twelve poor Fishermen
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40114:243"/>
and Publicans,</hi> and one of them a <hi>Traytor</hi> too: And that <hi>He</hi> that was
born this <hi>King,</hi> should be born in a <hi>Stable;</hi> while he liv'd that he should
not have an <hi>hole to put his Head in,</hi> nor his <hi>Corps</hi> in when he <hi>died,</hi>
but his <hi>Grave</hi> too must be <hi>Charity;</hi> this would startle any that did wait
for the <hi>Redemption of Israel</hi> in those glorious expresses which the Prophets
trac'd it out in. To you indeed that are Votaries to <hi>this Child,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
Christians, these seeming disadvantages can give no prejudice:
However mean and abject his condition were, that cannot make you to
despise him, who from that must needs reflect how dear you were to
God, when for your sakes meerly he became so mean an abject.<note place="margin">2 Cor. viii. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
poor,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, that you through his poverty might be made rich:</hi>
He was made the <hi>Child of Man,</hi> that you might be made <hi>Sons of God;</hi> it
was to pay the price of your Redemption that he so <hi>emptied himself;</hi>

                        </gap>. Phil. ii. 7.</note> thus
he valued you; and men do not despise meerly <hi>because,</hi> and <hi>by those mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>
that, they are esteem'd, these are not the returns of love; its passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
obliging, ravishing effects do not use to be thus requited; this his
great descent cannot occasion your fal, who know he descended onely to
assume you up to glory. But 'tis worth inquiry, why, since it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that for this <hi>this Child</hi> should be <hi>the fall of Israel,</hi> that for this they
would reject him; and the meanness of his condition would prove an
unremovable obstruction to their belief, as it is to this day; Why yet
he would chuse to be born in a condition so in the utmost extream to his
own nature, so all contradiction to his Divinity, and so seemingly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the very end of his coming.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jew</hi> indeed will find no excuse for his Infidelity from this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For whatever that were, yet those <hi>Miracles</hi> that made the <hi>Devils</hi>
to <hi>confess</hi> him, brought conviction enough to make <hi>Jews inexcusable.</hi> And
it was obvious to observe, that He who <hi>fed five thousand with five Loaves
and two Fishes,</hi> till they left more than was set before them,<note place="margin">Matth. xiv. 19, 20, 21.</note> needed not
to be in a condition of want or meanness, if it were not otherwise more
needful he should not abound. God, that when <hi>he brought this first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Son into the World,</hi> said,<note place="margin">Heb. i. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Let all the Angels of God worship him,</hi>
might have put him into an estate which all Mankind most readily would
have done homage to: As easily have dress'd his <hi>Person</hi> with a <hi>blaze</hi> of
<hi>Pomp</hi> and <hi>Splendor,</hi> as his <hi>Birthday</hi> with a <hi>Star;</hi> if there had not been
necessity it should be otherwise. And such there was. For <hi>when the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
both of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Iniquity was come,</hi> when Vice could grow no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but did even cry for Reformation, and when the Doctrine that must
come to give the Rules of this Reformation, was not onely to wage War
with <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> with those desires which <hi>Constitution</hi> gives, but
which <hi>perpetual universal Custom</hi> had confirmed; and which their Gods
also, as well as Inclinations did contribute to; which their <hi>Original sin,</hi>
and their <hi>Religion</hi> equally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>omented; for <hi>Vice</hi> was then the <hi>Worship</hi> of
the World, <hi>Sins</hi> had their <hi>Temples, Theft</hi> its <hi>Deity,</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness</hi> its
<hi>God, Adultery</hi> had <hi>many,</hi> and to <hi>prostitute their bodies</hi> was most <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>acred,</hi>
and their very <hi>Altar-fires</hi> did kindle these soul heats, whence Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness'
is so often call'd <hi>Idolatry</hi> in Scripture: And besides all this, when
all the <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and all the power of the World were ingag'd in the
belief and practice of this, and resolv'd with all their wit and force to
keep it so. When it was thus, the Doctrine that must come to oppose,
controul, reform all this, must come either arm'd with <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Sword,</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:40114:244"/>
design to settle it self by <hi>Conquest,</hi> or come in a way of <hi>Meekness</hi> and of
<hi>suffering:</hi> The first of these <hi>Religion</hi> cannot possibly design, because it
cannot aim to settle that by <hi>violence,</hi> which cannot be <hi>forc'd;</hi> and where
'tis <hi>force,</hi> is not <hi>Religion.</hi> One may as well invade, and hope to get a
Conquest over <hi>thoughts,</hi> and put a <hi>Mind</hi> in <hi>Chains,</hi> and <hi>force</hi> a man to <hi>will
against his will.</hi> All such motives are incompetent to demonstrate Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
for however successful their force proves, yet it cannot prove the
Doctrines true; for by that Argument is proves that Religion that it <hi>settles</hi>
true, it proves that which it destroys was true before, while it prevail'd
and had the Power. Had <hi>this Child</hi> come so, he had onely given such a
testimony to the truth of <hi>Christianity,</hi> as <hi>Heathenism</hi> had before, and <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism</hi>
hath since: He might indeed, have drown'd the wicked World again
in another Deluge of their own Bloud: But sure, never had reform'd it
thus. Therefore that Religion, that must oppose the Customs and the
Powers of the World, upon Principles of Reason and Religion, must do it
by <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> by <hi>doing good,</hi> (and which was necessary, then
by consequence as the World stood,) by <hi>suffering evil:</hi> parting with all,
not onely the Advantages but the Necessaries of this life, and life it self
too, where they stood in competition, and were inconsistent with mens
duties, and their expectations:<note place="margin">Heb. vii. 19.</note> And by this means they must shew the
World that their Religion did <hi>bring in a better hope</hi> than that, which all
the profits, pleasures, glories of this World can entertain and slatter.</p>
                  <p>Thus they did, and thus they did prevail. For the first Ages of the
Church, were but so many Centuries of Men, that entertained Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
with the Contempt of the World, and Life it self. They knew that
to put themselves into <hi>Christ</hi>'s Service and Religion, was the same thing
as to set themselves aside for spoil and Rapine, dedicate themselves to
Poverty and Scorn, to Racks, and Tortutes, and to Butchery it self. Yet
they enter'd into it; did not onely renounce the Pomps and Vanities of
the World in their Baptism, when they were new born to God; quench
their affections to them in those waters; but renounc'd them even to the
death; drown'd their affections to them in their own heart bloud: ran
from the World into flames, and fled faster from the satisfactions and
delights of Earth, than those flames mounted to their own Element and
Sphere: In fine, they became <hi>Christians</hi> so, as if they had been <hi>Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
of death,</hi> and onely made themselves <hi>Apprentises of Martyrdom.</hi>
Now if it were not possible it should be otherwise than thus, as the World
stood, then it was necessary that the <hi>Captain of Salvation</hi> should lead on,
go before this <hi>noble Army of Martyrs;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. xi. 10.</note> if it were necessary that they must
<hi>leave all who followed him;</hi> then it was not possible that he should be here
in a state of Plenty, Splendor, and Magnificence; but of Poverty, and
Meanness; giving an Example to his followers, whose condition could not
but be such. To give which Example was, it seems, of more necessity,
than by being born in Royal Purple, to prevent the <hi>fall of many in Israel,</hi>
who for his condition despis'd him.</p>
                  <p>I am not so vain as to hope to persuade any from this great Example
here to be in love with Poverty, and with a low condition, by telling
them this Birth hath consecrated meanness, that we must not scorn those
things in which our <hi>God</hi> did chuse to be install'd; that <hi>Humility</hi> is,
it seems, the proper dress for <hi>Divinity</hi> to shew it self in. But when we
consider, if this Child had been born in a condition of Wealth and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40114:244"/>
the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> would have received him; whereas
that he chose prov'd an occasion of <hi>falling</hi> to them: Yet that God should
think it much more necessary to give us an Example of Humility and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
below expression; then it was necessary that that whole Nation
should believe on him. When of all the Virgins of that People, which
God had to chuse one out to <hi>overshadow,</hi> and impregnate with the <hi>Son of
God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk i. 48.</note> he chose one of the <hi>meanest,</hi> (for <hi>he hath regarded the low estate of

                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>This Child is for the fall of many</hi> by the <hi>holiness</hi> of his <hi>Religion:</hi>
while the strictness of the Doctrine which he brings, by reason of mens
great propensions to wickedness, and their inability to resolve against
their Vices, will make them set themselves against it, both by word and
Deed: For they will contradict and speak ill of, yea, they will openly
renounce, and fall away from it and him.</p>
                  <p>1. For that reason they will <hi>contradict, speak ill</hi> of him and of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines:
This is said expresly in the last words of my Text, <hi>He is for a

a Standard</hi> for all Nations, were not for them to <hi>betake themselves to,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Matth. x. 25.</note> because <hi>he cast out Devils.</hi> And all this was foretold?
For although he were <hi>fairer than the Children of men,</hi>

<hi>Devotion</hi> in a Countenance does writh and discompose it, prints Deformity
upon it; and Eyes lifted up with ardency, look as bad as eyes distorted,
set awry. Nay <hi>Majesty</hi> when it was most severe and pious, never yet
could guard Religion from these <hi>scorns. David,</hi> that great and holy
King,<note place="margin">Psalm lxix. 10, 11, 12.</note> says of himself, <hi>I wept and chastned my self with fasting, and that
was turn'd to my reproof;</hi> as if Repentance were among his Crimes, and
he must be Corrected for his Discipline. <hi>I put on Sackcloth also, and they
jested upon me, they that sate in the gate spake against me, and the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
made songs upon me.</hi> Sure these jolly men are not companions to
those Angels,<note place="margin">Luke xv. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>in whose presence there is joy over one sinner that repenteth;</hi>
that his Vertue should be a <hi>rejoycing,</hi> and a <hi>song</hi> to them too: Certainly
the penitent mans tears do not fill their Chearful bowls, nor his groans
make those Airs which they set their drunken Catches to. But that we
may be sure it never will be otherwise,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 3.</note> S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>That in the last
days there shall come scoffers, walking after their own lusts.</hi> Now the men
of our days have the luck to obey Scripture thus far as to make that
Prophecy to come to pass; for those <hi>scoffers</hi> are come in <hi>power and great
glory.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psalm i. 1.</note> The Psalmist tells us of a <hi>Chair of Scorners,</hi> as if these were the
onely men that speak <hi>ex cathedra:</hi> And sure <hi>scoffs</hi> and <hi>taunts</hi> at <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
are the onely things that may be talk'd with <hi>confidence, aloud:</hi> They
imprint an Authority on what is said, and conversations that are most
insipid on all other scores, get account as they come up towards this
practice: Hence they <hi>gain degrees; commence ingenious</hi> as they border
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40114:245"/>
on these Atheistical and irreligious Blasphemies; and when it is pure
<hi>scorn,</hi> then it is in the Chair.</p>
                  <p>But it stays not there; For Secondly, Upon the same account of strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Religion, men will fall off from, and openly renounce both Christ
and his Religion. This is that our Saviour himself found, <hi>Light,</hi> saith
he,<note place="margin">John iii. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>is come into the World, and men loved Darkness rather than the Light,
because their deeds were evil.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. xxi. 32.</note> And he said of the <hi>Pharisees, They repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not that they might believe,</hi> as knowing it impossible that they could
venture to believe that Doctrine which condemn'd those courses that
they would not repent of.</p>
                  <p>And if I should affirm, that it is nothing else but mens unwillingness
to be obliged to those things, which if there be a <hi>God,</hi> and a <hi>Religion</hi>
which this <hi>Child</hi> was set to institute, they must account themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to; nothing else I say but this, which makes them so <hi>unwilling to
believe a God or Christ;</hi> yea, openly renounce them both, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
I should have for proof of this, not onely the late instance of a
Nation in the <hi>Indies;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Congo.</note> which, by institution of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> was easily
persuaded to embrace the Christian Creed, and was Baptized into our
Faith; but when they were required to lead their lives according to
Christs Precepts, and renounce their <hi>Heathen Licences,</hi> they chose rather
to renounce their <hi>Creed</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> and returned instantly to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
<hi>Heathenism.</hi> But to this experience, give me leave to add this
Reason, that it is not the Difficulty of the <hi>Mysteries of Faith,</hi> and their
being above our Comprehension, which makes them not to be receiv'd;
because there are as great difficulties in things that we are certain of. For
in the very <hi>Sphere</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> within the lines and measures of their own <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi> in things of which she does assure her self by <hi>Diagrams</hi> and
<hi>sense,</hi> yet she is as much amaz'd, as at those Objects in the highest and
remotest Regions of <hi>Faith;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Myster. (ut vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cari solet) Asymp. toticum &amp; Angul. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent. &amp;c.</note> and <hi>Mathematicks</hi> hath her <hi>Paradoxes</hi> that
stand in as great danger of a contradiction as any of <hi>Religions</hi> Mysteries;
while Reason cannot cape what she demonstrates, but is to seek how
those things can be possible which she proves most <hi>certain;</hi> and they are
<hi>incomprehensible</hi> to her, even when they are most evident: And then sure
if we can think there is a <hi>God,</hi> we must needs think <hi>He can</hi> do things
which we cannot comprehend, when it is plain our Reason cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
what she her self does find out and create. It is not therefore
contradiction to <hi>Reason,</hi> but to <hi>Appetite,</hi> that makes things of <hi>Religion</hi>
so <hi>incredible;</hi> which I thus demonstrate to the <hi>Atheist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those very difficulties, to avoid which he <hi>denies</hi> a <hi>God;</hi> to wit, <hi>Those
of an Eternal Being that is of himself;</hi> those very things he <hi>must</hi> and <hi>does
acknowledg</hi> in the being of the <hi>World,</hi> if that either be it <hi>self</hi> Eternal (as
the <hi>Atheist</hi> of the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Tribe will have it) or else if its <hi>atomes,</hi>
out of which it was concreted, were: (as those of <hi>Epicurus</hi> herd assert.)
In a word, if they say the <hi>World</hi> or its <hi>materials</hi> were made, they grant
a <hi>God</hi> that made it; If they say they were <hi>not made,</hi> they assert then an
<hi>Eternal Being of it self;</hi> that is, they allow those difficulties for which
they pretend to <hi>deny a God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There being therefore the same difficulties, (Greater I could prove
them, from the diverse natures of corporeal and spiritual beings; for we
are sure, in <hi>bodies</hi> that are still in <hi>motion,</hi> and so subject to <hi>succession,</hi> those
things are impossible; but if there be a <hi>Being</hi> that is <hi>not in motion,</hi> and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40114:246"/>
by consequence, not subject to the <hi>laws</hi> of <hi>our time,</hi> all these knots unty
themselves, those difficulties vanish and have no place: But to say no
more than I have shewed, <hi>there being the same Difficulties</hi> in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist's
Hypothesis</hi> as in the <hi>other,</hi> 'tis apparent, not the <hi>difficulties</hi> of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi>
but <hi>practice,</hi> make him fix upon his own against the <hi>common notions</hi>
of the World. So that 'tis not his <hi>understanding,</hi> but his <hi>Appetite</hi> frames
his <hi>hypothesis;</hi> and without figure, 'tis his <hi>Will</hi> that he believes with.
And it is most evident, that because men do not love the Precepts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
would not have them be their <hi>duty,</hi> therefore they would have the
<hi>Doctrines</hi> of it not be <hi>truths;</hi> and in this they are the Disciples onely of
their Lusts, and because they cannot resolve to be otherwise, therefore
they resolve not to be <hi>Christ's Disciples,</hi> but reject him for his holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
sake: And so <hi>this Child is for the fall of many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it were strange if upon this account, Christ should be for the fall
of any of us; who have learn'd a trick to reconcile his <hi>severe Doctines</hi>
and our <hi>Sins</hi> together. Where Vice most abounds, though it be wilful,
and men persevere in it, they are so far from finding any reason to <hi>fall
off from him,</hi> or from his <hi>Gospel</hi> for this, that they therefore take the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
hold of it,</hi> rely upon Him with the <hi>bolder, stronger confidence.</hi> As if
good old <hi>Simeon</hi> were mistaken, when he thought, because men would
not leave those sins which Christ so threatned, therefore they would
leave him: Because they could not bear those his hard sayings, to <hi>pull
our</hi> the <hi>lust</hi> and the <hi>Eye too; cast away the treasures of unrighteousness,</hi> and
the <hi>right hand</hi> that receives them also; therefore they would cast off
him: For, for this reason they betake themselves to him more eagerly,
devolve and cast themselves upon him with assurance. 'Tis possible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that the new Christian'd <hi>Indians</hi> might believe themselves oblig'd to
lead their lives according to the Vow that they had made in Baptism,
knew not how to live a contradiction, to be <hi>Christian Pagans;</hi> therefore
they thought it absolutely necessary to renounce the one; and to reject
<hi>Christ and his strict Religion was easier</hi> they thought. Our Saviour also
might suppose, that when he brought <hi>Light</hi> into the World, men would
not receive that <hi>Light,</hi> because their deeds were evil: But our modern
wickednesses that are of the true Eagle kind, are educated, bred up to
<hi>endure,</hi> and to <hi>defie</hi> the Light: Our deeds of Night have learn'd to face
both Sun and Men, yea and face the <hi>Sun of Righteousness,</hi> and the <hi>light</hi>
of those <hi>flames that are to receive them.</hi> Our Saviour told the <hi>Pharisees</hi>
indeed, <hi>that they repented not, that they might believe;</hi> for thinking it
impossible they could assent to what he did affirm, except they would
consent to what he did Command, He therefore thought they were not
abel to believe, because they would not purpose to amend. But there is
nothing difficult in this to us, who at the same time, are so perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
that every threat of Gospel is so <hi>Divine truth,</hi> as that we assure
our selves, that we could be content to <hi>die Martyrs</hi> to the truth of them,
rather than enounce one little of them; yet even then are <hi>Martyrs</hi> to
those <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> which those Threats belong to: Who, at once,
believe this Book of God,<note place="margin">Luke xiii. 3.</note> that says, <hi>except ye repent ye shall all perish;</hi>
and believe also, that notwithstanding we do not Repent, yet by <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi>
we shall <hi>scape;</hi> not perish, but be saved. And is not this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to believe our selves into <hi>Damnation?</hi> the <hi>third</hi> and the <hi>geat fall,</hi>
which <hi>this Child is set for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:40114:246"/>
3. <hi>This Child is for the fall of many,</hi> to wit, of all those who on these,
or any other grounds do <hi>not believe in,</hi> or do <hi>not obey him;</hi> who shall
<hi>not obey him:</hi> who shall therefore <hi>fall into Eternal Ruin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>this our Saviour does affirm, S. <hi>John</hi> iii. 19. <hi>This is the Condemnation
that Light came into the World,</hi> &amp;c. This does aggravate the guilt, and
Sentence. We were fal'n before indeed in <hi>Adam:</hi> And I dare not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to be so learned to say <hi>whether;</hi> to determine with some <hi>men</hi>
that was but a fall form <hi>Paradise</hi> into the <hi>Grave,</hi> and we were forfeit to
<hi>Death onely:</hi> But I may adventure to affirm, that in the <hi>second Adam,</hi>
Sinners finally impenitent shall fall much farther than we did in the <hi>first
Adam:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. ix. 1, 11.</note> Now their <hi>pit</hi> shall have <hi>no bottom,</hi> but <hi>this light that came to
lighten them,</hi> shall be to them <hi>consuming fire and everlasting burnings.</hi>
And all reason in the world. For, upon that fall of ours in <hi>Adam,</hi> help
was offer'd us: an easie way not onely to repair those ruines, but to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
infinitely that estate which we were fal'n from; and a way that cost
God dear to purchase; cost him, not this <hi>Incarnation</hi> onely, but the <hi>Death
and Passion of his Son,</hi> and divers other blessed methods of Salvation:
Now if we <hi>refuse</hi> the mercy of all this, and scorn these miracles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending
goodness, and defie those methods, that he makes use of to
raise us form our Fall, it is apparent we provoke and <hi>choose deeper ruine;</hi>
this refusal hath in it such desperate malignity, as to poison this great
mercy of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and all the rest. 'Tis but a small thing to say,
that they who <hi>Stumble at this Rock of their Salvation,</hi> spurning at it by
their wilful disobedience, that these make an infinite mass of loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to be lost upon them, so as that <hi>Salvation cannot save them;</hi> for alas
<hi>Salvation ruines</hi> them the <hi>deeper,</hi> and <hi>this Child is for their fall.</hi> The
condition they were forfeit to before by reason of their breach of the
first <hi>Covenant</hi> was advantage, comfortable in comparison of that which
Christ does put them in: <hi>This is the Condemnation,</hi> that he came into the
World; And it had been infinitely better for them, that <hi>this Child too
had never been born.</hi> The unreformed have the least reason in the world
to solemnize this Festival, they do but cecebrate the <hi>birth of thie own
Ruin:</hi> bow down, and do reverence to their <hi>Fall:</hi> Had it not been for
this, they had not gone to so severe an Hell. So that they do but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the great occasion of their greater Condemnation. Such it proves
to them, and that it might be so, <hi>He was fore-ordained for it:</hi>

                     <hi>This Child is set for the fall of many,</hi> which does lead me to <hi>Gods Counsel

                  <p>
                     <hi>This Child is set for the fall of many,</hi> even <hi>by Gods direct appointment;</hi>

but the design of this Childs coming, and Gods Counsel in it is intended here.</hi>
And without disputing of Gods <hi>antecedent</hi> Will, and <hi>consequent,</hi> this is
safely said: God design'd this Child should be such an one, that they
who had no inclinations for <hi>Virtue,</hi> would not entertain the <hi>love</hi> of it,
but counted it a <hi>mean pedantick</hi> thing, and all its Rules and Laws unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
servitude, these loose men would certainly <hi>reject Him</hi> and his
<hi>Doctrines,</hi> which were so severe and strict, That those who did pretend
<hi>friendship</hi> for Vertue, and a service for Religion, but withal must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to maintain correspondence with the World, seek the Honours
and advantages of Earth, and will trespass on Religion where it inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40114:247"/>
with these, break with Virtue when their interest cannot consist
with it, that these false <hi>hypocritical pretenders,</hi> should be <hi>offended</hi> with
the <hi>mean condition</hi> of <hi>this Child,</hi> and of his followers in this World, and
with the <hi>poor spirited Principles</hi> of his Religion. In sum, they that upon
these, or any other grounds <hi>finally disbelieve,</hi> or <hi>disobey</hi> him, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
<hi>this Child</hi> to be a means of bringing <hi>sorer Punishments,</hi> even to
everlasting ruin upon such.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>black Decree</hi> this, one would think. He that had so much <hi>kindness</hi>
for Mankind, to give away the <hi>onely Son</hi> both of his <hi>Nature,</hi> his <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
and his <hi>Bosom</hi> to them; could he then design that Gift to be the
Ruin of the <hi>greatest part of men? This Child, Simeon</hi> said but just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my Text, <hi>is Gods Salvation, which he had prepared before all people;</hi>
and does he now say God hath <hi>set him for their fall?</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi>
preached this was a Birth that <hi>brought glad tidings of great joy that
should be to all people;</hi> and is there so much <hi>comfort</hi> in <hi>destruction,</hi> that
most men should rejoyce at that which is ordained to be the <hi>great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of it to them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we have no reason to complain: 'Tis not unkind to <hi>deny Mercy</hi>
to them that <hi>refuse</hi> the <hi>offers</hi> of it; that will not <hi>accept Salvation,</hi> when
their <hi>God himself</hi> does come to bring it to them: tenders it upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>accepting</hi> and <hi>amending:</hi> Which if they despise, and prefer <hi>Hell</hi>
before <hi>Repentance,</hi> chuse <hi>sin</hi> rather than <hi>Gods blessed retributions,</hi> 'tis but
reason to deny them what they will <hi>not have,</hi> and let them take their
<hi>chosen Ruine;</hi> to <hi>will</hi> their Judgment which they <hi>will themselves; set</hi> and
ordain Him to be <hi>that</hi> to them, which themselves do <hi>ordain,</hi> and make
him to be to themselves. So S. <hi>Peter</hi> says expresly:<note place="margin">1 Pet. ii. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>He is a Stone of
stumbling and a Rock of offence to them who being disobedient stumble at the
Word, whereunto they were appointed, Disobedience,</hi> where it is obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
alters so the temper of our God, that it makes Him who <hi>swears he
would not have the Sinner die,</hi> yet <hi>set out</hi> his <hi>Son</hi> to make <hi>such sinners
fall into eternal Death.</hi> Makes <hi>Judgment</hi> triumph over <hi>Mercy,</hi> even in
the <hi>Great contrivances</hi> and <hi>executions</hi> of that <hi>Mercy;</hi> and while God was
plotting an <hi>Incarnation</hi> for the everlasting Safety of Mankind, prevails
with him to <hi>decree Ruins</hi> by the means of that <hi>Salvation;</hi> to Decree even
in the midst of all those strivings of his <hi>Mercies,</hi> that that <hi>Issue</hi> of his
kindness should be for the <hi>fall</hi> of such as they. Oh! let us consider,
whether they are likely to escape that which is set and ordain'd for them
by God? Whether they can hope for a <hi>Redemption,</hi> when the only great
<hi>Redeemer</hi> is appointed for the <hi>Instrument</hi> of their <hi>Destruction;</hi> and God
is so <hi>bent on their ruine,</hi> that to purchase it he gives <hi>this Child his Son.</hi>
Yea, when he did look down upon this <hi>Son</hi> in <hi>Agonies,</hi> and on the <hi>Cross,</hi>
in the midst of that sad prospect, yet the <hi>Ruine of such sinners,</hi> which he
there beheld in his Sons Bloud, was a delight to him, that also was a
<hi>Sacrifice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. ii. 15.</note> and a <hi>sacrifice</hi> of a <hi>sweet smell</hi> to him. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>We
are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them that perish,</hi> because <hi>we are
the savour of Death unto death to them:</hi> As if their <hi>Brimstone</hi> did ascend
like <hi>Incense,</hi> shed a <hi>perfume</hi> up to God, and their <hi>evrlasting burnings</hi>
were his <hi>Altar-fires, kindled</hi> his <hi>holocausts;</hi> and he may well be <hi>pleased</hi>
with it, for <hi>he ordain'd</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true indeed, <hi>This Child riding</hi> as in <hi>Triumph,</hi> in the midst of his
<hi>Hosannas,</hi> when he saw one City whose <hi>fall</hi> he was <hi>set</hi> for on this very
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40114:247"/>
account; He was so far from being pleas'd with it, that he <hi>wept over it</hi>
in pity. But alas, that onely more declares the most <hi>deplored</hi> and <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
condition of such sinners. <hi>Blessed Saviour!</hi> hadst thou no <hi>Blood</hi> to
shed for them? <hi>nothing</hi> but <hi>Tears?</hi> or didst thou weep to think they very
<hi>Bloodshed</hi> does but make their <hi>guilt</hi> more <hi>crimson,</hi> who refuse the mercy
of that <hi>Bloodshed</hi> all the time that is offered? Sad is their state that can
find no <hi>pity</hi> in the <hi>Tears of God,</hi> and remediless their Condition for
whom all that the <hi>Son of God</hi> could do, was to <hi>weep</hi> over them, all that
he did do for them, <hi>was to be for their fall;</hi> too sad a part indeed for
<hi>festival Solemnity,</hi> very improper for a <hi>Benedictus</hi> and <hi>Magnificat.</hi> To
celebrate the greatest act of kindness the <hi>Almighty</hi> could design onely by
the <hi>miseries</hi> it did occasion: to magnifie the vast descent of God from
<hi>Heaven</hi> down to <hi>Earth,</hi> onely by reason of the <hi>fall</hi> of Man into the
<hi>lowest Hell</hi> of which that was the cause. My Text hath better things
in view: The greatness of that <hi>fall</hi> does but add height to that <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
which He also is the cause of: <hi>Behold this Child is set for
the rising again of many:</hi> My remaining Part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rising again,</hi> does not particularly and onely refer to the foregoing
<hi>fall</hi> here in the Text, which <hi>this Child</hi> did occasion, as I shewed you;
but to the state wherein all Mankind, both in its <hi>nature</hi> and its <hi>Customs,</hi>
lay ingul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'d, the state of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>sin:</hi> A <hi>state</hi> from which recovery
is properly <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a <hi>resurrection</hi> and a <hi>reviving</hi> in this Life, and so
call'd in Scripture often; as <hi>Ephes.</hi> v. 15. <hi>Wherefore he saith, Awake
thou that sleepest <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and arise from the dead.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi>
vi. 13. <hi>Yield not your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,
but yield your selves unto God, as those that are alive form the dead.</hi> Now
to raise us from the death of sin into the life of Righteousness, by the
amendment of our own lives, to recover us into a state of Vertue, is the
thing <hi>this Child</hi> is said here to be <hi>set</hi> for. This was that which God
thought worth an <hi>Incarnation:</hi> Neither was there any greater thing in
the prospect of his <hi>everlasting Counsel,</hi> when he did decree his Son into
the World, than that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, He is <hi>set for this.</hi> The <hi>Word
was made Flesh;</hi> to <hi>teach, practise,</hi> and persuade to Vertue: To make
men <hi>Reform</hi> their lives, was valued at the price of a <hi>Person of the
Trinity. Piety</hi> and his <hi>Exinanition,</hi> yea his <hi>Blood and Life,</hi> were set at
the same rates; <hi>All</hi> of him given for our <hi>recovery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The time would fail me if I should attempt onely to name the various
methods he makes use of to effect this. How <hi>this Child</hi> that was the
<hi>brightness of his Fathers Glory,</hi> came to lighten us; shining in his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
and <hi>Example:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. i. 3.</note> How he sent more light, The <hi>fiery Tongues,</hi> Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to guide us in the ways of <hi>Piety:</hi> How he
suffered <hi>Agonies</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> for sin to appale and fright us from it. How
he <hi>Rose again</hi> to confirm <hi>Judgment</hi> to us, to demonstrate the <hi>rewards of
Immortality</hi> to them that will repent and leave their sins, and <hi>everlasting
Torments</hi> to those that refuse this Grace; Grace <hi>purchased</hi> with the <hi>Blood
of God,</hi> to enable them to repent and leave. Besides all these, the <hi>Arts</hi> and
<hi>Mesnage</hi> of his Providence, in preventing and following us by <hi>Mercies</hi> and
by <hi>Judgments, importuning</hi> us, and <hi>timeing</hi> all his blessed Methods of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to our most advantage. Arts, God knows, too many, if they
serve us onely to <hi>resist,</hi> and turn to <hi>wantonness</hi> and <hi>aggravation;</hi> if we
make no other use of Grace but this, to <hi>sin against,</hi> and overcome all Grace,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40114:248"/>
and make it <hi>bolster Vice;</hi> by teaching it to be an encouragement to go on
in it, from some hopes we entertain by reason of <hi>this Child,</hi> instead of
doing that which he was <hi>set, Decreed</hi> to make us <hi>do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And really I would be glad to see this <hi>everlasting Counsel</hi> of the Lord
had had some good effects, some, though never so little, happy execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this <hi>great Decree,</hi> and that that which God <hi>ordain'd from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,</hi>
upon such glorious and magnificent terms, were come to pass in
any kind, Now, certainly there are no evident signs of any great <hi>reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
this Child</hi> hath wrought among us, in the World that's now call'd
<hi>Christian.</hi> After those Omnipotent inforcives to a vertuous life, which
he did work out, if we take a prospect of both Worlds, it would be
hard to know which were the <hi>Heathen;</hi> and there would appear scarce
any other notice of a <hi>Christ</hi> among us, but that we <hi>blaspheme</hi> Him or
<hi>deride</hi> Him. Sure I am, there are no Footsteps of him in the lives of
the community of Men: And I am certain that you cannot shew me
any <hi>Heathen</hi> Age outgoing ours, either in <hi>loosness</hi> and <hi>foul Effeminacies,</hi>
or in <hi>sordidness</hi> and <hi>base injustice,</hi> or in <hi>frauds</hi> and <hi>falness,</hi> or <hi>malignity,
hypocrisie,</hi> or <hi>treachery,</hi> or to name no more, even in the <hi>lowest,</hi> most <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,
disingenious</hi> sorts of Vice. In fine, men are now as <hi>Earthly, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual,</hi>
yea and <hi>Devilish,</hi> as when <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Devils</hi> were their <hi>Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, I must needs say, that those times of <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
were in many men times of <hi>shining</hi> Vertue; and the little spark
of <hi>Light</hi> within them, brake out through all obstructions into a <hi>glory
of Goodness,</hi> to the wonder and confusion of most Christians: 'Tis true,
we are pretty well reveng'd on them for setting us Examples so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
to us; calling their Heroick Actions, <hi>splendida peccata,</hi> onely
<hi>beauteous sins,</hi> and <hi>well-fac'd wickednesses;</hi> and we have a reason for it;
because they never heard of Christ, whose <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi> 'tis most
certain, is the onely thing that can give <hi>value</hi> and <hi>acceptance</hi> to mens best
performances: While on the other side, we <hi>Christians</hi> comfort and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
our selves in our transgressions from <hi>this Child,</hi> and form his
Name. But if <hi>this Child</hi> were <hi>set</hi> to raise us up from <hi>sin,</hi> and to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
<hi>stronger arguments</hi> for a <hi>good life</hi> than the <hi>Heathen</hi> ever heard of,
more <hi>especial Divine engagements</hi> to Vertue; then if their Vertues were,
because they never heard of these engagements to them, sins; what cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
will be past upon their Actions that <hi>know</hi> all those engagements
and <hi>despise</hi> them? a sharper certainly unless to <hi>defie knowledg,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke</hi>
against all Divine Obligations, all that God could lay, shall prove
more tolerable than to labour to obey <hi>without them, without knowing
why.</hi> 'Tis true, they had not heard it may be of the Name, than
which there <hi>is no other Name under Heaven given unto men whereby
they may be saved.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts iv. 12.</note> Yet they endeavoured in some measure to do that,
which He that owns that Name, and wrought the Covenant of those
Salvations, does require. We know that Name, and have it call'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, and know too, that <hi>he that names that Name,</hi> (that calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Christian,<note place="margin">2. Tim. ii. 19.</note> owns the being a retainer to the <hi>Holy Jesus) must
depart from iniquity,</hi> otherwise it is no Name of Salvation to him,
yet we neve mind the doing that; and then which hath the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Plea? the <hi>Heathen</hi>'s sure were better, though he were <hi>not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:40114:248"/>
And if so, give me leave to tell you, how not onely <hi>this Child,</hi> but
this <hi>Resurrection</hi> too is for our <hi>fall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the first Chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> we shall find, those <hi>Heathens,</hi>
when they did neglect to follow the direction of that Light within
them,<note place="margin">Verse 20. Verse 28.</note> by which they were able to discover in some measure <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
things of God;</hi> when they did no longer <hi>care to retain God in
their knowledg;</hi> then they quickly left off to be Men: And when they
ceas'd to hearken to their Reason, they soon fell into a <hi>reprobate sense.</hi>
What was it else to change <hi>God</hi> into <hi>stocks</hi> and <hi>stones?</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi>
into most <hi>abominable wickedness?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> to make the Vilest creatures <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</hi>
and the foulest Actions <hi>Religion?</hi> to turn a <hi>disease</hi> into a <hi>God,</hi>
and a <hi>sin</hi> into <hi>Devotion?</hi> a stupidity, which nothing else but <hi>Gods</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
and reasons too, could have betrayed them to, and made them
guilty of.</p>
                  <p>And then, if by how much greater Light and means we have resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we shall be proportionably <hi>more vile</hi> in the consequents of doing so;
keep at equal rates of distance from those <hi>Heathens,</hi> that the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our guilt stand at from theirs; Whether, <hi>alas!</hi> are we like to
fall?</p>
                  <p>'Tis an amazing reflection, one would tremble to consider, how the
<hi>Christian</hi> World does seem to hasten into that condition which S. <hi>Paul</hi>
does there decipher: You would think that Chapter were our Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter:
But that we have reason to expect we shall fall <hi>lower,</hi> into much
more <hi>vile affections</hi> than those Heathens did, as having fal'n down from
a <hi>greater height</hi> than they.</p>
                  <p>Consider whether men do not declare <hi>they like not to retain God in
their thoughts,</hi> when they endeavour to <hi>dispute</hi> and to <hi>deride</hi> him too
out of the World! 'Tis true, they have not set up any <hi>sins</hi> or <hi>monsters</hi>
in their <hi>Temples</hi> yet, as they did: But if they can empty them of God
and Christ, and their Religion, and make room, we may imagine
easily whose Votaries they will be, that live as if they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unhappy that they had not liv'd in those <hi>good Pagan days,</hi> when
they might have <hi>sinned</hi> with <hi>devotion,</hi> been most wickedly Religious,
and most <hi>God-like</hi> in <hi>unchastities</hi> and other Villanies; I dare say none of
our <hi>fine Gentlemen,</hi> or our <hi>great Wits,</hi> would have been <hi>Atheists</hi> or <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi>
then.</p>
                  <p>Think whether those are not already in that <hi>reprobate sense</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> does
speak of, who have case off all <hi>discriminating notions</hi> of <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> who
say in their hearts, and affirm openly, there are none such in <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
It would appear they were if we should try by those effects, <hi>verse</hi>
29, 30, 31. or by that essential signature, <hi>vers.</hi> 32. they not onely <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
such things, but have pleasure in them that do them;</hi> which because
they cannot have from those Commissions when they do not commit
them, therefore their debauched minds must be satisfied there is no evil
in those doings, and must reap the pleasure onely of such satisfactions:
That is, have the satisfactions and pleasures onely of a Reprobate
sense. In fine, (because I dare not prosecute the Character) Men sink
so fast, as if they were resolv'd to <hi>fall</hi> as far below <hi>Humanity,</hi> as <hi>this
Child</hi> did below his <hi>Divinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O do not you thus <hi>break Decrees, frustrate</hi> and <hi>overthrow</hi> the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Counsel</hi> of Gods Will for good to you. He <hi>set, ordain'd this Child</hi>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:40114:249"/>
for your <hi>rising again:</hi> Do not throw you selves down into Ruin in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite

plac'd <hi>Flesh</hi> in an union with <hi>Divinity,</hi> set it there at the <hi>Right hand

too,<note place="margin">John xi. 25.</note> and make them <hi>like his glorious Body, by the working of his mighty

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese Words are easily resolved into two parts: The
<hi>first,</hi> a Duty; and the <hi>second,</hi> to encourage the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
an assurance of an happy issue in the
doing it.</p>
                  <p>The First, the Duty in these words, <hi>Resist the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi>
the happy issue in those other, <hi>he will flee from
you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the more practical and useful handling of these
parts, I shall endeavour to do these three things.</p>
                  <p>1. View the Enemy we are to resist, <hi>the Devil;</hi> see his Strengths, and
what are his chief Engines, his main Instruments of Battery, whereby
he shakes, and does endeavour to demolish the whole frame of Vertue in
mens lives, shatters and throws down all Religious, holy Resolutions,
and subjects men to himself and Sin.</p>
                  <p>2. See what we are to do in opposition to all this; and how and by
what means we must <hi>resist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Prove to them that do <hi>resist,</hi> the happy issue which the Text here
promiseth.</p>
                  <p>First of the first.</p>
                  <p>Though no man can be <hi>tempted</hi> (so as to be foil'd by the temptation)
but <hi>he that is drawn away by his own Lust, an enticed,</hi> James i. 14. and all
the blandishments of this World, all the wiles and artifices of the <hi>Prince</hi>
and <hi>God</hi> of it, the <hi>Devil,</hi> are not able to betray one into sin, till his <hi>own
Lust conceive</hi> that sin,<note place="margin">Verse 15.</note> and <hi>bring it forth;</hi> Man must be taken first in his
own Nets, and <hi>fall into that pit himself hath digged,</hi> before he can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40114:250"/>
the <hi>Devil</hi>'s prey: Yet Satan hath so great an hand in this affair,
that <hi>the Tempter</hi> is his Name and Office, <hi>Matth.</hi> iv. 3. And the War
which is now before us is so purely his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we are said to fight,<note place="margin">Ephes. iv. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>not against
flesh and blood</hi> (those nests and fortresses of our own Lusts) <hi>but against
Principalities and Powers, against the Rulers of the darkness of this World,
against spiritual wickednesses in high places;</hi> that is, against the Enemy
here in the Text, the <hi>Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to bring about his ends upon us he hath several means. The
first that I shall name is</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Infidelity.</hi> With this he began in Paradise, and succeeded by it: for
he had no sooner told the Woman that she should <hi>non surely die,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. iii. 4. 6.</note> and so
made her <hi>doubt of,</hi> not <hi>believe,</hi> and consequently nor <hi>fear,</hi> that which
God had threatned, but <hi>she took of the forbidden fruit, and she did eat,
and gave it to her Husband</hi> too, <hi>and he did eat</hi> Now if a Serpent si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with her inclination could so quickly stagger and quite overthrow
her Faith; if she, because she <hi>sees</hi> and <hi>likes</hi> a pleasing Object, can, in
meer defiance of her own assured Conviction, when the <hi>Revelation</hi> look'd
her in the face, and <hi>God</hi> himself was scarce gone out of sight, straight give
credit to a <hi>Snake,</hi> that comes and confidently gives the lye to <hi>God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> her
<hi>Maker,</hi> offers her no proof at all of what he says, but onely flatters her
desires with promises and expectations of the knows not what <hi>Ye shall
not die, but ye shall be as Gods;</hi> if in spite of Knowledg she turn Infidel
so soon and easily: 'Tis no great wonder if that Serpent do, at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from Revelation, prevail on men, whose conversation being most
with Sense (their satisfactions also consequently gratifying of their
Sense) they do not willingly assent to any thing but that which brings
immediate evidence and attestation of the Senses, which the Objects of
our Faith do not (especially if it give check to and restrain those satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
as those do) on such men, I say, that do not care, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

things that are against their mind, to apply the Understanding close and
strongly to reflect on those considerations which should move assent, and
work belief. Considerations which I dare affirm, if with sincerity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to (if there be no improbity within to trash their efficacy, no sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
inclination cherish'd that must hinder their admittance, as not being
able to endure to lodg in the same breast with those persuasions) would
make disbelief appear not onely most <hi>imprudent,</hi> but a thing next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
But in those that give themselves no leisure, have no will thus
to advert, 'tis not strange if, <hi>through Satans arts,</hi> in things of this remote
kind they have onely <hi>languid opinions,</hi> which sink quickly into <hi>doubts,</hi>
and by degrees into flat <hi>Infidelity.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>S. Paul</hi> does fetch the rise of unbelief of Charistianity from hence,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 3, 4. <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; In whom
the God of this World hath blinded their minds:</hi> That is, if the Christian
Doctrine do not appear to be the truth of God to any, 'tis to obstinate
persons onely, whom the Devil hath besotted so with the advantages
and pleasures of this World, that their affections to these will not let the
other be admitted. For,</p>
                  <p>The Carnal prejudice can cast a mist before the mind, or that a bright
an glittering Temptation of this World may dazle it so as that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Those Works which Christ and his Apostles wrought, which made
the whole World that was <hi>Heathen</hi> then, so many Millions of such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Nations as could never meet together to conspire an universal change
in their Religions, made them yet agree to lay aside their <hi>dear gods</hi> and
their dearer vices, and do that to embrace a <hi>Crucified Deity,</hi> a God put
to a vile ignominious death, as one <hi>worse</hi> than the <hi>worst of men;</hi> and a
Religion that was as much <hi>hated,</hi> counted as <hi>accursed</hi> as that God of it,
<hi>He</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> crucified alike; and a Religion too that had as great
severities in its Commands as in its Persecutions, that did it self enjoyn
as hard and cruel things to flesh and bloud as they that hated it inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the <hi>duties</hi> and the <hi>punishments</hi> equally seem executed on its follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and a Religion whose performances had no retributions here but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
ones, no otherwise rewarded but with <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>faggot,</hi> and whose af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-promises
were most incredible: Those <hi>works</hi> that could produce all
this, had certainly <hi>Omnipotent conviction</hi> in them; sure we are there must
be prodigy of <hi>Miracle</hi> either in the <hi>causes,</hi> or in the <hi>effect.</hi> And yet the
<hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> are not wrought on by them. Their carnal Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
would not be removed, not by the <hi>Finger of God:</hi> The mean and
despicable, and, as to all their worldly expectations and affections, the
unsatisfying condition of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> had so clouded all his Works, and
their own pride so blinded them, that they could see no <hi>argument</hi> in
<hi>Miracle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now 'tis the Devil, that <hi>God of the World,</hi> that hath the power of its
Glories, and the managery of its temptations, who, by raising these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
dazles so and blinds the minds of men, that they should not
believe. S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms it: And 'tis plain that <hi>unbelief</hi> is no one's Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
but Satan's. For it is not Man's. Not the vertuous man's certainly:
He's concern'd as much as Happiness amounts to, to believe there is a
<hi>God,</hi> whose <hi>cares</hi> and <hi>Providence watch</hi> over him, whose Ears and Arms
are <hi>open</hi> to him, whose <hi>Bowels yearn</hi> for him, whose <hi>Blood</hi> did <hi>purchase</hi>
him, whose everlasting Blessednesses do await him. 'Tis his Interest to
trust that <hi>Vertue,</hi> which the World so scorns or pities, was yet worthy
God should be <hi>Incarnated</hi> to teach it, <hi>die</hi> to purifie us into it, and will
<hi>raise</hi> us up again to <hi>crown</hi> it. Neither is this Unbelief <hi>Man's real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi>
abstracting from these prejudices of Religion. For if it were <hi>Man's
real Interest,</hi> then it were every man's wisest course to pursue that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.
But if every man did so, and should persuade himself into <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,</hi>
and that Religion and a Deity were but <hi>dreams</hi> or artifices, and
so arrive so far as to have <hi>no fear of God,</hi> nor <hi>sense of Honesty</hi> or <hi>Vertue,</hi>
the whole World must needs return into the first confusions of its <hi>Chaos:
Villany</hi> and <hi>Rapine</hi> would have <hi>right.</hi> When those Mounds are thrown
down, there is nothing that can hinder but that every man may lawfully
<hi>break in upon and invade every thing.</hi> There is no fence to guard thy Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
nor thy Bed, no not thy very Breast: Rather indeed there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
thine. This is, 'tis true, <hi>Leviathan's state of Nature;</hi> and 'tis so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
with the <hi>Leviathans</hi> of Sea and Land, the wild Beasts of the Deep
and of the Desart. But to prevent the necessary and essential mischiefs of
this state amongst us Men, he will have Nature to have taught us to make
<hi>Pacts</hi> and <hi>Oaths:</hi> But if there's no such things as <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> then
there is no Obligation to <hi>keep</hi> Pacts or Oaths. And why should he observe
them that can safely break them? <hi>Here</hi> it is indeed that <hi>Doctrine ends;</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:40114:251"/>
to this their <hi>Infidelity</hi> does tend. And therefore 'tis no Interest of <hi>States</hi>
or <hi>Princes.</hi> This the <hi>Atheist</hi> will confess; <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Religions,</hi> he says,
were invented for the meer <hi>necessities</hi> of Governours, who could not be
secure without those higher Obligations, and these after-fears. And are
they not <hi>kind Subjects</hi> then who, by promoting Atheism, labour to break
down that fence which themselves account <hi>necessary?</hi> Or are they not
good rational Discoursers too, who labour to throw out a thing as <hi>false</hi>
and <hi>vain,</hi> because 'tis <hi>necessary?</hi> So necessary sure, that they who weaken
these bonds of <hi>Religion,</hi> quite dissolve those of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> all whose Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
are made of those Sacred Ties, which if you untwist, the other
Cords are burst as easily as <hi>threads of Cobweb.</hi> Nay these Doctrines lay
Principles that justifie <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>King-killing.</hi> Nor if there's no such
thing as <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> then those are no Crimes. And it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Treason</hi> hath been loved, when <hi>Blasphemy</hi> hath been so. They that
hear men <hi>droll</hi> on <hi>God Almighty, raille</hi> their <hi>Maker,</hi> and <hi>buffoon</hi> with <hi>Him,</hi>
will quickly learn to speak with little reverence of their <hi>Superiours.</hi>
There's no Kingdom but the <hi>Devil's</hi> that can have support from <hi>Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
'tis the Interest of that indeed. His work goes more securely on,
when there are no Religious apprehensions to check it: <hi>Allow'd Vice</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be at ease if it but think those things are true. It is the infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of <hi>wickedness,</hi> that the Laws of Vertue and Religion should be onely
<hi>Spiders webbs,</hi> Snares for innocent and lesser <hi>Flies,</hi> while <hi>venomous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
can pass safely through them, and the <hi>Wasps</hi> can burst them; are

and that there should be <hi>no God</hi> that can bring them to an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reckoning.
They that <hi>flatter</hi> and <hi>betray,</hi> that hug and then trip up, or

there should be a Resurrection, to collect the scatter'd, the soul atomes
of his Sin and his Disease, and shew them at that dread Tribunal, before
<hi>God,</hi> his holy <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Mankind.</hi> Such as these are the onely men that
are concern'd against Religion. Here we see whose Interest such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
who promote <hi>Infidelity.</hi> And truly 'tis so much the Devil's Interest,
that by those very measures that he weakens Faith, he strengthens every
sort of Wickedness: By the steps and degrees of <hi>Infidelity</hi> men ascend
towards the heights of sin: And when they have surmounted all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
apprehensions, then they are upon the Precipice of Vice. When
the Flood-gates are remov'd, the Torrent must break in impetuously.
For what is there that can hinder? nothing certainly, if <hi>present Interest</hi> be
not able: But 'tis plain that <hi>Thieves,</hi> and <hi>Murtherers,</hi> and <hi>Rebels,</hi> in fine,
every one whom we call <hi>Sinners,</hi> do pursue that which they account their
<hi>present Interest:</hi> That therefore if there were no other, would not be

which nothing in the world can be more restless, is nurs'd by it. Where
are States so censured, so new modell'd, as at certain of our <hi>Refectories,</hi>
places that are made meerly for men to spend their time in which they
know not what to do with? At those Tables our Superiours are disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
Calumny and Treason are the common, are indeed the more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
entertainments of the places. In fine, where persons have no other
employment for their time but <hi>talking,</hi> and either have not so much Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
as to find delight in talking good things, or not so much skill as to
speak innocent recreation, there they <hi>talk of others, censure,</hi> and <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite,</hi>
and <hi>scoff.</hi> This is indeed the onely <hi>picquant</hi> conversation; <hi>Gall</hi> is
<hi>sawce</hi> to all their Entertainments: And that you may know these things
proceed from that <hi>old Serpent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. iii. 13.</note> they do nothing else but <hi>hiss</hi> and <hi>bite.</hi>
'Tis the <hi>poyson of Asps that is under their lips</hi> which gives rellish to their
Discourses; 'tis the <hi>sting</hi> that makes them <hi>grateful, venom</hi> that they are

                  <p>More of the brood of this want of Imployment you may find at <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
namely,<note place="margin">Ezek. xvi. 49.</note> 
                     <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Luxury:</hi> For saith <hi>Ezekiel, This was the Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Sodom; Pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of Idleness was in her
and in her daughters.</hi> And indeed the Idle person could not possibly
know how to pass his hours, if he had not Delicacies to sweeten some,
Wine to lay some asleep, and the solicitous deckings of Pride to take up
others: But the studious gorgings of the inside, and the elaborate trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings
of the outside, help him well away with them.</p>
                  <p>Good God! that for so many hours my morning eyes should be <hi>lift
up</hi> to nothing but a <hi>Looking-glass!</hi> that that thin shadow of my self should
be my <hi>Idol,</hi> be my <hi>God</hi> indeed, to which I pay all the devotions I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form!
And when with so much care and time I have arrayed and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall'd
my self, that I should spend as much more too in the compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies
of viewing this! with eager eyes and appetite surveying every
part, as if I had set out, expos'd them to my self alone, and only dress'd
a prospect for my own sight! and since Nature, to my grief, hath given me
no eyes behind; that I should fetch reliefs from Art, and get vicarious sight,
and set my back parts too before my face, that so I may enjoy the whole
Scene of my self! And why all this? for nothing but to serve vain Osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
or negotiate for Lust, to dress a Temptation, and start Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence.
And that the half of each Day should be spent thus! the best
part of a reasonable Creatures and a Christians life, be laid out upon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
so far from Christian or reasonable!</p>
                  <p>And truly <hi>Luxury</hi> will easily eat the remainder up, that sure Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Idleness. For when the <hi>Israelites</hi> were in the Wilderness, where
they could not eat but by <hi>Miracle,</hi> and the <hi>Rock</hi> must give them <hi>drink;</hi>
yet,<note place="margin">Exod. xxxii. 6.</note> having no Imployment, they made <hi>Feasts: They sate down to eat
and drink and rose up to play.</hi> Nor would eating to the uses of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
serve them, but they must have entertainments for their wantonness.
Had they been imployed to get their Bread, their labour would have
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40114:252"/>
made their morsels sweet: But since God, as the Wise-man says, <hi>sent
them from Heaven bread prepared without their labour,</hi> they must have
varieties to sweeten it;<note place="margin">Psalm lxxviii. 19, 25.</note> they require <hi>him</hi> to <hi>prepare a Table</hi> also <hi>in the

<hi>food of Angels,<note place="margin">Wisd. xvi. 20, 21.</note> able to content every mans delight, and agreeing to every
taste, and serving to the appetite of the eater, it temper'd it self to every
mans liking,</hi> and what could they fancy more? The latitude of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the whole Universe of Luxury could do nothing else; in every
single morsel they had sorts, Variety, all choice; as if that <hi>Desert</hi> had
been <hi>Paradise,</hi> that <hi>Wilderness</hi> the <hi>Garden of the Lord:</hi> Yet so coy is
Idleness, so apt to nauseate, that they abhor the constancy of being pleas'd.
And though they were not sated neither,<note place="margin">Exod. xvi. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>he that gather'd much had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

to take up their Minds and Entertain their <hi>Souls,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psalm lxxvii. v. 18.</note> they require <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>meat for their Souls,</hi> meat not to serve the uses of their <hi>bodies,</hi>
but to feed their <hi>fancies,</hi> their extravagant <hi>minds.</hi> Thus <hi>Idleness</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
to be <hi>dieted.</hi> And all this but to pamper and feed high mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
so to make Temptations <hi>irresistible,</hi> and by consequence <hi>Vice
necessary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It were easie to recount more of those ways by which the Devil does
make use of mens <hi>want of Imployment</hi> to debauch their lives, and ruin all
the hopes of Vertue in them. S. <hi>Jude</hi> finds more of its effects at <hi>Sodom:
They gave themselves over to Fornication,<note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> and went after other flesh, and
are set forth for an Example, suffering the vengeance of Eternal fire.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
these are most certain consequents of not being imployed: <hi>Quaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
Aegysthus</hi>—is too known an instance:<note place="margin">2 Sam. xi. 1, 2.</note> and <hi>great holy David</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
But its dire influence is sufficiently visible in that which it rain'd
down upon those Cities. Since it did fulfill the guilt of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and made
<hi>Heaven</hi> furnish <hi>Hell</hi> for it, and God himself turn Executioner of <hi>fire</hi>
and <hi>brimstone</hi> to revenge it; this shall serve to prove it is one of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's
Master-pieces.</p>
                  <p>3.<note place="margin">Ephes. vi. 16.</note> Next succeed his <hi>fiery darts,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them, namely, <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,</hi>
or <hi>Calamities</hi> of any kind: Which he manageth either by inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pressures, and he was so confident of the force of these, that he did
tell God he would make <hi>Job curse him to his face</hi> with them:<note place="margin">Job i. 11.</note> Or if he
find men in necessities and pressures, then by tempting them to get from
under them by methods which he shall direct; and he had such assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the strength of this Temptation, that by it he tried our Saviour,
to find out whether he were the <hi>Son of God</hi> or no,<note place="margin">Matth. iv. 3.</note> believing none but he
that was so would be able to resist it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the trials are severe which this Temptation does present, to
draw men from their Duty, and to overcome their Constancy; Whether
it solicite by inflicting punishment (as on the Mother and her Children,
2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> vii.) or by offering to withdraw it, if they will submit to their
unlawful terms (and so they tried her youngest Son there, <hi>verse</hi> 24.)
or at leastwise by some feigned act, some ambiguous words or practices,
will pretend compliance; (so they dealt with <hi>Eleazar, Chap.</hi> vi. 21. whom
they would have had to bring flesh of his own provision, such as he
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40114:253"/>
might use without offence, and so onely seem to eat forbidden meat.)
Each of which is as great a trial also, and to stand against them reckon'd
up amongst as vigorous acts of Faith, as those that held out in the greatest
tortures persecuting malice could invent: <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 17. <hi>They were stoned,
sawn asunder, were tempted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to fetch an instance of the sad success of these, I shall not need
to go so far as to those Persecutions of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> nor those of the <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times of Christianity;</hi> when they had no other choices but these, to
deliver up their <hi>Bibles</hi> or their <hi>Lives;</hi> either to <hi>sacrifice</hi> to <hi>Idols,</hi> or at
least procure a <hi>Ticket</hi> which should certifie that they had done it, or to
be themselves an <hi>Holocaust,</hi> and give those <hi>Idols</hi> a <hi>Burnt-offering</hi> with
their <hi>martyr-flames.</hi> Which made the <hi>Traditores, Lapsi,</hi> the <hi>Thurificati</hi> and
the <hi>Libellatici</hi> to be so numerous. Through Gods blessed mercy there
is no use of such instances, as there is no fear of such a trial; 'tis not
death to be a Christian now: For if the <hi>Son of Man</hi> or <hi>Satan</hi>'s self should
come to try us at those rates, 'twere a great doubt whether the one or
other would <hi>find Faith upon the Earth;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke xviii. 8.</note> whether they would sacrifice a <hi>life</hi>
to our Religion, who are not content to sacrifice a little <hi>interest</hi> or <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
to it;<note place="margin">Heb. xii. 4.</note> whether they are likely to <hi>resist unto blood fighting against sin,</hi>
who will not resist to <hi>tears</hi> nor <hi>sober resolutions.</hi> Alas! what Religion
should we be of, if God should raise a <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> come to tempt us with
the <hi>fiery trial? Martyrs</hi> as we are to nothing but our <hi>Passions</hi> and our
<hi>lusts!</hi> Nor shall I produce more known and near experiences, when, by
reason of such <hi>storms</hi> of Persecution, men <hi>made shipwreck,</hi> if not of <hi>their
Faith,</hi> yet of good Conscience. When by order or permissions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
they were brought to such a streight, that either they must let
go their <hi>possessions</hi> or their <hi>honesty,</hi> acting against Principles, and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Duty: I shall not remember, how, when God did shake his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
hand thus over them, they fled to the Devils kindness, and made
<hi>Hell</hi> their refuge, to save them from their <hi>Fathers rod:</hi> how they grew so
<hi>Atheistical,</hi> as to believe a Perjury or other crime greater security, that
would preserve their selves and their condition better than all God had
promis'd; were such <hi>Infidels,</hi> that they did rather trust their being here
to the commission of a sin, than to the Providence and the Engagements
of the Almighty. For indeed what need I instance in these greater cases,
where the trial was so sharp, as not to offer any easier choice than this,
either to part with <hi>Conscience</hi> or with <hi>all they had?</hi> God knows, we find
less Interests will do: The Devil by no more than this, driving the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darens
swine</hi> into the Sea, was able to drive <hi>Christ</hi> out of their Coasts.
You have the story <hi>Matth.</hi> viii. from the 28. <hi>verse.</hi> A legion of those
evil spirits did possess two men; and finding <hi>Christ</hi> would cast them out,
and by that Miracle so far shew forth his Power, that in probability the
whole Countrey would believe on him, they fall upon this project to
prevent it; they besought him, if he would cast them out, to suffer them
to go into an herd of Swine there feeding; hoping by destroying them
to incense the Owners against <hi>Christ:</hi> And, to try them, he permitted
this. The possessed Swine ran violently down into the Lake, and perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Now a man would think the virulency of these Devils, which were
so destructive when they were at liberty and not restrained, would have
endeared the mercy that had cast them out of the poor men, and came
to dispossess the Countrey of them; and that their astonishment at so
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40114:253"/>
great a Miracle would possess them all with Reverence and belief of him;
and that they would therefore seise and possess him also, and not let the
mercy go: But, on the contrary, the whole City and Countrey came out
to meet <hi>Jesus,</hi> and in consideration of the loss of their Swine, desire him
to depart out of their Coast. Lo here an equal Enemy to Christ and all
his Miracles, that was indeed too hard for them. The Senate of Hell had
no project to keep out Religion like to this, to make Religion thwart an
Interest. Rather no Christianity than lose an Earthly satisfaction by it:
<hi>Rather have the Swine than Christ himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. But if he chance to fail in this Assault (as by our Saviour he was
beaten off) he hath yet a reserve in which he places his last, strongest
confidence; with which he ventured to charge Christ, when it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
he knew he was the <hi>Son of God.<note place="margin">Matth. iv. 8, 9.</note> He takes him up into an high
Mountain, and shews him all the Kingdoms of the Earth in the twinkling
of an eye, and the glory of them, and says, All these things will I give thee.</hi>
He thought it was impossible for such a Prospect not to make impression
on the Appetite, raise some desire, or stir one Covetous or Ambitious
thought: which if it could but do, he made no scruple then to clog the
Gift with such conditions as that there, <hi>All these things will I give thee.
if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. v. 5.</note> 'Tis said indeed, the <hi>Covetous man
is an Idolater:</hi> And here we see the God he does do <hi>homage</hi> to, and <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi>
The Devil does require, that those whom he gives Wealth to (now
'tis <hi>he</hi> that gives it to the <hi>Covetous,</hi> to all indeed that get it with <hi>injustice</hi>
or with <hi>greediness;</hi>) he requires, I say, that these should pay all their
Religion to Himself: And the <hi>Ambitious,</hi> in however high a place he
sets them, must <hi>fall down to him.</hi> And truly these two dispositions can
give worship to no other God but such an one as is <hi>Abaddon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. ix. 11.</note> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer
of Mankind. For all the great Commotions of the World, all
those Convulsions that tear Provinces and Empires, all Seditions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
with those Armies of Iniquities that attend them, and that wage
their Designs, which are upheld by legions of Villanies as well as men,
all the Disturbances of States and Church, are but attempts of Covetous
and Ambitious spirits, men that are unsatisfied with their condition, and
desire a change, and care not how they compass it: They can charge
through Seas of Bloud and Sin, over the face of Men and Conscience, to
get out of that condition, which they therefore are not well content with,
because something they like better beckens their ambitious and their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Desires. Would you see what one of these will venture at? When
Christ our Saviour was to be betrayed, when a Person of the Godhead
was to be delivered up and Crucified, the Devil had no passion to imploy
on that Design so fit as the <hi>desire of getting money;</hi> and when that desire
was once entertain'd,<note place="margin">John xiii. 2, 27.</note> we see he enters <hi>really</hi> in <hi>person,</hi> and <hi>possesses</hi> such
a Soul: and when he is there, he designs no farther but to warm and stir
that passion: 'Tis sufficient fruit of his possession, he hath done enough
in such an heart wherein he <hi>dwells,</hi> if he but keep alive that desire of
Money; For he knows that will make the man adventure upon any
guilt; for it made <hi>Judas</hi> undertake to betray <hi>Christ.</hi> And as for the
other passion which the Devil did design the glories of his prospect to
give fire to, though he could not stir it in our Saviour, yet he knew it
vanquish'd him himself when he was <hi>Angel.</hi> What height is there which
<hi>Ambition</hi> will not fly at, since it made this spirit aim at an equality with

                  <p>5. The remaining Trial with which Satan did assault our Saviour,
when he tempted him with <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>God's Promises,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. iv. 4.</note> and sought to
<hi>ruine</hi> him with his <hi>own priviledges:</hi> with that also,</p>
                  <p>6. His being a <hi>lying spirit in the mouth of all the Prophets;</hi> by which
long ago he did destroy an <hi>Ahab,</hi> in the 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xxii. 22. But since by
sad experience we know, he ruined the <hi>best King,</hi> purest <hi>Church,</hi> and most
flourishing <hi>State,</hi> by the same Stratagem. But these, with those other
which S. <hi>Paul</hi> does call his <hi>wiles,</hi> I must omit; sufficient hath been said
already to inforce the necessity of <hi>resisting,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. vi. 11.</note> which is the <hi>Duty,</hi> and the
next considerable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Resist the Devil:</hi> That is, do not you consent to his Temptations:
for there is no more required of us, but this onely, not to be willing to
be <hi>taken</hi> and <hi>led captive by him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. ii. 26.</note> For let him <hi>suggest, incite, assault</hi> and
<hi>storm</hi> us, no impression can be made upon us till we yield, and till we <hi>give
consent</hi> no hurt is done. It is not here as in our other Wars: In those
no resolution can secure the Victory, but notwithstanding all resistance
possible, we may be vanquish'd; yea, sometime men are overpress'd
and die with Conquering, and the Victor onely gains a Monument, is
but buried in the heaps of his slain Trophies. But in these Wars with
the Devil, whosoever is <hi>unwilling</hi> to be vanquish'd, <hi>never can</hi> be: For he
must first <hi>give consent</hi> to it, and <hi>will</hi> the ruine; for men do not sin against
their <hi>wills.</hi> Onely here we must distinguish betwixt <hi>Will</hi> and thin <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leity</hi>
and <hi>Woulding.</hi> For let no man think when he commits deliberate
iniquity with aversness and reluctancy of mind, allows not what he does,
but does the evil that he would not, what he hates that he does; that
this is not to be imputed to the Will; that in this case he is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
but here the <hi>spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak,</hi> and yields
through meer infirmity: For, on the contrary, the Devil finds the Flesh
so strong in this case, that with it alone he does assault the mind, and
breaks through its reluctancies and aversations, bears down all its reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
triumphs over all that does pretend to <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Vertue</hi> in him.
Where 'tis thus, let no man flatter or persuade himself he <hi>does what he
would not,</hi> when it is plain he does impetuously <hi>will the doing it.</hi> Let
him not think that he <hi>allows not,</hi> but <hi>hates</hi> that which he does; when it
is certain, in that moment that he does commit, not to <hi>allow</hi> that which
he does <hi>resolve</hi> and <hi>pitch upon</hi> and <hi>chuse;</hi> to <hi>hate</hi> what with <hi>complacency
he acts;</hi> or to do that <hi>unwillingly</hi> which he is wrought on by his <hi>own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence</hi>
to do, and by his <hi>inward incitations,</hi> by the mutiny of his <hi>own
affections</hi> which the Devil raises, and when it is the meer <hi>height</hi> and <hi>prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of his appetite</hi> that does make him do it (as it must be where there
is reluctancy before he do it, his desires and affections there are evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
too strong for him) or at last, to <hi>hate the doing</hi> that which 'tis his too
much <hi>love</hi> to that makes him <hi>do,</hi> are all impossibilities; the same things
as to <hi>will against the will, desire against appetite.</hi> But do but keep thy self
sincerely and in truth from being willing, and thou must be safe: For
God expects no more but that we should not voluntarily yield to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.
He hath furnish'd us with his own compleat Armour for no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uses of a War,<note place="margin">Ephes. vi. 11.</note> but to encourage us to <hi>stand. Take unto you the whole

                     <hi>Put ye on the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to

to do more than this, not to be willing and consent to fall; for no man
can be beaten down but he that will fall.</p>
                  <p>It were very easie for me to prescribe you how to fortifie against those
Engines of the Devils battery which I produced to you. But that I may
not stay upon particulars, directing those whom he prevails upon through
<hi>want of Imployment</hi> to find out honest occasions not to be idle (and sure
it is the most unhappy thing in the World, for any man to be necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be vicious by his having nothing else to do, and because, while
the World accounts it a <hi>Pedantick</hi> thing to be brought up by Rules and

to pass by these, I say, the universal strength against this Enemy is
<hi>Faith.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 9.</note> Your adversary the Devil, like a roaring Lion, goeth up and down
seeking whom he may devour; whom resist stedfast in the Faith.</hi> And that
not onely as it frustrates all that he attempts by means of <hi>Infidelity,</hi>
but it also <hi>quenches all his fiery darts;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. vi. 16.</note> whatsoever bright Temptation
he presents to draw us from our Duty, or whatever fiery trial he makes
use of to affright and martyr with. For the man whose Faith does give

hath swallowed down those happy expectations which <hi>have never entred
in the heart of man to comprehend;</hi> what is there that can <hi>tempt</hi> or
<hi>fright</hi> him from his station? To make all that which Satan gave the
prospect of prevail on such a Soul, <hi>the Kingdoms of the Earth</hi> must out-vie
<hi>Gods Kingdom,</hi> and their <hi>Gauds</hi> out-shine his <hi>Glory,</hi> and the <hi>twinkling of
an eye</hi> seem longer than <hi>Eternity:</hi> For nothing less than these will serve
his turn, all these are in his expectations. Or what can fright the man
whose heart is set above the sphere of terrours? who knows calamity,
how great soever, can inflict but a more sudden and more glorious bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
upon him; and the most despiteful cruel usage can but persecute
him into Heaven. 'Tis easie to demonstrate that a Faith and Expectation
of the things <hi>on Earth,</hi> built upon weaker grounds than any man may
have for his belief of <hi>things above,</hi> hath charg'd much greater hazards,
overcome more difficulties than the Devil does assault us with. For sure
none is so <hi>Sceptical,</hi> but he will grant that we have firmer grounds to
think there is another World in Heaven, than <hi>Columbus</hi> (if he were the
first Discoverer) had to think there was <hi>another Earth;</hi> and that there
are far richer hopes laid up there in that other World, for those that do
deny themselves the sinful profits and the jollities of this, and force
them from their inclinations, than those Sea-men could expect who first
adventur'd with him thither. For they could not think to gain much for
themselves, but onely to take soism of the Land (if any such there were)
for others covetous Cruelty; could get little else but only <hi>richer Graves,</hi>
and to lie <hi>buried</hi> in their <hi>yellow Earth.</hi> Nor are we assaulted in our
Voyage with such hazards, as they knew they must encounter with; the
<hi>path of Vertue</hi> and the <hi>way to Heaven</hi> is not so beset with difficulties as
theirs was; when they must cut it out themselves through an unknown
new World of Ocean, where they could see nothing else but swelling ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Death, from an Abyss of which they were but weakly guarded,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40114:255"/>
and removed few inches onely: And as if the dangerousest shipwrecks
were on shore, they found a Land more savage and more monstrous than
that Sea. Yet all this they vanquish'd for such slender <hi>hopes,</hi> and upon
so uncertain a <hi>belief.</hi> A weak Faith therefore can do mighty works;
greater than any that we stand in need of to encounter with our Enemy:
It can remove these Mountains too; the golden ones that Covetousness
and Ambition do cast up: Yea more, it can remove the <hi>Devil</hi> also; for
if you <hi>resist</hi> him <hi>stedfast in the Faith,</hi> he <hi>flies;</hi> which is the <hi>happy issue,</hi>
and my last Part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Resist the Devil, and he will Fly from you.</hi> And yet it cannot be denied
but that sometimes when the <hi>messenger of Satan</hi> comes to <hi>buffet,</hi> though
S. <hi>Paul resist</hi> him with the strength of <hi>Prayer</hi> (which when <hi>Moses</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
he was able to prevail on <hi>God</hi> himself, and the Lord articled with
him,<note place="margin">Deut. ix. 14.</note> that he might be <hi>let alone</hi>) yet he could not beat off this assailant,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 7, 8, 9. When God, either for prevention, as 'twas there, <hi>v.</hi> 7.
or for exercising or illustrating of Graces, or some other of his blessed
ends, gives a man up to the assaults of Satan, he is often pleased to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the temptation long; but in that case he does never fail to send
assistances and aids enough against it. <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee,</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aith he to S. <hi>Paul</hi> there. And when he will have us tempted for his
uses (if we be not failing to our selves) he does prevent our being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
so that there is no danger in those Trials from their stay. But
yet it must not be denied but that the Devil does prevail sometimes by
importunacy, and by continuance of Temptation; so that <hi>Resistance</hi> is
not always a <hi>Repulse,</hi> at least not such an one as to make him draw off
and flie. It is not strange to find him siding with a <hi>natural Inclination,</hi>
with the <hi>bent of Constitution,</hi> still presenting Objects, laying Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
throwing in Examples, and all sorts of Invitation, always pressing
so, that when a man hath strugled long he does grow weary of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
not enduring to be thus upon his guard perpetually, watching a
weak heart with strong inclinations, busie Devils do lay siege to; and
so growing slack and careless, he is presently surprised: Or else, despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he shall be always able to hold out, lays hold upon a tempting
opportunity, and yields; by the most unreasonable and basest cowardise
that can be, yields, for fear of yielding; lest he should not hold out, he
will not, but gives up; and puts himself into that very Mischief which
he would avoid, meerly for fear of coming into it. For which fear there
is no reason neither; For 'tis not here as in our other Sieges, where, if
it be close, continuance must reduce men to necessity of yielding, Strengths
and Ammunitions will decay, Provisions fail, and, if the Enemy cannot,
their own Hunger will break through their Walls, and make avenues
for Conquest, time alone will take them; but in these Spiritual Sieges,
one Repulse inables for another; and the more we have resisted, the
Temptation is not onely so much flatter, and more weak and baffled,
but the inward Man is stronger: Victory does give new forces, and is
sure to get in fresh and still sufficient supplies.<note place="margin">James iv. 6.</note> For <hi>God giveth more grace,</hi>

that where the Devil after several repulses still comes on with fresh as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults,
we may be sure he does discern there is some treacherous incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
that sides with him: And although the man refuse himself the
satisfaction of the sin, the Devil sees he hath a mind to it, his refusals
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40114:255"/>
are but faint, not hearty; though he seem afraid to come within the
quarters of the Vice, he keeps, it may be, correspondence with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives
to it, entertains the opportunities, plays with the Objects, or at
best he does not fortifie against him. Now this gives the Tempter hopes,
and invites his assaults, and does expose the person to be taken by him.</p>
                  <p>But where he sees he is resisted heartily, his offers are received with
an abhorrency, discerns Men are in earnest, watch to avoid all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and occasions, and prepare, and fortifie, and arm against him, there
he will not stay to be the <hi>triumph of their Vertue.</hi> We may know th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
by his <hi>Agents,</hi> those that work <hi>under the Devil,</hi> whom he hath instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>mysteries of waging his Temptations.</hi> Where they are not like
to speed (and as to this they have <hi>discerning spirits</hi>) they <hi>avoid,</hi> and
<hi>hate,</hi> and <hi>come not near,</hi> but study <hi>spite</hi> and <hi>mischief</hi> onely there. The
intemperate men are most uneasie with a person whom they are not able
to engage in the debauch; the <hi>rudeness</hi> and <hi>brutality</hi> of their excesses are
not so offensive to the sober man, as his <hi>staid Vertue</hi> is to them; they do
not more avoid the crude egestions, shameful spewings of their overtaken
fellows Riot, then they do the shame and the reproach that such a man's
strict Conversation casts on them, which does in earnest make them look
more foul and nasty to themselves. In fine, every Sinner: shuns the
Company of those whom he believes Religious in earnest; 'tis an awe
and check to them; they are afraid, and out at it, as their <hi>Great Master</hi>
also is, who when he is resisted must be overcome: And as they that
are beaten have their own <hi>fears</hi> also for their Enemies, which are sure
to charge close, put to slight, chase and pursue them; so it seems he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is afraid of a sincere and hearty Christian, for he flies him: So he did
from <hi>Christ, Matth.</hi> iv. <hi>verse</hi> 11. and so the Text assures, If you <hi>resist</hi>
him, <hi>he will flie from you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, although we all did once <hi>renounce the Devil and his works,</hi>
were listed Soldiers against him, took a <hi>Sacrament</hi> upon it, and our Souls,
the immortality of life or misery, depend upon our being true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to our selves and Oaths, or otherwise; nor is there more required of
us but <hi>resolution</hi> and <hi>fidelity,</hi> onely not to be <hi>consenting</hi> to our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Conquest of us, not to will Captivity and Servitude: Yet as if, in
meer defiance of our Vows and Interests, we not onely <hi>will'd</hi> the ruine,
but would <hi>fight for it,</hi> we may find, instead of this <hi>resisting of the Devil,</hi>
most men do <hi>resist the Holy Ghost;<note place="margin">Acts vii. 51. Ephes. vi. 16. 1 Thess. v. 19.</note> quench</hi> not <hi>the fiery darts of Satan,</hi> but
the <hi>Spirit</hi> and his flames, by which he would enkindle love of God and
Vertue in them. If he take advantage of some warm occasion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
their courage against former follies, heat them into resolutions of
a change; as soon as that occasion goes off, they put out those flames,
and choak these heats until they die. If he come in his <hi>soft whispers,</hi>
speak close to the heart, suggest, and call them to those joys of which
himself is <hi>earnest;</hi> to all these they shut their ears, can hear no whispers,

Sinners to <hi>believe</hi> and be <hi>converted,</hi> that thy self shouldst interpose to
hinder it, and hide the possibilities of mercy from their eyes, that they
may never see them, nor recover! What can then become of those for
whom God does contrive that they shall not escape? when instead of those
bowels that did make him <hi>swear he would not have the sinner die,<note place="margin">Ezek. xxxiii. 11.</note> but would
have him return and live,</hi> he puts on so much indignation at such Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
as to take an order they shall not repent, and take an order that
they shall be damn'd.</p>
                  <p>And yet all this is onely to those men, who, being <hi>dull of hearing</hi> the
suggestions of the Spirit, and not willing to give entertainment to his
holy motions, <hi>grieve</hi> him so, that they repell and drive him quite away;
and so by <hi>consequence</hi> onely make way for the Devil: Whereas there are
others that <hi>directly call him, force</hi> him to them, <hi>ravish</hi> and <hi>invade</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

them: Others <hi>feed high to invite and entertain the Tempter,</hi> do all that
is possible to make him come, and to assure him that he must prevail,
when they have made it most impossible for themselves to stand and to
<hi>resist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some there are indeed whom he does not overcome so easily, but is
put to <hi>compound</hi> with them, takes them upon <hi>Articles:</hi> for when he
would ingage them to a sin to which he sees they have great <hi>inclinations,</hi>
with some <hi>fears,</hi> he is fain to persuade them to <hi>repent</hi> when they have
done; to lay hold upon the present opportunity, and not let the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
escape them, but be sorry after, and amend. For where these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
of Repentance usher in transgression, there we may be sure it
is the Devil that suggests those resolutions. But if he can get admittance
once thus, by prevailing with a person to receive him upon purposes of
<hi>after-Penitence;</hi> he is sure to prosper still in his attempts upon the same
condition: For Repentance will wash out another sin, if he commit it;
and so on. And it is evident that by this very train he does draw most
men on through the whole course of sin and life: For never do they till
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40114:256"/>
they see themselves at the last stage, begin repenting. When they are
to grapple with <hi>Death's forces,</hi> then they are to set upon <hi>resisting of the
Devil:</hi> And when they are grown so weak that their whole Soul must
be imployed to muster all its spirits, all their strength, but to beat off
one little spot of phlegm, that does besiege the <hi>avenues of breath, the
ports of life,</hi> and <hi>sally at it,</hi> and <hi>assault it, once, again,</hi> and a <hi>third, many
times,</hi> and yet with all the sury of its might cannot break through, nor
beat off that little clot of spittle; when it is thus, yet then are they to
<hi>wrestle</hi> with,<note place="margin">Ephes. vi. 12. 2 Cor. x. 4, 5.</note> and Conquer <hi>Principalities and Powers, all the Rulers of the
utter darkness, pull down the strong holds of sin</hi> within, <hi>cast down imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and every high thing that did exalt it self against the knowledg of
God, and bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;</hi>
and with those feeble hands that they are scarcely able to lift up in a
short wish, or prayer, they must do <hi>all this; resist the Devil,</hi> and take
Heaven by force.</p>
                  <p>Now sure to put it off to such a fatal season is a purpose of a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
concern. In God's Name let us set upon the doing it while there
is something left of <hi>Principle</hi> and vigor in us, ere we have so <hi>griev'd
Gods Spirit,</hi> that he do resolve to leave us utterly; and before the Devil
have so broke us to his yoke, that we become content and pleas'd to
do his drudgery. We deceive our selves if we think to do it with more
ease when Constitution is grown weaker; as if then Temptations would
not be so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not so much as stirring to get out. But if we strive before he have us in
his clutches, we have an Enemy that can vanquish none but those who
consent to, and comply and confederate with him, those that will be
overcome: So that if we <hi>resist,</hi> he must be <hi>Conquer'd;</hi> and Temptation
must be conquer'd too, for <hi>he will flie,</hi> and then by consequence must
cease to trouble and molest us. This is the sure way to be rid of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
to put to flight the great <hi>Artificer</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> of them, subdue
and overcome <hi>him</hi> and <hi>our selves:</hi>

                     <bibl>PHILIPP. III. 18.</bibl>
                     <q>For many walk of whom I have told you often, and now
tell you even weeping, that they are the Enemies of
the Cross of Christ.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough many <hi>by the Cross of Christ</hi> here understand
any sort of Suffering for the sake of Christ or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
(it being usual with the Scripture to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
<hi>Christ</hi> to every evil that befals a man for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his duty,) yet others looking on it <hi>properly</hi>
as that on which <hi>Christ</hi> himself suffered, by the
<hi>Enemies of the Cross</hi> understand those that set
themselves against the whole design and influence
of <hi>Christ</hi>'s death upon it.</p>
                  <p>Now to name that in few words, the Cross of Christ not onely is
one of the greatest Props on which our Faith of the whole Gospel leans,
which it establisheth the truth of as Christs Bloud shed upon it was the
sanction of the Covenant on Gods part, who by that federal Rite of
shedding Bloud engag'd himself; and we may certainly assure our selves,
he cannot fail to make good whatsoever he hath promised in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
who would give the Bloud of his own only Son, who was so holy,
and who was himself to Seal that Covenant; and his Bloud is therefore
called <hi>the Bloud of the Everlasting Covenant.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. xiii. 20, &amp; 10. 29.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But besides this extrinsick influence of it, all the blessed Mercies also
of the Gospel, are the Purchase of this Cross, and all the main essential
duties of the Gospel are not onely Doctrines of the Cross, such as it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
and does inforce, but the Cross also hath an immediate efficacy in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40114:258"/>
the working of them in us:<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> For S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>by the Cross of Christ the
World is Crucified to me and I unto the World.</hi> On it <hi>the Flesh</hi> is also
<hi>crucified with the Affections and Lusts:</hi> And to say all that comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Duty of the Gospel, <hi>Self-denial,</hi> is but another word for <hi>taking up
the Cross:</hi> And then as for the Mercies of the Gospel on the Cross the
satisfaction for our sins was made, the Price of our Redemption paid,
and that effected: There was wrought our Reconciliation with our
God; Lastly, that was the consideration upon which Grace was bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
whereby we are enabled to perform our duty: With good reason,
therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Gospel <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,<note place="margin">1 Cor. i. 18.</note> the <hi>word or Doctrine of
the Cross;</hi> so that the Enemies of <hi>the Cross of Christ</hi> are in a word the
Enemies of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and so the blessed <hi>Polycarpe</hi> in his Epistle to
these same <hi>Philippians</hi> seems to understand it:<note place="margin">Poly. &amp; Ignat. Ep. <hi>p.</hi> 23. Edit. Usserian. pro persequentibus &amp; odientibus vos, &amp; pro ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>is crucis.</note> And they that <hi>walk as
Enemies</hi> to it, are such as do not onely hate the Duties of the Gospel,
those especially which the Cross directly does inforce; but their course
of life is order'd so as to break the very Frame and Power of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they set themselves against all that Christ came to do upon and by
the <hi>Cross,</hi> resist, and wage War with the <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and by consequence
oppose the <hi>mercies</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>The words being thus explain'd, I have no more to do but onely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
two Enquiries which they give occasion for.</p>
                  <p>The first is, What sort of men those are that <hi>walk as Enemies to the
Cross,</hi> and wherein their hostility does express it self?</p>
                  <p>The second is, What the danger and the sadness is of that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that they should make S. <hi>Paul</hi> think it necessary frequently to warn
them of it, and to do it now with so much passion? <hi>For many walk,</hi> saith
he, <hi>of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First for the first. And here I shall not strive to give you in a perfect
list of all that walk as Enemies to the Cross, but shall take that which
S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath made ready to my hands in the next words.</p>
                  <p>And first the Enemies which he brings up in the front, are the Sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
the <hi>Men whose God is their Belly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>They whose glory is in their shame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Who mind Earthly things,</hi> to which as being their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
and near Allyes I shall add</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Those that he reckons up in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. <hi>the wise men of
this World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, The <hi>Sensualists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Men who diligently mind the serving of their appetite in Meats
and Drinks, that study and contrive its pleasure, and with industry
have learn'd, and practise Arts of Luxury, and in those have set up their
delights, that these should be accounted Enemies of the Cross of Christ
there is but too much reason. For their course of life is perfect opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to that <hi>Cross,</hi> and to the whole <hi>design of Christianity,</hi> and to the
very <hi>being</hi> of all <hi>Vertue.</hi> For since <hi>Vertue</hi> is but moderation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
of Appetites and Passions, and since sensuality indulges, and does
raise and heat them: since the whole <hi>design of Christianity,</hi> is to <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the deeds of the Body,</hi> those <hi>our members upon earth,</hi> that <hi>Body of Sin</hi>
and <hi>Death;</hi> and since Voluptuousness quickens, pampers and does make
them vigorous; lastly, since the Doctrines and the Influences of <hi>the Cross
of Christ</hi> do aim at <hi>Crucifying the flesh with its Affections and Lusts,</hi> and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40114:258"/>
Luxuries do gorge and make them ramping, sure the Enmity is too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
to be prov'd.</p>
                  <p>It is the business of Religion to instruct and frame men into reasonable
Creatures: God himself chose to die upon the Cross that we might live
like Men here, and then afterwards die into Sons of God, and become
equal to the Angels.</p>
                  <p>He suffered on the Tree, that we might be renewed into that consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
which the Tree of Knowledg did disorder and debauch. Before
Man a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of that, his lower Soul was in perfect subordination to his mind,
and every motion of his appetite did attend the dictates of his Reason,
and obey them with that resignation and ready willingness which our
outward faculties do execute the Wills commands with; then any thing,
however grateful to the senses, was no otherwise desired than as it serv'd
the regular and proper ends and uses of his making; there was a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
harmony in all the tendencies of all his parts, and that directed, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulated
by the rules and hand of God that made them: In fine, <hi>then
Grace was Nature, Vertue Constitution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to reduce us to this state as near as possible is the business of
Religion (as it had been in some kind the attempt also of Philosophy.)
But this it can in no degree effect, but as it does again establish the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
of the sensual to the reasonable part within us: That is, till
by denying satisfactions to the Appetite (which is now irregular and
disorderly in its desires) we have taught it how to want them, and to
be content without them, and by that means have subdu'd its inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
or by taking down the Body have abated of its powers and its
provocations; and where it is stubborn, heady, and rebellious, there
by cutting off provisions from the flesh, and by sharp methods van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd
and reduc'd it into a condition of Obedience; and (whenever
that is also necessary) weakens so that insolent untam'd part of our
selves, that we make it lie fainting, groveling at our feet (these are the
Doctrines of the Cross, and this the method of its Discipline:) And
withal by those rational and divine heavenly encouragements which
above all Doctrines in the World our Christianity suggests and furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with infinite advantage, have so fortified the mind that it resumes
its principality, governs, and carries on the lower Soul in its obedience
to Duty easily without resistance, as they say the higher Heaven moves
the inferiour Orbs along with it although their proper tendencies are
contrary: At leastwise if impressions from without or inbred inclinations
stir, raise passions, and mutinies, yet the mind keeps so much power that
they shall not beat it off, and force it from its prosecutions of good; nor
shall, unless by a surprize, engage its consent in the pursuit of evil. This
is that which Religion aims at, thus to make us men, teach us to live
according to our nature, to put Reason in the Throne, and vindicate the
Spirit from the tyranny of its own Vassal flesh.</p>
                  <p>But sensuality is most perfect opposition to this whole design; for
it renverses that subordination without which there is no possibility of
Vertue as I shew'd you; and it puts that whether Lust or Passion in the
Throne, which either constitution, conversation, or whatever accident,
did give possession of our inclinations to: And makes the strangest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy
of <hi>Centaure</hi> where the <hi>Beast is uppermost and rides the man;</hi> where
the <hi>Beast is God</hi> indeed; for the sensual man acknowledges no other <hi>God</hi>

but his own <hi>belly,</hi> so S. <hi>Paul</hi> does character him here. And truly if we
look on the attendances, and careful services he gives it, and how stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously
and wholly he does consecrate himself to please it, one would
think it most impossible he should have any other God: but if we num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the <hi>drink-offerings,</hi> and <hi>meat-offerings,</hi> the whole <hi>Hecatombs</hi> he gives
it, and whereas other Deities had onely some peculiar appropriate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
for their Sacrifices, how this Votary rifles the Universe, goes
through the whole latitude of beings for Oblations, one would think he
did out<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is onely for his Belly. Now he that deifies his Appetite, and that is so
attent and so sollicitous in its service, he that sets up such an <hi>Antigod</hi> as
this to Christ, appears a scornful insolent Enemy to <hi>Him,</hi> his <hi>Cross</hi> and
his <hi>Religion,</hi> near the state of those men whom the Wise-man couples
with the sensual, persons <hi>of an impudent mind,</hi> the very disposition of
those Enemies of the Cross of Christ whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> brings up in the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
place,</p>
                  <p>Those that glory in their shame.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the uses of the Cross of Christ, one chiefly meant, was by
the ignominy of that most accursed infamous punishment to represent
the vileness of Iniquity; to which shame and confusion were so due,
that there were to be Contumelies as well as Agonies in the Death that
was to expiate it; And it seems not sufficient that <hi>the Blood of God</hi> be
shed for it, but that Bloud must be stain'd too with the <hi>imputation of a
Malefactor;</hi> Christ was to suffer the insulting scorns and vilifyings of his
Crucifiers, his Honour must be sacrific'd as well as his Life, <hi>Barabbas</hi>
must be prefer'd even before that <hi>Pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n of the Trinity</hi> to whom sin was
to be imputed, and who was to bear the just shame of it, such infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
debasement and contempt being a most essential ingredient in the
wages of Iniquity, of which this Cross of Christ was the express.</p>
                  <p>And then how is it possible for men to wage a more profess'd hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
against the Cross of Christ, than by endeavouring to put <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
on the thing on which that Cross was set to throw <hi>Disgrace?</hi> by
raising <hi>Trophies</hi> to themselves for that which raised a <hi>Gibbet</hi> to their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour?
giving themselves a <hi>value</hi> for the thing which hath such infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
diminution in it, that it made the <hi>Son of God</hi> esteemed worse than
<hi>Barabbas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These men are too successful Enemies of the Cross that thus triumph
over it, and when it was erected as an Ensign to display the vileness
of iniquity, and to shame sin out of the lives of mankind, vindicate
and rescue sin from that contempt, and throw the Cross and shame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Religion it self; while they exult in their commissions as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
things, and too truly verifying the Apostles aggravations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
wilful Sinners, <hi>Crucifie to themselves the Son of God afresh and put
him to an open shame,</hi> while they put scorns on that contempt he suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
For the Agonies and Contumelies he endured on that account of
sin must needs be most ridiculous to them who count Sin gay and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.
Thus they trample and insult upon his Passion, thus tread
underfoot the Son of God even on his Cross, and upon that footstool
they exalt themselves by putting sin in countenance and credit with the
Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For it is plain it is so when men once can <hi>glory</hi> in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For our
actions raise a glorying in us onely in relation to the sentiments of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40114:259"/>
that growing from a confidence of having praise and value for
them in the World. So that they must assure themselves that most men
or the most considerable will applaud their Vices; otherwise they could
not glory in them, but would be ashamed. And such a judgment we
may safely pass upon an Age or Nation, where great Crimes not onely
have impunity but Reputation; and men glory in them. Had it been
so in the Heathen World when Christ and his Cross first appeared there,
Christianity had wanted one of its convincing pleas. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his
Apology for our Religion to them that blasted it with all imaginable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
of Impiety, discourses thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Omne malum out timore out pudore Natura perfudit:</hi>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tul. Apolog. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> Nature hath
dash'd every Vice with fear or shame; all Malefactors labour to lie
hid, and if they are laid hold upon they tremble, and deny when they
are accus'd, hardly confess it to the Rack; and when they are found
guilty they bewail, upbraid themselves, and aggravate confessions of
their Crimes. <hi>Christianus verò quid simile?</hi> But what does the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
like this? None of us is asham'd of his Religion, or repents, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be because he was not sooner of it: If he be branded for it he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rejoyceth,
if you accuse him of it he does own it, triumphs in it; if
he be condemned for it he calls his Execution his Martyrdom, his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
his Crown. <hi>Quid hoc mali est quod naturalia mali non habet?</hi> Now
what strange kind of impiety is this that hath none of the natural affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of it? not the shame nor fear, tergiversations or repentance, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorings
of it? <hi>Quid hoc mali est cujus reus gaudet, cujus accusatio votum
est, &amp; poena faelicitas?</hi> What a kind of evil's this, which he that is found
guilty of is glad? to be accus'd of it is his ambition? to suffer for it
is his happiness?</p>
                  <p>Alas, the World hath taught Vice now adays to use this plea with a
much greater confidence, and he that would apply this argument to our
experiences might plead thus for the Religion of sin. For now they
are but piteous puisny sinners who feel those things which in <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
days were natural and essential to sin, <hi>to blush,</hi> and <hi>be ashamed,</hi> and
<hi>have regrets.</hi> Men do not onely own it as those primitive persons did
their Christianity, but they out-vie the Martyrs heats; for they accuse
themselves, and boast of their performances in Villany, yea falsity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
themselves in sin, and usurp Vice, steal the glorious Reputation of
exceeding sinfulness, as if the impiety were meritorious.</p>
                  <p>And truly as that Christian Confidence and Magnanimity brought
in the World as Proselytes to the Cross, so this other confidence brings
Sholes of Votaries to Vice: For when once there is no need to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd
of it, there are but very few but will venture to commit it.
And indeed this sort of men do manage their hostility so dexterously, as
to use those very Weapons Christianity was successful with, against it
self. 'Twas by a <hi>discipline of shame</hi> (for that was the great strength of
the <hi>Church Censures</hi>) that our Religion did at first prevail almost to the
exterminating Vice out of the World: The temporal Sword was never
so victorious as this <hi>weapon of our Spiritual Warfare was,</hi> which yet in
those times drew no bloud, unless it were into the face, <hi>in blushes.</hi> But
since men have found or made pretexts to glory in iniquity, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Crimes are become honourable; Vertues are dress'd up as mean,
poor spirited, sneaking qualities; some look <hi>melancholick, sad,</hi> are <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriack,</hi>

some <hi>pedantick,</hi> some <hi>unmanly,</hi> some <hi>irrational,</hi> and worse; so
that men are now asham'd of Duty; 'tis a disparagement to own the
doing it: Thus they have as it were <hi>excommunicated Religion.</hi> It is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a contemptible, or at best foolish thing; which is the very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the <hi>third</hi> sort of Enemies the <hi>Wise men of this World,</hi> tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
all their wisdom lies. Which two last sorts of Enemies I shall attaque
together.</p>
                  <p>The Cross of Christ amongst its other ends was set to be an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>whereby the World is to be Crucified to us,<note place="margin">Gal. vi. 14.</note> and we unto the World;</hi>
to be the means whereby we are enabled to prevail upon and overcome
our worldly lusts and inclinations; and to sleight, yea and detest all
the temptations of its Wealth, Delights, and Heights, when they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to draw us into sin or take us off from Duty. Now to this it
works by these three steps.</p>
                  <p>First, shewing us <hi>the Author and the finisher of our Faith</hi> nailed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to that Cross; his joints rack'd on it, his whole Body strip'd, and
nothing else but Vinegar and bitter potions allow'd his thirst:<note place="margin">Matth. xvi. 24.</note> and thus
convincing us that <hi>if we will be his Disciples we must take up his Cross
and follow him,</hi> at leastwise we must have preparedness of mind to take
it up when ever it is fix'd to Duty; to renounce all profits, honours,
and delights of this World that are not consistent with our Christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession:
This is the Doctrine of the Cross of Christ; it being otherwise
impossible to to be the Disciples of a Crucified Master. And when this
great <hi>Captain of our Salvation</hi> was himself <hi>consecrated by his sufferings,</hi>
and had for his Standard his own Body lifted up upon the Cross, we
that are listed under him, and with that very badg the Cross too; <hi>crucis
Consecranei,</hi> Votaries and fellow Soldiers of that Order, if we shall avoid
our Duty when it is attended with a Cross, or straitned any ways, and
the provisions of this World are cut off from it, and betake our selves
rather to the contents of Earth; we do not onely shamefully fly from
our Colours; Fugitive, and Cowards, Poltrons in the Spiritual War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare;
but are Renegadoes, false and traytours to our selves too, such as
basely ran away not onely from our Officer, but from Salvation, which
he is the Captain of; and which we cannot possibly attain, except we
be resolv'd to follow him, and charge through whatsoever disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to attend Religion, vanquishing all those temptations with which
the World assaults us in our course to Duty. Thus the Cross of Christ
first shews us the <hi>necessity</hi> we have to renounce and <hi>Crucifie the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to encourage and enable us to do so, it does also shew us</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>certainty of a good issue</hi> in the doing it, assures us,
that those who deny themselves forbidden satisfactions here, that will
be vertuous maugre all the baits and threats of Earth, will embrace
Duty when it is laden with a Cross, although so heavy as to crush out
life, and kill the body; assures us that those lose not, but exchange their
lives, shall save their Souls, and that there is another World wherein
their losses shall be made up to them, and repaired with all advantage.
To the truth of this the Cross of Christ is a most pregnant and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
testimony. For as by multitudes of Miracles Christ sought to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the World that he was sent from God to promise all this, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his Power to perform it by experiment, raising some up from the dead;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40114:260"/>
so when they said he did his Miracles by <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> he justified it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his Life; affirming that he was the Son of God (no 'tis
impossible but he must know whether he were or no) and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sent and able to do all he promised, and resolv'd to do it also for our
more assurance in himself, that he would raise himself up from the dead
within three days; and saying this when he was sure he should be Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
for saying so, and sure that if he did not do according to his
words, he must within three days appear a meer Impostor to the world,
and his Religion never be receiv'd.</p>
                  <p>Now 'tis impossible for him that must needs know whether all this
were true or no to give a greater testimony to it than his Life. For
this that Bloud and Water that flowed from his wounded side upon
Cross, which did assure his Death, is justly said to bear witness to his
being the Son of God, and consequently to the truth of all this, equal
to the testimony of the Spirit (whether that which the Spirit gave
when he came from Heaven down upon him in his Baptism, or the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
which he gave by Miracle;<note place="margin">1 John v. 8.</note>) for <hi>there are three that bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
upon Earth, the Spirit, the Water and the Blood.</hi> Thus by his Death
Christ did bring Life and Immortality to light: his choosing to lay down
his own life for asserting of the truth of all this, was as great an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to prove it as his raising others from the dead: and <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
Monument, and walking Grave-cloaths were not better evidence
than this <hi>Cross of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Once more, this Cross not onely proves the certainty of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
state, but does demonstrate the advantage of it; and assures us
that it is infinitely much more eligible to have our portion in the life
to come than in this life: That to part with every thing that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable
in this World rather than to fail of those joys that are laid up
in the other, that to be poor here or to be a spoyl, to renounce or to
disperse my wealth, that so I may lay up treasures for my self in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and may be rich to God; never to taste any one of these puddle
transient delights, rather than to be put from that right hand where
there are pleasures for evermore; to be thrown down from every
height on Earth, if so I may ascent those everlasting Hills, and Mount
Sion that is above; that this is beyond all proportion the wisest course
it does demonstrate; since it shews us him who is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who
did create all these advantages of Earth, and prepare those in Heaven,
and does therefore know them both: Who also is the <hi>Wisdom of the
Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. xii. 2.</note> and does therefore know to value them, yet <hi>for the joys that
were set before him choosing to endure the Cross and despising the shame.</hi>
On that Beam he weigh'd them, and by that his choice declar'd the
Pomps of this World far too light for that <hi>exceeding and eternal weight
of Glory;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. iv. 17.</note> that the whole earth was but as the dust upon the Ballance
and despis'd it, and to make us do so, is both the Design and direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of the Cross of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But as at first the <hi>Wise men of this World</hi> did count the <hi>Preaching
of the Cross meer folly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. i. 18, 19, 21, 23.</note> to give up themselves to the belief and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of a man that was most infamously Crucified, and for the
sake of such an one to renounce all the satisfactions, suffer all the dire
things of this Life, and in lieu of all this onely expect some after Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesses
and Salvations from a man that they thought could not save
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40114:261"/>
himself, seemed to them most ridiculous: So truly it does still appear
so to the carnal reasonings of that sort of men, who have the same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
to the Cross of Christ, as it would Crucifie the World to them,
and them to it; as it would strip them of all present rich contents, and
give them certain evils, with some promises of after good things, which
they have no taste for, nor assurance of.</p>
                  <p>Now this being in their account folly, then the contrary to this
they must think Wisdom: as it is indeed <hi>the Wisdom of this World;</hi>
which Wisdom since it does design no further than this World, and hath
no higher ends than Earth and its Felicities, it must needs put men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
minding the acquist and the enjoyment of these Earthly things, for
that is onely to pursue and to atchieve their ends, to catch at and
lay hold on their felicity; and accordingly we see it does immerse them
wholly in those cares. So that it is no wonder if their God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
can get no attendance from them, it being most impossible they
should, when Mammon hath engaged them in the superstitious services
of Idolatry; and when they sacrifice their whole selves to pleasure and
make their bodies the burnt offerings of their Lusts, and when Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
even while it makes them stretch and climb and mount, causes
them also to fall low, prostrate, make their temper, nature stoop, lie
down to every humour, and to every Vice they think themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to court and please.</p>
                  <p>And though a man would think these so great boundless cares are
very vain and foolish upon several accounts; for common sense as well
as Scripture does assure us that <hi>this life</hi> and the Contents of it do <hi>not
consist in the abundance of the things that we possess;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke xii. 15.</note> that it is all one
whether my draught come out of a small Bottle or an Hogshead; the
one of these indeed may serve excess, and sickness better, but the other
serves my Appetite as well; the one may drown my Vertue, but the
other quenches thirst alike. And every days experience also does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us, that the least cross accident, pain or affliction on our persons
or some other that is seated near our hearts, or the least vexation or
cross passion will so sowr all those advantages, that we cannot possibly
enjoy them while we have them; sickness makes the richest plenty only
a more nauseous trouble, a more costly loathing; then the poorest Soul
that is in health is that great rich mans envy.</p>
                  <p>And there's no man also but does see so far into futurity as to satisfie
himself that he shall die, and then the shadow of Death will cloud and
put out all these Glories. And universal Reason also does tell every
man that to deny himself or want his present satisfactions of this help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
dying kind, and suffer present evils, is in prudence to be chosen for
avoiding of a future evil or atchieving of a good to come which do
transcend those other infinitely, and to all Eternity continue. Sure as
no man pities the poor Infant in the Womb because he lies imbrued in
Blood, hath no inheritance there at all, is fetter'd, confin'd as it were
in that dark Cell; if he be to be born to an Estate, to live a full age
here in gaiety of mind, and health of body, in Reputation, and all plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of delights, we never are concern'd or troubled at his other nine
months Dungeon. So if this life be to the next as the Womb is to this;
and if our hopes be no more on the Earth than in the Belly; and we
have no inheritance or abiding place here, as we had not there; although
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40114:261"/>
the waters of affliction, and to be in our bloud should be as natural to
us as to the Child, yet if we thus press forward to the other birth, to
be delivered into immortality of joys, this state were not to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but endeavoured for with all our powers. Lastly, the same reason
does assure us, that if those futurities (which are most certain) were
but only possible, yet to part with every thing, and suffer any thing here
to prevent miscarriage in relation to those two Eternities is certainly the
safest course, and then by consequence the wisest. And this does appear
a truth to all men when they go to die: And if it be the truth then, 'tis
always so.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithstanding all this, he that minds these earthly things,
whose heart is set upon them, whose desires the World serves, provides
to satisfie every imagination of delight: His heart is so intangled in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to them, and in prejudices for them, and hath so imbib'd the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of them, that he hath no taste for any other, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
no satisfying notions of them: And if he hath not then it is
not possible that he should really and from his heart, out of conviction
and inward sense value these beyond the earthly ones: and it is plain
we see he does not; and if he do not, to deprive himself of all the sweet
contentments of his life, and tear out his own bowels that yearn after
them, and cling to them; and instead of those embrace a Cross, and do
this for things which he cannot value more, and counts uncertain, he
must needs think a mad folly: Consequently to contrive and seize the
present to the best most plentiful advantage is the wisest course; and
therefore they that by whatever arts do thrive, advance themselves,
live high and in delights, they are Wise men; because they do attain
their ends, by means appropriate to those ends.</p>
                  <p>And now the enmity betwixt <hi>the Cross of Christ</hi> and the <hi>wisdom of
the World</hi> appears: <hi>first,</hi> their <hi>designs</hi> are most directly opposite; the
cross designs to take us up from earth and from its satisfactions, which
have also <hi>thorns</hi> and <hi>bryars</hi> in them, that <hi>Earths Curse,</hi> things that pierce
and wound as fatally as the <hi>Nails</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> and other cruelties of
<hi>Christ's Cross;</hi> and to lift us towards Heaven, to direct our hearts and
our affections thither as our harbingers, to take possession for us of those
joys the Cross did purchase for us, but no Cross can ever trouble. But
the Wisdom of this World designs to lay out all its cares and its contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
within this World, minds nothing else but earthly things, and
does not lift an eye or thought to any other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Their <hi>Principles</hi> wage war: For earthly good things being
the design, the main end of this worldly wisdom, consequently that
does justifie all courses without which men cannot gain those ends, by
which they do, though they be never so unlawful by the Rules of that
which we call Vertue and Religion; it does justifie, I say, all such as
prudent. But the Principles of the Doctrines of the Cross of Christ are
positive, that we must renounce all earthly satisfactions, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be enjoyed without trangressing Christ's Commands, and imbrace
Duty even when it executes it self upon us.</p>
                  <p>But Thirdly, there's no enmity so fatal to the Cross of Christ as is
the <hi>practice</hi> of those men who minding Earthly things, and all their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
lying as to them, they therefore think themselves concern'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the Doctrines of the Cross, which does so contradict their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40114:262"/>
as meer madness, and the Cross it self as the Ensign of folly; And
accordingly they do, treat it <hi>en ridicul;</hi> and make the proper Doctrines
of it, the strict duties of Religion, matter for their jests, and bitter scoffs:
They character Religion as a worship that befits a God whose shape the
Primitive persecutors painted Christ in,<note place="margin">Tertul. Apol. c. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Deus Onochaetes,</hi> as if Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
were proper Homage onely to an <hi>Asses person,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tertul. ad Nat. c. 11. Ibid.</note> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> words it;
And the Votaries transform'd by this their service and made like the
God they worship, were what they were call'd then <hi>Asinarii</hi> creatures
onely fit for burthen, to bear, what they magnifie, a Cross and scorns.
No persecutions are so mortal as those that Murther the reputation of a
thing or person; not so much because when that is fallen once then they
cannot hope to stand, as because those <hi>murder after death,</hi> and <hi>poison
memory, killing to immortality.</hi> They were much more kind to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and more innocent that cloath'd the Christians in the <hi>skins of
Bears and Tygers,</hi> that so they might be <hi>worried into Martyrdom;</hi> Than
they that cloath their Christianity in <hi>fools Coat,</hi> that so it may be <hi>laugh'd
to death,</hi> go out in ignominy and into contempt. If to sport with things
of sacred and Eternal consequence were to be forgiven, yet to do it with
the Cross of Christ: Thus to set that out as <hi>foolishness</hi> which is the
greatest mystery the <hi>Divine wisdom</hi> hath contriv'd to make <hi>mercy and
truth meet together, righteousness and peace kiss each other,</hi> to make sin be
punish'd, yet the Sinner pardoned: Thus to play and sin upon those dire
expresses of Gods indignation against sin, are things of such a sad and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
concern, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> could not give a caution against them but
with tears, <hi>For many walk, saith he, of whom I have told you often and now
tell you even weeping, &amp;c.</hi> Which calls me to my <hi>last</hi> Consideration.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the Cross of Christ does represent Almighty God in so severe a
shape, and gives the lineaments of so fierce displeasures against sin, as do
exceed all comprehension. There was a passion in Christs Prayer to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his Passion, when he deprecated it with strong cries and tears, yea
when his whole body wept tears as of bloud to deprecate it; and yet he
cryed more dreadfully when he did suffer it; The Nails that bor'd his
Hands, the Spear that pierc'd his Heart and made out-lets for his Bloud
and Spirits, did not wound him as, that sting of death and torments, sin
did, which made out-lets for God to forsake him, and which drove away
the Lord that was himself out of him. Neither did his God forsake him
only, but his most Almighty attributes were engag'd against him: Gods
Holiness and Justice were resolv'd to make Christ an example of the sad
demerit of Iniquity, and his hatred of it: Demerit so great, as was valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with the everlasting punishment of the World, fal'n Angels and fal'n
Men; for to that did it make them liable. Now that God might appear
to hate it at the rate of its deservings, it was very necessary that it should
be punish'd, if not by the execution of that sentence on Mankind as on
the Devils, yet by something that might be proportionable to it, so to let us
see the measures God abhors it by, to what degrees the Lord is just and
holy by those torments, torments answerable to those attributes.</p>
                  <p>Now truly when we do reflect on this we cannot wonder if the Sinner
be an enemy to the Cross, and hate the prospect of it, which does give him
such a perfect copy of his expectations, when our Saviours draught which
he so trembled at shall be the <hi>everlasting portion of his Cup:</hi> For if God
did so plague the <hi>imputation</hi> of Iniquity, how will he torment the <hi>wilful
and impenitent commission</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:40114:262"/>
But then when we consider those torments were the satisfaction for
the sins of man, methinks the Sinner should be otherwise affected to
them: Christ by bearing the Cross gave God such satisfaction, as did
move him in consideration thereof to dispence with that strict Law, which
having broken we were forfeit to eternal Death, and to publish an act of
Grace whereby he does admit all to pardon of sins past, and to a right to
everlasting Life that will believe on him, forsake their sins and live true
Christians.<note place="margin">John i. 36.</note> He there appears the <hi>Lamb of God that taketh away the sins
of the World,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. xiii. 8. Heb. ix. 26.</note> for that he does as being a <hi>Lamb slain,</hi> then he was our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>
and that Cross the <hi>Altar.</hi> And the humbled Sinner that repents
(for, notwithstanding satisfaction, God will not accept a Sinner that goes
on; by all those Agonies his holiness would not be justified, if when he
had forsaken and tormented his own Son for taking sin upon him, he
should yet receive into his favour and his Heaven, Sinners that will not
let go, but will retain their sins: but the penitent) may plead this expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Lo here I poor Soul prostrate at the footstool of the Cross lay hold
upon the Altar, here's my Sacrifice on which my fins are to be charg'd,
and not on me, although so foul I am, I cannot pour out tears sufficient
to cleanse me, yet <hi>behold Lord, and see if there ever were any Sorrow like
the sorrow of thy Son wherewith thou didst afflict him</hi> for these sins of mine:
And here is Bloud also, his Bloud to wash me in: and that Bloud is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Vail too now, and that my Offering taken from the Cross up to
thy Throne, thou hast accepted it, and canst not refuse it now my <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi>
does plead it, and claims for me the advantage of the Cross.</p>
                  <p>Now that men should be Enemies to this, and when they are forfeit
to eternal Ruine, hate that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is to redeem the forfeiture; that
they should trample on the Cross whereon their satisfactions were
wrought; tread down the Altar which they have but to lay hold on and
be safe; wage war with, beat off, and pursue a Lamb, that <hi>Lamb of God</hi>
that comes to <hi>take away their sins:</hi> and make a spoil and slaughter of
their Sacrifice; hostilely spill upon the ground that Bloud, that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for their Bloud upon the Altar, for their <hi>blood of sprinkling,</hi> and
was to appear in Heaven for them. If men resolve to be on <hi>terms of Duel</hi>
with their <hi>God,</hi> and scorn that <hi>Satisfaction</hi> shall be made for them by any
other way than by <hi>defiance;</hi> and although their God do make the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
for them to himself, yet not endure it, but chuse quarrel rather;
this is so perverse and fatal an hostility as no tears are sufficient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail.</p>
                  <p>But possibly men sleight these satisfactions because some terms are put
upon them which they know not how to comport with; the merits of
the Cross must not be accounted to them but upon conditions which
they are not able to perform; they are required to master all their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Customs, their untam'd appetites, and setled habits, to keep under
their Concupiscence, to calm their inclinations and their passions: Now
on such severe articles friendship with the Cross they think is too hard
bought.</p>
                  <p>But therefore <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Cross was the consideration upon which
Grace is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>er'd us, whereby we are enabled to perform all this; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>power to will</hi> and <hi>strength to do,</hi> all necessary aids from Heaven are
granted to us as Christ merited them for us by his Sufferings; and that
Bloud he shed upon the Cross it is the Fountain, 'tis the Ocean of all
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40114:263"/>
Grace: And if temptations storm thee, lay hold on that Cross, it is
the Anchor of Salvation thou hast hold on; tell thy God although thou
art not able to resist and stand, thou hast the price of strength, that
which did purchase it was paid down for thee on the Cross, and is at his
right hand, he hath it: give me therefore grace for it, let me have the
value of that Blood, the <hi>Blood of God</hi> in spiritual succours, which may
make me able to resist thy Enemies, and do thy will. Now God will
never be unjust to deny any man those aids that were so dearly purchas'd
for him, and for which he hath receiv'd the price.</p>
                  <p>And then that men should be Enemies of the Cross which is their
Magazine of strength against their Enemies! As men that do resist
the having Grace, lest it should change their inclinations! as men that
will not be impowered against Vice, but will oppose the Aids of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
fight against the succours that are given them, and destroy their
own forces, lest with them they should be able to encounter sin and
overcome it! Thus wilfully to run against and charge their Anchor of
Salvation; to poison to themselves the Fountain the whole Ocean of
their graces, is the state of them onely that do resolve and that had
rather perish.</p>
                  <p>Once more, on that Cross was wrought <hi>a reconciliation betwixt God
and Man;</hi> and that upon such terms of honour to us Men, that God
does seem to condescend as far in this his Treaty, as in coming down
from Godhead into Flesh; there is Exinanition in his yieldings and
compliance. He sent his Son to move us to be reconciled, as if he
did acknowledg us the offended party; and as if he meant to give
us satisfaction, in his Blood, he dies upon the Cross to effect that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.

                  <p>And is a Reconciliation with the Lord so hateful to us, that we will
be Enemies to the Cross that works it? are we so assur'd of worsting

him to Hell to beg and to procure our friendship, will we go to trample

this is, alas, a state so sad that neither S. <hi>Paul's tears,</hi> nor <hi>Christ's blood</hi>

                  <p>And yet though one <hi>wept</hi> the other <hi>dyed</hi> for them, these men have
neither tears nor pitty for themselves. Yet one would think this were
a subject worthy of them: 'Tis storyed of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> that when he took
a view of his vast Army which he went to Conquer <hi>Greece</hi> with (an
Army such as the Sun never saw, and it could scarce see that, which
the Historian says did <hi>Coelo minitari tenebras,</hi> as it cover'd and drank
up the Sea, and took up and devour'd the Earth, so it did seem to
darken Heaven too: An Army which consisted, saith <hi>Herodotus,</hi> when
muster'd at <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> of Five Millions, Two Hundred Eighty Three
Thousand, Two Hundred and Twenty Men, besides Laundresses,
Harlots, and Horses; and it had Twelve Hundred Gallies for Sea-fight,
besides Twenty Hundred Ships for carriage.) When upon this view
he had for a while gloryed in his happiness to behold and Gommand
so many Nations, and so Powerful a Fleet and Army: notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on a sudden he burst into tears on this Consideration, that in one
Hundred years there should not one survive of that great marvellous
multitude: (And truly through his folly in one hundred weeks scarce
any one but was the prey of Enemies, and Death and Infamy.) But
'tis a sadder Contemplation to reflect on the far greater Army of the
Enemies of the Cross, who, if they do not end that quarrel, will in
fewer years be all dead and in Hell. I know not whether such a sad
reflection called out S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s tears, but sure I am it does deserve
their own: And there is nothing will avail in their behalf without
their tears. It may be tears are piteous things for such brave Sinners:
But then what will these insulting Enemies of the Cross do, when
they shall see <hi>that Sign of the Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven?</hi>
When this Cross shall usher in the great Assize? When they shall
<hi>look on him that they have pierced and Crucified upon it?</hi> And when that
Crucified offended Enemy shall come there to be their Judge? That
takes himself to be offended much more in his kindness, than his
Person; and will judge this more severely that we would not let his
Cross and Passion do us any good, than that we Crucified him
on it.</p>

Let us then be caution'd in the fear of God to be no longer Enemies
to that which is to reconcile our judge to us. If we have his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

which our Saviour here directs, and which with such severity he

                  <p>Lastly, Christ's asseveration is added to all this, <hi>Verily I say unto
you whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little Child, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> shall
not enter therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But because the main thing Christ intended in the Text (which
he so oft repeated upon several occasions) was by the significative
emblem of <hi>a little Child,</hi> visibly to inform us of some dispositions
that are absolutely necessary to the entertaining Christianity, either
in our minds by Faith, or in our lives by practice; I shall therefore
wholly attend that design of his in the words, and handle them
particularly as they seem here to be spoken in relation to the Doctrine
of it. This being most of use now in an Age when men not only
tear Religion with disputes, but aim to baffle it with reproaches quite
out of the World: Now against such the Text is positive, <hi>Whosoever
shall not receive the Kingdom of God,</hi> the Doctrine of Christianity <hi>as a
little Child, be cannot enter therein,</hi> neither into the possession of the
Promises of Christianity, nor indeed into the profession of it.</p>
                  <p>And here I need not labour much to find that in a Child which
Christ requires of those that come to be Disciples in Religion; for it
is plain that Children being impotent, unable to sustain or to direct
themselves, they give themselves up to the aids and the directions of
others, those especially whom they are committed to, and with
whose cares of them they are acquainted; to whose guidance they
resign themselves entirely, laying hold on them in any dangerous
appearance, and not trusting to themselves at all: And when their
Age first makes them capable of having any thing infus'd into them,
being empty and unseason'd Vessels they will easily receive all and
sincerely without taint: And being neither fill'd before-hand with
prejudicate opinions, nor with windy vain conceits of their own skill
or knowledge, they must needs take in without any let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> hindrance
whatever is infus'd, and submit themselves to be directed wholly
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40114:265"/>
by their teachers, without contradiction or dispute, for they Judge
not, nor examin, but receive. Now such a resignation seems the
proper disposition which our Saviour expects in a Disciple. It is
plain that his pretended Vicar and that Church expect it, that men
shall submit their Faith entirely to the Church, believe whatever
<hi>she proposeth as reveal'd by God meerly on that account as she proposeth it,</hi>
for otherwise it is not a right faith: Yea she requires that men give
their assent to the determinations of her head, the <hi>Pope,</hi> in <hi>matters
of fact</hi> also, where they are as competent to Judge as he; and though
with all their industry, and using the same means, they cannot find
the fact to be as he determins, yet they are oblig'd in conscience to
that superior to depart from their own Judgment, and to <hi>yield</hi> and
<hi>sign their assent</hi> to his determinations. Witness the matter of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senius.</hi>
Yea their great <hi>Cardinal</hi> is positive that<note n="c" place="margin">Si Papa erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret praecipiendo vitia, vel prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>If the Pope could err
so far as to call evil good, good evil, to prohibit vertues or command vices,
the Church were bound in conscience to believe those vices good and honest,</hi>
and <hi>those vertues evil.</hi> So far he.</p>
                  <p>Indeed if that Church be the <hi>Mother and Nurse of all Christians,</hi>
'tis from her breasts only they must seek the <hi>sincere Milk of the word:</hi>
Now that she is so, they must take her word, as Children do their
Parents words that they are so. And indeed this is properly to
receive the Doctrine <hi>as a little Child,</hi> not judge, nor reason, not examin,
but believe it. And such <hi>legendary doctrines</hi> as well as <hi>Histories,</hi>
which they deliver are most fit to be receiv'd by such as Children.
Yet as if this had been the proper method among Christians always,
in S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s time we find the <hi>Manichees</hi> derided Christianity, <hi>that
discipline of Faith</hi> because by<note n="d" place="margin">Irridere Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae Fidei disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinam, quod juberentur ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines credere, non autem quid esset verum cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimâ ratione docerentur. <hi>l.</hi> 1.

                     <hi>requires us to assent before we have a reason for it.</hi>
And long before that<note n="f" place="margin">Origen. adv. Celsum. <hi>l. 1. p.</hi> 8. editio Cantabrig, <hi>C.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Celsus</hi> did advise the Christians <hi>to receive no

not you examin, but believe, 'tis your faith shall save you;</hi> and as if from
the beginning it were so we cannot but have heard the story of that
man that reading <hi>Genesis</hi> where <hi>Moses</hi> says, <hi>In the beginning God
created the Heaven and the Earth. And he said let there be light and

                     </gap>titutors
of each Religion, did deliver it; others had no more to do
but to believe it, that is, <hi>to receive it as a little Child.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether these reproaches, and the Oath of these known enemies
may go for proofs that it was so, I shall not now enquire. But it is
certain on the other side S. <hi>Paul</hi> requires of his new Christian<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,
that they be not Children in understanding, that they be in
malice Children, but in understanding Men.</hi> Now a Man and a Child
differ not in this, that the one hath an understanding reasonable soul,
and the other hath not; but in that the one cannot use his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40114:266"/>
or his reason, and the other where he acts as man does:
So that our Religion in requiring that we <hi>be in understanding men,</hi>
does require of us that we use our reason in it.</p>
                  <p>And since assenting to a thing as truth is an Act of the highest
faculty of the soul of man as it is properly and truly reasonable, namely
as it <hi>understands and judges,</hi> it is not possible a man should really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a thing unless he satisfie himself that he hath reason for so doing.
Yea, whether that be true or not which many men so eagerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for, that the will though free is bound, and cannot choose but
will that which appears best at that time it wills, yet it is sure that
he who with his understanding, which is not free in her apprehensions
and judgments, but must necessarily embrace that which hath most
evidence of truth: He I say who really assents to any proposition does
satisfie himself that he hath better and more cogent reasons for that
then the contrary: And therefore it is impossible that any man can
verily believe a thing which he is throughly convinc't is contrary to
clear and evident right reason, for he cannot have a better reason for
the thing that is so; and were it possible for any man to believe so,
there could be neither grounds nor Rules for such a ones belief; for
there is nothing in the World, so false and so absur'd although he
were assur'd it were so, but he might assent to it, for whatever
demonstrations could be offer'd why he should not, yet it seems he
might believe against acknowledg'd evident truth and reason, but
this were onely <hi>wish,</hi> or <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>imagination,</hi> not <hi>belief.</hi> And to
prevent such Childish weak credulity was the great work and care of
Christ, so far is he from requiring we should be <hi>as Children</hi> in this
kind. For <hi>when he was ascended</hi> up to heaven <hi>he gave some Apostles,
some Evangelists, some Pastors and Teachers,</hi> he shed down the Holy
Spirit and his gifts, <hi>that we might not be as Children tossed to and fro,
and carried about with every wind of Doctrine;</hi> Eph. 4. 14.</p>
                  <p>First, For want of rational grounds instable in our Faith as Children
are in body, and in judgment also, taking all appearances for truths.
If men were only to believe, there must needs be as great variety of
Religions as of teachers. And though God hath appointed that some
Church should be as perfectly <hi>infalliable</hi> as that of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to
be; yet since there are so many Churches, and the true one therefore
could be known no otherwise then by some marks, there must be
disquisition before Faith; and men must reason and examin ere they
can believe upon good grounds; for were they to receive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<hi>as a little Child,</hi> be nurst up with the <hi>Doctrine</hi> as with <hi>milk,</hi>
a Child we know may suck infection from the poyson'd breast of an
unwholesom mother, or some other person, for it knows not to
distinguish; and so may be nurst to death. A soul like theirs that is
but <hi>rasa t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as the <hi>inscription of the living God,</hi> just as the first hand shall impress.
Therefore we are bid<note n="h" place="margin">I Joh. 4. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>not to believe every Spirit,</hi> not every Teacher

them;</hi> and our<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 24. 24.</note>

S. <hi>Paul</hi> directs. Now what that was here to the hearers in the Text
is easily collected, namely that <hi>he was the Christ that does require it:</hi>
And S. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses it in the forecited place; where he says <hi>we must

Christ,</hi> who as he does himself profess that <hi>if he had not done among
them the works which no other had done, they had not had sin:</hi> John, 15. 24.
If his demonstrations had not convinc't them it had been no fault
not to believe: So when he had made appear he was that person
whom their prophesies had pointed out, the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the <hi>Son of the living

if his revelations present dark unintelligible Mysteries to our faith, his

made proof he comes from God; and surely we are not so insolent as
to doubt that God can discover thing above our understanding; and
do things above the comprehension of our reason. Therefore since
we <hi>are as Children</hi> to all these, it is but just we should <hi>receive them even as

it is impossible for any person or assembly to produce a delegation
of authority in more ample terms then the great Councel of the
Jews could shew, sign'd both by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ. According to the

                  <p>Now Secondly, 'tis most impossible those so vast multitudes of
every Nation should have met together, forg'd a Code of Doctrines,
and agreed so uniformly in professing a Religion, and in dying for it;
for we may as easily believe that there were never any men before this
Age we live in but that these began the kind, as that those of that Age
began the Christian Religion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, 'tis as impossible that their immediate Ancestors who
lived in the Apostles Age, who heard their Preaching, received
their Writings, saw the Miracles they did, if they did any, and many
of them must have seen Christ also after he was risen if it were so;
yea multitudes of them were themselves parties in the gifts of Tongues
and Miracles, if there were any, and so could not be impos'd on,
but must necessarily know whether they were truths or forgeries: It
is as Impossible, I say, so many should agree together to betray all
their Posterity into the profession of a Religion from which they could
look for no advantage but the certain total Ruin of themselves and
their posterity; it was not possible they could have done this if they
had not thought all this was true; and since they did know whether
it were true or not, if they thought it was true, they did know
it was, and if they knew it was, then it is certain that it was so; and
these Scriptures, and the Doctrines Christians deliver (so far as they
have not varied since that time from these Authentical Records) they
have the <hi>Seal of God,</hi> Miracles to attest they come from God.</p>
                  <p>I might have urged completion of Prophecies to prove the same.
First those in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which so eminently
came to pass in <hi>Christ,</hi> that they sufficiently clear those Books to be
Divine: Next <hi>Christ</hi>'s predictions in the New, particularly those
about <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which saith <hi>Eusebius</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Euseb. <hi>lib. 3. c.</hi> 7. Hist Eccl:</note> 
                     <hi>He that will compare with what
Josephus an eye-witness and no Christian, writes of it</hi> (or what our selves
know of that Nation and that place indeed) <hi>he must acknowledge the
Divinity of his words.</hi> But enough hath been said to prove they <hi>come
from God,</hi> and therefore we must so receive them as the <hi>Word of God,</hi>
with perfect resignation of our Souls, and submission of our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
denying every apprehension that would start aside from and
not captivate it self to that prime truth which cannot be deceived nor
lye; and renounce all discourses Reason offers that resist such abnega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it self and all our other faculties, that is, <hi>receive this word of
the Kingdom as a little Child.</hi>

I do not here affirm, by saying this, that our Religion does dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
or keep distance from the service of any of Mans faculties,
for it sometimes admits them not as Ministers only, but as Judges:
'Tis plain the senses were the first, I do not say conveyance onely,
but, Foundation of Faith, which was built on the first believers eyes
and ears; they heard the Doctrine, saw the Miracles, were sure
they saw and heard them, and so, supposing the signs sufficient to
confirm the Doctrine to have come from God, were certain of their
truth, without any Authority of a Church to influence that faith into
divine: And S. <hi>John</hi> therefore does not onely call in, and admit,
and urge their testimony,<note n="s" place="margin">I Joh. 1. 1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>That which we have heard, which we
have seen with our Eyes, which we have lookt upon, and our hands
have handled of the word of Life, that declare we unto you;</hi> But our
Saviour in the highest point of Faith appeals directly to their
Judgment:<note n="t" place="margin">Joh. 20. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands, and reach
hither thy hand and thrust it into my side, and be not faithless but believing:</hi>
And S. <hi>Austin</hi> also gives them the decision of a point of Doctrine which
of all others now troubles the Church most; for speaking of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi>
he says,<note n="u" place="margin">Quod ergo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detis panis est. &amp; calix quod vobis etiam oculi vestri re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuncia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shall resolve that, it must judge against all Rules it hath of judging
by, and judge in contradiction to known Principles, and trample on
all Laws of sense and understanding, which (especially when the
Scripture hath no where defined expresly) must be most unreasonable;
yea most impossible, to judge that true (that is to say, believe that
thing) which it sees is most irreconcileable with known truths. Here
therefore Reason is not insolent if it give verdict by its proper evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences;
men are not bound to swallow <hi>contradictions</hi> as they do the
<hi>Wafer,</hi> or <hi>receive as a little Child,</hi> that <hi>discerns the Lords Body,</hi> no
more then it does the repugnancies that are consequent to their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis

                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:40114:269"/>
Or to make another instance, when the Scripture says, <hi>God is a
Spirit,</hi> yet does also give him <hi>hands,</hi> and <hi>eyes,</hi> and <hi>ears,</hi> and <hi>wings,</hi>
and these of strange prodigious dimensions; neither tells us which
of these is <hi>proper</hi> and which <hi>figure:</hi> Here if Reason that can prove
God cannot be a Body, and cannot endure his God should be a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
shall be called in to pass sentence; they that make Philosophy
interpret Holy Writ in this case, and give the last resort to Reason,
do no more usurp or trespass on Religion, then they that make use of
Authors, or a Dictionary judge of the sense of any <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew</hi>
word in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding this we may not think the mysteries of Faith
are to be measured by the Rules of natural Reason, so to stand or fall
as they approve themselves to its discourse or Principles: for though
it be impossible that any Revelation can contradict right Reason
(truth cannot be inconsistent with truth:) yet it is very possible God
can reveal those truths which we have neither faculties analogal, nor
Principles or notions proportioned to, nor any natural ways of judging
or examining. And if those faculties which are not capable of cognisance
will judge; and judge of things removed from all our notices; (such as
Spiritual, Infinite, Eternal being is) and do it by principles gathered from
the information of our Sences, and by analogy with things of another
kind; corporeal finite things that are about us; reason need not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
how liable such judgments must be to mistakes; and how that
which we call repugnancy in one may have no place in the other. Here
therefore to submit ourunderstandings, and believe is but modest justice,
and to <hi>receive as Children what our Heavenly Father says.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore they that will presume to comprehend what ere
they are commanded to believe, and those that will believe nothing
but what they are able to comprehend, are alike insolent, if not
pernicious. 'Tis true God by the Gospel hath revealed and brought
to light many things which before appeared onely as he himself did
in the Temple, <hi>in a Cloud;</hi> namely concerning the <hi>Divine nature,
Persons, Properties, and the Eternal being,</hi> and the <hi>Incarnation of his
Son;</hi> but still, as God himself is said to do, these also <hi>dwell in Light,
that no man can approach unto.</hi> Which he that will needs gaze and
pry too near to, must be dazled into blindness, and be only so much
more in the dark. But he that proudly does conceit his little spark
of Reason can bear up with that Divinity of brightness, and enlighten
him to look through all those inaccessible discoveries, with <hi>Lucifers</hi>
assuming he hath reason to expect <hi>his</hi> fall. The<note n="a" place="margin">The School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> one of these that

the one that with his Pencil will presume to figure him <hi>who is the
brightness of Gods glory,</hi> and trace out the lineaments by which that

person on him,</hi> and the other that with a bold hand dashes out the
Person from the Nature; the one that will untie the knots of the
Hypostatick union; and the other that will cut them and the union
too asunder; the one that will needs prove by Reason whatsoever is
in Scripture, and the other that speaking of Christs Satisfaction, saith

                  <p>But these, as all extravagance is wont, are profited into much
worse: The one that would be proving, making reasons for, the
mysteries, often God knows framed only shadows, and the other
by their light of Reason being able to dispel and make those shadows
vanish, that so easie victory encouraged them to frame reasons
against, and to attaque the mysteries themselves; and then others
finding there was something that was taken to be reason not agreeing
with some chief heads of Religion, as they had been still received;
took occasion thence to conclude against the whole Religion; and by
scruples at some Articles taught themselves to dispute all the Creed;
and now a difficulty in one Doctrine makes the rest suspected, and
regarded onely as things made to amuse, and the unusual wording of
a Command is thought ground enough to turn all Christian duty into
Raillery.</p>
                  <p>For instance; If Christ intending by prescribing patience, to teach
men how to escape not onely from the guilt, and present torture
that a Spirit which will needs return each sleight offence is subject to,
but also from the future and eternal recompences of revenge, shall

when Religion does attempt to deal with men so, 'tis concluded
it designs to cozen them, as they think it does indeed, and is a
cheat, and all that minister about it are meer fourbes: And truly if
we rackt the Consciences of dying men, and if so be they would
give so much to this Cloyster or that Order promised them remission
of their sins, and worse than <hi>Judas,</hi> sold the purchase of Christs
Blood at those base rates, and betrayed the Redemption so, on Gods
name let them so account us; but if we do attempt on nothing but
mens vices, and would onely steal their Souls from Hell, and cheat
them into piety and blessedness, these we hope are very unreproachful
frauds. But alas! to talk to them of these after-things, of Heaven
and Hell is altogether as much liable to their contempt as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
are. If we tell them of a Resurrection to Judgment, and of
everlasting fire to punish wicked men, because their reason cannot
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40114:270"/>
comprehend how flame can hurt a Soul; or for the Body how devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
fire can repair the food it preys upon, that it may keep alive and
nourish torment to eternity; or how each man's peculiar dust that is
digested into several mens being and so become no one mans peculiar,
when it shall be also blended with the ashes of the Universe, can be
singled out and parted to its proper owner, when there are so many
own it, because their reason cannot comprehend all this, therefore
<hi>Scriptures lake of fire</hi> must be no more then the <hi>Poets Acheron;</hi> and
Resurrection was fram'd (as the apparition of a Ghost is wont to do)
to fright men meerly; and however 'tis attested Christ did never
rise, but all is fable: Thus from such premises as these our rational
disputing men conclude.</p>
                  <p>And here I shall not ask how these men dare presume, that if
there be a God who hath declar'd that he will bring such things to
pass, yet he must be unable to affect them, if they cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the manner how he does them; or be confident they can look
through those <hi>beams that come out of his hand,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hab. III. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>in which the hiding of
his Power is:</hi> But this I shall say to our men of reason, theirs is the
most unreasonable way of arguing in the world; to dispute against
plain matters of fact, the <hi>being and the Works of such and such so many
ages since,</hi> and witnessed by a greater testimony then the World can
shew for any other thing; and ever since appearing in their visible
and vast effects, <hi>as the Conversion, Suffering, Faith,</hi> of the whole Earth
almost. Now to attempt the confutation of such matter of fact by
reasonings drawn from difficulties in some things which those men
are witnessed to have deliver'd, or to conclude, that there can never
have been any such persons in the World, because they cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
all that those persons taught, or possibly because they can
take some occasions to buffoone on what they taught, is most ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.
Thus History must have been false, and several known
places not to have been, because the story hath been turn'd into
<hi>Burlesque:</hi> Thus he that with the Ancients cannot comprehend
how it is possible that there should be <hi>Antipodes,</hi> or the Earth can be
any thing but a plain flat, otherwise he thinks the inhabitants must
fall down to Heaven; may as rationally despise all the discoveries of
the Earth, assure himself our constant Navigations which perswade
us 'tis a Globe inhabited on both sides, bring home from the <hi>Indies</hi>
nothing else but false relations, and that indeed there are no <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not urge how Christianity approves it self even to the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the sober part of mankind; and the morality of it had the
suffrage of the World before it self appeared: For while the evidence
stands good, if the matter of fact be true, the Doctrine must be true,
and the commands obey'd: and to use such arguings to resell such
matter of fact is just like that which <hi>Zeno</hi> did attempt, namely,
by subtilties to prove it was impossible there could be any motion,
while another did disturb his Lecture by his motion up and down the
Schools; it is the same thing as to take a <hi>bowl</hi> to <hi>cut</hi> with, or the
<hi>vessels of the Danaid's to carry water</hi> in: For such reasonings are alike

And indeed these arguings are not the exceptions of reason, but
the struglings of mens vices against Religion. And it must be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
so many Thousands would give up their <hi>Bodies,</hi> rather then

broken pieces did remain;</hi> yet not so much because they know not how
their <hi>eating</hi> could <hi>nourish the victuals</hi> so, and <hi>make it grow;</hi> as because
they are angry with the worker of the miracle, who forbids and
upbraids the excesses of their luxury, which can easily, and does
daily consume the price of that that would suffice 5000, without
miracle on 5 single persons; and all that when 'tis drest according to
the modern mode of eating well, dissolved, turned into juyces, and
exalted into the Elixir of the Epicure, shall leave, alas! no broken
pieces for the Alms-basket: This is the quarrel; this does make the
miracle impossible. And yet methinks upon the same account they
should allow,<note place="margin">John II. 6. 7.</note> that at a feast he turned so many <hi>pots of water into wine,</hi>
because that seems to gratifie the thirsts of their intemperance. In
fine, we do not live as men prepared or willing to be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all our doings, therefore we have no mind to rise again to
give it: When we are thus minded, it is not hard to meet with
difficulties that encourage the opinion that we shall not rise. Which
difficulties when we look into, we cannot find how it is possible we
can be raised, and 'tis easie then to think we cannot, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
especially when it is our will and interest to think so; and
then it must be false whatever is in Scripture that we shall. These
are the processes of those that reason against Christianity, such the
grounds that they dispute upon: But their reasons are but Sophisms
of lust and interest, which will guild and paint whatever they are
much in love with, and it is no wonder they find colours for it, and
can think them reasons, for they always did so against present evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
conviction. When <hi>Moses</hi> by his miracles endeavoured to let
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> know who was the Lord, and to persuade him to let Israel
go; while <hi>God</hi> permitted the<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. VII. 11, 13, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Magicians</hi> to counterfeit those miracles,
it lookt like reasonable indeed that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> should not be convinced;
but when they could not immitate, but did confess<note n="b" place="margin">Exod. VIII. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>the finger of the
Lord,</hi> and<note n="c" place="margin">Exod. IX. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>themselves suffered those plagues which they could not either
conjure up or down;</hi> then if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will not be persuaded, 'tis plain
nothing but his interest, not the wonders which were brought by
the Magicians, were the reasons that prevailed with him; for those
were not reasons against more and greater miracles; yet they were
effectual with him to the destruction of himself and his nation.
Again when they who knew the mighty works <hi>Christ</hi> did, and were
<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 24. 29.</note> forewarned by him <hi>of false Christs and false Prophets, that would come
with signs and lying wonders;</hi> God allowing Sathan leave to struggle
at his last gasp, and to make a blaze when he was to <hi>fall from heaven
as lightning,</hi> but far beneath <hi>the glory of his onely begotten Son:</hi> when
they who knew both these, chose yet to follow a <hi>Barchocab,</hi> a false

such strict mortifying Doctrines, nor onely with the thin encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of after-expectations as <hi>Christ</hi> did, for he gave them hopes of

by the comparison of the several signs that <hi>Christ</hi> and this <hi>Barchocab</hi>
wrought, the onely reasons that gave efficacy to that sleight im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture,
and did make it over-power <hi>Christs</hi> mighty works, was their
earthly desires and affections which <hi>Christs</hi> severe Doctrines could not

more <hi>Tertullian</hi> challenging the Heathen says, <hi>Produce before your
judgment-seats some, whom you will, of those who are inspired by any of
your Gods, when gaping ore the Altar they have in its fumes (according to
their custom) taken in the Deity 'till they are great with it,</hi> &amp; ructando
conantur, <hi>while they are in travel with him, as it were, have belching
throws, that they burst almost 'till they are delivered of the inspiration:
while it is thus, let but any Christian adjure them by the name of Christ,
and if the spirits that they are possest with do not presently confess that they
are Devils,</hi> ibidem illius Christiani procacissimi sanguinem fundite,
<hi>let the sawcy petulant Christian lose his life.</hi> He speaks of this as a known
frequent trial. And <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> says, their chiefest Gods have
been forced out of their Votaries, and acknowledged they were evil
spirits. Now here was reason and experience; the miracle was so
evident, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> braging says, <hi>do not believe it if your eyes and
ears can suffer you;</hi> and the reason was more pressing then the fact,
Nec enim Divinitas deputanda est quae fubdita esthomini, <hi>it being most
impossible that that should be a God which a man could rule and triumph over,</hi>
so imperiously manage him, as with a bare command to force him
from his hold, and make him shame himself so villainously before
both his adorers and his enemies, as to say, <hi>He was a Devil.</hi> Yet
the Heathens still found colours to do out all this conviction; and
their old acquaintance with their Gods, together with the Custom
of their vicious Worships, had more force with them then miracle
and reason. And while the Christian dispossest their Deities, he was
himself turned out of all his own possessions; and although he made
their God confess himself a Devil, yet still poor he was made to suffer
as a malefactour.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis not strange if men now stick as closely to their <hi>vices,</hi> as
those did to the <hi>Gods</hi> that patronized them, and it be as hard to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcise
the Devil out of their affections and practices, as it was then
out of Heathen Votaries or Temples. They are as fierce against the
Christian Religion for their lusts sake, as those for their <hi>Venus,</hi> and
the very same account that made those Heathen Customs, or the
lying wonders of false Christs, or <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Magicians sings, be more
persuasive then the other more real miracles; namely, because they
sided with their inclinations and interests. This very account makes
little difficulties (which Almighty God hath left in our Religion, as
he suffered signs and lying wonders heretofore, for trials) yea, makes
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40114:272"/>
cavils, mere exceptions, pass for reasons most invincible, be disputed,
urg'd with great concern and passion, against all those methods of
conviction which God hath afforded Christianity.</p>
                  <p>Now if this be to <hi>receive Religion as a little Child,</hi> 'tis with the
<hi>frowardness of Children,</hi> when they are displeas'd or ill at ease; who
resist and quarrel with the thing that is to make them well or please
them, and return the Parents cares to ease and quiet them with
little outrages and vexing. And <hi>do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish
people and unwise? Is not he thy Father that hath bought thee? Hath he
not made thee and established thee? Ask thy Father and he will shew thee,
thy Elders and they will tell thee,</hi> Deut. 32. 6, 7. Now have Children
any other way to know their Parents, then to let their Father shew
them, and their Elders tell them? Or should we cast off the relation
and renounce all the obedience due to it, because we are not sure of
it our selves? For ought we know those may not be our Parents, we
have only testimony for it: Thus we serve our God on that account;
and yet <hi>Hath he not made thee and established thee?</hi> As he began us, so
did he not nurse and bear us in his arms, and carry us in all our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and difficulties, 'till he brought us up to a full strength? 'Till
by a miraculous and signal providence he had establisht, settled us?
and after all these cares bestowed upon us, do we prove a generation
of vipers onely, such as do requite the bowels that did bear and
nourish them, by preying on them and consuming them? Or like
the of-spring of a Spider, who, when he hath spent himself with
weaving nets,<note place="margin">Arist. hist. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim. <hi>l. 5. c.</hi> 27. Plin. nat. hist. <hi>l. 11. c.</hi> 24.</note> and working of them into labyrinths, to be the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
and the defences of his brood, to catch them prey, and to secure
them; then the strongest of his young ones, when he is by these his
cares establisht and grown ripe to destroy, makes those threads fatal
to his parent, which he spun out of his bowels to be thread of life to
him. And shall we be such Children to our Father that establisht
us? Make all his plenties turn to poison in us, and invenome us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
himself? make his miraculous mercies furnish us for the abuse
and provocation of him? His blest Providence serve only to afford
us arguments against it self; help to confute it self because it hath so
prospered, doth still suffer us? but after all this, <hi>is he not thy Father
that hath bought thee?</hi> who to all his titles to us, his endearing obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
notwithstanding our despites and provocations of them;
yet did give the life of his own Son to purchase o're again the same
relation to us, that we might have right to the inheritance of his
Kingdom: And then however we have hitherto affronted, let us be
content now to be bought and hir'd,<note place="margin">Rom. VIII. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>to receive that Kingdom of God
as his Children; for if Children then heirs; heirs of God, and joynt heirs
with Christ,</hi> who died to make us Kings and Priests to God and his

there be any Holy Ghost,</hi> any extraordinary effusions of the Spirit,
whether he do come down in Gifts and Afflations, such as we know
were usual in the first Jewish Temple, but have not been for a

those <hi>Three One Persons;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 12. 20.</note> but they set the <hi>same Person</hi> against <hi>himself</hi>

to do in their foundation: If I had said more, I could have brought
the <hi>Popes</hi> own <hi>Seal</hi> for evidence; where not only both are, but Saint

himself had inflicted on offenders in the <hi>Churches</hi> he had planted.
<hi>Powers these,</hi> which by such <hi>steps</hi> and by <hi>degrees</hi> of separation an <hi>Apostle</hi>
himself receives, and does not execute 'till he ascend the <hi>highest,</hi>
that which they have a <hi>new</hi> solemnity ordain'd from <hi>Heaven</hi> to enstate

                  <p>The <hi>separateness</hi> of this <hi>highest order</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> is a doctrine
handed down to us both by the <hi>writings</hi> of all Ages and the <hi>practices;</hi>
(two things, which as they scarcely do concur in such a visible degree
in any other things in our Religion, so also when they do concur,
they make and secure <hi>tradition</hi> beyond all contradiction, give it
sufficient <hi>infallibility:</hi> and truly he that does refuse the evidence which
such tradition gives to all the motives of believing <hi>Christianity,</hi> if he
be not a <hi>Socinian,</hi> he must be an <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> and can receive his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
only from <hi>Revelation.</hi>) Now the matter of fact of this <hi>tradition</hi>
is a subject for <hi>Volumes,</hi> not for a discourse, and it hath filled so many,
that there is nothing left unsaid, or to be said against, as to the main:
And they that pick some little sayings seeming against this order out
of those <hi>Ancients</hi> which were themselves of it, and wrote much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40114:279"/>
for it, and think by those means to confute it, do the same
thing with that <hi>Romanist,</hi> who tore some little shreds, that look as if
they favour'd some opinions of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> out of the Books of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
most of which were directly writ against the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi>
and putting those together went about by them to convince the world
there never were any such things as <hi>Protestants,</hi> but they that did
profess to be so were all <hi>Papists.</hi>

                  <p>First, Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s work was to <hi>Preach the Gospel,</hi> and we find
him doing it from this time forward to his End. The <hi>high Priest</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Acts 7. 1.</note> Indeed the Case now is not like Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s, the <hi>Gospel</hi>

wherein they will not indure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts shall
they heap to themselves teachers.</hi> He therefore that is in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s place
must heap up <hi>Reproofs</hi> and <hi>Exhortations;</hi> or he must heap <hi>good sound

the foul tinctures of a <hi>scandalous life,</hi> nor the Corrosive infusions of
<hi>Schismatical</hi> and <hi>turbulent opinions.</hi> He that caters thus for his flock,
and provides such as by doctrine and by practice do instruct them
<hi>to live quiet and peaceable lives in all godliness and honesty;</hi> He, like the

1 Cor. 12. 18. It was so in the Law; when
God went to divide part of <hi>Moses</hi> burthen of Government amongst
the Lxx, <hi>he came down and took off the Spirit that was upon him, and
gave it to the Lxx, Num.</hi> 11. 25. A work this that may have reason
to supersede much of that which I <hi>first</hi> mentioned: For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Assistances of Spirit, he does reckon that
<hi>care that came upon him daily from the Churches</hi> amongst his <hi>persecutions,</hi>
and it <hi>summes up</hi> his Catalogue of <hi>sufferings,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. Such various
Necessities there are by which <hi>Government</hi> is <hi>distracted,</hi> and knows
not how to temper it self to them. For sometimes it must <hi>condescend: Paul</hi> notwithstanding <hi>Apostolical decrees</hi> made in full Council that
abrogated Circumcision, (<hi>as the Holy Ghost had declared it void be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>)
yet is fain to comport so far with the violent humours of a
party as to Circumcise <hi>Timothy,</hi> at the very same time when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
those decrees to the <hi>Churches</hi> to keep, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 3, 4. yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
when Circumcision was lookt on as <hi>Engagement to the whole</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">[That sense he puts upon it in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Galathians, <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 3.]</note> 
                     <hi>Law,</hi> and to grant them that one thing, was but to teach them to
ask more, and to be able to deny them nothing; then he <hi>suffers not</hi>
Titus <hi>to be Circumcised, nor gave place to them by submission, no not for
an hour,</hi> Gal. 2. 3, 5. Thus the <hi>Spirit of Government</hi> is sometimes a
<hi>Spirit of meekness,</hi> does it work by <hi>soft yieldings,</hi> and breaks the
Adamant with <hi>Cushions</hi> which <hi>Anvils</hi> would not do: The <hi>Ocean</hi> with
daily billows and tides, helpt on with storms of violence, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by tempests of roaring fury, assaults a rock for many Ages;
and yet makes not the least impression on it, but is beat back, and
made retire in empty some, in insignificant passion: when a few
single drops that distil gently down upon a rock though of Marble,
or a small trickle of water that only wets and glides over the stone,
insinuate themselves into it, and soften it so as to steal themselves a
passage through it. and yet <hi>Government</hi> hath a <hi>rod</hi> too, which like
<hi>Moses</hi>'s can break the <hi>rock,</hi> and fetch a stream out of the heart of
quarre; and which must be used also: The <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> himself <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
tempest</hi> when he came, blew in a <hi>mighty boisterous Wind:</hi> nor does
he always whisper soft things, he came down first in <hi>a sound from heaven,</hi>
and spoke <hi>thunder;</hi> nor did it want <hi>lightning,</hi> the <hi>tongue was double flame.</hi>
Of <hi>some we knowwe must have a Compassion, but others must be saved with
terror,</hi> Jude 22. 23. which drives me on to the last piece of their work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Censures of the Church,</hi> the burthen of the <hi>Keys;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> which (passing
by the private use of them in voluntary penitences, and discipline
upon the sick) as they signifie <hi>publick exclusion out of the Church</hi> for
scandalous Enormities, and <hi>re-admission into it</hi> upon repentance,
have been sufficiently evinc'd to belong to the <hi>Governours of the Church.</hi>
The Exercise of these is so much their <hi>work</hi> that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls them
<hi>the Weapons of their spiritual Warfare, by which they do cast down imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and every high things that exalteth it self against the Knowledge
of God, and bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ,</hi>
2 Cor. 10. 4, 5. A <hi>blessed victory</hi> even for the <hi>Conquered;</hi> and these
the only <hi>Weapons</hi> to atchieve it with. If those who sin scandalously,
and will not hear the admonitions of the <hi>Church,</hi> were cast out of the
<hi>Church;</hi> if not <hi>Religion, Reputation</hi> would restrain them somewhat:
Not to be thought <hi>fit Company for Christians</hi> would surely make them
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:40114:281"/>
                     <hi>proud</hi> against their Vices. Shame, the design'd Effect of these <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi>
hath great pungencies, the fear of it does goad men into actions
of the greatest hazard, and the most unacceptable; such as have
nothing lovely in them, but are wholly distastful. There is a Sin
whose face is <hi>bloody dismal,</hi> and yet because tis countenanc'd by the
<hi>Roysting Ruffian</hi> part of the World, men will defie <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
Man's</hi> and <hi>God's Law,</hi> venture the ruine of all that is belov'd
and dear to them in this World, and assault <hi>death,</hi> and charge
and take <hi>Hell</hi> by violence; rather then be <hi>asham'd</hi> before those <hi>valiant
sinners, Satans Hectors:</hi> and, they must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if they do not go boldly on upon the sin, is of more force
with them than all the indearments of this World, than all their
fear of <hi>God,</hi> and Death, and that which follows. Now if <hi>Religion</hi>
could but get such Countenance by the <hi>Censures</hi> of the Church;
and every open sinner had this certain fear, I should be turn'd out
of all Christian company, shall be avoided as unfit for Conversation;
would it not have in some degree the like effect? and if the motive
beas much exactly, would not men be <hi>chast</hi> or <hi>sober</hi> or <hi>obedient</hi> for that
very reason for which they will now be <hi>kill'd</hi> and be <hi>damn'd?</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all question Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Censure</hi> on the <hi>intemperate,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.
must needs be reformation to him: 'Tis such a sentence to the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,
not to company with him, whose Vice is nothing but the
<hi>sauce of Company;</hi> and who does sin against his <hi>Body</hi> and against his
<hi>faculties</hi> and against his <hi>Conscience,</hi> is <hi>sick,</hi> and is a <hi>Sott,</hi> and goes
to <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Hell</hi> meerly for <hi>Societies sake.</hi> Now the infliction of these <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>
is so much the work to which Church-governours are call'd
by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> that they are equally call'd by him to <hi>it</hi> and to
<hi>Himself;</hi> both are alike bestow'd upon them: <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost,
whose sins ye retain they are retained,</hi> John 20. 22. And in the first
derivations of this office, it was performed with <hi>severities,</hi> such as
this Age I doubt will not believe, and when they had no <hi>temporal</hi>
sword to be auxiliary to these <hi>Spiritual weapons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now to make reflections on this is not for me to undertake,
in such a state of the Church as ours is; wherein the very <hi>faults</hi> of
some do give them an <hi>Indemnity,</hi> who having drawn themselves
<hi>out of the Church,</hi> from under its authority, are also got <hi>out of the
power of its Censures:</hi> So Children that do run away from their <hi>Fathers
house,</hi> they do escape the <hi>Rod;</hi> but they do not consider that withal
they run away from the <hi>inheritance:</hi> And many times in those that do
not do so, but stay within the family; long intermission of the <hi>Rod,</hi> and
<hi>indulg'd license</hi> makes them too big and heady to be brought under
<hi>discipline.</hi> And is't not so with us? Among many of those that stay
within the <hi>Church,</hi> (I know not whether I do well to say so, when
of these I mean there is little other Evidence of their doing so but
this, that they will <hi>swear</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> of the <hi>Churches side;</hi> blessed <hi>Sons</hi>
of a <hi>demolished Church,</hi> who think to raise their <hi>Mother</hi> a <hi>Temple</hi> by
<hi>throwing stones at her:</hi>) by reason of the late overthrow of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and <hi>discipline,</hi> and the <hi>consequent licences, Vice</hi> hath been so
nurst up, not only by an universal, barefac'd, uncorrected practice;
but by <hi>principles</hi> of liberty, that can dispute down all <hi>Ecclesiastical
restraints,</hi> and have set up the <hi>Religion of License:</hi> that now sin is
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40114:281"/>
grown so outragious, as to be too strong for <hi>discipline;</hi> nay rather
than it should be set up, 'tis to be feared they would endeavour to
reverse all in the <hi>Church,</hi> and enterprise as much in their <hi>vices</hi>
quarrel, as others have done for <hi>mistaken Religion.</hi> And indeed to
what purpose were the <hi>Censures,</hi> whose <hi>first</hi> and <hi>medicinal</hi> effect is
<hi>shame,</hi> amongst men, where 'tis in very many instances the <hi>only
shameful</hi> thing <hi>not to be vitious;</hi> where men stand <hi>candidates</hi> for the
reputation of <hi>glorious sinners,</hi> take to themselves <hi>sins</hi> they have <hi>not
committed,</hi> that are <hi>not theirs,</hi> and <hi>usurp</hi> Vice; <hi>sins</hi> and <hi>damnations
hypocrites?</hi> What work is here for <hi>discipline?</hi> But this state wants not
precedents; the <hi>censures of the Church</hi> were not only lay'd aside in
the Vastations of the <hi>Arian</hi> heresie and persecution; when the <hi>weapons
of the Churches warfare</hi> were too weak to make defence against all their
cruelties and impieties: and before that in <hi>Diocletian</hi>'s days against
the <hi>Lapsi:</hi> But we find also that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is forc'd to break out
only in a passionate wish, <gap reason="foreign">

cut off that trouble you (cut off by excommunication</hi> he means) <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 12.
When he saw the ill humours were too spreading, and too tough
also; <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Sehisme,</hi> wide and obstinate; so that neither his
authority could reach, nor his methods cure, but were more likely
to exasperate them: Then he does <hi>excommunicate</hi> them only in <hi>desire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And again, 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 6. And having in a readiness to revenge all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience

one that hath <hi>good Will for Sion,</hi> to labour to fulfill his own obedience,
that so the <hi>Church</hi> may be empower'd to use <hi>Christ's Method</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of the rest. And thet that will not do so, must know they
shall not only answer for their <hi>sins,</hi> but for <hi>refusing to be sav'd</hi> from
them, that they <hi>resist</hi> all medicine, as men resolv'd that nothing
shall be done towards their Cure, as men that rather choose to
perish, and prefer destruction. And for the <hi>seasons</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of
putting this <hi>work</hi> into Execution, Wisdom must be implor'd from
that <hi>Spirit of Wisdom</hi> that <hi>calls</hi> unto this work: The last Part;
<hi>Whereunto I have called them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Nature of the <hi>calling of the Holy Ghost</hi> is a Subject that would
bear a full discourse. But waving those pretensions which <hi>Necessity,</hi>
and <hi>inward incitation</hi> do make to be the <hi>Calls of the Holy Ghost</hi> I shall
positively set down that the <hi>call</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> to
any <hi>Work</hi> or <hi>Office,</hi> (for I enquire not of his calling, to a <hi>privilege
or state of favour,</hi>) is his <hi>giving abilities</hi> and <hi>gifts</hi> qualifying for that
<hi>Work</hi> or <hi>Office:</hi> The call <hi>immediate</hi> when the gifts were <hi>so,</hi> but <hi>mediate</hi>
and <hi>ordinary,</hi> when the abilities are given in his <hi>blessing</hi> on our
<hi>ordinary labours.</hi> 'Tis so in every sort of things, Exod. 31. 2. <hi>See
I have call'd Bezaleel, and I have fill'd him with the Spirit of God in
Wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner
of Workmanship, to devise cunning works, and to work in all manner of
Workmanship; and behold I have given him</hi> Aholiab, <hi>and in the hearts
of all that are wise-hearted I have put Wisdom, that they may make all
that I have commanded thee:</hi> And he repeats the same again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.
30. adding that <hi>he hath put in his heart that he may teach both he and</hi>
Aholiab; so that giving this skill to <hi>work</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> is nam'd <hi>Gods
calling.</hi> So in another case, the <hi>Lord</hi> does say of <hi>Cyrus, I have call'd
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40114:282"/>
him,</hi> Esay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 48. 15. which he explains in the 49. I have <hi>holden him
by my right hand to subdue Nations before him, to loose the loyns of Kings,
I have girded him,</hi> So when <hi>Isaiah saith, the Lord hath call'd me from

how, <hi>ver. 5. he form'd me</hi> and prepared me <hi>from the Womb to be his
servant, to bring</hi> Jacob <hi>to him.</hi> And throughout the <hi>New Testament,</hi>
as his Call to a <hi>privilege</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, his gifts ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
for it.</p>
                  <p>The Gifts of these <hi>Apostles</hi> by which they were enabled for
their <hi>Office,</hi> and which made up their <hi>call,</hi> are set down: Those
of <hi>Barnabas</hi> in the fore-cited 11 <hi>Act. He was a good man, full
of faith, and of the Holy Ghost;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>call</hi> was a little <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</hi>
If we look into times, we shall find reason to believe
those Revelations in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. were given to <hi>Paul</hi> a little before this
<hi>consecration</hi> of him in the Text. That Epistle was writ, saith <hi>Baronius,</hi>
in the second year of <hi>Nero,</hi> and this separation was in the second of
<hi>Claudius,</hi> as may be gathered also in some measure from the <hi>famine</hi>
mention'd in the 28th verse of the 11th chap. betwixt these two were
<hi>fourteen years:</hi> now saith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he wrote that, <hi>he had his revelation somewhat above</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">ab annis qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuordecim, saith the Arab.</note> 14. <hi>years before;</hi> a little therefore before
this solemnity. Here was a <hi>call</hi> indeed, call'd up to the <hi>third heaven</hi>
to receive instructions for his Office, and for ought he did know,
call'd out of his own body too, that he might be the fitter for it;
<hi>whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell, God knows,</hi> v. 2.
and that again, v. 3. They whom <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> qualifies for <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration</hi>
to <hi>separate</hi> to these diviner Offices may be stil'd <hi>Angels</hi> well,
when they are call'd from all regards or notices of any body that
belongs to them; their gifts and graces set them above the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of flesh: In the entertainment of these qualifications the Soul
is swallowed up so, that it cannot take cognizance whether it have
a body of its own, and is not sensible of that deer partner of it self,
it is so onely sensible of this Employment. 'Tis not for an <hi>Apostle</hi>
(or for his <hi>Successor</hi>) to think of things below with much compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency:
When these have all their uses, all their glories on, they
but make pomp to dress the body; which an <hi>Apostle</hi> does not design
for, nor knows whether he be concern'd at all in. He becomes
something <hi>without a body,</hi> and <hi>above the Earth,</hi> who for a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
must be <hi>taken up</hi> to <hi>Paradise,</hi> and <hi>call'd</hi> from all <hi>commerce</hi> and
all <hi>intelligence with his own body.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>call'd from Heaven</hi> to
preach the Gospel; but he was <hi>call'd to Heaven</hi> to qualifie him for
this higher <hi>separation,</hi> to an <hi>Apostle</hi> and Church-Governour.</p>
                  <p>And now you <hi>see your calling,</hi> Holy Fathers: And to pass by such
obvious unconcerning observations as at first sight follow, that those
who are not qualified are not call'd; I shall only take notice hence
of the <hi>counter-part</hi> of this call, the charge <hi>God</hi> takes upon him,
when he calls to this charge; and that is, he <hi>owns</hi> and will <hi>protect</hi>
whom himself <hi>calls.</hi> 'Twas that he promised to the <hi>Founder</hi> and <hi>God</hi>
of your <hi>Order; I the Lord have call'd thee, and I will hold thine hand,
and I will keep thee,</hi> Isai. 42. 6. And when he said of <hi>Cyrus, I have
call'd him,</hi> he said also, <hi>be shall make his way prosperous,</hi> Isai. 48. 15.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40114:282"/>
And so he shall be the way what it will; for thus he said to <hi>Jacob,
I have called thee, when thou goest through the Water I am with thee, and
through the rivers they shall not overflow thee,</hi> Isai. 43. 1, 2. There
was Experience of all this in one of the chief <hi>Princes</hi> of your Order;
when the <hi>Apostles</hi> were scarce safe within their <hi>Ship,</hi> they were so
toss'd with waves and fears,<note place="margin">Math. 14. 28.</note>
yet if our <hi>Lord</hi> will <hi>call</hi> him, <hi>Peter</hi> is confident he shall be safe even <hi>in the Sea; Lord,<note place="margin">29.</note> if it be thou, bid me
come unto thee on the Water,</hi> saith he; and the <hi>Lord</hi> did but call him,
and he went down and walked on the water safely: As if the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
billows did only lift themselves to meet his steps, and raise him
up from sinking.<note place="margin">31.</note> And when his own doubts, which alone could,
were neer drowning him, and he but <hi>call'd the Lord; immediately he
stretched out his hand and caught him:</hi> He answers his <hi>call,</hi> if we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<hi>ours;</hi> if we <hi>obey</hi> when he says <hi>come,</hi> then will he come and
save when we call to him.<note place="margin">ibid.</note> And so <hi>Peter</hi> receiv'd no hurt,
but a rebuke; <hi>O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?</hi> couldst thou
imagin I would not sustein thee in the doing what I bid thee do? In
answering my call? But why seek we experience of so old a date? There is a more encouraging miracle in <hi>these late calls themselves.</hi>
Had God sustein'd the <hi>Order</hi> in its <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>dignities</hi> amidst those
waves that rack'd the Church of late, it had been prodigy of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserved
Compassion to our Nation: But whenas all was sunk, to
bid the Sea give up what it had <hi>swallowed</hi> and <hi>consumed;</hi> this is more
than to catch a <hi>sinking Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 19. 20.</note>
or to save a <hi>falling Church.</hi> The work of <hi>Resurrection</hi> is emphatically call'd the <hi>working of God's mighty power,</hi>
and does out-sound that of his <hi>ordinary conservation.</hi> And truly 'twas
almost as easie to imagination, how the <hi>scattered Atomes</hi> of mens
dust should <hi>order</hi> themselves, and <hi>reunite,</hi> and <hi>close</hi> into <hi>one flesh;</hi>
as that the <hi>parcels</hi> of our <hi>Discipline</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> that were lost in such
a wild confusion, and the <hi>Offices buried</hi> in the rubbish of the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht
Churches, should <hi>rise again</hi> in so much <hi>order</hi> and <hi>beauty. Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
non poterant tect a probare Deum.</hi> This <hi>calling</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is like
that when the <hi>Spirit</hi> moved upon the face of the <hi>abyss;</hi> and call'd
all things out of their <hi>no-seeds</hi> there; or like the call of the <hi>last Trump.</hi>
Thus by the miraculous mercies of these calls <hi>God</hi> hath provided for
our <hi>hopes,</hi> and warranted our <hi>faith</hi> of his protections! yet he hath
also sent us more security, hath given us a <hi>Constantine,</hi> if his own
be not a <hi>greater Name,</hi> and more deserving of the Church; for which
(it is well known to some) he did <hi>contrive</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> when he could
neither plot nor hope for his own <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and did with passion
labour a <hi>succession</hi> in your <hi>Order,</hi> when he did not know how to lay
designs for the <hi>Succession</hi> of <hi>himself</hi> or <hi>any of his Fathers</hi> house to his
own <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Dignity.</hi> Nor is the secular arm all your security:
<hi>God</hi> himself hath set yet more guards about his <hi>consecrated</hi> ones, he
hath severe things for the violaters of them: <hi>Moses,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 12. 3, 20, 10.</note> the <hi>meekest man
upon the Earth,</hi> that in his life was never angry, but once at the <hi>rebellious;</hi> seems very passionate in calling Vengeance on those that
stir against these holy Offices. <hi>Smite through the loins of all that rise
against them, and of them that hate them,<note place="margin">Deut. 33. 11.</note> that they rise not again:</hi> The <hi>loins</hi> (we know) are the <hi>nest of posterity;</hi> so that, strike through the
<hi>loins,</hi> is, stab the <hi>succession,</hi> destroy at once all the <hi>posterity</hi> of them
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40114:283"/>
that would cut off this <hi>Tribe,</hi> and hinder its <hi>Succession.</hi> Nor was this
<hi>Legal Spirit; Gospel</hi> is as severe. Those in Saint <hi>Jude</hi> that despise
these <hi>Governours,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 16. 3.</note> that do as <hi>Corah</hi> and his Complices did, (who <hi>gathered themselves against</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>and said, You take too

the prefixing your <hi>Name</hi> to

would look rather like <hi>revenge</hi> than <hi>homage</hi>
or <hi>obedience:</hi> If I did not know that <hi>low</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
are due to the transcendency of
such a <hi>subject</hi> as I then discours'd upon,

and such a <hi>Patron</hi> as I now Dedicate to:
So I lie <hi>prostrate</hi> under my <hi>great Arguments,</hi>
here <hi>insufficiency</hi> is <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick.</hi> And
the truth is, <hi>My Lord,</hi> it was not this
which made me so sollicitous to avoid
your injunctions, but apprehensions of the
unusefulness of the Discourse it self.</p>
                  <p>When God's most signal methods of all
sorts do not seem to have wrought much
conviction; when neither our own dismal
guilts, nor miseries, nor most express
miracles of deliverance have made us sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
but after the equally stupendous
Thirtieth of <hi>January</hi> and Twenty Ninth of
<hi>May,</hi> and the black time that interven'd;
we are still the same <hi>perverse untractable</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
when <hi>luxury</hi> is the retribution made
for <hi>plenty, license</hi> for <hi>liberty,</hi> and <hi>Atheism</hi> for
<hi>Religion,</hi> whil'st <hi>miracles</hi> of <hi>mercy</hi> are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
only by <hi>prodigies</hi> of <hi>ingrateful disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:</hi>
And on the other side, when <hi>factious</hi>
humours swell against all <hi>Laws,</hi> as they
would either <hi>over-flow</hi> those mounds, or
make them <hi>yield</hi> and <hi>give way</hi> to them; when
<hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> which <hi>infallible</hi> when
they came only from a <hi>party</hi> of a <hi>part</hi> of
a <hi>Parliament,</hi> are neither of <hi>force</hi> nor <hi>esteem</hi>
when they have all <hi>solemnity</hi> and obligation
that <hi>just</hi> and <hi>full authority</hi> can give; alas,
what hopes of doing any thing can a

                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>HOSEA III. 5.</bibl>
                     <q>Afterward shall the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> return, and
seek the Lord their God, and <hi>David</hi> their King,
and shall fear the Lord and his goodness.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>HE has said in the words before, that <hi>the Children of</hi> Israel
<hi>shall abide many days without a King and without a Prince,
without a Sacrifice and without an Image or Altar, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an Ephod and without Teraphim.</hi> Now when they
shall have been for many years in such a state of helpless desolation,
shall have no <hi>King</hi> under whose shadow they, their Laws and
Rights, might hope for shelter; no <hi>Prince</hi> to guard them from
the sad calamities of wild confusion or usurping violence; shall
have <hi>no exercises of Religion</hi> to allay and soften those calamities, and
give them comfort in the bearing of them; <hi>no Altar</hi> to lay hold on
for security against them, or to stretch out their hands towards,
for deprecation of them; <hi>no</hi> nor a <hi>God</hi> to put an end to this sad
state; nor any <hi>means of direction</hi> what to do under it, <hi>no Ephod</hi> to
ask Counsel at; nor yet the <hi>pageantry,</hi> the <hi>fallacy</hi> of these, <hi>no Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim</hi>
for <hi>Ephods,</hi> nor <hi>Image</hi> for a <hi>God;</hi> the same destruction having
seized <hi>these</hi> and their <hi>worshippers,</hi> the <hi>people</hi> and their <hi>Idols</hi> going
into Captivity together, and the <hi>only true God</hi> having forsaken them:
Now when the <hi>Prophet</hi> had denounc'd this state of Woe, which
was to dwell with them so long as that their very expectations
of deliverance should be dying, having continued <hi>threescore</hi> years
and <hi>ten,</hi> a longer and more wearisome age of <hi>patience</hi> then <hi>life,</hi> he
then proceeds to sweeten all by telling them of a <hi>return,</hi> and what
things they shall do in it; and they are three.</p>

                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:40114:287"/>
First, <hi>Seek the Lord their God,</hi> apply themselves to his Worship
and Obedience, and cleave to him; for so the word is rendred

words it, <hi>shall serve the Lord their God, and</hi> David <hi>their King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which is the <hi>second</hi> thing they were to do. As the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi>
state was to be setled, so the <hi>secular</hi> too upon its just foundations,
<hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Loyalty</hi> both running in their ancient current.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>They shall fear the Lord and his goodness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Not only trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
before him, who is the <hi>Lord,</hi> that did exert his power in their
destruction; but shall much more revere his <hi>goodness,</hi> that did flow
out in such plentiful miraculous expresses of deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Now these being not only <hi>prophecy</hi> what in that juncture they
would do, nor only <hi>duties</hi> what they were to do, but also <hi>counsels</hi>
and <hi>directions immediately</hi> from <hi>God</hi> what they were best to do, the
only prudent and safe course according to the policies of heaven;
the direct view of these particulars in reference to that state of theirs
is not an unconcerning prospect at this season, which is the <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary</hi>
of an equal return; and therefore I shall lay them so before
you, and the reflection on them in our practice shall make the
application.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>They shall seek the Lord their God</hi> is my first part, and the Lord's
prime direction for the repairing of a broken Nation. Neither
indeed can any other course be taken; for 'till we have found him,
while he does <hi>hide his face,</hi> nothing but <hi>darkness</hi> dwells upon the
land; or if any <hi>light</hi> do break out, 'tis but the <hi>kindlings</hi> of his
anger: So he expresses, <hi>Deut. 31. 17. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> people will forsake me
and break my Covenant, then my anger shall be kindled against them,
and I will forsake them, and hide my face from them, and they shall
be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them, so that they
will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us because our God is
not amongst us?</hi> This absence is only another word for <hi>desclation:
Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem,</hi> saith God by <hi>Jeremy,</hi> c. 6. 8. <hi>lest
my soul depart from thee, and I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited:</hi>
As if without him there were nothing else but solitude in Cities
and in Courts, and all were desart where he does not dwell. Yea
there is something beyond desolation, <hi>Hos. 9. 11, 12. As for</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,
<hi>their glory shall flee away like a bird from the birth and from
the womb, and from the Conception: though they bring up their Children,
yet I will bereve them that there shall not be a man,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>yea wo
also to them when I depart from them.</hi> And it must needs be so;
for let our state be never so calamitous, if God be <hi>not departed,</hi>
there is <hi>comfort</hi> in it,<note place="margin">Psal. 44. 19.</note> and a <hi>deliverer</hi> at hand: If we are in the
place of Dragons, his presence will make heaven there; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we be covered with the shadow of death, if the light of
his Countenance break in, we are in <hi>glory;</hi> and the brightness
of that will soon damp and shine out the fiery Trial. But if the
<hi>Lord</hi> depart, then there is no redemption possible; <hi>God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
him, persecute him and take him, for there is none to deliver him,</hi>
Psal. 71. 11. But if there were deliverance some other way, yet the
want of <hi>God's presence</hi> is an evil, such as nothing in the whole
world can make good: The presence of an <hi>Angel</hi> in his stead does
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40114:287"/>
not. When the Lord said to <hi>Israel, I will not go up in the midst of thee,
but I will send an Angel with thee, and drive out the</hi> Amorite, <hi>the</hi>
Hittite, <hi>&amp;c. yet when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d,
and man did put on his Ornaments,</hi> Exod. 33. 4. Nay more, I shall not
speak a <hi>contradiction</hi> if I shall say, that the most intimate presence of
the <hi>Godhead</hi> does not supply God's absence; and such a small with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
of himself as may consist with being united hypostatically,
was too much for him to bear, who was <hi>Immanuel</hi> when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
God was not with him: I mean our <hi>Saviour</hi> on the Cross.
<hi>He,</hi> who although he did beseech against his cup with fervencies
that did breath out in heats of bloody sweat,<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 44.</note> with <hi>agonies of prayer,</hi>
yet when he fell down under it, did chearfully submit to it, saying,
<hi>Not my will,<note place="margin">Ver. 42. Mat. 27. 46.</note> but thy will be done;</hi> yet when God hides himself, he does
expostulate with him, crying out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me? His God</hi> could no more <hi>forsake him,</hi> than <hi>himself</hi> could
be <hi>not himself:</hi> And yet the apprehension of that which could not be
was even insufferable to him, to whom nothing could be insufferable.</p>
                  <p>He seems to feel a very contradiction while he but seems to feel the
want of the <hi>Lord's presence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such is the sad importance of <hi>God's not being with us;</hi> and this same
instant tells us what drives him away. 'Twas <hi>sin</hi> that he withdrew
from them: <hi>Christ</hi> did but take on him our guilt, and upon that
the <hi>Lord forsook</hi> him: God could no more endure to behold wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in him, than the Sun could to see God suffer; Iniquity eclips'd
them both, and sin did separate betwixt him and himself, and made
that person who was <hi>God</hi> cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 45.</note> And it will do the same betwixt God and a people.
Isay. 59. 1, 2. <hi>Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortned that it cannot save;
nor his ear heavy that it cannot hear; but your iniquities have separated
between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that
he will not hear.</hi> His <hi>face</hi> is clothed with <hi>light,</hi> we know; but when
Wickedness over-spreads a people, those <hi>deeds of darkness</hi> put out
the <hi>light of his Countenance.</hi> His <hi>hand</hi> although it be not <hi>shortned,</hi>
yet it <hi>contracts</hi> and <hi>shuts</hi> it self, not only to grasp and withhold his
mercies from them, but to smite: Iniquity builds such a <hi>wall of
separation</hi> as does shut out <hi>omnipresence,</hi> and makes him who is every
where, not be with such a people; not be in hearing of their needs;
for when their sins do cry, no prayers can be hearkned to; <hi>he will
not hear you,</hi> saith the Prophet. And that gives us the very <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
of the Lord's departure from a people, and the manner of it.</p>
                  <p>He is taking away his peace and mercies from a Nation when he
will <hi>hear no prayers</hi> for it; and he declares that he will hear no
prayers when he withdraws once from his <hi>house of prayer,</hi> and makes
his Offices to cease. The place appointed for these Offices, the
<hi>Sanctuary,</hi> he calls, we know the <hi>Tabernacle of<note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>throne:</hi>
And if so, when he is not to be found in these, when he no longer
<hi>dwels</hi> nor <hi>meets</hi> in them, we may be sure that he hath left the land.
The Psalmist,<note place="margin">Psal. 74.</note> when he does complain men had <hi>done evil in the
Sanctuary,<note place="margin">Ver. 3.</note> the adversaries roared in the midst of the Congregations, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40114:288"/>
set up their banners there for trophies;<note place="margin">Psal. 4. 6.</note> they broke down all the carved work
thereof with axes and hammers,<note place="margin">Ver. 7.</note> and had defiled the dwelling places of God's
name even to the ground,<note place="margin">Ver. 1. 2.</note> and burnt up all the houses of God in the land;</hi>
he does suppose that God was then <hi>departed</hi> when they had left him
<hi>no abiding place:</hi> And therefore cries out, <hi>O God wherefore art thou
absent from us so long? Remember</hi> Sion <hi>where thou hast dwelt.</hi> But
'tis not only upon these <hi>Analogies</hi> I build; this method of departure
we shall finde exactly in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Vision of that case to which my
Text referrs: It begins ch. 9. 3. <hi>And the glory of the God of</hi> Israel,
(i. e. <hi>the shining cloud,</hi> the token of his <hi>presence</hi> in the <hi>Sanctuary,)
went up from the Cherub whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house,</hi>
as going out; and then vers. 8. he does refuse to be entreated for
the land: After that ch. 10. 18. <hi>the glory went from off the threshold
to the midst of the City;</hi> and ch. 11. 23. it went from thence to the
mountain without the City, and so away: And then nothing but
desolation dwelt upon the land, untill the Counsel of my Text was
followed, and they did <hi>seek the Lord their God:</hi> For then the <hi>glory</hi>
did return into the Sanctuary just as it went away, as you may find
it chap. 43.</p>
                  <p>And having seen when and how God forsakes a people, and for
what, that does direct us how to seek him, and it is thus, When
men forsake those paths in which they did not only <hi>err</hi> and <hi>go astray,</hi>
but did <hi>walk contrary to God,</hi> so that they did forsake each other; and
do return, <hi>walk in his ways,</hi> the <hi>ways of Commandments,</hi> and return
also to his Church, and seek him in his house, fall low before his
<hi>footstool,</hi> beg of him to meet in his <hi>tabernacle,</hi> renew his worship,
and all invitations of him to return into his <hi>dwelling-place.</hi> For sure
as it is in vain to seek him but in his own ways, nor can we hope
to meet him but in his <hi>Tabernacle of meeting;</hi> so also Scripture calls
both these to <hi>seek the Lord,</hi> and promises to both the <hi>finding him.</hi>
To the first, <hi>Deut. 4. 29, 30. If from thy tribulation thou shalt seek
the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and shalt
be obedient to his voice.</hi> And the second, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 12. speaking of
this sad state to which my Text relates, <hi>then shall ye call upon me,
and ye shall go and pray unto me; and I will hearken unto you, and I will
be found of you, saith the Lord, and I will turn away your Captivity.</hi>
I could produce you instances of <hi>Asa</hi> making <hi>all his people swear to
seek the Lord:</hi> But because my Text speaks of <hi>David,</hi> he shall be
the great <hi>explication,</hi> as he was the <hi>practice</hi> of this duty in both
senses. In the former, 119. Psal. <hi>I have sought thy Commandments
above Gold or precious stone;</hi> more than that which does make and
does <hi>adorn</hi> my Crown, than that which furnishes all the <hi>necessities</hi>
and all the <hi>pomps</hi> of Royalty. And for the other, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 1, 2.
<hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I seek thee: My soul thirsteth for
thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water
is: To see thy power and thy glory, as I have seen the in the Sanctuary.</hi>
His very words do seem to <hi>labour</hi> too, and he does <hi>seek expressions</hi> to

and so impetuously are in his <hi>soul;</hi> it hath a <hi>pious fever,</hi> which
cannot be allay'd but by pouring out of his soul to God in the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40114:288"/>
Temple, by breathing out its heats in his <hi>devotion Offices.</hi> Nay,
more, he longs, hath that I know not whether <hi>appetite,</hi> or <hi>passion,</hi>
which is not to be <hi>understood,</hi> but onely <hi>suffered;</hi> to which all the
<hi>unreasonable violences</hi> which passion can be heated into, all the <hi>defail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances</hi>

Now this he had towards the worship of the Sanctuary; his very
<hi>flesh</hi> found rapture in those exercises, and when he was in a barren
and dry land, was driven from the <hi>plenties</hi> of a Court, and from
the <hi>glories</hi> of a throne into a <hi>desart solitude,</hi> he found no other wants
but of <hi>God's house;</hi> did <hi>mind, pant,</hi> and <hi>long after</hi> nothing else, did
neither thirst for his <hi>necessities,</hi> nor long for his own Crown, but
for the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> only. And besides the <hi>Religion</hi> of this, he had
<hi>reason of State</hi> too to be thus affected; this was the best means to
engage his Subjects to him and secure his Throne. He knew, if by
establishing God's worship,<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 4.</note> and by going with the multitude, as he
did use, to the exercises of it; if by Royal Example and <hi>encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of vertue, and by <hi>discountenancing</hi> and <hi>chastising</hi> impiety, by
doing as he did profess to do, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. (that Directory for a Court)
he could people his <hi>land</hi> with holy living, and his <hi>Temple</hi> with holy
Worship; he knew he should then have good Subjects, Loyal to
him and <hi>at peace</hi> with themselves. I they will seek their God, then
they will seek their King. The Lord saw this dependence, and
therefore counselled this course should be taken. The <hi>Master of our
Politicks</hi> discerned it too,<note place="margin">Arist. Pol. 1 7.</note> and therefore does advise that the first and
chiefest publick cares should be about things of Religion, that and
the same profession of it being <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>the cement of Communities, and the very foundation of all

<hi>To have one and the same opinions of God, and
not to differ in their rites from one another, breeds the best harmony in
mens affections.</hi> When on the other side no obligations, though
the most <hi>signal</hi> and <hi>divine,</hi> will hold them in obedience and peace,
if their <hi>ambitions</hi> or <hi>interests</hi> look another way: And if at any time
<hi>present advantage,</hi> or an <hi>expectation,</hi> or some <hi>passion</hi> do encline them

had had experience of this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abner</hi> knew of <hi>God's Oath</hi> to <hi>David</hi> that after <hi>Saul</hi> he should be
<hi>King over all Israel;</hi> but he was otherwise concerned, and therefore
he made <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> King, maintained a long and sore War even against
what he knew God was engaged to bring about,<note place="margin">

                     </note> and <hi>made himself
strong for the house of</hi> Saul, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2, 3, ch. But when a <hi>quarrel</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
betwixt <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> and <hi>him,</hi> then, <hi>So do God to</hi> Abner <hi>and more
also, except as the Lord hath sworn to</hi> David, <hi>even so I do to him, to
set up the throne of</hi> David <hi>over</hi> Israel <hi>and over</hi> Judah. <hi>And he sent
Messengers to him saying, Whose is the land? Make but thy league with
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40114:289"/>
me,</hi> c. 3. 9, 10, 11, 12. Do but look forward, and you find when
<hi>Abner</hi> was cut off, and <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> was slain, and <hi>Israel</hi> had no leader,
then they <hi>came to</hi> David, <hi>saying, behold we are thy bone and thy flesh,
and the Lord said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel,</hi> c. 5. 1, 2. They
knew all that before, yet would not let him do it, 'till they had no
other leader. Nay, when they had done that, by <hi>Absalom</hi>'s insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(who in a way of treacherous pitty did instill dislikes against
the Government, and did remonstrate in <hi>good wishes,</hi> as some men
do in <hi>prayers,</hi> c. 15. 3, 4.) they were all drawn into Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this <hi>David,</hi> and made him flie out of the land, and became
Subjects to that <hi>Absalom.</hi> When he was dead indeed they speak of
<hi>bringing back the King,</hi> c. 19. 10. and when his own <hi>Judah</hi> had done
it, quarrell'd, ver. 43. because that <hi>their advice was not first had:</hi>
And though <hi>Judah</hi> had nothing but their service, for, <hi>have we eaten
at all of the Kings cost, or hath he given us any gift?</hi> say they, v. 42.
yet <hi>Israel</hi> in angry, because he came not back upon their score, for
they forsooth <hi>have ten parts in him,</hi> v. 43. and yet the next day
every man of <hi>Israel</hi> went after him that said, <hi>we have no part in</hi>
David, Sheba <hi>a man</hi> of Belial, ch. 20. 1. Thus no allegiance, no
tie however sacred and divine will hold them who follow not upon
God's score. Nay at the last, because that <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oboam</hi> would not
ease the Taxes, all <hi>Israel</hi> cry out, <hi>What portion have we in</hi> David?
<hi>see to thine own house,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings 12. 16</note> David. And to make this secession perpetual
(which all the former did not prove) <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did use no other
policy, but to <hi>change the Worship and the Priests:</hi> He knew he should
divide their hearts and Nations for ever, when he had altered once
the Service and the Officers; and if he could but keep them from
<hi>seeking God</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he was secure they would <hi>not seek</hi> David
<hi>their King.</hi> And so it proved. Now the Lord to prevent divisions
had provided so far for <hi>Uniformity</hi> in his Worship, that he required
a single <hi>Unity;</hi> and that it might be but in <hi>one manner,</hi> he let it be
but in <hi>one place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truly, when men once depart from Uniformity, what measures
can they set themselves of changing? What shall confine or put
shores to them? what Principle can they proceed upon which shall
engage them to stay any where? And why may not divisions be as
infinite as mens fancies? And though, when those are but in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial
things, those who are strong, and know them to be
such, are no otherwise concerned to contend for them than on
<hi>Authorities</hi> behalf, (to which every change is a <hi>Convulsion fit.</hi>) and
on the account of decency, and of compliance with the universal
Church: yet when others do <hi>dogmatize,</hi> and put <hi>conscience</hi> in the
<hi>not doing</hi> them, and stand at such a distance from them as to chuse
<hi>Schism, Disobedience,</hi> and <hi>Sedition</hi> rather, and therefore must needs
look upon <hi>damnation</hi> in them; these differences make as great a <hi>gulf</hi>
and <hi>chasm</hi> as that which does divide <hi>Dives</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bosom.<note place="margin">Luke 16. 26.</note>
It is <hi>one God, one Faith, one Worship</hi> makes <hi>hearts one.</hi> Hands lifted up
together in the Temple they will joyn and clasp: And so <hi>Religion</hi>
does fulfil its name <hi>à religando,</hi> binds Prince and Subjects all together;
and they who thus do <hi>seek the Lord their God,</hi> will also <hi>seek</hi> David <hi>their
King,</hi> God's next direction, and my second part.</p>

2. And here three things offer themselves, <hi>a King, their King,
and</hi> David <hi>their King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not here to read a Lecture of State-policy upon a vie of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
why seek <hi>a King,</hi> not any other sort of Government; and
why <hi>their King,</hi> one that already was so by the right of <hi>Succession,</hi>
not whom <hi>addresses</hi> or <hi>election</hi> should make so. And though I think,
'twere easie to demonstrate only Monarchy had ever a <hi>divine</hi> or <hi>natural</hi>
original, and that <hi>elective Monarchy</hi> is most <hi>unsafe</hi> and <hi>burthensome,</hi>
full of dangerous and uneasie consequences; and this so much to
sight, that choice for the most part bounds it self, proves but a
<hi>ceremony</hi> of <hi>Succession:</hi> yet this I need not do, for I am dealing with
the Jews, who had God's judgment in the case, and his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
too; and to me that is argument enough. And when God
hath declar'd, <hi>for the transgressions of a land many are the Princes
thereof;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 28. 2.</note> many at once, as in a <hi>common-wealth,</hi> or many <hi>several fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi>
successively, (for so God reckons also one or many; 'tis still,
we see, <hi>David their King,</hi> while 'tis in <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>line,</hi> and so the King
does truly <hi>never die,</hi> while his race lives.) If either of these <hi>many</hi>
be Gods punishment, for the sins of a land; I will not say that they
who love the <hi>many Princes</hi> love the <hi>transgressions</hi> which God plagues
so; but I will say, they who do chuse that which God call his
plague, that <hi>quarrel</hi> for his <hi>vengeance,</hi> and with great strife and
hazard take his indignation by force, I can but pity them in their
own opinions and enjoyments: But, <hi>O my soul, enter not thou into
their counsels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for <hi>seeking their King,</hi> I shall content my self with that which
<hi>Calvin</hi> says upon the words; <hi>Nam aliter verè &amp; ex animo Deum quaerere
non potuit, quin se etiam subjiceret legitimo imperio cui subjectus erat: For
they could not otherwise truly and with all their heart seek God, except they
did subject themselves to his Government to whom they did of right belong
as Subjects.</hi> And I shall add that they who do <hi>forsake their King,</hi>
will soon <hi>forsake their God.</hi>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40114:290"/>
and fence against it: for if we read on there, 19, 20, 21. ch. we shall
find those dismal Tragedies of <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> the one of which did
sin to death the Levites wife; the other, besides 40000. slain of them

so the story closes it, <hi>In those days there was no king in</hi> Israel,

                  <p>Just upon this; when God in their necessities did raise them <hi>Judges,</hi>

Yea upon this account they are reckon'd by God to sin after both
their <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>State</hi> were ended, when their <hi>calves</hi> and their
<hi>Kingdom</hi> were destroyed. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. 4, 5. the Lord does bid the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>lie on his left side 390 days, to bear the iniquity of</hi> Israel <hi>according
to the number of the years of their iniquity.</hi> But this was more then the
years of their <hi>State,</hi> which were only 255, 390 years indeed there were
betwixt the <hi>falling off</hi> of the Ten Tribes, and the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
by the King of <hi>Babel;</hi> but those ten Tribes were gone, their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

was not, it seems, that does <hi>outlive</hi> their State, so long as that
<hi>God's Temple,</hi> that <hi>King's house</hi> did stand from which they did divide.
As if <hi>Seditious men</hi> and <hi>schismaticks</hi> sin <hi>longer</hi> then they are, even
<hi>while</hi> those are whom they do sin against in separating from.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, there was an <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Manasseh</hi> in the house of <hi>David,</hi>
but <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Josiah</hi> did succeed. Mischief did not appear <hi>entail'd</hi>
on <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as 'tis upon <hi>rebellion</hi> and having <hi>no</hi> King. It does

<hi>to pray for Kings,<note place="margin">Tim. 2. 2.</note> that we might live in godliness and honesty;</hi> and still
they were the same who sought the <hi>Lord their God, and</hi> David
<hi>their King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why <hi>David their King?</hi> For could his Kingdom disappear and
be to seek; of whom the Lord had said, <hi>I have sworn once by my Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

There are other sins besides <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Treason</hi> that <hi>murder</hi> Kings

and use great shadows for a shelter to rapacity, oppression,

                  <p>It was the custom of most Nations from some great eminent
prince to name all the Succession, so at once to suggest his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
to his followers, and to make his glory live. Now without
doubt <hi>David</hi> was <hi>Heroe</hi> enough for this, and his valour alone sufficient
to ground the like practice upon. And though we do not find that
done, yet we do find his <hi>piety</hi> and his <hi>uprightness</hi> made the standard
by which that of his Successors is meted. Of one 'tis said, <hi>he walked
in the ways of</hi> David <hi>his Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chro. 34. 2.</note> of another, <hi>he did that which was right

<hi>David</hi> went aside, and was <hi>upright</hi> with an <hi>Exceptation,</hi> once
therefore it is said, <hi>The Lord was with</hi> Jehoshaphat, <hi>because he walked
in the first ways of his Father</hi> David. But besides this, his very name
is given to two,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 17. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> and the <hi>Messiah;</hi> both which were to be
the <hi>restorers</hi> of their people: The one from <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish
the <hi>Kingdom of heaven</hi> it self; the other to deliver his people
from <hi>Babel,</hi> and to repair a <hi>broken Nation</hi> and <hi>demolish'd Temple.</hi>

                  <p>3. That <hi>Israel</hi> who came but now out of the <hi>furnace</hi> should fear
the Lord whose wrath did kindle it, whose <hi>justice</hi> they had found
such a <hi>consuming fire</hi> as to make the <hi>Temple</hi> it self a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and
the whole <hi>Nation</hi> a <hi>burnt-offering,</hi> is reasonable to expect: But
when his <hi>goodness</hi> had <hi>repair'd</hi> all this, to require them to <hi>fear</hi> that,
does seem hard. That that <hi>goodness</hi> which when it is once appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

melts the heart, and causes dissolution of soul through swoons of
complacency,<note place="margin">Psal. 130. 4.</note> that this should be received with <hi>dread</hi> and <hi>trembling,</hi>
is most strange. Indeed the Psalmist says, <hi>There is mercy with God

                     </hi>
But how to fear those mercies is not easie. 'Tis true, when God

he says, in those mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>lake of fire,</hi> his very <hi>goodness stabs</hi> whole successions at once, and
the guilty may tremble at it for themselves and their posterity. But
if those words do mean as we translate those very words, <hi>Jer.</hi> 46. 28.

not make a <hi>full end</hi> of the guilty, when I visit Iniquities upon the
Children, but will leave them a remnant still; then there is nothing
dreadful in it, but those very visitations have kindness in them,
and his rod comforts, and this issue of his goodness also is not
terrible but lovely. To <hi>fear God's goodness</hi> therefore is to <hi>revere</hi> it,
to entertain it with a <hi>pious astonishment,</hi> acknowledging themselves
unworthy of the crums of it, especially not daring to provoke it by
<hi>surfeiting,</hi> or by <hi>presuming</hi> on it, or by <hi>abusing</hi> it to serve <hi>ill ends,</hi>
or any <hi>other</hi> than God sent it for, those of <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>obedience:</hi> Not
to comply with which, is to <hi>defeat</hi> God's kindness, and the designs
of it. If when they sought the Lord, he was found of them, and
came to his dwelling place only to be <hi>forc'd</hi> thence again by their
abominations; if when his goodness had restor'd all to them, they
had <hi>David their King</hi> but to <hi>conspire</hi> against, an <hi>Altar</hi> onely to <hi>pollute,</hi>
and a <hi>Temple</hi> to <hi>separate</hi> from, as <hi>Manasses</hi> the Priest, <hi>Sanballat</hi>'s son
in-law, with his accomplices did do; this were both to <hi>affront</hi> and
to <hi>renounce</hi> that goodness, which above all things they must dread
the doing: For if this be offended too, ruine is irreversible; there
is no other attribute in God a sinner can fly to with any hope.
His <hi>Holiness</hi> cannot <hi>behold iniquity,</hi> his <hi>Justice</hi> speaks nothing but
<hi>condemnation</hi> to guilt, his <hi>Power</hi> without kindness is but <hi>omnipotent
destruction;</hi> but if we have his <hi>Goodness</hi> on our side, we have an
<hi>Advocate</hi> in his own bosom that will bear up against the rest, for his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40114:291"/>
mercy is over all his Attributes as well as Works: But if this also be
exasperated, and kindness grow severe, there is no refuge in the
Lord, no shadow of him to take Sanctuary under; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to allay the <hi>anger</hi> of his <hi>Comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the extreamest terrour, we are to dread his kindness <hi>more</hi> than his
severity and wrath; we have an antidote, a buckler against those,
but none against the other if it be provok'd; and if the heats of love
take <hi>fire</hi> and rise into indignation, 'tis unquenchable flame and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
burning. Therefore when God hath done all things that he
can do or they can wish, then most of all they must <hi>fear the Lord
and his goodness.</hi>

this were not enough to make us be <hi>without a God</hi> too, then to drive
him away we had <hi>defil'd his dwelling places to the ground,</hi> and by his
ancient gifts of remove he was certainly gone. There was indeed
exceeding much Religion among us, yet, God knows, almost none
at all, while Christianity was crumbled into so many, so minute
professions, that 'twas divided into little nothings, and even loft

made others <hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Atheists;</hi> while seeing men such holy

We sought him with the violent impatiencies of necessitous
and furious desires, and our eyes, that had even fail'd with looking
<hi>for him,</hi> did even fail with looking <hi>on him,</hi> as impotent and as

with as many tears as pray'd for; as one whom not our <hi>Interests</hi>
alone, but out <hi>guilts</hi> had endear'd to us, and our tears: He was as
necessary to us as <hi>repentance,</hi> as without whom it was impossible for

our Condition.</p>
                  <p>There never was so much pretence of <hi>seeking God</hi> as in those late

chuse rather to deny their own conclusions, and resist Gods goodness,
then to be convinced and repent: For we have seen them as bold

impenitence with chearful suffering, as if the fire they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd

mounted up to Heaven. Others that did not go so far in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
nor guilt as they, and therefore think they have no reason
to repent of that, do they repent of what they did contribute to
it? Of those that lifted up their hands to swear and fight, how

saying,<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 19.</note>

themselves proceeded? And if all that were well, why do not we
repent of our Allegiance and Loyalty? If all that were well, what
hath thy goodness done, O Lord, that hath reverst it all? And for
the rest, those that do not partake the plenties of thy goodness,
murmur and repine at it; are discontent at having what they pray'd
for, what they would have died for. Those that have been partakers
of it, have <hi>turned it into wantonness,</hi> have made it furnish them for
base unworthy practices; such as have not the generosity of Vice,
have not a noble, manly wickedness, are poltron sins; have made
it raise a cry on the Faithfullest party, the best Cause, and the purest

as this we have tasted, cannot have such deadly issues; and it
was great indeed, so perfectly miraculous in such strange and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
successes, resisting our contrivances and our sins too, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
all opposition of our vices, and our own policies, that do

it was <hi>fatality of goodness.</hi> Now sure that which is so victorious
will not be worsted by us. But Oh! have we not reason so much
more to fear the goodness? The greater and more undeserved it is,
the more suspicious it is: As if it were the last blaze of the Candle
of the Lord, when its light gasps; its flash of shine before it do go
out, the <hi>dying struggles</hi> and <hi>extream efforts</hi> of goodness, to see if at
the last any thing can be wrought by it. And if we did consider
how some men manage the present goodness, make use of this time
of it, and take, and catch, we would believe they did fear the
departure of it: But yet it is in our power to fix it here. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,

                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>MATH. V. 44.</bibl>
                     <q>But I say unto you, love your Enemies, bless them
that curse you, do good to them that hate you,
and pray for them that despitefully use you, and
persecute you.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I Need no Artifice to tie this Subject and this Day together.
The Saint whose memory we celebrate was the <hi>Martyr of this
Text:</hi> And 'tis impossible to keep the Feast but by a resolution
of obeying these Commands, you being call'd together on
this day to <hi>beseech God to grant that you by the Example of this first
Martyr St.</hi> Stephen, <hi>who pray'd for his Murderers, may learn to love
your Enemies, and pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute
you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A strange command in an Age, in which we scarcely can find
men that love their Friends, nor any thing but that which serves
their interests or pleasures, that indeed love nothing but themselves;
nor is it onely injury that works their hate and enmity, but difference
in opinion divides hearts, and men are never to be reconcil'd that
have not the same mind in every thing; as if one Heaven should
not hold them that have not one judgment in all things, we see
that one Church cannot hold them, and they that have but <hi>one
same God, one Redeemer</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> one <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of Suplication,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40114:295"/>
cannot agree yet in <hi>one Prayer</hi> to him, though they have but <hi>one same
thing</hi> to pray for to him: will not meet in their Worship because they do
not in some Sentiments; and 'tis no wonder all Christ's reasonings and
upbraidings, all the Advantages he does propose to them that love, the
shames he casts on them that do not, by putting them out of his Train in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the condemnation of Publicans; 'tis no wonder all this does not work
with them whom their own sufferings and black Calamities will not
convince. There is not one of us but knows that thus our miseries
began but few years since, and yet we that have suffered for and by
our Divisions, whose quarrels wounded the whole Nation and our
selves, who have wept so much bloud at once to vent and to bewail
our differences, are still as full of the same animosities as ever,
and want nothing but opportunity to confound all again, <hi>Religion</hi>
and <hi>our selves:</hi> And in the name of God what did <hi>Christ</hi> mean when
he prescrib'd this Precept? when he disputed? prest it thus? or what
do <hi>Christians</hi> mean when they do break and tear this Precept and
themselves? Though I be far from any hopes to reconcile our Parties,
(as by Gods help I shall ever be from making any,) yet I will offer
an Expedient to make them not so noxious; namely, if they will
keep the differences of their judgments from breaking out into their
affections and actions. And though while meekness and obedience
to Governours, and the whole constellation of Gospel-graces, do
not seem to shine so fair as man's own reputation, or humor, or
possibly some strict opinion which they have own'd, and the shew
of holiness that glitters in it, while 'tis thus, I say, we cannot look
any party will yield, all do or will believe themselves to be in the
right; yet I will give them leave to think so, and my prescription
shall concern them equally although they be; and by addressing my
Discourse to them that are so really, I shall conclude more forcibly
them that are not, who ere they be; for sure I am none can be more
in the right than those whom <hi>Christ</hi> lays this injunction upon, than
his <hi>Disciples</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> as relating to those that would be their
Enemies as such: Yet 'tis to them he speaks here; <hi>I say unto you, love
your Enemies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The words contain a <hi>Duty prescrib'd,</hi> and the <hi>Authority prescribing</hi>
it: The Prescription and the Authority in these words, <hi>I say unto you,</hi>
the Duty in the rest: where it is set down 1. in general: <hi>Love your
Enemies,</hi> and that to be consider'd under a double prospect: 1. As
it is plac't in opposition to somthing that was before indulg'd the
<hi>Jews,</hi> or presum'd so to be by them; signified here by the particle
<hi>But;</hi> and then as it stands by it self, in its own positive importance:
<hi>Love your Enemies.</hi> And Secondly, this Duty is particulariz'd in
several exercises of the Act commanded, <hi>Love,</hi> in relation to several
sorts of the Objects of that Act, <hi>Enemies:</hi> As 1. Those that <hi>curse</hi>
you, you must <hi>bless:</hi> 2. Those that <hi>hate</hi> you, you must <hi>do good</hi> to:
3. Those that <hi>use you despitefully and persecute you,</hi> you must <hi>pray for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These I shall treat of in their given order, beginning with the
general Duty, and viewing that at once in both the lights that it
doth stand in, that one may clear and fortifie the other. <hi>But I say
unto you, love your Enemies.</hi>
                  </p>

Of all the Points of Christian Religion those which did most
stagger the faith of some, and check their acceptation of it, or
adherence to it, (saith <hi>Marcellinus</hi> writing to St. <hi>Austin</hi>) were these
3; The <hi>incarnation of our Lord:</hi> The <hi>meanest of his Miracles,</hi> which
they thought the works of <hi>Apollonius</hi> equall'd; and thirdly, the
<hi>prescriptions in the Text,</hi> It seems they lookt upon these Duties as the
mysteries of Practice; that spoke as loud a contradiction to their
<hi>active principles</hi> and <hi>inclinations,</hi> as the other appear'd to do so, those
of <hi>Speculation</hi> and <hi>Discourse,</hi> a <hi>God made flesh,</hi> and <hi>flesh and bloud</hi> made
so lame and passive, sweetned so, being alike impossible to their
belief: As if no flesh could certainly be so, except that of which
God was made, and the <hi>Word incarnate</hi> onely could fulfill, <hi>these words</hi>
here in my Text: They lookt upon this as a much-more mighty
work than any of his Miracles; as if 'twere easier to snatch one out
of the arms of Fate from the embraces of the Grave, than to receive
an enemy into ones own: As if <hi>Christ</hi> had done more when he pray'd
for his Crucifiers then when he pray'd <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of his grave:
For their Magicians, they say, vied Miracles with him, but none of
their Religions or Gods did ever aim at this Prescription, <hi>ut quae sit
propria bonitas nostra;</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian;</hi> this being a sort of Piety pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to the Christians. Nor did they onely think it unpracticable,
but unreasonable; as carrying opposition to all Government, to the
Prosperity and Peace of every Polity; for he that does require that
I shall have no return of injuries, but for a wrong, makes me in debt
a kindness, not onely supersedes judiciary proceedings, but does
secure Rapine by Law, and encourage it by reward; and truly if it
were impossible for him that does affect a person to dislike his evil
actions, and to desire he may have condigne punishment, such as
by Gospel-measures may be satisfaction equal to his fault, and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to himself and others, these men had reason: But if a Father can
at once love and correct his Child; if when I am with indignation
displeas'd at my offences against God, and by severities revenge them
on my self, I do then love my self most passionately; and if I can
pray with all the vigour of my soul for that false Traytor-bosom-enemy,
my flesh, while it lies goading me to sin, and with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
persecuting me to everlasting death, then no reason of State,
or of my own requires I should not do all these acts of kindness to my
Adversary. In that thou hast an exact pattern for thy enmity to
them that wrong thee, and <hi>thou shalt hate thine enemy as thy self,</hi> is a
most perfect Gospel-Rule: that being most cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>nt with and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective
of this Duty, <hi>love your enemies.</hi> But yet there is so great a
difference indeed betwixt this Act here and its object (Enemy being
constituted such by enmity, that is aversion and hate) that love,
and that seem strangely coupled, things that can be put together
onely for a contest, just as heat and cold, to weaken one another,
that both the love and enmity, may be refracted into a luke-warmhess.
Therefore I shall divide them, handling <hi>Love</hi> first by it self, viewing
the import of that as it is sincere, lest the enemy appearing with it,
make it shrink into a very slender Duty: and having done that,
secondly, see whether an others enmity; and thirdly, whether en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
with that appropriation here, <hi>your enemies,</hi> can take off from the
Obligation of that Duty, <hi>Love.</hi>

company, their Rule, and scope; and such a person <hi>Aristotle</hi> says must
be either a <hi>God,</hi> who can enjoy nothing beside himself, is his own
blessed and immortal entertainment, or a <hi>wild beast</hi> whose nature is

and the repetitions of injuries, but still expects, and suffers all the
contradictions of spite and wrong.</p>
                  <p>Now if all these acts and the many other there are essential to Love
and all be under Obligation; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> says there, they are so much
Duty that without these performances all Faith and all Graces
profit nothing: the Preaching Rhetorick of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> would
be nothing else but <hi>tinkling,</hi> and <hi>working Miracles,</hi> but shewing tricks.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40114:296"/>
It follows then these Acts must necessarily have a certain object, there
must be some body that we are bound to love thus: And if that
Object be or Neighbour (as that is most sure) 'tis clear my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
injury, or hate or enmity to me, cannot take off nor yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish
in the least that Obligation I have to all those Acts, but I
must love him though he be mine enemy in every of those instances.
For it is plain, his having wrong'd me does not make him cease to be
my Neighbour; nay more, that enmity does formally dispose and
qualifie my Neighbour for the Object of my love: And many of its
Acts cannot relate but to a man that injures me; it must be in respect
to <hi>provocations</hi> that <hi>love</hi> is said to cool into such a temper as <hi>is not
easily provokt;</hi> For men are not provokt with kindnesses. I cannot
<hi>suffer</hi> any thing but <hi>wrong,</hi> nor <hi>suffer long</hi> except there be <hi>continuation</hi>
and <hi>frequency</hi> of wrongs. Nor is it possible I should <hi>forgive</hi> unless it
be <hi>offences</hi> done against me. And so for divers of the rest: Now it
were strange the enemy should supersede the obligation of the Duty,
which cannot be a Duty but in order to an Enemy; that injury
should give me a release, from doing that which I can neverr have
cause or occasion to do but in the case of injury; that I should have
leave not to obey the Command for that meer reason which alone
maks it possible to obey it, and which alone makes the Command:
Whereas indeed because I must needs love in these expresses, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he must needs be my enemy whom I must love.</p>
                  <p>But if he be without all provocation very unjustly so, if his hate
be his sin, so that he hath offended God too in it, may I not then
espouse Gods quarrel thus farr, not to love his Enemy if I must mine
own, not to love the injurious, the sinner? Vice certainly is the
most hateful thing that is, and therefore it must needs render the
subject not to be belov'd; accordingly 'tis said, that <hi>the ungodly and
his ungodliness are both alike hateful unto God,</hi> Wis. 14. 9. and <hi>David</hi>
does comply with God in this,<note place="margin">Vers. 21. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Psalm 139. Do not I hate them, O
Lord, that hate thee? yea I hate them with perfect hatred, I count them
mine enemies.</hi> And when I reflect on mine under this Notion, or
if mine be such as set themselves against Religion and the peace and
quietness of the Church, am I bound to love them? If so, then I
may be allow'd to do it with a little regret sure. But yet if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how these in the Text are designated by that Appropriation,
<hi>your enemies,</hi> which means those that hate <hi>you, my Disciples,</hi> those
that in the last words of my Text, <hi>will persecute you</hi> even for your
being mine; and yet those they are bid to love, we may conclude
in the next place we may not hate our enemies as Sinners: Nor yet
does enmity with <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Church,</hi> or his <hi>Religion</hi> qualifie a person
for our aversation or mischiefs. I except here <hi>Apostacy</hi> and utter
<hi>obduration in it;</hi> a state that incapacitates for mercy, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
for love and kindness.<note place="margin">1 John v. 16.</note> There is a sin which S. <hi>John</hi> would
not say that we should pray for, and the Church thought that there
was such a sinner, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dian,</hi> but as to less degrees, they that are
suppos'd <hi>to persecute Disciples,</hi> and in doing so <hi>persecute Christ himself,</hi>
may well be granted <hi>sinners, enemies to God</hi> and <hi>Christianity;</hi> but yet
says he, <hi>I say unto you, love these your enemies. Tertullian</hi> understood
this so, and writing to the Governour of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who threatned all
the Christians of that Province with Excision, that he might persuade
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40114:297"/>
him from his purpose, thus began his Proposals: <hi>We do not write as
fearing for our selves, or dreading any thing that we are like to suffer,
for we did enter our Religion on the condition of suffering, we covenanted
to endure, and staked our lives when we began our profession; but 'tis for
you we fear, for you our enemies, whom our Religion does command us to
love and to do good to.</hi> And though we must hate Vice, and do our
best to root out Infidelity and Atheism, destroy Profaneness, Irreligion
and Heresie and Schism: These are fit objects for the zeals of Hate,
and for the feavers of our Passion, and if our enemies be such we
may meetly endeavour they may have appropriate restraints, yet
not to exercise the Acts of Charity and kindness to them we have
no allowance: No sins can make it lawful for us to ruine, or not to do
good to the Sinners. In fine the onely persons that the <hi>Jews</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have ground to hate were Enemies, and Enemies, indeed
to their Religion, the Idolatrous Gentile-world, therefore that being
now forbid to us, there is not sort of men, nor any man whom it is
lawful for a Christian not to love; and all the reasons urg'd here
by our Saviour, do prove, that all mankind whether good or bad is
the object of a Christians love: Because God does good to all, his
methods of Mercies are universal; he makes his Clouds drop fatness
even upon them that consume the encrease on their Lusts, and
sacrifice it to their Riots, making their belly be their God: He
gives abundance of his good things unto those that love them onely
as they advantage Vanity and Sin, and that turn Gods-store into
provision for Vice and for Destruction. He gives gold to them
that make gold their Idol, and bestows large portions of Earth on
them that are Children of Hell, and them who for the pleasures
of that Earth despise his Heaven. Yea, the whole order of things
does teach us this, the Creatures do service to the whole kind,
they acknowledge the man, and not the Countrey-man and Friend;
but alike the rich and poor,<note place="margin">

                     </note> the good and grateful, the wicked

more day to gild the gaudy and gay person whose Cloaths and
Jewels will reflect his light, return him as much almost as he sends,
and vie brightness with him, than he does to the poor dark, sordid
rags that even damp his beams: He sheds the same unpall'd day
even on those men that draw such streams of bloud as with their
mists endeavour to put out or stain his shine: The Ayr gives breath
to them that putrifie it, as well as those that send it out a Perfume.

are the duty of this place, which does intend that all sorts of loving
words should be the Christians returns to the offences of the tongue,
whether by Curse or contumely. And truly when I do consider how
the other way, the rendring like for like, and giving him that does
wish or speak evil as good language as he brings, is so far from all
shadow of compensation, that there is really a loss of honour in those
dismal imprecating words, the anger that does belch them out, does
swell and stretch and rack the passion, blushes at it self, the malice
drinks those spirits up which it lurks in, and the envy that Snake,
sucks all the blood away, leaves nothing but its own pale venom in
the stead: In a word, the very Essence of impatience is vexation
and fret; and then that men should call that recompence for suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which is it self a present agony, and hath no prospect of any
after good, that they should satisfie themselves in that does make
that bold assertion of the <hi>Romanist,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">White.</note> who says that those in Hell do
will and love their being there not strange at all, for indeed there
is one and the same reason of both, that in the paroxysm of a passion,
whensoever a man is seiz'd by an affection with violence (as they
in Hell are always, and those that speak evil are for the present,)
He does for that time love, cherish and pursue the affection: and in
good earnest, if so be that men can please themselves in the extreme
impatience of a fruitless choler, it looks like demonstration, that the
damn'd may please themselves in their damnation; as to that part of
it, that which tears the Soul, the rage of its own passions when
they are loose and unmuzzel'd, and the more because we have
good reason to believe theirs are the very passions we are now upon,
<hi>Envy,</hi> and <hi>Hate,</hi> and <hi>Shame;</hi> and they do vent themselves in the same
manner too, in <hi>Blasphemy</hi> and <hi>Curses;</hi> and differ nothing, but that
their's are endless, and then let such men please themselves in the
returns of calumny and imprecations, we will allow them the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of Hell in doing so, and they do tast those very onely satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
that the fiends do in their torments, and much good may
they do them.<note place="margin">Psal. 109. 17. 18.</note> 'Tis true then what the Psalmist says, <hi>that he who thus

                        </gap> in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. does
mean a work of excellency, in a state of virtue without precept)
and if it be here so too, enmity seems to have advantage above friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in the Gospel, and brings kindness under an obligation; graces
and favours that in their notation and essence imploy the being free,
yet are not so to hatred, which hath by Christs Law just pretences
to them. I will not be too positive in my affirmings, yet from the
words will offer this, that if a kindness lye before me, and I have no
reason to deny it a man, but this because he hates me, I must not,
deny it him, and if Christs reasonings do inforce the other it will
cunclude this too. For if we must relieve the wants of them that
hate us, that <hi>we may be Children of our Father,</hi> who does so, upon the
same account we must be good and kind too to them, for he is, and
he will scarce prove a true lawful issue of this Father, who is in this
unlike to him that tries and owns his progeny by these resemblances.
So that whatever strength of argument there is in one, the other
hath it. And truly we have reason to believe that there is more then
motive in it, when first Christ hath set this principle both to himself
and us, <hi>with what measure you meet, it shall be measured to you again,</hi>
Matt. 7. 2. As if the Lord had brought himself into that law of Justice
with us men, <hi>whatsoever ye would that others should do to you, do you
also to them:</hi> And it be also, <hi>whatsoever ye would that God should do

as the rates we do, for with the froward God learns frowardness, and
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and is kind to the kind, so <hi>Ps.</hi> 18. 25. recals a grace
from him that would not do one, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. from 23. nay thirdly,
when he gives us leave to beg his kindnesses, but just in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40114:298"/>
we do ours, <hi>forgive as we forgives,</hi> we ask no more, and
praying so, we undertake to have endeavoured thus; assure God
that we practise so, and upon that score beg. Now he that will
forgive to the bounds of necessity, but never into favour, there he
will stay his hand, will so much serve his turn from God? And
can he be content with such a portion? Take heed, O severe man,
what thou dost ask, when thou dost put up this petition. As thou
shouldest say, I knew that notwithstanding we offend God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
yet besides all the mercies of his Covenant, (and that's a
Covenant of Grace) his kindness too is over all his works; he
does not only furnish our necessities, but serves our pleasures and
our fancies, prevents us with the blessings of his goodness, and watches
over us, and waits to be kind to us in the rescues of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and beyond these gives us means of Salvation more than
barely sufficient, the plenties of his grace, the five and ten Talents, the
expresses of his temporal spiritual and eternal favours towards them
that provoke him, are as immense and as innumerable as their guilts,
but all these I shall rather part with, then be good and do favours
to him that is mine Enenmy; I will nevr have any kindness for that
man that hates me, nor do beg any of Thee, O Lord. And wouldest
thou say all this to God, if it were put in words at length in thy
petition? Or dost thou think thou dost not say as much in praying
so? And thou that makest so ill requests for thy own self, how wilt
thou pray for them that despitefully use thee and persecute thee?
Which is the last particular command. <hi>Pray for them that despitefully
use you and persecute you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As in this Character of Enemies, Christ hath not left out any
thing that does express hostility, hating in heart, cursing in word,
and persecution in deed, and which to some is more provoking than
a persecution, despiteful usage; (For persecution may make them
serious, and look at their demerits, the other only stirs their spleen
and gall) all which, all that an enemy can speak, or wish, or do,
must be no bar to our affection: So to express the unfeignedness of
that, he hath not left out any exercise of Love, we must speak well
of them, but that a crafty passion may do, and blessing may be but
more plausible and cunning hatred: We must therefore also do good
to them, but this a generous pride may do, as knowing it more
glorious to raise up a distressed adversary, then to trample on him
whem he is down, and to make him my creature rather then my
footstool: All this I may do therefore yet love nothing but my vanity
or my designs: But when I take my Enemy into my Closet and into
my heart, give him a share in the petitions of my soul, divide the
aims and interests of my devotion to him, and make my prayers
concern'd in the forgiveness of his sins as of my own, there's nothing
but obedience to my Saviour, and the Love of my Enemy can make
a man do this. And truly 'tis a piece of kindness that is as necessary
for our selves, as those that injure us. For them it is very necessary
for persecution, or despightful usage, offending God, as by a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
to his precept; so also by the sufferings it does inflict on
man, to forgive or require which that man hath right: God does
not use to put the injur'd person by this right, or by its paramont
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40114:299"/>
Authority assume to pardon the mans part of the wrong, but does
retain the sin till that either in deed or desire do satisfied for, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
there being 'till then an obstruction to Gods forgiveness,
for 'till then the man hath not repented; but when the fufferer does
pray for him, in doing so he pleads that that obstruction is remov'd,
that his part is remitted, and so leaves no bar in the way to that
pardon which he begs for him of God, and which that bar being
gone, the Lord is us'd to grant with all advantage, the prayers of
our Martyr, in the seventh of the <hi>Acts,</hi> are a demonstration, to
which the Fathers say the Church did owe not only her deliverance
from all the violent intentions of <hi>Saul,</hi> but all that Christianity
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> planted; the dying voice of that petition.<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 7. 60.</note> 
                        <hi>Lord, lay
not this sin to their charge,</hi> was answered by that<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 9 4.</note> 
                        <hi>voyce from Heaven,</hi>
which converted <hi>Saul</hi> in his career of fury: One prayer for a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
puts an end to persecution, <hi>&amp; si Stephanus non or asset &amp; Ecclesia
non habuiesset Paulum. Jobs</hi> miserable comforters, whose visits prov'd
afflictions to him, could not a tone themselves to God by their
burnt offerings, but <hi>Job</hi> must pray for them 42. <hi>Chr.</hi> 8. seven Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks
and seven Rams cannot expiate, but one petition from the
sufferer will do it; <hi>for him I will accept,</hi> saith God, and he accepted
him, not for them only, but for himself, for <hi>the Lord turned the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
of</hi> Job, <hi>when he prayed for them.</hi> vers. 10. These intercessions
speed sooner then direct supplications, and such a petition is heard
to our selves, when 'tis made for others. And reason good, for such
requests lay the condition of our pardon before God, making evidence
of our performance, and they cry, <hi>for we forgive,</hi> and so call for
pardon. And to encourage this procedure, our <hi>Saviour</hi> before he
did commend his own spirit into the hand of his Father, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
his Executioners to the mercies of his Father; Our <hi>Martyr</hi>
did not so indeed, but first pray'd for himself, <hi>Lord Jesus receive my
Spirit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 34. 46.</note> Acts. 7. 59. But though Heaven opening he <hi>saw that Jesus
standing at the right hand of God,</hi> as ready to receive it, yet his spirit
would not leave his body so, yet made him live yet to endure more
stoning from his persecutors, for whom he had not pray'd yet, but
when he once fell on his knees, not beaten down by their storm,
but his Charity, and pray'd, <hi>Lord lay not this sin to their charge, when
he had said so he fell asleep,</hi> v. 60. his Spirit taken hence as it were
<hi>osculo pacis,</hi> though by the most violent death, and he lies down in
a perpetual rest and peace, that thus lies down in Love. These
are requests to breath out a soul into heaven in, and heaven it self
did open to receive that soul that came so wafred.</p>
                     <p>And now we are at the top of Christ's Mount, the highest and
the steepest point of christianity,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 48.</note> which view with that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o which
our Martyrs Spirit did ascend: For it makes <hi>perfect as our heavenly
Father is perfect;</hi> it sets our heads within those higher and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubled
Regions, wherein there are no Meteor-fires, the flame of
Passion cannot wing it thither, for he that is above the power of
injury, discontent, cannot look up to him, it is with him as in the
upper Orbs, where there is only harmony and shine, all is peace and
love, the state of heaven it self. Now as it does happen to them
that look down from great heights, every Object below is dwarf'd:
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40114:299"/>
And if the distance of the prospect be as great as that from Heaven
to Earth, they tell us this whole Globe would be but like a spot, all
being swallowed in it self; so if from this great height of duty, we
should look down upon the World of Christianity, would it not
almost wholly disappear and vanish? Something like a dark spot
of it you may perchance behold, stain'd and discolour'd with the
Blood of Christians, which their constant quarrels shed: Some it
may be dye that Blood in colours of Religion, their Animosity is
christened Zeal, they kill only for Sacrifice, thus they interpret
and fulfill Christs precepts, this they call holy love, as if Christ
when he bid his Disciples <hi>take no Staves with them,</hi> meant they
should carry <hi>Swords;</hi> as if the love he had commanded we should
have for them that are in errour (if our enemies be so indeed)
were but to murder them forsooth out of their errours. Next for
the kindnesses that Christians do to those that hate them, or have
disoblig'd them, they are God knows so little, that no perspective
can shew them from this height we are upon: And yet 'tis not for
want of light we cannot see them, 'tis very rare men do those things
in the dark; for if they do not blazon them themselves, the enemy
whom they oblige, must do it. The distance also is too great to
hear the prayers that are made for those that treat men with despite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
usage; perhaps it is because they are put up in secret; bur then
what means the yelling of those curses? That ill Language that is
banded to and fro? While none will be behind in the returns of these;
how far soever we are off, like Thunder these are heard: And thence
you may behold them also tearing Christs wounds wider to mouth
their swelling passion; We may see their anger redden with his
Blood, and themselves spitting out that Blood by imprecations at the
face of him that did provoke them; we may see them raking Hell
to word these prayers, sending themselves thither in wishes, that
they may express them with more horrour. The Hatreds and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges
which men act on them that have offended them (hates that
seldom ever dye 'till themselves do, which the Frost of the Grave
onely cools, yea, many times they are rak'd up, and keep their heat
in the ashes, live in the grave, and are as long liv'd as the families,
which for the most part is more careful and tenacious of them than
of their Inheritance.) The executions of these are often writ in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
legible at utmost distance; in this Mount of the Lord they
may be seen, but where now are the Christians of my Text and of
this day? There's no appearance of them in the face of the whole
Globe of our Profession; nay worse, it is scarce possible they should
appear, the Duties of <hi>loving enemies,</hi> of <hi>returning affronts with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> these are banisht thence; other virtues are practic'd down,
but these are scorn'd and quarrel'd down. 'Tis become a base thing
and not to be endur'd to be a Christian in these instances: See pride
and passions swoln up to an height, which Christ's Mount cannot
reach, and which he must not level by his precepts: For since he
was not pleas'd to consider how inconsistent in this last age of the
World his rules would be with those of honour, and in making his
Laws, took no care of the reputation of a Gentleman, 'tis fit his
Laws should give way to the constitutions' of some <hi>Hectors,</hi> and he
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40114:300"/>
must bear the violation of them: And all this must be reasonable
too. Good God! what prodigy of age is this, when Christ the Lord
cannot be competent to judge either of right, of honour, or of realon?
When to be <hi>like God,</hi> and to be <hi>perfect as our Father in Heaven is
perfect,</hi> is to be most fordid and unworthy of a Gentleman? and
in the name of God these men that are too great for virtue, that
brave out Religion, and will needs give rules to God, what rank
do they intend up stand in at Gods Judgment seat on the last day?
<hi>Lord God! grant us to stand among the week, on that hand with the sheep,
