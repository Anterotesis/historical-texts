            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Printed this Play with all the impatient haste one ought to do, who would be vindicated from the most unjust and silly aspersion, Woman could invent to cast on Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and which only my being a Woman has procured me; <hi>That it was Baudy,</hi> the least and most Excusable fault in the Men writers, to whose Plays they all crowd, as if they came to no other end then to hear what they condemn in this: <hi>but from a Woman it was unnaturall:</hi> but how so Cruell an unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness came into their imaginations I can by no means guess; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by those whose Lovers by long absence, or those whom Age or Ugliness have rendered a little distant from those things they would fain imagin here — But if such as these durst profane their Chast ears with hearing it over again, or taking it into their serious Consideration in their Cabinets; they would find nothing that the most innocent Virgins can have cause to blush at: but confess with me that no Play either Ancient or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern has less of that Bug-bear Bawdry in it. Others to show their breeding (as <hi>Bays</hi> sayes,) cryed it was made out of at least
<pb facs="tcp:59381:3"/>
four <hi>French</hi> Plays, when I had but a very bare hint from one, the <hi>Malad Imagenere,</hi> which was given me translated by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man infinitely to advantage: but how much of the <hi>French</hi> is in this, I leave to those who do indeed understand it and have seen it at the Court. The Play had no other Misfortune but that of coming out for a Womans: had it been owned by a Man, though the most Dull Unthinking Rascally Scribler in Town, it had been a most admirable Play. Nor does it's loss of Fame with the Ladies do it much hurt, though they ought to have had good Nature and justice enough to have attributed all its faults to the Authours unhappiness, who is forced to write for Bread and not ashamed to owne it, and consequently ought to write to please (if she can) an Age which has given severall proofs it was by this way of writing to be obliged, though it is a way too cheap for men of wit to pursue, who write for Glory, and a way which even I despise as much below me.</p>

As for my Estate, my Father dy'd since I came of Age, and left me a small younger Brothers Portion, dear Lady.</p>

                     <p>Yes my Dear, going this morning into her Chamber, she not being there, I took up a Letter that lay open on her
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59381:32"/>
Table, and out of curiosity read it, as near as I can remember 'twas to this purpose, I writ it out now because I had a mind thou shou'd'st see't; for I can hide nothing from thee.</p>

            <l>Ah, Rott it—'tis a Womans Comedy,</l>
            <l>One, who because she lately chanc't to please us,</l>
            <l>With her Damn'd stuff will never cease to teaze us.</l>
            <l>What has poor Woman done that she must be,</l>
            <l>Debar'd from Sense and Sacred Poetrie?</l>
            <l>Why in this Age has Heaven allow'd you more,</l>
            <l>And Women less of Wit then heretofore?</l>
            <l>We once were fam'd in Story, and cou'd write</l>
            <l>Equall to men; cou'd Govern, nay cou'd Fight.</l>
            <l>We still have passive Valour, and can show</l>
            <l>Wou'd Custom give us leave the Active too,</l>
            <l>Since we no provocations want from you.</l>
            <l>For who but we, cou'd your Dull Fopperies bear,</l>
            <l>Your Saucy Love, and your brisk Nonsence hear;</l>
            <l>Indure your worse then womanish affectation,</l>
            <l>Which renders you the Nusance of the Nation;</l>
            <l>Scorn'd even by all the Misses of the Town,</l>
            <l>A sest to Vizard Mask, the <hi>Pitt-Buffoone</hi>;</l>
            <l>A Glass by which th' admiring Country Fool</l>
            <l>May learn to dress himself en Ridicule:</l>
            <l>Both striving who shall most Ingenious grow</l>
            <l>In Lewdness, Foppery, Nonsence, Noise and Show.</l>
            <l>And yet to these fine things we must submit</l>
            <l>Our Reason, Arms, our Lawrells, and our Wit.</l>
            <l>Because we do not Laugh at you when Lewd,</l>
            <l>And scorn and cudgell ye when you are Rude;</l>
            <l>That we have Nobler Souls then you, we prove,</l>
            <l>By how much more we're sensible of Love;</l>
            <l>Quickest in finding all the subtlest waies</l>
            <l>To make your Ioys: why not to make you Plays?</l>
            <l>We best can find your Feables, know our own,</l>
            <l>And Gilts and Cuckolds now best please the Town;</l>
            <l>Your way of writing's out of Fashion grown.</l>
            <l>Method, and Rule — you only understand,</l>
            <l>Pursue that way of Fooling, and be Damn'd.</l>
            <l>Your Learned Cant of Action, Time, and Place,</l>
            <l>Must all give way to the unlabour'd farce.</l>
            <l>To all the Men of Witt we will subscribe:</l>
            <l>But for you half Wits, you unthinking Tribe,</l>
            <l>We'll let you see, what e're besides we doe,</l>
            <l>How Artfully we Copy some of you:</l>
            <l>And if you're drawn to th' life, pray tell me then</l>
            <l>Why Women should not write as well as Men.</l>
