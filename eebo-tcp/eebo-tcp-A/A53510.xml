            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
LORD ELANDE,
Eldest Son to the Right Honourable the
Marquiss of Hallifax.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was not without a great deal of debate with my
self, that I could resolve to make this Present to
Your Lordship: For though Epistles Dedicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
be lately grown so Epidemical, that either
sooner or later, no man of Quality (whom the least
Author has the least pretence to be troublesome to)
can escape them; yet methought Your Lordship should
be as much above the common Perplexities that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Your Quality, as You are above the common
Level of it, as well in the most Exalted Degrees of a
Noble Generous Spirit, as in a piercing Apprehension,
good Understanding, and daily ripening Judgment, all
sweetned by an obliging Affability and Condescention;
of which I have often, in the Honour of Your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
had particular cause to be proud; and for
which therefore, a more than ordinary reason, now,
to be Grateful.</p>
            <p>And it is upon that pretence, I here presume to shelter
this Trifle under Your Protection; for indeed, it has
great need of such Protection: having at its first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the World met with many Enemies, and
<pb facs="tcp:59663:3"/>
very industrious ones too; but this way I was sure it
must live: <hi>Would He but once vouchsafe to espouse its
Defence, whose Generosity will overthrow the ignoblest
Envy; whose good Nature, cannot but confound the
most inveterate Malice; and whose Wit must baffle the
sauciest Ignorance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> It would but argue me of the meanest
Impertinence and Formality, to pretend here an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue
of those Praises You deserve: For he who
tells the World whose Son You are, has said enough
to those who do not know You; and the happy few,
whom You have pick'd and chosen for Your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
cannot but every hour You are pleased to
bestow upon them, be sensible of more than I could
tell them in a Volume: Your Lordship being the
best Panegyrick upon Your self; the Son of that
Great Father of his Country, who when all manner
of Confusion, Ruin, and Destruction, was breaking
in upon us, like the Guardian Angel of these Kingdoms,
stood up; and with the Tongue of an Angel too,
confounded the Subtleties of that Infernal Serpent, who
would have debauched us from our Obedience, and
turned our <hi>Eden</hi> into a Wilderness. Certainly His
Name must be for ever Honourable, Precious His
Memory, and Happy His Generation, who durst exert
his Loyalty, when it was grown almost a reproach
to have any, and stem a torrent of Faction, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Fury, and fermenting Rebellion, to the Preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the best of Kings in his Throne, and the happiest
of People in their Liberties.</p>
            <p>May he live long to compleat the Reparations he
<pb facs="tcp:59663:3"/>
has made in our Defence; still by the strength of
his Judgment, to foresee those Evils that may yet
threaten us, and by the Power of his Wisdom to
prevent them; to root out the Footing and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the Kings open (nay, and bosome) Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
As a watchful, bold, and sincere Counsellor
to his Master; to be a driver of Treacherous, Grinning,
Self-ended Knaves, Insinuating Spies, and useless
unprofitable Fools from his Service: A Patron and
and Promoter of Honesty, Merit, and Ability,
which else too often, by neglect, are corrupted to their
Contraries.</p>
            <p>In fine, to continue (as he is) a kind Indulgent
Father to Your Lordship, so much every way his
Son, and fit to Inherit his Honours, as in the strong
and shining Virtues of Your Mind, the fixt and
steady disposition of Your Loyalty, the goodness
and obliging temper of Your Nature, is apparent; by
which only I must ever humbly confess, and no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive
Merit of my own, I have been incouraged
to take this Opportunity of telling the World how
much I desire to be thought,</p>

               <speaker>Beaug.</speaker>
               <p>SIR, I say, and say again, No Matrimony; I'll not be noos'd.
Why, I beseech you, Sir, tell me Plainly and fairly, What
have I done, that I deserve to be married!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fath.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Sauce-box, I, your old Father, was married
before you were born.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Beaug.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, Sir; and I thank you, the next thing you did, was, you begot
me; the Consequence of which was as follows: As soon as I was born, you
sent me to Nurse, where I suckt two years at the dirty Dugs of a foul-feeding
Witch, that liv'd in a thatch't Sty upon the neighb'ring Common;
as soon as I was big enough, that you might be rid of me, you sent me to a
Place call'd a School, to be slash't and box't by a thick-fisted Blockhead,
that could not read himself; where I learnt no Letters, nor got no Meat,
but such as the old <hi>Succubus</hi> his Wife bought at a stinking Price, so over-run
with Vermin, that it us'd to crawl home after her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fath.</speaker>
               <p>Sirrah, it was the more nourishing, and made such young, idle
Whoresons as you fat, fat, you Rogue. I remember the young Dog at
twelve years old had a broad, shining, pufft, Bacon-face, like a Cherubim;
and now he won't marry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Beaug.</speaker>
               <p>My next Removal was home again; and then you did not know
what to do with me farther, till after Twelve-months Deliberation, out
of abundance of Fatherly Affection and Care of your Posterity, you very
civilly and fairly turn'd me out of your Doors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fath.</speaker>
               <p>The impudent, termagant, unruly Varlet rebell'd with too much
Plenty, and took up Arms against my Concubine. Turn'd you out of my
Doors!</p>

               <speaker>Beaug.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, turn'd me out of Doors, Sir.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fath.</speaker>
               <p>Had I not reason, Master Hector?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Beaug.</speaker>
               <p>As I had then, so have I now too, Sir, more Manners than to
dispute the Pleasure of a Father.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fath.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, the Rogue has Breeding, that's the truth on't; the Dog
would be a very pretty Fellow, if I could but perswade him to marry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Beaug.</speaker>
               <p>Turn'd out of Doors as I was, you may remember, Sir, you gave

               <p>Bless us all! Industry and Vertue, quoth a! Nay, I have a very

            <sp>
               <speaker>Beaug.</speaker>
               <p>Till at last a good Uncle, who now, Peace be with his Soul, sleeps
with his Fathers, bestow'd a Portion of Two hundred pounds upon me,
with which I took Shipping, and set Sail for the Coast of Fortune.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fath.</speaker>
               <p>That is to say, You went to the Wars, to learn the Liberal Arts
of Murder, Whoredom, Burning, Ravishing, and a few other necessary
Accomplishments for a young Gentleman to set up a Livelihood withal,
in this Civil Government, where, Heav'n be prais'd, none of those Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
need grow rusty.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Beaug.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I hope I have brought you no Dishonour home with me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fath.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, the <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>-Monkey has not behav'd himself unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly,
that's the truth of the Bus'ness; but the Varlet won't marry: the
Dog has got Two thousand pound a year left him by an old curmudgeonly
moldy Uncle, and I can't perswade him to marry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Beaug.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, that curmudgeonly moldy Uncle you speak of, was your El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Brother, and never married in all his Life: He, dying, bequeaths me
Two thousand pound a year: You, Sir, the younger Brother, and my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
Father, have been married, and are not able, for ought I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
to leave me a bent Ninepence: So, Sir, I wish you a great deal of
Health, Long life, and merry as it has been hitherto; but for Marriage, it
has thriven so very ill with my Family already, that I am resolved to have
nothing to do with it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fath.</speaker>
               <p>Here's a Rogue! Here's a Villain! Why, Sirrah, you have lost
all Grace; you have no Duty left; you are a Rebel: I shall see you hang'd,
Sirrah. Come, come, let me examine you a little, while I think on't:
What Religion are you of?—hah?—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Beaug.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I hope you took care, after I was born, to see me Christen'd.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fath.</speaker>
               <p>Oh Lord! Christen'd! Here's an Atheistical Rogue, thinks he
has Religion enough, if he can but call himself a Christian!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Beaug.</speaker>

               <p>Married! That is, thou call'st a Woman thou likest by the name
of Wife: Wife and t'other thing begin with a Letter. Thou liest with
her when thy Appetite calls thee, keepest the Children thou begettest of her
Body; allowest her Meat, Drink, and Garments, fit for her Quality, and
thy Fortune; and when she grows heavy upon thy Hands, what a' Pox,

the name of Wife; and lie with her, for the most part, with no Appetite

laying your self athwart my Harser, boarding me upon the Forecastle,
clapping all under Hatches, carrying of the Prize to the next Port of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,

to speak properly, were Raskals; for in a short time they conspired

               <p>Of the Religion of the <hi>Inner-Temple,</hi> the Common-Law Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
I believe in the Law, trust in the Law, enjoy what I have by the Law:
For if such a Religious Gentleman as you are get Fifty pounds into my

as I apprehend, is but a sort of a shallow Monster. Fear of Hell! No,
Sir, 'tis fear of Hanging. Who would not steal, or do murder, every time
his Fingers itch't at it, were it not for fear of the Gallows? Do not you,
with all your Religion, swear almost as often as you speak? break and
prophane the Sabbath? lie with your Neighbours Wives? and covet their
Estates, if they be better than your own? Yet those things are forbid by
Religion, as well as Stealing and Cutting of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Throats are. No, had every
Commandment but a Gibbet belonging to it, I should not have had Four

Drinking mightily; and to tell ye the truth on't, I am never so well
satisfied in my out-of-the-way Principles, as when I am drunk, very drunk.
Drunkenness is a great Quietter of the Mind, a great Soother of the

for some weighty Considerations, to give a Treat to the People of the
<hi>Duke's Theatre,</hi> after the Play's done, upon their Stage; we are to have the
Musick too, and the Ladies, 'tis hoped, will not deny us the Favour of
their fair Company. Now, my dear Iniquity, shall we not, thinkest thou,
if we give our Minds to it, pass an Evening pleasantly enough?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dared.</speaker>
               <p>Rot me, with all my Heart: I love the Project of Treating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage extremely too. But will there, will there be none of the
Poets there? Some of the Poets are pretty Fellows, very pretty Fellows;
they are most of 'em my Disciples in their Hearts, and now and then stand
up for the Truth manfully.</p>

resolv'd to storm a certain Enchanted Castle, where I apprehend a fair
Lady newly enter'd into League with an honest Friend of thine, call'd my

her Guardian. Thou wilt make one at it, wilt thou not, my little <hi>Dare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devil?</hi>

a Son, with a great deal of Money, ows an honest old Daddy, that has none.</p>

Heart is at home again. Let me see; I have a hundred and a hundred
times wish'd my self a Man; and now, in outward appearance, I am a very
Fellow; nay, a very pretty Fellow: for, methinks Foppery, Impertinence,
Self-conceit, and other Masculine Qualities grow upon me strangely.—Oh,
Mischief, Mischief, Mischief! thou art a very sweet-Employment:—But Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity!

               <p>Ladyship, Huzzy! take notice from this important Moment, I am no
more your Mistress; but that Imperial Creature, your Master: and therefore
know too, I will have my Foeminine Habiliments burnt instantly, and an Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
sent for to make me a Beard grow. I will learn to Ride, Fence, Vault,
and make Fortifications in Dirt-Pyes: Nay, if the humour hold, I'll go Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntier
into <hi>Germany</hi> against the <hi>Turk.</hi>

home, to talk of Marches, Battels and Sieges, which I never was at, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
any more than the Fools I tell my story to. If I stay at home, with the privilege of good Cloaths, Pertness and much Simplicity, will I set up for a Spark, grow familiar at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and impudent with some great Man there or another; run in Debt with a high Hand, be terrible in eating Houses,
and noisy all over the Town.</p>

of a very Prison, I have resolv'd to put as good a face upon the matter as it will
bear, and make my misfortune as easie as I can. Wherefore, for a little present
diversion, I have contrived a Letter in an unknown name, by this young Agent
here, and convey'd it to thy lewd Husband, with another in my own to <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard;</hi>
and sent for thee, my Dear, to share in the pleasure of the Consequence.</p>

the Hangings for a concealed Lover. It may too, by chance, produce me some
lucky opportunity once more to make my Escape out of their merciless Power.
Nay, they are already half disposed to run away themselves; for by my Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
interest in the Chirurgeon, who has care of the swearing Atheistical Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
yesterday hurt in the scuffle, and afterwards conveyed hither, he gives it
out, that he fears his Wounds may be mortal. Upon which, my Lover <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
sighs, and turns up his Eyes like a Godly Brother at Exercise. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Theodoret</hi> puffs, swells, grinds his Teeth, and stamps as if he would brain
himself against the next Wall; while poor <hi>Beaugard's</hi> ne'er be good Father
has, with pure fear, lost a red Nose that has been his fast Friend for these 40
years; and every time he sees his Face in a Glass, fancies every Wrinkle there

               <p>As I hope to see you happy, Madam, I put it as fast here between these
two poor naked Breasts here, as ever it could stick, so I did, when, just as I
was going forth, who should meet me but the old, wicked, ranting, roaring
Gentleman that lies hid here for fear of hanging, would he had been well hang'd
a Twelvemonth since; and there he fell a towzing, and a mowzing, and a
meddling with me; I was never so afraid of being ravish'd in my life, Gad he
knows: So in the struggle, I guess the Note was lost truly; though, in my heart, I
wish I had been ravish'd six times over, rather than such a misfortune had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.

another, without Money in his pocket, is in a very hopeful condition. In the
