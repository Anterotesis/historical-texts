         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

such and so many goodly strong Corporations, as it

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Xcellent and High
Renowned Prince, since
such time as it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Lord Treasurer to
referre the Peticion of M.
<hi>Henry Honnings,</hi> vnto the
Irish Commissioners, for the vndertaking
of threescore thousand Acres of the Eschea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Lands in the North of Ireland, to bee
planted by certaine English Gentlemen, of
which my selfe being one, considering the
greatnes of the Action, to satisfie my selfe I
passed the Seas, and not farre from the <hi>Lyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
I found that very worthy Gentleman,
Sir <hi>Arthur Chichester,</hi> the Kings Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie
with other Commissioners, surueying
<pb facs="tcp:2810:4"/>
those escheated Lands from the Church
Lands, and from their Lands who haue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
bene loyall.</p>
            <p>I being there conuersant with some of the
chiefe Knights and Captaines, desired of
them to know the cause why they themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
were not forward to vndertake those
profitable seates and rich grounds: I was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that to build Castles and Fortes was
chargeable, neither then if there should be
a Mannor erected with twentye or fortye
Tennants, would they and it secure their
goods: for although that Castle or Forte
would serue for a sufficient refuge to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
their liues vpon any extremitie, yet the
cruell wood-kerne, the deuowring Woolfe,
and other suspitious Irish, would so attend
on their busines, as their being there should
be little profitable vnto them. For an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
Sir <hi>Tobye Cawlfield</hi> he dwelleth in <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemount</hi>
a Forte of many other the best, and
well furnished with men and munition: yet
now (euen in this faire calme of quiet) his
people are driuen euery night to lay vp all
his Cattle as it were in warde, and doe hee
<pb facs="tcp:2810:4"/>
and his what they can, the Woolfe and the
Wood-kerne (within Calieuer shot of his
Forte) haue often times a share: yet I do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
beleeue, no man keepeth better order,
aswell for the safeguard of himselfe and his
neighbors, as for the gouernment of al those
parts about him.</p>
            <p>The like I haue obserued in many other
places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to speake the truth, all men there
in all places doe the like, and that within the
English Pale (as they a long time haue cald
it) Sir <hi>Iohn King</hi> he dwelleth within halfe a
mile of <hi>Dublin:</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Harringto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> within
halfe a mile on the other side thereof, Fewe
men that euer I haue seene better seated for
much good Soyle: they also doe the like, for
those sore named enemies, doe euery night
suruey the Fields to the very wals of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
whatsoeuer is left abroad is in danger to be
lost: so they cannot for the foresaid causes
contriue any thing to much profit, although
it hath bene inhabited a long time.</p>
            <p>The consideration whereof satisfied me
with the impossibilitie of planting a Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nor
vnder the protection of any strong built
<pb facs="tcp:2810:5"/>
Castle; but after that I had trauailed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst
the meere Irish, and had sufficiently infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
my selfe with their conditions, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and manner of life, I found it most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
impossible by such kinde of plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to improue any thing with security, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great profit, neither any with whome I
conferred, would or could set downe how
with security any thing might be vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>Therefore the principall studd of this
frame must be wrought with a tennor more
substantiall then hath bene hitherto by any
one mencioned.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge and see it sufficiently, that
many Castles and fortes well fortified, doth
and wil restraine the violence of such a scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
people as they are, being at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
altogether without men of conduct or
armour, but I thinke those Castles &amp; Fortes
more necessary in time of warre; for then
thereby the Cattell of the Rebels are cut off,
and they are inforced to vnite themselues
into many strong troopes, otherwise the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
of those places would bereaue them
<pb facs="tcp:2810:5"/>
of all their victuals, and hinder their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and all their other intentions
whatsoeuer, for they cannot be strong y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
at one instant in euery place to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter
the force of those millitary garrisons,
who are maintained at a great rate (as I
thinke) out of the Exchequer: for these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers
to plant themselues so in this time
of quiet, I doe verily beleeue it would be to
small auaile, and not the best way to secure
themselues with their goods, and that wilde
country to the Crowne of England; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there be no apparant enemy, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
visible maine force, yet the wood-kerne
and many other (who now haue put on the
smiling countenaunce of contentment) doe
threaten euery houre, if oportunitie of time
and place doth serue, to burne and steale
whatsoeuer: and besides them there be two,
the chief supporters of al their insolencie, the
inaccessable woods, &amp; the not passible bogs:
which ot subiect to our desires is not easie,
and that not performed, it is not possible to
make a profitable, improuement, no not by
any meanes in any place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2810:6"/>
Moreouer the frowning countenance of
chance and change, (for nothing so certaine
as that all thinges are most vncertaine) doth
also incite a prouident vndertaker to lay
such a foundation, as it should be rather a
violent storme then a fret of foule weather
that should anoy him. A scattered plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will neuer effect his desire: what can the
countenance of a Castle or Bawne with a
fewe followers doe? euen as they at this
present doe: which is nothing to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>What shall we then say? or to what course
shal we betake our selues? surely by building
of a wel fortified Towne, to be able at any
time at an houres warning with fiue hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred
men well armed, to encounter all occasions:
neither will that be sufficient, except that be
seconded with such another, and that also (if
it may be, as easily it may) with a third: so
there will be helpe on euery side, to defend,
&amp; offend: for as in England, if a priuy watch
be set, many malefactors are apprehended,
euen amongst their cuppes: so there when
the spaces in the Woods be cut out, and the
<pb facs="tcp:2810:6"/>
bogges be made somewhat passible, then
these new erected townes intending a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
must often times at the first set a
vniuersall great hunt, that a suddaine search
may be made in all suspitious places, for the
Woolfe and the Wood-kerne, which being
secretly and wisely appointed by the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
they with the helpe of some Irish, well
acquainted with the holes and holdes of
those offenders, the generallitie shall search
euery particular place.</p>
            <p>For an example, the fourth day of March,
the <hi>Lyfford,</hi> the <hi>Omigh,</hi> they in <hi>Farmanagh,
Donganon,</hi> and <hi>Colrayne,</hi> shall on that day
send forth from euery one of those places,
an hundred men; which fiue hundred men
shall as then make search in all, or in all the
most suspitious places: and by being at one
instant dispersed with furniture fit for such
busines, they shall discouer all the Caues,
holes, &amp; lurking places of that country, euen
for an hundred miles compasse: &amp; no doubt
it will be a pleasant hunt, and much preye<note place="margin">Hassets <hi>Hunt.</hi>
               </note>
will fall to the followers: for what dooth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
some, will fall to the hands of others,
<pb facs="tcp:2810:7"/>
and bring such a terror, that the woolfe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
will not dare to continue his haunt,
where such so suddaine incursions shall be
vsed, although it be but once in a moneth:
the charge none, the pleasure much, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
more: then may they make inclosures, &amp;
venture their Cattell abroad, for to starue in
the night doth ouerthrow the feede of the
day, with the generall improuement and
chief profit, for the feeding of al kind of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:
then may they sowe, mowe, plant, thriue
&amp; be merry, for this kind of planting wil not
onely supplant those domesticall enemies,
but there will be out of those townes fiue
thousand well armed men, to encounter any
forraine enemy, that shall offer arriuall to
inuade, whereby his Maiestie shall shortly
haue little neede of those so chargeable gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons:
For these vndertakers will easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
the mutinies of them at home, and
confront the power of any inuader whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
and those good fellowes in trowzes, I
meane the euery where dispersed creatures
in the creats, seeing this course, they will no
longer hearken after change, nor entertaine
<pb facs="tcp:2810:7"/>
the lurking wood-kerne, as now they doe.</p>
            <p>Throughout all Ireland where there be
Fortes and garrisons in paye, if all those
places were planted with this kinde of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
&amp; the old worthy Soldiers, who
in those places haue garrisons in pay, with
euery one of their Soldiers, if they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
with the fee simple thereof, to them
&amp; to their heires, paying after one life yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnto his Maiestie a fee-farme, as the other
vndertakers doe: but these Captaines and
Soldiers would haue their pay continued,
otherwise they shall not be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
with the charge of planting, and
then other lands there next adioyning laide
also to such places, that many might ioyne
with them to erect corporations: which may
be performed now ten times better cheape
then it wil be heerafter: their security would
be much better, and the societye farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
&amp; so the charge of the garrisons might
be withdrawne, the olde worthy warriour
who hath gone already through with the
brunt of that busines, shall with a good satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
be rewarded, and all Vlster a whole
<pb facs="tcp:2810:8"/>
hundred times better secured vnto the
Crowne of England: for the generation of
the Irish, (who doe at this time encrease ten
to one more then the English, nay I might
well say twenty) will neuer otherwise be
sufficently brideled: of all which I would sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your highnes by an example.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lyfford,</hi> whereas there be an hundred
Soldiers in pay, (as is reported) which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come vnto lesse then a thousand pounds
yearely, and if there were in that kingdome
many such, it would amount vnto a great
somme by the yeare, and many of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
like this, able indeed a smal time
to withstand the first or second assault of a
weake enemie. But if the <hi>Lyfford</hi> and the
Lands adioyning neere thereunto, were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
by many, their many helping
hands (euery man respecting his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit)
they would not regard charge, not be
weary with labor and paines to frame a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
security, and good successe to their
businesse: and so there might out of dout by
that goodly riuer side, be laid out so much
land, (besides the Gouernours and Soldiers
<pb facs="tcp:2810:8"/>
allowance) as the vndertakers would cleere
all that pay, and the like in many such other
places: and giue vnto the Crowne a hundred
pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds yerely for a fee-farme for euer, which
would rise in that kingdome, to every great
masse, and the great charge of the garrisons
withdrawne. I might say the like of the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migh,</hi>
of <hi>Dongannon,</hi> and of many such other
places, and so there would be in stead of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
true religion; &amp; a comfortable society,
whereas at this present, there is small appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and much defect of them, and of all
other the chiefest things to make the life of
man happy, onely plenty of good victuall
excepted.</p>
            <p>How exceedingly wel standeth <hi>Ardmath,</hi>
better seate for rich soyle there cannot bee,
but so poore, as I doe verily thinke all the
houshold stuffe in that Citty is not worth
twenty pounds, yet it is the Primate of all
Ireland, &amp; as they say for antiquitie, one of
the most antient in all Europe: it is also of so
small power as forty resolute men, may rob,
rifle, and burne it: were it a defenced corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
it would soone be rich and religious,
<pb facs="tcp:2810:9"/>
and the security would make one acre more
worth then now twenty be. At this present
it is a most base and abiect thing, not much
better then <hi>Strebane,</hi> &amp; not able to restraine,
no, not the violence of the Woolte. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
many be the commodities of this kinde
of vndertaking a scattered pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
vndertakers to be dispersed three score
miles in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe, alas they shal be now at the
first like the vnboundsticks of a brush fagot,
easie to be gathered, hewen and had to
the fire, neither shall there be true Religion,
sweete society, nor any comfortable securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
amongst them, no, nor any other the
principall respectes and commodities that
mans life desireth, as they who there now
doe liue do know very well: but in one and
the selfe-same estate for many to be bound
vp together in the band of one hope, so as
all must be but one, It must be the power of
some great Monarch, who receiuing more
blowes then benefites, shall buy the vnbind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this fagot, at a much greater rate then
will be for his gaine or reputation.</p>
            <p>But some peraduenture will say here is
<pb facs="tcp:2810:9"/>
much speech of corporations, but nothing
how the Lands which lyeth farre remote,
which these vndertakers must take vp, shall
be vsed, for it will be very inconuenient that
vnto this corporation all the commodities
of that great quantity of ground shal be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
transported, both for the distance of
the place, and other discommodities: and it
is expected that there should be Manors
erected, &amp; not that one corporation should
containe so great a circuit. My answere is,
that the corporation shall containe all that
quantity of ground, for when they therein
haue framed the country to their desires,
then there shall be by these vndertakers
many Manors erected, and after the first
or second yeare, most of the houses within
this corporation built by these vndertakers,
(for euery man according to the quantity of
his land must put to his aide) although these
houses shall be still their owne, yet then,
when the great Huntes before mentioned,
haue reduced the country to such passe, as in
the seueralties of euery man, their Cattell
may be in security, then most of those buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
<pb facs="tcp:2810:10"/>
in the corporation shall be left, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man of the vndertakers shall build on
his demeanes a strong Mannor house, and
certaine Tenements for his Tenants about
him, on such Lands as he shall allot them by
coppy of Court role, or otherwise, to them
and their heires for euer: and within the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,
euery one of the vndertakers shall
stil retaine his mansion house, there to dwel
at his pleasure, and all the other of his hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
there, shall be set ouer vnto tradesmen; as
Shoomakers, Smithes, Carpenters, Weauers,
and such like: so in Sommer he may remain
with his tennants in the country, and in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with his farmers the tradesmen in the
corporation, which I hope to see a faire well
gouerned and a very strong Citty, which
will serue at all times to defend them and all
their moueables, if inuasion or any other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
storme should come: so all the land
farre remote shall be built and inhabited
with good security.</p>
            <p>On this word <hi>Myne</hi> is a strong warrior, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man for his owne will aduenture farre,
the Mercinary <hi>Rutter</hi> will often times haue
<pb facs="tcp:2810:10"/>
his charge empty with men, when his purse
shall be full with dead payes. This my vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and prouident warriour <hi>Myne,</hi> he will
rather increase then decrease his nomber,
he doth watch and ward night &amp; day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ceasing. Therefore in this our vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
let all the people be such as shall enioy
euery man more or lesse of his owne, and if
they were such as had no other estate then
there, it were the better.</p>
            <p>But I feare, if many shall peruse this reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
most of them wil be vtterly deterred with
the charge, saying, it is easie to be spoken,
but to their capacitie very difficult to be per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formed,
and so they will withdrawe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
&amp; their conceits from imbracing that
which I would haue them entertaine chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
in the best fashion. Therefore I doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
them to consider, that all those great
and sumptuous buildings which former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
haue left vnto euerlasting posterity, were
not erected any where, where continuance
of peace had improued all thinges to a high
rate and great price, but the originall of all
nations, was where and when the Lands and
<pb facs="tcp:2810:11"/>
all the commodities of those places were of
small worth. To enter into the perticular
heereof would be rather tedious then neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
            <p>There be twelue of vs vnder the assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the right honorable, <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earle of
<hi>Shrewesbury,</hi> who intend by the help of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God to imploye a good part of our
substance, and bestowe our best indeuours
therein: for discoursing will not doe it, it
must be a paineful hand, &amp; a discreet minde
furnished with knowledge and much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience:
we cannot enioy the happy <hi>Elizian</hi>
fields, but by passing ouer the blacke riuer
<hi>Stix:</hi> for heauen wil not be had without some
tribulation, neither may we feede vpon the
delicates prepared in a rich and plesant ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting
Gallery, except we doe straine our
feete to passe vpon the first &amp; second staire:
so difficult is the thing that we intend, <hi>Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
toti, qui bene caepit, habet.</hi> If any thing
seeme difficult, rouse vp thy spirit, and put
to both thy hands. Great thinges without
much labor can not be obtained: <hi>Rome</hi> was
not built in one day, but this in fiue yeares
<pb facs="tcp:2810:11"/>
may be performed without admiration, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
if all these planters do draw closely
together without dissentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or muteny: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there must especiall regard be had, that
in this corporation the chiefe Gouernor be
of wisdome, wealth, and authoritie, such a
one as wil be obeyed, yet will conferre with
other, and not be too much addicted to his
owne conceits: without gouernment there is
nothing but confusion: so many heads so
many opinions. Let all the vndertakers haue
recourse vnto the consultations, the meanest
may sometimes bring foorth a necessary
knowledge, therefore let euery mans opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be heard, but let the Gouernor with his
assistants determine, and let all the rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
thereto, or endure condigne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And as for thee that puttest diffidence in
the assurance, which thou shalt haue from
his Maiestie, thou needest not trouble thy
head therwith, there hath bene already two
suruaies to know the parcels and precincts
exactly: no doubt vpon the deuision there
will be proclamation, that whosoeuer can
<pb facs="tcp:2810:12"/>
iustly and apparantly claime any part of
those Lands to these vndertakers by Pattent
assigned, he shall then within some conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
time put in his claime or else be silent for
euer.</p>
            <p>So before thou doost charge thy selfe any
way, thy portion shall be cleere, or else thou
shalt haue some other that shall be voide of
all incombrance.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, to comfort thy fearefull spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
there thou shalt haue many good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
for all they thy countrymen that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
there estated with part of those Lands,
of which there be many of the chiefe in that
kingdome, they are hearty well willers vnto
al vndertakers, both for that your good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
will second, and as it were fortifie
their already beginnings: and they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
Gentlemen of such sort and quality, as
they speake alwaies what they thinke, and
performe what they speake. They doe not
after the fashion of this age carry bread in
the one hand and a stone in the other; but
they haue a sword alwaies ready to maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
truth and equity; besides a very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb facs="tcp:2810:12"/>
course of proceeding by law: And to
knit thy affection more firmely to the hope
of thy well doing there, I doe insure thee,
there be excellent warriors, and they such
worthy men as wil willingly backe thy busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
&amp; in time of need violently abate the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
of any that shal inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thy trouble: so
<hi>Mars</hi> himselfe shall protect thee, &amp; perhaps
<hi>Mercury</hi> too: &amp; if thou beest honestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with that which is thine, thou mayest
there liue and neuer trouble the Lawyer, and
thou shalt finde it to be a great blessing. All
which I haue written to encourage thy fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
spirit, which rather then faile wil obiect
the charges thither, and the danger, which is
nothing so much as amongst good fellowes
it is, to be beastly drunke at home.</p>
            <p>To conclude, what art thou? one whome

make speede, get thee to <hi>Vlster,</hi> serue

<pb facs="tcp:2810:13"/>
make speed without racking of rents,

            <p>Art thou a poore indigent fellow? and hast
neither faculty nor mony? goe not thither,
for though there be plenty of all thinges,
thou shalt starue there, Loyterers and lewd
persons in this our new worlde, they will
not be indured. Art thou a Tradesman? a
Smith, a Weauer, a Mason, or a Carpenter?
goe thither, thou shalt be in estimation, and
quickely inriched by thy indeauours. Art
thou an husband man, whose worth is not
past tenne or twenty pounds? goe thither,
those new Manor-makers will make thee a
Coppy holder: thou shalt whistle sweetely,
and feede thy whole family if they be six for
six pence the day. Art thou a Gentleman
that takest pleasure in hunt? the Fox, the
Woolfe, and the Wood-kerne doe expect
thy comming: and the comely well cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
Stagge will furnish thy feast with a full

dish. There thou shalt haue elbowe roome,
the Eagle and the Earne and all sorts of high
flying fowles do attend thee. Art thou a
Minister of Gods word? make speed, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
is great but the laborers be fewe: thou
shalt there see the poore ignorant vntaught
people worship stones and sticks: thou by
carrying millions to heauen, maiest be made
an Archangell, and haue whiles thou doost
liue for worldly respects, what not. So <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
which hath bene hitherto the receptacle
