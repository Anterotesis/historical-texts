            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>If we should Challenge separately, there must be so many separate Tryals, and therefore to prevent the trouble of the Court, I am willing there should be but one Challenge for all.</p>

               <p>Yes, yes.</p>

               <speaker>Mr Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>IF your Lordship please, the Pannel is now gone through, I desire they may shew some legal Cause for their Challenges.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr Iones.</speaker>
               <p>I conceive we that are retain'd for the King are not bound to shew any Cause, or the Cause is sufficient if we say they are not Good for the King, and that is allow'd to be a good Cause of Challenge, for what other Cause can we shew in this Case. You are not to shew your Cause, you Challenge peremptorily, so in this Case the King does.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I stand at the Bar with some disadvantage, to encounter a Gentleman that hath no Concernment; but however, I do take it for Law, that there must be a Cause shew'd, and that Cause must be a legal one, and what that Cause is they must certainly make out. I do think it ought to appear that there is some relation, or some notorious affection or friendship, or something of that sort, or otherwise it is not a legal Cause of Challenge; and if there seem to be any difficulty in this particular, I hope your Lordship will assign me Councel to argue it with the Kings Councel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr Baron Hatsell.</speaker>
               <p>Mr <hi>Cowper,</hi> you are not under such disadvantage as men usually are that stand where you now do. You have been educated in the study of the Law, and understand it very well, I have several times seen how you have manag'd your Clients Causes to their advantage. As for this matter of Challenge, Mr <hi>Iones,</hi> I think you should shew your Cause of Challenge, tho the Law allows the Prisoner the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to Challenge 20 peremptorily.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr Iones.</speaker>
               <p>I don't know, in all my practice of this nature, that it was ever put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King to shew Cause, and I believe some of the Kings Councel will say they have not known it done.</p>

               <speaker>Mr Iones</speaker>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen that are sworn, I am of Councel for the King in this Cause, and it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon an Indictment by which the Gentlemen at the Bar stand accus'd for one of the foulest and most wicked Crimes almost that any age can remember; I believe in your County you never knew a fact of this nature: For here is a young Gentlewoman of this County murder'd and strangled in the night time. The thing was done in the dark, therefore the Evidence cannot be so plain as otherwise might be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65427:3"/>After she was strangled and murder'd, she was carried and thrown into a River to stifle the fact, and to make it suppos'd that she had murder'd herself; that it was ineded, if it prove otherwise, a double Murder, and a Murder accompanied with all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Wickedness and Villany that I remember in all my Practice, or ever read of.</p>
               <p>This Fact, as it was committed in the night time, so it was carried very secret, and it is very well we have had so much light as we have to give so much satisfaction: For we have here in a manner two Tryals, one to acquit the party that is dead, and to satisfie the world, and vindicate her reputation that she did not murder herself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but was murder'd by other hands. For my part, I shall never as Councel in the case of Blood aggravate; I will not improve or enlarge the Evidence at all, it shall be only my business to set the Fact as it is, and to give the Evidence, and state it as it stands here in my Instructions.</p>
               <p>My Lord, for that purpose, to lead to the Fact, it will be necessary to inform you that upon <hi>Monday</hi> the 13th of <hi>March,</hi> the first day of the last Assizes here, Mr <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> one of the Gentlemen at the Bar, came to this Town, and lighted at Mr <hi>Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi>'s house, and staid there some time, I suppose, to dry himself, the weather being<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirty, but sent his Horse to Mrs <hi>Stout</hi>'s, the Mother of this Gentlewoman. Some time after he came thither himself, and din'd there, and staid till 4 in the afternoon; at 4 when he went away, he told them he would come and lodge there that night, and Sup.</p>
               <p>According to his word he came there, and had the Supper he desired, after Supper Mrs <hi>Stout</hi> the young Gentlewoman and he sat together till near 11 a clock. At 11 a clock there was orders given to warm his Bed, openly to warm his Bed in his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Maid of the house, Gentlemen, upon this went up stairs to warm his Bed, expecting the Gentleman would have come up and followed her before she had done, but it seems while she was warming of the Bed she heard the door clap together, and the nature of that door is such, that it makes a great noise at the clapping of it to, that any body in the House may be sensible of any ones going out. The Maid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this was concern'd, and wonder'd at the meaning of it, he promising to lye there that night; she came down, but there was neither Mr <hi>Cowper</hi> nor Mrs <hi>Stout,</hi> so that we suppose, and for all that we can find and learn, they must go out together. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their going out, the Maid and Mother came into the Room, and the young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman not returning, nor Mr <hi>Cowper,</hi> they sat up all night in the house, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what time the young Gentlewoman would return. The next morning after they had sat up all night, the first news of this Lady was, that she lay floating and swimming in water by the Mill-Damm. Upon that there was several persons call'd; for it was a surprize how this should come to pass. There she lay floating with her Petticoats and Apron, but her Night-rail and Morning-gown were off, and one of them not found till some time after; and the Maid will give you an account how it came to be found.</p>
               <p>This made a great noise in the Country; for it was very extraordinary, it hapning that from the time the Maid left Mr <hi>Cowper</hi> and this young Gentlewoman together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she was not seen or heard of till next morning, when she was found in this condition, with her Eyes broad open, floating upon the water.</p>
               <p>When her Body came to be view'd it was very much wonder'd at: For in the first place it is contrary to nature, that any persons that drown themselves, should float upon the water. We have sufficient Evidence that it is a thing that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, if persons come alive into the water then they sink, if dead then they swim, that made some more curious to look into this matter. At first it was thought that such an accident might happen, though they could not imagin any cause for this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to do so, who had so great Prosperity, had so good an Estate, and had no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to do an action upon her self so wicked and so barbarous, nor cannot learn what reason she had to induce her to such a thing. Upon view of the Body it did appear there had been violence used to the woman, there was a crease round her Neck, she was bruised about her Ear, so that it did seem as if she had been strangled either by Hands or a Rope.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, upon the examination of this matter, it was wondred how this matter came about, it was dark and blind. The Coroner at that time, nor these people had no Evidence given, but the ordinary Evidence, and it pass'd in a day. We must call our Witnesses to this Fact, that of necessity you must conclude she was strangled, and did not drown her self; If we give you as strong a proof as can be upon the nature of the Fact that she was strangled, then the 2d matter under your enquiry will be, to know who, or what persons should be the men that did the Fact. I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was, as all wicked actions are, a matter of darkness, and done in secret, to be kept as much from the knowledge of men as was possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65427:4"/>Truly, Gentlemen, as to the persons at the Bar, the Evidence of the Fact will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> short, and will be to this purpose.</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Cowper</hi> was the last man unfortunately in her Company, I could wish he had not been so with all my heart, 'tis a very unfortunate thing, that his name should upon this occasion be brought upon the Stage; but then, my Lord, it was a strange thing; here happens to be three Gentlemen, Mr <hi>Marson,</hi> Mr <hi>Rogers,</hi> and Mr <hi>Stevens,</hi> as to these 3 men my, Lord, I don't hear of any business they had here, unless it was to do this matter, to serve some Interest or Friend, that sent them upon this message, for my Lord, they came to Town, (and in things of this nature, 'tis well we have this Evidence, but if we had not been streightned in time it would have brought out more, these things come out slowly) these persons, Mr <hi>Stevens,</hi> Mr <hi>Rogers,</hi> and Mr <hi>Marson</hi> came to Town here on the 13th of <hi>March</hi> last, the Assize day: My Lord, when they came to Town, they came to an House, and took Lodgings at one <hi>Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reys,</hi> they took a Bed for two and went out of their Lodging, having taken a room with a large Bed in it, and afterwards they went to the <hi>Glove and Dolphin,</hi> and then about 8 a Clock one <hi>Marson</hi> came to them there; in what company they came, your Lordship and the Jury will know by and by, they staid there, my Lord, at the <hi>Glove</hi> from 8 a Clock to 11, as they say. At 11 these three Gentlemen came all in to their Lodging together to this <hi>Gurreys;</hi> my Lord, when they came in, it was very observable amongst them, unless there had been a sort of fate in it: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>st, That they should happen to be in the condition they were in, and 2dly, fall upon the discourse they did at that time; for my Lord, they call'd for Fire, and the Fire was made them, and while the people of the House were going about, they observ'd and heard these Gentlemen talk of Mrs <hi>Sarah Stout,</hi> that happened to be their discourse, one said to the other, <hi>Marson,</hi> she was an old Sweet-heart of yours: Ay, saith he, but she cast me off, but I reckon by this time a Friend of mine has done her business: another piece of discourse was, I believe a Friend of mine is even with her by this time. They had a bundle of Linnen with them, but what it was is not known, and one takes the bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and throws it upon the Bed, well, saith he, her business is done, Mrs <hi>Sarah Stout</hi>'s courting days are over, and they sent for Wine, my Lord; so after they had drank of the Wine they talk'd of it, and one pulled out a great deal of Money, saith one to another, what Money have you spent to day? Saith the other, thou hast had 40 or 50 <hi>l.</hi> for thy share: Saith the other, I will spend all the money I have, for joy the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is done.</p>
               <p>My Lord, this discourse hapned to be among them, which made the People of the House consider and bethink themselves, when the next day they heard of this Mrs <hi>Stout</hi>'s being found in the water, this made them recollect and call to mind all these discourses.</p>
               <p>My Lord, after these Gentlemen had staid there all night, next morning truly it was observ'd (and I suppose some account will be given of it) that Mr <hi>Cowper</hi> and they did meet together, and had several discourses, and that very day went out of Town, and I think as soon as they came to <hi>Hooddesdon,</hi> made it all their discourse and business to talk of Mrs <hi>Stout.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, we will call our Witnesses, and prove all these Facts that I have opened to your Lordship, and then I hope they will be put to give you some account how all these matters came about. Call <hi>Sarah Walker</hi> (who was sworn)</p>

               <p>No Sir, I did not go out of the doors; I thought you were with her, and so I thought she would come to no harm.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>Here is a whole night she gives no account of. Pray Mistress why did not you go after her?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Walker.</speaker>
               <p>My Mistress would not let me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>Why would she not let you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Walker.</speaker>
               <p>I said I would see for her: No, saith she, by reason if you go and see for her, and do not find her, it will make an alarm over the Town, and there may be no occasion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr Cowper.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Walker.</speaker>
               <p>I don't say but she was melancholy; she was ill for some time, and I imputed it to her illness, and I know no other cause.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>Have you not often told people that your Aeistress was a melancholy person, upon your Oath?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Walker.</speaker>
               <p>I have said she hath been ill, and that made her melancholy.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>I will ask you this question, Pray did you ever purchase any Poyson, more or less, within these twelvemonths?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Walker.</speaker>
               <p>Yes Sir, I did so, and can tell what it was for.</p>

               <p>It was a Dog that us'd to haunt our House that did us a great deal of mischief, but that did not do, so I bought it a 2d time.</p>

               <p>A Surgeon, my Lord. When I was sent for to Mrs <hi>Stout</hi>'s, I was sent for two or three times before I would go; for I was unwilling after I heard Mrs <hi>Stout</hi> was drown'd; for I thought with my self, what need could there be of me when the person was dead; but she still sent; and then I went with Mr <hi>Camlin,</hi> and found a little swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the side of her neck, and she was black on both sides, and more particularly on the left side, and between her Breasts up towards the Collar-bone, that was all I saw at that time, only a little mark upon one of her arms, and I think upon her left arm.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dimsdale.</speaker>
               <p>There was a settling of blood on both sides the neck, that was all I saw at that time.</p>

               <p>My Lord, in <hi>April</hi> last I was sent for by Dr <hi>Philips,</hi> to come to <hi>Hartford</hi> to see the body of <hi>Mrs Stout</hi> opened, who had been 6 weeks buried, and he told me that there was a suspicion she was murthered, and that her Relations were willing to have her taken up and opened. I came down, I think on the 27th of <hi>April,</hi> and lay at Mrs <hi>Stout</hi>'s house that night, and by her discourse I understood she wanted to be satisfied, whether her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was with Child. I told her it was my opinion we should find the parts contained in the <hi>Abdomen</hi> so rotten, that it would be impossible to discover the <hi>Uterus</hi> from the other parts; however, if she would have her opened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could not discover whether she was with Child unless the Infant was become boney. Her face and neck to her shoulders appeared black and so much corrupted, that we wore unwilling to proceed any further; but however her mother would have it done, and so we did open her, and as soone as she was opened we perceived the Stomach and Guts were as full of wind, as if they had been blown with a pair of Bellows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we put her Guts aside, and came to the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and Dr <hi>Philips</hi> shewed it us in his hand, and afterwards cut it out and laid it on the Table, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and we saw into the cavity of it, and if there had been any thing there as minute as a hair, we might have seen it, but it was perfectly free and empty; and after that he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65427:8"/>
put the Intestines into their places, and we bid him open the Stomach, and it was opened with an Incision Knife, and it sunk flat, and let out wind, but no water; afterwards we opened the Breast and Lobes of the Lungs, and there was no water; then we look'd on each side, and took up the Lobes of the Lungs too, to see if there was no Water in the Diaphragm, and there was none, but all dry. Then I remember, I said this woman could not be drowned, for if she had taken in water, the water must have rotted all the Guts; that was the construction I made of it then, but for any marks about her head and neck, it was impossible for us to discover it because they were so rotten.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I would know, and I desire to be heard to this point; I think where the Coroners Inquest have view'd the body, and the relations have been heard, and the Body buried, that it is not to be stirr'd afterwards for any private inspection of parties, that intend to make themselves Prosecutors, but if it is to be taken up, it is to be done by some legal authority, for if it should be otherwise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any Gentleman may be easily trepann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, for instance, if they should have thought fit after the Coroners View to have broken the Skull into a hundred pieces. This was a private view altogether among themselves, certainly if they intended to have prosecuted me, or any other Gentleman upon this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, they ought to have given us notice, that we might have had some Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons amongst them, to super intend their proceedings. My Lord, with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this ought not to be given in Evidence.</p>

               <p>Mr <hi>Cowper</hi> I think you are not in earnest, there is no colour for this objection, if they did take up the body without notice, why should not that be Evidence, unless you think they had a design to forswear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

               <p>On the 28th of <hi>April<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as I remember, I was sent for down by Mrs <hi>Stout,</hi> to view the body of her Daughter. Her Daughter was just taken out of the Ground but not opened, they had just toucht the body, but not opened the Skin when I came there—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr Bar. <hi>Hatsell.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Are you a Surgeon?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dimsdale.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord. Finding her head so much mortified down to her neck, we thought all the parts were seized, and had a consultation whether we should open her or not, but Mrs <hi>Stout</hi> was very much enraged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because a great
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65427:9"/>
scandal had been raised, that her Daughter was with Child, and she said, she would have her opened to clear her reputation; with that we opened her, and found her body as found as any Flesh could be, no manner of putrifaction in her Lungs or any other part, but she was very full of Wind. We searched the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and the Thorax, and found not one drop of water about it, I was more curious than the rest, and turn'd away her Legs, to see if the Coffin was soil'd, and the Coffin and Shrowd were not wet. Her Uterus was taken out, and I saw no manner of sign of Conception. After this we had a consultation to consider, whether she was drown'd or not drowned, and we were all of Opinion that she was not drowned, only Mr <hi>Camlin</hi> desired he might he excused from giving his opinion, whether she was drowned or not, but all the rest of us did give our opinions, that she was not drown'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr <hi>Iones.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Give your reasons, why you believ'd she was not drown'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dimsdale.</speaker>
               <p>My reason was this, beccuse we found no water in her, her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testines were not putrified, for if there had been water in her, that would have caused a fermentation, and that would have rotted the Lungs and Guts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr Bar. <hi>Hatsell.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Could you tell so many weeks after whether she was drowned or no?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dimsdale.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, for this reason, for if she had been drowned, there had been some sign of water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if there had been a pint of water it would have rotted her Lights and her Guts, and that is done in a weeks time by fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr <hi>Cowper.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Sir I desire to know, whether according to reason and your skill after six weeks time, it's possible, there should be water in the Thornx.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dimsdale.</speaker>
               <p>I do believe there may be some, for it can't come out after the body is dead, but by putrifaction, and there was no putrifaction, but it was firm and sound.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dimsdale.</speaker>

               <p>No never. If a body be drown'd a fortnight, the bowels will be so rotten, there will be no coming near it, and I took particular notice, and I did not see one drop of water.</p>

               <p>She was putrified about the head and shoulders and one arm, that I saw was putrified, it was the left arm as I take it.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I believe if she had been drowned, there would have been a putrifaction of the Abdomen first, and it was her extream parts, her arm, her head and her breast, that was putrified, but her Bowels seem'd firm and sound.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr Iones.</speaker>

               <p>Swear Dr <hi>Coatsworth.</hi> (which was done) Now, my Lord, we call these Gentlemen that are Doctors of skill, to know thèir opinion of them, that are found floating without water in them, how they come by their death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr <hi>Coatsworth.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I have not seen many drowned bodies to make observation upon, but it is my opinion, that every body that is drowned is suffocated by water passing down the Wind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pipe into the Lungs upon inspiration, and at the same time, the water pressing upon the Gullet, there will be a necessity of swallowing a great part of it into the Stomach: I have been in danger of being drowned my self, and I was forced to swallow a great quantity of water. If a person was drowned and taken out immediately, as soon as the suffocation was effected, I should not wonder, if there were but little water in the Stomach and Guts, but if it lay in the water several hours, it must be very strange if the belly should not be full of water, but I will not say, it is impossible it should be otherwise.</p>

               <p>It was by accident, I was passing up the Ship side, and took hold of a loose Rope instead of the entring Rope which failing me I fell into the water.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I am of opinion, that it will have a quantity if it be drowned, but if there be no water in the body, I believe that the person was dead before it was put into the water.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, I once had a Gentlewoman a Patient that was half an hour under Water, and she liv'd several hours after, and in all that time she dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd a great quantity of Water; I never heard of any that went alive into the Water, and were drowned, that floated so soon as this Gentlewoman did, I have heard so from Physicians.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Bar. <hi>Hatsell.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I have heard so too, and that they are forc'd to tye a Bullet to dead Bodies thrown into the Sea that they might not rise again.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>The reason of that is, that they should not rise again, not that they will not sink without it; but I would ask Mr. <hi>Babington</hi> whether the Gentlewoman he speaks of went into the Water Voluntarily, on fell in by Accident.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Babington.</speaker>

               <p>When a Person is casually drowned, there may be water found in them, but what is your Opinion in the Case of a Person that goes into the water with a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to drown himself?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Will. Bab.</speaker>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I think that if any Person fall into the Water by Accident, or throws himself in, the Body will receive Water as long as it is alive, and there are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for Respiration, and after these Endeavours are over, there is no Water will come in, for all the Parts are closs'd; so consequently there must be Water in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability found in her.</p>

               <p>I think you say when the Faculty of Respiration ceases, no Water comes in.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Opinion is, that no Person is suffocated by Water, but he must have a great deal of Water within him, a great deal of Water in the Stomach, and some in the Lungs.</p>

               <p>There was some, but a little, but a great deal in the Stomach.</p>

               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Woodhouse.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>While the Person is strugling for Respiration, there may be a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation of, and the Person must suck in Water as well as Air, and some Water may get into the Windpipe, and so enter into the Lungs.</p>

               <p>The Thorax is the Vessel wherein the Lungs lie, the Lungs in the Thorax, the Breast is the Cavity were the Lungs lie, the Wind pipe is the Conveyance to the Lungs, and a Person in Respiration takes down some Water there, but no doubt the greater quantity will be in the Stomach.</p>

               <p>In the Year 89, or 90, in <hi>Beachey</hi> Fight, I saw several thrown over-board, during the Engagement, but one particularly I took notice of, that was my Friend, and kill'd by my side, I saw him swim for a considerable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Ship, and a Ship coming under ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>n who have died natural Deaths at Sea, they have when they have been dead had a considerable weight of Ballast and Shot made fast to them, and so throw them over board; because we hold it for a general Rule that all Men Swim if they be dead before they come into the Water, and on the contrary I have seen Men when they have been drowned, that they have sunk as soon as the Breath was out of their Bodies, and I could see no more of them. For Instance, a Man fell out of the <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and sunk down to rights, and seven Days afterwards we weighed Anchor, and he was brought up grasping his Arms about the Cable, and we have observed in several Cases, that where Men fall over-board, as soon as their Breath is out of their Bodies they sink downright, and on the contrary where a dead Body is thrown over-board without weight it will swim.</p>

I was then belonging to the <hi>Dutchess,</hi> under the Command of Captain <hi>Clement,</hi> we look'd out and see them taking down their Masts, we saw the Men walking up and down on the right side, and the Ship sunk down, and they swam up and down like a shoal of Fish one after another, and I see them hover one upon another, and see them drop away by scores at a time, and there was an account of about 19 that sav'd themselves, some by Boats, and others by Swimming; but there were no more sav'd out of the Ships Complement, which was between five and six hundred, and the rest I saw sink downright, some 20 at a time. There was a Fisherman brought our Captain word, that in laying in of his Nets he drew up some Men close under the Rocks that were drowned belonging to the <hi>Coronation,</hi> we generally throw in Bags of Ballast with them.</p>

               <p>Then Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope we have given you Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi> did not drown her self, but was carried into the Water after she was killed. That was the first Question, for if it be true that all dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies when they are put into the Water do swim, and the Bodies that go alive into the Water and are drowned do sink. This is sufficient Evidence that she came by her Death not by drowning, but some other way. Now, my Lord, as to the second Matter, and that is to give such Evidence as we have again these Gentlemen at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> it appears was the last Man that any one can give an account of was in her Company. What became of her afterwards, or where they went no body can tell; but the other Witnesses have given you Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65427:11"/>
that he was the last Man that was with her. I shall only give this further Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as to Mr. <hi>Cowper,</hi> That notwithstanding all the Civility and Kindnesses that pass'd between him and this Family, when the bruit and noise of this Fact was spread abroad, Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> did not come to consider and consult with old Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi> what was to be done; but he took no manner of notice of it, and the next day he rode out of Town, without further taking notice of it.</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. Gurrey.</speaker>
               <p>I was laying on some Sheets two pair of Stairs when they came, and then there was three of them; so they saw me a little after and beg'd my excuse for bringing in another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they said it was so late they could not get a Lodging any where else, and said if I thought fit the Gentleman should lie with them, and I told them I liked it very well.</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. Gurrey.</speaker>
               <p>The Firing I laid on in the Morning, and they sent for my Husband to fetch them some Wine.</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. Gurrey.</speaker>
               <p>They discours'd with my Husband, and ask'd him if he knew <hi>Mrs. Sarah Stout,</hi> and one of them said to <hi>Mr. Marson,</hi> I think she was an old Sweatheart of yours, ay saith he, but she turn'd me off, but a Friend of mine is even with her; and <hi>Mr. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> said he was in with her, and afterwards said her Business was done; they had a Bundle that was wrapt in a pure white Cloth (like to an Apron) but I can't say it was an Apron, and there was a Parcel hanging loose by it, and when he laid it down, he said, he would pass his Word <hi>Mrs. Sarah Stouts</hi> Courting days were over, and I said, I hop'd it was no hurt to the Gentlewoman, and then I looking upon <hi>Mr. Marson,</hi> I saw him put his Peruke aside, and his Head reak'd, and he told them he was but just come from <hi>London</hi> that Night, which made him disappointed of a Lodging.</p>

               <p>I think it was <hi>Mr. Marson,</hi> his Shooes were very wet and dirty, one of them was very hot, and he wip'd his Head with his Handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Come Mr. <hi>Cowper,</hi> what do you say to it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Cowper.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Now they have done on the part of the King, my Lord, and you Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of my Jury, I must beg your Patience for my Defence: I confess it was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Accident for me (as <hi>Mr. Iones</hi> calls it) that I hapned to be the last Person (for ought appears) in the Company of a melancholy Woman. The Discourse occasioned by this Accident had been a sufficient Misfortune to me without any thing else to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate it; but I did not in the least imagine that so little, so Trivial an Evidence as here is could possibly have affected me to so great a degree, as to bring me to this place to answer for the worst Fact that the worst of Men can be guilty of.</p>
               <p>My Lord, your Lordship did just now observe, that I have appear'd at the Bar for my Clients, but I must say too, that I never appear'd for my self under this, or the like Circumstances, as a Criminal for any Offence whatsoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> very well said, when he spoke on the part of the King, that if this Gentlewoman was Murther'd, the Crime was Villanous, Base, Barbarous, and Cruel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for my part I think so too, the Crime would be so great, that it could never sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be Condemned: But at the same time I may averr, that to suppose a Murther with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good Grounds for it, and afterwards to charge innocent Men with it knowingly and maliciously, is to a Trifle as Base and Barbarous as the Murther it self could be. My Lord, I speak for my own part, I know not at what Price other Men may value their Lives, but I had much rather my self was Murther'd then my Reputation, which yet, I am sensible hath suffer'd greatly hitherto by the Malice and Artifice of some Men, who have gone pretty far in making this Fact, as Barbarous as it is, to be Credited of me. And therefore I must beg your Lordship's, and the Jury's Patience, while I not only defend my Life, but justifie my self also from these things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that have uniustly aspers'd me, by the Conspiracy and Artifice of my Accusers.</p>
               <p>My Lord, in all the Evidence that hath been given, I must observe there is no posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Evidence, with Submission, to induce the Jury, or any one to believe the General, that this Gentlewoman was Murthered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they go upon Suppositions and Inferences, which are contradicted by other Circumstances, in the very Evidence of the Prosecutor, that make full as strong to prove she was not Murther'd, as that she was; so that as it stands, it can amount only to a bare Suppositions that she was Murther'd by any body.</p>
               <p>Then as to the Evidence that particularly relates to my self, on the Gentlemen who stand with me at the Bar; that they, or I were concerned in it (if she was Murther'd) there is not one Syllable of Proof, at most it amounts but to make us suspect of a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not proved, but only suspected; this I observe upon the Evidence, as it now stands without Answer, as it has been given on the King's Part, and how far in the Case of Life, Men shall be affected with Evidence of this Nature, which neither proves the Murther in General, nor that they did it in particular, though no Defence was made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any further Answer given, I must submit to your Lordship's, and the Jury's Judgment.</p>
               <p>But my Lord, I do not doubt but I shall be able to wipe away, even that remorse Suspicion by my Defence; they have been long in their Evidence for the King, and therefore I must beg your Patience while I give a particular Answer to every part of it, in as good a Method as I am able, and I will wast as little time as may consist with the justifying of my Reputation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (for which I know your Lordship will have as tender a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, to see it doth not suffer unjustly, as for my Life it self.</p>
               <p>And I promise your Lordship I shall trouble you with no Evidence which is not express and plain, no Inuendo's or Suspicions; but I shall prove fully and clearly, in the first
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65427:14"/>
place, that there was no Ground at all in this Case to suppose she was murther'd by any one but her self.</p>
               <p>The first Fact that they insisted upon to inset a murther from it, was, that the Body was found floating; now, my Lord, that Fact I am able by the Evidence I have, as well as from that of the Prosecutor to deny; for the Fact was directly otherwise, that is, she was not found floating.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Prosecutor's Witnesses, who have been produced to this Point, are obscure and poor Men, and your Lordship observes have been taught to say generally that she floated, which, when they are required to explain, and describe how she lay, they contradict themselves in, by shewing she lay sideways between the Stakes, and almost all under Water: Now I shall give your Lordship, and the Jury a full and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Account and Description from the Parish Officers, Men employ'd by the Coroner to take the Body out of the Water, of the very Manner and Posture in which it was first found; which they are much better able to do, than the Prosecutor's Witnesses, having seen her before all, or most of those People, and these Officers clearly agree that her Body was under Water, when found, except some small appearance of her Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoats, near, or on the surface of the Water, which may be very easily accounted for, because the Stakes the Witnesses mention, and which are driven into the Ground cross the River to prevent Weeds and Trampery from running into the Mill stand, as the Witnesses have already said, about a Foot distance from one another, and are set with their Feet from the Mill, and their Heads inclining towards the Mill with the Stream: Now, my Lord, every one knows that though a drowned Body will at first sink, yet it is buoyant, and does not go down-right, and rest in one place like Lead; for a humane Body is seldom or never in a Stream found to lie where it was drowned; a Body drowned at <hi>Chelsea,</hi> has been often found by Fishermen at <hi>London,</hi> and that before it came to float above Water. Now, if a Body is so buoyant, as that it is driven down by the impellant force of the Current (though it do not float above Water) it seems a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence that when it comes to be stopp'd and resisted by the Stakes, which lie with their Heads downwards, inclining with the Stream, the Stream bearing the Body against the Stakes, must needs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ise it upwards to find another Passage, if possible, when the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and Natural is obstructed. I have seen I remember, that where Weeds have been driven down a River, and have been rooled along at the bottom, when they have come down to a Board, or Stakes of a Wyer, or Turnpike, they have been by the force of the Water raised up against those Boards, or Stakes, and forc'd over them, though without such Obstruction they had undoubtedly continued to rool along un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Water. I don't know of any other Symptom they pretend too, of her not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drowned, from any thing observed of her in the Water. Then as to the flatness of her Belly, when she was put into her Coffin, I shall shew it is a common and natural Accident, sometimes drowned Bodies are swelled more, sometimes less, sometimes not at all; I think it hardly deserves a Physician to prove that a Body may be drowned with very little Water, that a Man may be drowned by Strangling, or Suffocation caused by a little Water in the Lungs, without any great quantity or Water received in the Body, is a certain and establish'd Truth; for I am told that when Respiration ceases, the Party dies, and can receive no more Water after that; so that nothing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> to be inferred from a Body's having more or less Water found in it, especially, if your Lordship will give me leave to observe this distinction, where a Body is voluntarily drowned, and where it is drowned by Accident; for People that fall in by Accident do struggle and strive as long as they can, every time they rise they drink some Water into the Stomach to prevent its pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing into the Lungs, and are drowned no sooner than needs must; but Persons that volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily drown themselves, to be sure desperately plunge into the Water to dispatch a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Life, as soon as they can; and so that little quantity in the Lungs, which causes Death, may be the sooner taken in; after which, no more is received: And I hope by Physicians it will appear there is good Ground for this Difference.</p>
               <p>The next is the Evidence that the Chvrurgeons have given on the other part, relating to the taking this Gentlewoman out of her Grave, after she had been buried six Weeks, whether this ought to have been given in Evidence for the Reasons I hinted at in a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Case, I submit to your Lordship. But as it is, I have no reason to apprehend it, being able to make appear, that the Gentlemen who spoke to this Point have delivered themselves in that manner, either out of extreme Malice, or a most profound Ignorance, this will be so very plain upon my Evidence, that I must take the liberty to impute one, or both of those Causes to the Gentlemen that have argued from their Observations upon that Matter.</p>
               <p>And now, if your Lordship will but please to consider the Circumstances under which they would accuse me of this horrid Action, I don t think they will pretend to say, that in the whole course of my Life, I have been guilty of any mean or indirect
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65427:14"/>
Action; and I will put it upon the worst Enemy I have in the World to say it. Now, for a Man in the Condition I was in, of some Fortune in Possession, related to a better, in a good Employment, thriving in my Profession, living within my Income, never in Debt, (I may truly say not five Pounds at any one time these eight Years past) having no possibility of making any Advantage by her Death, void of all Malice; and as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by her own Evidence in perfect Amity and Friendship with this Gentlewoman, to be guilty of the murthering her, to begin at the top of all Baseness and Wickedness, certainly is incredible.</p>
               <p>My Lord, in this Prosecution my Enemies seeing the necessity of Assigning some Cause, have been so Malicious to suggest before (though not now, when I have this Opportunity of Vindicating my self publickly) that I have been concerned in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of Money's for this Gentlewoman, had her Securities by me, and sometimes that I had been her Guardian, or her Trustee, and I know not what: I now see the Contrivers and Promoters of that Scandal, and they know it to be Base, False, and Malicious; I never was concerned in Interest with her, directly, or indirectly, and so I told them when I was before my Lord Chief Justice; 'tis true, it was then just suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prosecutors, I then denied it, and I deny it still—I thank God I have not been used, nor have I needed to deny the Truth.</p>
               <p>My Lord, you find the Prosecutors have nothing to say to me upon this Head, after all the Slanders and Stories they have Published against me, of my having Money in my Hands which belonged to the Deceased. But though they do not stir it, I will, and and give your Lordship a full Account of all that ever was in that Matter: When I lo'g dat <hi>Hartford,</hi> some time since, she desired me to recommend to her a Security for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>oo <hi>l.</hi> if it came in my way, my Lord, when I came to Town, I understood that one <hi>Mrs. Puller,</hi> a Client of mine, had a Mortgage formerly made to her by one Mr. <hi>Lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> of <hi>Lambeth</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> for the like Summ, and that she was willing to have in her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; I wrote to this Gentlewoman, the Deceased, to acquaint her of the Security, she thereupon did send up 200 <hi>l.</hi> and some odd Pounds for Interest (the Account of which I produced to my Lord Chief Justice) this Money was sent to me by <hi>Mr. Cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> as I have been informed, and by him given to <hi>Mr. Toller</hi>'s Clark, and by him brought publickly to me; my Lord, this Mortgage I immediately Transferr'd by Assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Indors'd on the back of it, and Mrs. <hi>Habberfield,</hi> a Trustee for Mrs. <hi>Puller,</hi> Signed and Sealed it, and that very 200 <hi>l.</hi> and Interest due was at one and the same time paid to Mrs. <hi>Puller,</hi> and by her the Principal was paid to her Daughter, in part of her Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. All this was Transacted the beginning of <hi>December</hi> last, and she was not drowned till the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> following: And my Lord, these People that are now the Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, did own before my Lord Chief Justice, that they had found this Mortgage amongst the Deceased<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Writings in her Cabinet at the time of her Death. Now, my Lord, I say, that saving this one Service I did her, as I said in <hi>December</hi> last, I never was otherwise concerned with her in the receiving, or disposing of any of her Money; nor had I ever any of her Securities for Money in my keeping; and I defie any Adversary I have to shew the contrary.</p>
               <p>My Lord, as there appears no Malice, no Interest, so they have prov'd for me that there was no Concealment of Shame, to induce me to commit so Barbarous an Action; otherwise, perhaps now they find they can assign no other Cause, they would content themselves to give that reason, and fling that Scandal at me: And though I take it by the Experience I have had of them, they did not design to do me any Favour, yet I thank'em. in endeavouring to vindicate her Honour, they have secured my Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against that Calumny; and though I am satisfied, as I said, they did not intend me Kindness, yet I thank God they have given me a just Opportunity to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their Cunning, for the clearing my Innocence in that Particular.</p>
               <p>Then, my Lord, not to rest it here, but to satisfie the Jury and the World how this Gentlewoman came to destroy her self, I shall give the clearest Evidence that was ever given in any Court, that she murther'd her self; when I enter upon this Proof, I must of necessity trespass upon the Character of this Gentlewoman that is dead, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess this is a tender Point, 'tis a thing I would willingly be excus'd from, and 'tis not without a great deal of Reluctancy and Compulsion forc'd from me: That she was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly the Prosecutors themselves have prov'd; but I must of necessity show you the Occasion and Reasons of it, and the Witnesses will tell your Lordship what despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Resolutions she had been under formerly, and that will lead me to near the time of her Death; to show why, and upon what Accidents she made away her self. I will not innumerate Particulars, by way of opening; only I must tell your Lordship, that some Letters of hers must of necessity be produced, which truly as I said, I should not meddle with, if I had not these innocent Gentlemen here to defend, as well as my self; perhaps it may be said, that in Honour I ought to conceal the Weakness of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65427:15"/>
but then in Honour and Justice to these Gentlemen that are falsly accused with me, I cannot do it; I hope this one reason will excuse me to the World, for I have no other that could have obliged me to bring these Letters upon the Stage; I solemnly protest, if I stood here singly in the Case of my own Life, upon the Evidence given against me, I take it to be so inconsiderable, I would not do it; but I must do it to show that these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen also are innocent, and to preserve them, because I am satisfied in my own mind they are so My Lord, when I have done that, I shall show your Lordship in the next place, that it is utterly impossible I could be concern'd in this Fact; if I had had all the motives and provocations in the World to have done it: I shall show your Lordship in point of time it could not be.</p>
               <p>The Maid <hi>Sarah Walker,</hi> who is the single Witness, I take it, that says any thing in the least relating to me, said but now, the Clock had struck 11 before she carried up the Coals, and about a quarter of an hour after, while she was warming the Bed above stalis, she heard the Door clap, and sometime after that she dame down and found that I and her Mistress were gone, Now in point of time I shall prove it utterly impossible I could be guilty of the Fact I am accused of, being seen to come into the Glove Inn as the Town Clock struck eleven, and staying there more than a quarter of an hour, was, after seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things done at my lodging, in bed before twelve a Clock, and went no more out that night as I shall prove. As for that little circumstance of sending for my Horse, which they have made use of all along to back this prosecution, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>neir very telling me of that matter, shews how they are put to their shlfes to justifie their accusing me; I say in prudence I ought to have done what I did: I sent for him on the <hi>Tuesday,</hi> but as their Witness saith, I told him, at the time I bid him setch my Horse, not to use then, nor till by the course of the Circuit I was to go into <hi>Essex</hi> with the Judges the next Morning; and till then the Prosecutors Witness; who is the Ostler of the <hi>Glove Inn,</hi> was ordered to set him up there to litter him down, and to take care of him and feed him, and that he should be ready for me to go to <hi>Chelmsford</hi> on the morrow, whither I went with the other Councel the next Morning being <hi>Wednesday;</hi> and this my Lord is the whole of that matter.</p>
               <p>My Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Business slept near Two Months after the Coroners Inquest before I heard of it, or imagined my self to be concerned in it, and was never stirr'd till two Parties differing on all other occasions had laid their Heads together; I beg leave to let your Lordship a little into that matter, to show you how this Prosecution came to be managed, with so much noise and violence as it hath been. I can make it appear, that one of the greatest of the Quakers, <hi>Mr. Mead</hi> by name, has very much, and indirectly too, concerned himself in this matter; it seems they fancy the Reputation of their Sect is concern'd in it, for they think it a wonderful thing, nay absolutely impossible (howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver other People may be lyable to such resolutions) that one who was by her Education intituled to the Light within her, should run headlong into the Water, as if she had been possest with the Devil; of this they think their Sect is to be clear'd, though by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spilling the Blood of Four Innocent Men. The other sort of People that concur with the Quakers in this Prosecution, I shall mention now I come to observe what the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are that have been produced against me; some of them I have nothing to object to, but that they are extreme Indigent and Poor, and have been helped by the Prosecutor, those that are so say nothing as to me; others who live in this Town, and give their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the manner of her Death, are possess with much prejudice against me, upon Feuds that have risen at the Elections of my Father and Brother in this Town, and these with the Quakers have wholly drest up this matter for several ends, the Quakers to maintain the Reputation of their Sect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the others to destroy, or break at least, the Interest of my Family in this Place: But however effectual these designs may have been, to have made a great noise in the World out of nothing; I am satisfied now, that I am in a Court of Justice, where no Persons Reputation, much less his Life, will be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifie'd to the Policy or Malice of a Party without Proof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore I have taken up so much of your time, to set the true rise of this Prosecution before you in a clear Light,</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65427:15"/>
to Write to <hi>Mr. Barfoot</hi> our Landlord, and get him, if he could, to dispose of the Lodgings, for said I, if he keeps them they must be paid for, and then I cannot well avoid lying there; my Brother did say he would Write, if he could think on't; and thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if <hi>Mr. Barfoot</hi> disposed of the Lodgings, I own I intended to lie at the Deceaseds House, but if not, I looked on my self as obliged to lie at <hi>Mr. Barfoots.</hi> Accordingly I shall prove, assoon as ever I came to this Town in the morning of the first day of the Assizes, I went directly to Mr. <hi>Barfoots,</hi> (the Maid and all agree in this) and the reason was, I had not seen my Brother after he said he would Write before I went out of <hi>London;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was proper for me to go first to Mr. <hi>Barfoots,</hi> to know whether my Brother had Wrote to him, and whether he had disposed of the Lodgings or not; assoon as I came to Mr. <hi>Barfoots,</hi> there was one <hi>Mr. Taylor</hi> of this Town came to me, and I in his hearing ask'd <hi>Mr. Barfoot,</hi> his Wife, and Maid-servant one after another, if they had received a Letter from my Brother to unbespeak the Lodgings; they told me no, that the Room was kept for us, and I think that they had made a Fire, and that the Sheets were airing; I was a little concerned he had not writ, but being satisfied that no Letter had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, I said immediatly, as I shall prove by several Witnesses, if it be so I must stay with you, I will take up my Lodging here; thereupon I lighted, and sent for my Bag from the Coffee-house, and I lodg'd all my things at <hi>Barfoots,</hi> and thus I took up my Lodging there as usual: I had no sooner done this, but <hi>Sarah Walker</hi> came to me from her Mistress <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Now my Lord, the reason that I went to her House at Night was first, as I said, to pay her the Interest mony; in the next place it was but fitting, when I found my self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a necessity of disappointing her, and lying at <hi>Barfoots</hi> to go to excuse my not lying there; which I had not an opportunity at Dinner time to do. My Lord, I open my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence shortly, referring the particulars to the Witnesses themselves, in calling those who will fully refute the Suppositions and Inferences made by the Prosecutors, of whom, first my Lord, I shall begin with to shew there is no Evidence of any Murther at all commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this I say again ought to be indisputably made manifest and prov'd before any Man can be so much as suspected for it.</p>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d) is poured into them by way of torture to make them confess crimes, have no suffocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or drowning happen to them: But on the other hand, when any quantity comes into the Wind-pipe, so as it does hinder or intercept the inspiration, or coming in of the air, which is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65427:17"/>
necessary for respiration or breathing, the person is suffocated. Such a small quantity will do as sometimes in Prescriptions, when people have been very weak, or forced to take Medicines, I have observed some spoonfuls in that condition (if it went the wrong way) to have choaked or suffocated the person. I take drowning in a great measure to be thus, and though it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely when one struggles he may (to save himself from being choak'd) swallow some quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water, yet that is not the cause of his death, but that which goes into the Windpipe and Lungs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether a person comes dead or alive into the water, I believe some quantity will go into the Wind-pipe, and I believe without force after death little will get into the Stomach, because for that it should, swallowing is necessary, which after death cannot be done.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I am apt to think it would have putrified the stomach less than the lungs, because the stomach is a part of the body that is contrived by nature, partly to receive liquids, but the contrivance of the lungs is only for the receiving of air, they being of a spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy nature, the water might sink more into them than the stomach; but I believe it might putrify there too after some time. I am apt to think that when a body is buried under ground, according to the depth of the Grave, and difference of the weather and soil, the fermentation may be greater or lesser, and that according to the several kinds of meats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or liquids in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach the putrifaction will likewise vary, so that it seems to me to be very uncertain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </speaker>
               <p>No doubt there will be a Fermentation more or less, according as the air comes, more or less to the body. Indeed it may be otherwise, where the air is wholly shut out, which is supposed to be the way of Embalming, or preserving dead Bodies of late, without the use of any Spices, which is thought in a great measure to be brought about by the closeness of the Coffin, and hindring of the air from coming into the body.</p>

               <p>I believe 'tis hardly possible that any should go from the Windpipe into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Thorax, without great violence and force, for there is a membrane that covers the outside of the Lungs, that will hinder the water from passing through it into any part without them.</p>

               <p>I am apt to think if there was any quantity in the lungs, the sponginess of the part would suck up some part of it. As to the stomach I have not known it tried, but 'tis like if there was a great fermentation, a great deal of it would rise up in vapours or steams, and go off that way.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I observed in this Tryal the first Gentleman call'd for the King that spoke to this matter was Mr <hi>Coatsworth.</hi> He saith he was sent for to open her, upon an aspersion of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing said to be with Child. I agree with him in what he speaks to that point, but must differ with him where he infers she was murther'd because he found no great quantity of water in her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as also her head extreamly mortify'd, but not her lungs (lungs and bowels I think were us'd promiscuously.) Now, my Lord, as to the matter of putrefaction, I think 'tis not much mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial whether there be any water or no in the cavities of the body, if water would hasten putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, it would do it as well in the lungs as otherwise; there is always some water in the lymphaducts there, the breaking of which may be one occasion of Catarrhs. As to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the putrefaction of the head, it may happen from a stoppage of the refluent blood, which is staid there in a great quantity, through the suffocation in the water, or from the nearness of the brain, which is observ'd often to mortifie first.</p>
               <p>The next was Mr <hi>Dimsdale</hi> (I wou'd speak to them all in order if my memory wou'd permit) I think he was of the same opinion with Mr <hi>Coatsworth;</hi> he laid the stress of his suspicion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mortification of the head, which I think is not at all material, no more than what they infer from her floating: it being impossible the body should have floated, unless it had rested, or had been entangled amongst the stakes, because all dead bodies (I believe) fall to the bottom, unless they be prevented by some extraordinary tumour. My Lord, we have not only Philosophy, but Experiments for this. The Witnesses all agree she was found upon her side, which to suppose her to float in this posture, is as hard to he conceiv'd, as to imagine a Shilling shou'd fall down and rest upon its edge rather than its broad side; or that a Doal Board shou'd rather float edgeways than otherwise: therefore 'tis plain she was entangled, or else the posture had been otherwise.</p>
               <p>As to the quantity of water, I do not think it necessary it shou'd be very great. I must own the water will force itself into all cavities where there's no resistance. I believe when she threw herself in she might not struggle to save herself, and by consequence not sup up much water. Now there's no direct passage into the stomach but by the gullet, which is contracted or purs'd up by a Muscle in nature of a Sphincter: for if this passage was always open, like that of the Windpipe, the I weight of the air, would force it self into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we shou'd be sensible of the greatest inconveniencies. I doubt not, but that some water fell into her Lungs, because the weight of it, wou'd force it self down, but if we consider the Windpipe with its ramifications, as one <hi>Cylinder,</hi> the calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of its contents will not amount to above 23 or 24 solid inches of water, which is not a pint, and which might imperceptibly work and fall out. I remember I offer'd a wager at <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways</hi> Coffee House to a Gentleman here in Court.</p>

               <p>Those which seem to be questions of greatest moment, are whether there was a necessity for this body (if drown'd) to have a great quantity of Water in it, and whether bodies thrown dead into the Water float: To the first I answer positively, that there is no absolute necessity, that she should have a great quantity of water in her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I think the question Mr <hi>Cowper</hi> ask'd Dr <hi>Coatsworth,</hi> whether he had like to been drowned by accident or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

We see the same thing done by Divers in order to save themselves, as it happened to this unfortunate Gentlewoman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in her design of destroying herself: if a Diver before he come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the surface of water should so far mistake his power of holding his breath, that he should be forced to endeavour respiration, the little water he drew into his Lungs by this attempt to respire may drown him. We last night drown'd a Dog<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and afterwards dissected him, and found not a Spoonful of water in his Stomach, and I believe about two Ounces in his Lungs, while we were doing this, we drowned another, and he lay at the bottom and did not float; no more would he have done, if he had been hang'd before thrown into the water: we took him up, and upon opening him we found much about the same quantity of water in his Lungs, and little or none in his Stomach, they both froth'd at Nose and Mouth, because the water coming into the little bladders of the Lungs, and there meeting with air, a commotion arose between the water and air, which caused th' froth. To the second question, I think if bodies new killed swim 'tis by accident, for the reason that bodies swim, is because by putrifaction they rarifie by rarifaction they grow lighter, which brings them to the top of the water.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I think it is impossible to be known, for if there had been never so much water in the body at first, it could not lye there so long; but must of necessity have forced its way out, We see in persons that dye of Dropsies, that the water will work it self out (and sometimes burst the body) before it is buried. And I am sure, if it do so in Dropsies where there are no visible passages for it to get out at, it must do so much more in drown'd persons, where the water lies only in the Stomach and Guts; and has nothing to hinder its working out, when it ferments, as it always doth.</p>

               <p>My Lord, what is taken in, is I believe chiefly at the surface of the water, when they open their mouths for breath, and the water that rushes in, they are forc'd to drink down, to keep it from their Lungs. But when the head is quite under water, I don't think it is possible for any quantity to get down into the Stomach: because it being breath they open for, the very first water they take in, would of necessity fill the Lungs, and when the breath is stopt, I don't see how they can swallow.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I will give you a short account, I hope to your satisfaction too, my Lord. I will not only speak from reason, but give you the testimony of the Experiments I have made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occasion. My Lord, I heard it made a mighty argument, that this person had no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that seemed to flow out, but the witnesses agree there was a froth. Now, my Lord, it was not reasonable to expect any thing but froth. My Lord, had she been thrown into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and made her utmost efforts, which she would then have done to have sav'd herself, and been often buoyed up to the top of the water, no doubt but she would have swallowed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderible quantity of water before she had been drowned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it may be expected to flow from her, if her head had been inclined downwards.</p>
               <p>This is a truth that no man can deny, who is acquainted with any thing of this nature, that when the head of an Animal is under water, the first time it is obliged to inspire (or draw in air) the water will necessarily flow into its lungs, as the air would do if it were out of the water; which quantity of water (if the dimensions of the Windpipe and its branches in the lungs be considered) will not amount to 3 inches square, which is about 3 ounces of water. Nor is a greater quantity of water in the Windpipe necessary to choak any person, if we do but reflect what an ebullition is caused by its meeting with the air, which remain'd in the lungs, whereby a small quantity of water is converted into a Froth, and the Channel of the Windpipe, and those of the Bronchia are filled with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> insomuch that no air can enter the lungs, for the office of respiration. After a Suffocation is thus commenced (I am apt to think) all regular animal actions are perverted, and particularly that of swallowing (or deglutition) and what water flows into the Stomach at the instant or after this suffocation, is from its own weight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is more or less as the Body is farther under, or nearer the surface of the Water. My Lord, I don't speak this by way of conjecture or Hypothesis, but I have made experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which have suggested what I here offer. I shall by the by tell you how falacious the first experiment was, when I proposed to satisfy my self, whether a dead Body would float in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—it happened, that a Spaniel, that had a great deal of long hair was hanged for this purpose, which I found swim on the surface of the water; but when I considered that his hair might buoy him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o, I caused another Dog, which had shorter and less hair to be hanged, and put into the water, which (agreeable to what I had always conceived of a Human Body) sunk directly to the bottom. In order to satisfie my self what quantity of water was necessary to enter the Body of an Animal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cause a suffocation in Water, I caused 3 Dogs when alive to be suddenly plunged under Water, till they were stifled, one was before I left <hi>London,</hi> the other 2 I made the Experiment on last night, in the presence of Dr <hi>Sloane</hi> and Dr <hi>Morley,</hi> and we could not compute there was more than 3 ounces of water in their Lungs, and none that we could perceive in their Stomachs.</p>
               <p>Dead Bodies necessarily sink in Water, if no distension of their parts buoy them up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this, destension sometimes happens before death, at other times soon after, and in Bodies that are drowned after they lye under water. This enlargement of them is caused by a rarefaction of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> humors within the cavities, and the body necessarily rises to the surface of the water. Your Lordship, may infer this from what the Seamen told you, and the great weight they use to fasten to their bodies that died of Diseases, was not of such use to sink them, as it was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their floating afterwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that the weight was necessary for those that were killed as well as these that died of diseases.</p>
               <p>It is so commonly known that the contents in the stomach of a dead body are discharged by the mouth and nostrils so soon as it begins to ferment, and the belly becomes distended, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> no wonder that water, if the greatest quantity that had been in the stomach, or any thing else that was fluid, must be forced from thence six weeks after death.</p>

               <p>My Lord, it must be reading as well as a Man's own Experience, that will make any one a Physitian; for without the reading of Books of that Art, the Art it self cannot be attained to; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, my Lord, I humbly conceive, that in such a difficult case as this, we ought to have a great deference for the Reports and Opinions of Learned Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither do I see any reason why I should not quote the Fathers of my Profession in this Case, as well as you Gentlemen of the Long-Robe quote <hi>Cook</hi> upon <hi>Littlet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He was chief Surgeon to <hi>Francis</hi> the First, imploy'd by him in most of his Sieges and Battles against the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently must observe, and could not be ignorant of such like Casualties in such great Bodies of Men. He tells us, that the certain sign of a Mans being drown'd, is an appearance of Froth about his Nostrils and Month. Now, my Lord, I think, that every one of the King's Evidences observ'd it in the present Case, and a Woman swore, that she saw her purge at the Nose; which could not be, as he declares, if the Person had been Strangled, or otherwise killed before.</p>

               <p>My Lord, when I was a Surgeon in the Fleet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I made it always my Observation when we threw Men over-board that were kill'd, some of them swam, and some sunk; and I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, particularly when the <hi>Sandwich</hi> was burnt, we saw abundance leap off from on Board and they sunk directly, but in a little time I observ'd some swim again.</p>

Saith I there is something more than ordinary, you seem'd to be Melancholy. Saith she you are come from <hi>London,</hi> and you have heard something or other: Said I, I believe you are in Love, In Love! said she, Yes saith I <hi>Cupid</hi> that little Boy hath struck you home; She took me by the Hand, truly saith she I must confess it, but I did think I should never be Guilty of such a Folly, and I answered again, I admire that should make you uneasy; If the Person be not of that Fortune as you are, you may if you love him, make him happy, and your self easy. That can't be saith she the World shall not say I change my Religion for a Husband, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after I had been at <hi>London,</hi> having bought some <hi>India</hi> Goods, She came to my Shop and bought some of me for a Gown, and afterwards she came to Pay me for it, and I asked her, how do you like it have you made it up? No said she, and I believe I shall never live to wear it.</p>

ask'd her the Reason of it several times, and sometimes she seem'd to dislike her Profession, being a Quaker, and sometimes she would say that she was uneasy at something that lay upon her Spirits, which she should never out-live, and that she should never be well while she was in this World; sometimes I have endeavour'd to perswade her out of it seriously, and sometimes by raillery, and have said are you sure you shall be better in another World, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly I remember I have said to her, I believe you have Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> in your Head, either have him or do not trouble your self about him, make your self either easy one way or another, and she hath said no in an indifferent way, I cannot make my self easy; then I have said marry him, no saith she I can't.

This time Twelve-month, at the Summer Assizes, I was here six Days, and I saw her every Day, and one time among other Discourse, she told me she had receiv'd great disturbance from one <hi>Theophilus,</hi> a Waterman and a Quaker, who coming down to old Mrs. <hi>Stout,</hi> that was then lame, she had gather'd about 20 or 30 People together to hear him Preach, and she said he directed his Discourse to her, and exasperated her at that rate, that she had thoughts of seeing no body again; and said, she took it hainously ill to be so us'd, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that he told her that her Mothers falling outwardly in the Flesh should be a warning that she did not fall inwardly, and such canting stuff as she called it, and she said, that <hi>Theophilus</hi> had so used her that she was asham'd to shew her Head. Another time the same Week, she had a Feaver, and she said she was in great hopes it would end her Days, and that she neglected her self, in doing those things that were necessary for her Health, in hopes it would carry her off, and often wish'd her self dead; another time, which I think was the last time I saw her, was at my Sisters Lodgings, and I sent for her to drink a dish of Tea with us, and she came in a great toss and melancholy; saith I, What is the matter you are always in this odd Humour, saith she, I can't help it, I shall never be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; saith my Sister, for God's sake keep such Thoughts out of your Head as you have had, don't talk any more of throwing your self out of Window; saith she, I may thank God that ever I saw your Face, otherwise I had done it; but I can't promise I shall not do it.</p>

               <p>My Lord, all I can say to this matter is this, I do remember, that when she was one time in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65427:21"/>
                  <hi>London,</hi> I think it was about a year and an half since, I am not positive as to the time, but when she was in <hi>London,</hi> my Brother came in the Morning to my Chamber in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and after some discourse, he told me he had received a Letter from Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi> that day, wherein she said, she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him a visit at his Chamber that Afternoon, he told me at the same time, that his Friend Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> had some thoughts of her, and therefore for that, as well as other reasons, he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline receiving the visit intended him; and upon consideration, this was the method agreed upon: At that time I lived with my Father in <hi>Hatton Garden,</hi> and this Gentlewoman having writ in the same Letter I now speak of, that she designed to dine there, and to come from thence in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; says my Brother, you may casually, as it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were, take occasion to say at Dinner, that my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness obliges me to go to <hi>Deptford</hi> in the Afternoon, as in good earnest it did, as he then told me, and from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that she may take a hint of my not being at home, and so save her self the disappointment of coming to my Chamber; I told him, I would find an opportunity of doing it if I could. At Dinner my Father hapned to ask me, as he often did, when I saw my Brother; I took this hint and said, I had seen him at my Chamber in the Morning, and that he was gone to <hi>Deptford</hi> that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon about some Law business. My Lord, Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi> was then at the Table. I no sooner said it, but I observ'd she chang'd colour presently, and rose with her Napkin, and went into the back yard, and we saw her through a Sash-window fall into a woman's Fit of Swooning, and they gave her the assistance that is usual in such cases.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the next thing I can speak to is this, the Parliament sitting late the <hi>Friday</hi> before the <hi>Monday</hi> of the last Assizes at <hi>Hertford,</hi> I came late from Dinner, I had din'd about seven a Clock, as I remember, and having occasion to speak with my Brother, I found him out by enquiry at the <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> Tavern, and there was Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> of <hi>Lions-Inn</hi> with him. I had not drank above a Glass or two of Wine, but my Brother began with me, and said, I seldom trouble you with affairs of mine, but now I do not know well how to avoid it. I have received an importunate Letter, which I will shew you, it came from a Lady whose name I believe you will guess; so he pull'd it out of his Pocket, and I read it so often, because of the oddness of the expression, that I can say, I am sure this is the very Letter he shew'd me at the <hi>Covent Garden</hi> Tavern, the <hi>Friday</hi> before the last Assizes; saith he, the occasion of my shewing it, is not to expose a Woman's weakness, but I would not willingly lie under too many Obligations, nor engage too far; nor on the other hand, would I be at an unnecessary Expence for a Lodging. Upon this subject there was some Discourse I think Foreign to this purpose, and therefore I would not trouble your Lordship with the repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, that which is material is this, I did undertake to write to Mr. <hi>Barefoot</hi> to dispose of his Lodgings, where I us'd to be at the time of the Assizes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and my Brother with me. I said I would write the next day, being <hi>Saturday,</hi> but when I should have writ, it was very late, and I was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, being then tied down to the business of Parliament, and partly for that reason, and partly in point of discretion, which I had upon my second thoughts, that 'twould be better for my Brother's business to be at Mr. <hi>Barefoot</hi>'s, which is near the Court, and in the Market place; I did neglect writing, and though I thought of it about 11 a Clock; yet as I said, partly for one reason, and partly for the other, I did not write that time. My Lord, my Brother could know nothing of this matter, for I did not see him from the <hi>Friday</hi> he shew'd me the Letter, till he went to the Assizes, so that he could not know before he was at <hi>Hertford,</hi> that I had not writ. My Lord, I say as to this Letter I am sure he shew'd me the <hi>Friday</hi> next before the last Assizes.</p>

               <p>I believe you may ask her Mother, she will tell you whether it be her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's hand.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Stout.</speaker>
               <p>How should I know! I know she was no such person, her hand may be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bar. Hatsell.</speaker>

               <p>No, I don't believe it, because it don't suit her character.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I went up and made a Fire, and then I came down again, and then I went up and warm'd Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi>'s Bed, and then he desir'd another Blanket, and I came down for it; and all this took up a considerable time; and Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> was in bed before twelve a Clock.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>

               <p>Now, If your Lordship pleases, I would explain that part of <hi>Sarah Walker</hi> the Maid's Evidence; where she says, her Mistress ordered her to warm the Bed, and I never contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted it: Your Lordship observes the words in the last of the two Letters, <hi>No inconvenience can attend your Cohabiting with me; and afterwards I won't Fly for it: For come life come death I am resolv'd, and so on,</hi>—I had rather leave it to be observed than make the observation my self, what might be the dispute between us at the time the Maid speaks of. I think it was not necessary she should be present at the debate; and therefore I might not interrupt her Mistress in the orders she gave; but as soon as the Maid was gone, I made use of these objections; I told Mrs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Stout,</hi> by what accident I was obliged to take up my Lodging at Mr. <hi>Barefoot</hi>'s, and that the Family was sitting up for me: That my staying at her House under these circumstances, would in probability provoke the censure of the Town and County; and that therefore I could not stay, whatever my inclination otherwise might be; but my Lord, my reasons not prevailing, I was for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>'d to decide the controversie by going to my Lodging, so that the Maid may Swear true, when she says I did not contradict her orders.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bar. Hatsell.</speaker>

               <p>No my Lord, I have more Evidence to give. Call <hi>Elizabeth Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>If your Lordship pleases to observe, I have already proved by two Witnesses that I was actually at Mr. <hi>Barefoot</hi>'s a little after Eleven; so that if I was to rest upon this proof, here is not the least article of time, in which it can be supposed I was employ'd in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this matter: But says <hi>Sarah Walker,</hi> the Maid to obviate (I presume) this Evidence of mine, our House-Clock went faster than the Town-Clock: Now to answer this too, I shall further prove to your Lordship, that before I came to my Lodging, I was at the <hi>Glove</hi> and <hi>Dolphin</hi> Inn, where I had a little Account of about six or seven Shillings, as I remember for Horse-keeping, and which I then paid.</p>

               <p>My Lord, with your Lordships favour, I would ask <hi>George Man</hi> a question to the same point. Do you remember my coming into the <hi>Glove and Dolphin?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G. Man.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>How long did I stay there?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G. Man.</speaker>
               <p>You staid about a quarter of an hour, as near as I can guess.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>I will now call a Witness to prove that this Maid <hi>Sarah Walker</hi> is not so cautious and careful how she Swears, as I think she ought to be. Call <hi>Mrs. Mince.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bar. Hatsell.</speaker>
               <p>Pray wherein has <hi>Sarah Walker</hi> said any thing that is false?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>In this, I ask'd her when she gave Evidence, Whether she went out to see for her Mistress all that Night, and whether her Mistress did not use to stay our a Nights; and whether she her self had not used to say so? If your Lordship pleases to remember she said no. Pray Mrs. <hi>Mince</hi> what have you heard Mrs. <hi>Stout's</hi> Maid say concerning her Mistress, particularly as to her staying out all Night?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Mince.</speaker>
               <p>She hath said, That her Mistress did not love to keep company with <hi>Quakers;</hi> and that she paid for her own board and her Maids; and that when she entertained any body, it was at her own charge. And she hath said that Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi> us'd to ask who is with you Child? and she would not tell her; and that she did entertain her Friends in the Summer House, now and then with a Bottle of Wine. And when her Mother ask'd who was there, her Mistress would say bring it in here. I suppose there is none but Friends; and after the company was gone, she us'd to make her Mother believe that she went to Bed; but she us'd to go out and take the Key with her, and sometimes she would go out at the Window, and she said particularly one time she went out at the Garden Window, when the Garden door was lock'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, and that she bid her not sit up for her, for she would come in at any time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. B. Hatsell.</speaker>
               <p>Did ever <hi>Sarah Walker</hi> tell you that Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi> had staid out all Night?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Mince.</speaker>
               <p>She hath said she could not tell what time she came in, for she went to Bed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>Now if your Lordship please, I will prove to you, if it may be thought material, that <hi>Gurrey,</hi> at whose House these Gentlemen lodged, should say, That if I had visited Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi> none of all this had been (upon so little an omission it seems did this prosecution depend) to which I give this Answer, my Lord, I never did once go to visit her in my Life; she knows it. Now for a Man officiously to make a new visit in the time of the Assizes, one engaged in business as I was, and especially upon so Melancholly an occasion, I say for me to go officiously to see a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I never had the least knowledge of, would have been thought more strange (and justly might have been so) than the omission of that ceremony. For my part I cannot conceive what Mr. <hi>Gurrey</hi> could mean this being the Case; by saying, that if I had visited Mrs. <hi>Stout,</hi> nothing of this had happened.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. B. Hatsell.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cowper,</hi> he is not the Prosecutor, I think it is no matter what he said.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>I take it my Lord, with humble submission, it is material as he is a principal Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against these Gentlemen; and the rather for that he now pretends, that what he did was out of Conscience. My Lord, I have only one thing more to say, I know not whether it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for me or no to give some account of my self, Sir <hi>William Ashurst,</hi> if you please.</p>

               <speaker>Sir William Ashurst.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, if I had not had a good opinion of this Gentleman, I had not come on purpose to hear this Cause, which has made so great a noise all <hi>England</hi> over.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. B. Hatsell.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir W. Ashurst.</speaker>
               <p>I always thought Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> to be a Gentleman of singular Humanity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrity: he is an Officer in <hi>London,</hi> and as to his management of his Office, I think no Man ever performed it better, or has a better reputation in the place where he lives.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho. Lane.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I came hither on purpose to own this Gentleman, and indeed he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be owned by his Friends, and those that know him; his Character is altogether untaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with us, he has gained a good Reputation in the business wherein he is concerned; he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himself in his Office which he holds of the City of <hi>London,</hi> very honestly and well; I never knew him discover any ill nature in his temper, and I think he cannot be suspected of this or any other act of Barbarity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, in the next place, I would call Mr. <hi>Cox,</hi> who has the honour to serve in Parliament, for the Burrough of <hi>Southwark;</hi> and has been my near Neighbour these Eight or Nine Years. If you please Mr. <hi>Cox,</hi> give an account what Reputation and Character I have in that place.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I live in <hi>Southwark,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> lives; I have lived by him 8 or 9 Years, I know him to be a person of Integrity and Worth; all the Neighbours court his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, I take him to have as much Honour and Honesty as any Gentleman whatsoever; and of all Men that I know, he would be the last Man, that I should suspect of such a Fact as this is: I believe nothing in the World could move him to entertain the least thought of so foul a Fact.</p>

               <p>If you please, my Lord, the first acquaintance I had with Mr. <hi>Cowper,</hi> was in our Childhood, I had the honour to go to <hi>Westminster</hi> School with him; I did not renew my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him till about Five Years ago; since that time I have been often with him, and have several times had occasion to ask his advice, in matters relating to his Profession: and I think no Man more faithful in the service of his Clyent than he is, and I am sure he is very deserving of the esteem of any Man, and I believe he never entertain'd a thought of so fowl and barbarous a Fact as this, of which he is accused.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Marson.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord our business at <hi>Hartford</hi> was this, Mr. <hi>Ellis Stephens</hi> and I went down, he is Clerk of the Papers of the <hi>King's Bench</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> is Steward of the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> and it was their Duty to wait upon my Lord Chief Justice with the Marshal of the <hi>King's Bench</hi> out of Town, and on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning we went to my Lord Chief Justice's House in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</hi> as we used to do, and there set out, but I being an Attorney of the Borough Court could not with any convenience go farther with them than to a place which I think is called <hi>Kingsland,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I returned to my Business in <hi>Southwark,</hi> where I attended the Court as was customary and necessary for me to do, and set forth from thence at past 4 in the Afternoon; by the way as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member about <hi>Waltham-Cross</hi> I met one Mr. <hi>Hanks</hi> a Clergyman of my acquaintance who had been likewise to attend my Lord Chief Justice to <hi>Hertford</hi> and was returning from thence, with some perswasion I prevailed with him to go back again with me to <hi>Hertford,</hi> telling him, I did not know the way, and we gallop'd every step of it because Night was coming on, it was about 8 a Clock when we came in, Mr. <hi>Hanks</hi> and I found the Marshal, Mr. <hi>Stevens,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rutkin,</hi> and others of the Marshal's Acquaintance at the Coffee-House; and truly when I came in I might for ought I know be in a Sweat with riding so hard as we did, but even then I was not in such a Sweat as the Witness would have it. My Lord, we went from thence to the <hi>Glove and Dolphin</hi> and stayed there till about 11 a Clock, Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> and I had a Dispute who should lie with Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> at the now Witness Mr. <hi>Gurry's,</hi> at last it was agreed between us to go to <hi>Gurry's</hi> to see what Convenience he could make for us, and Mr. <hi>Rutkin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hanks</hi> went with us with design to drink a Glass of Wine at our Lodging, but afterwards it came in Mr. <hi>Rutkin's</hi> Head, that he was to lie with the Marshal, and for that reason he said he would go back again, and accordingly he went, and Mr. <hi>Hanks</hi> with him after they had seen us into our Lodgings, and Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> and I drank 3 Bottles of Wine together, Mr. <hi>Gurry</hi> our Landlord was sent to fetch it; and afterwards in jocular Conversation I believe Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> might ask Mr. <hi>Gurry</hi> if he knew one Mrs. <hi>Sarah Stout,</hi> and the reason why he ask'd that Question our Witnesses will explain; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he might likewise ask, what sort of Woman she was; and possibly I might say the words, <hi>My Friend may be in with her,</hi> tho' I remember not I did say any thing like it, but I say there is a possibility I might, because I had heard she had deny'd Mr. <hi>Marshal's</hi> Suit, and that might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to say, <hi>my Friend may be in with her,</hi> for all that I remember, I confess Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> ask'd me what Money I had got that Day, meaning at the Borough Court, I answer'd, Fifty Shillings, saith he, we have been here a spending our Money, I think you ought to treat us, or to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; as for the Bundle mention'd, I had no such except a pair of Sleeves and a Neckcloth: As to the Evidence which goes to words spoken, the Witnesses have fruitful Inventions, and as they have wrested and improved the Instances I have been particular in, so have the rest, or otherwise forged them out of their own Heads.</p>

               <p>Till about 11, little more of less, we went away together in order to drink a Glass of Wine with them at their Lodging, but <hi>Mr. Rutkin</hi> considering that he was to drink a Glass of Wine, and lye with the Marshall, thought it would disturb the Marshall, so faith he, <hi>I will not go in,</hi> but we saw them go into their Lodgings and returned to the <hi>Bull,</hi> where we eat part of a Fowl, and I was never out of <hi>Mr. Marson</hi>'s company all that time.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I came to wait on the Marshal of the <hi>King's Bench</hi> to <hi>Hertford,</hi> and when we were come to <hi>Hertford</hi> we put up our Horses at the Bull, and made ourselves a little clean, we went to Church, and din'd at the <hi>Bull,</hi> and then we walk'd in and about the Court and diverted our selves till about 7 a Clock, and between 7 and 8 a Clock came Mr. <hi>Marson</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hanks</hi> to Town, and then we agreed to go to the <hi>Dolphin and Glove</hi> to drink a Glass of Wine, the Marshall went to see an ancient Gentleman and we went to the <hi>Dolphin and Glove</hi> and staid there till past 10 a Clock, and after the Reckoning was paid we went with them to their Lodging with a Design to take a Glass of Wine, but then I consider'd I was to lie with the Marshal, and for that reason I resolv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d not to go in, but came away, and went to the <hi>Bull Inn,</hi> and after I drank part of a Pint of Wine, and afterwards I went to the next Door to the <hi>Bull Inn</hi> where I lay with the Marshall.</p>

               <p>My Lord, because these Gentlemen are Strangers in the Country I think if in taking an account of any Evidence for my self there is any thing occurs to me that they may have a just advantage of, I think I ought not to conceal it, for I am as much concern'd to justifie their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence as my own: The principal Witness against them is one <hi>Gurrey,</hi> and I will prove to you, that since he appear'd in this Court and gave his Evidence he went out in a triumphant manner, and boasted, that he by his management had done more against these Gentlemen than all the Prosecutors Witnesses could do besides; to add to that I have another piece of Evidence that I have been just acquainted with. My Lord, it is the Widow <hi>Davis, Gurrey's</hi> Wives Sister that I would call.</p>

               <p>They ask'd him, if he knew any occasion for Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi>'s Death, and he said he knew nothing of it, or of any Letters.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Iones.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, they would call witnesses to this Gentlewoman's Reputation, I believe the whole Town would attest for that, that she was a Woman of a good Reputation; indeed they have produced some Letters without a name, but if they insist upon any thing against her Reputation we must call our Witnesses.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bar. Hatsell.</speaker>
               <p>I believe no body disputes that, she might be a vertuous Woman, and her Brains might be turned by her Passion or some Distemper.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard a very long Evidence; I am sure, that you can't expect that I should summ it up fully; but I will take notice of some things to you, that I think are most material, and if I omit any thing that is material, I would desire Mr. <hi>Iones</hi> (that is Council for the King) and Mr. <hi>Cowper,</hi> to put me in mind of it.</p>
               <p>The Indictment against the Prisoners at the Bar, is for a very great crime, it is for Murther, which is one of the most horrid of all Crimes: you are to consider first, what Evidence you have heard to prove it; and though there be no direct proof, you are to consider what is circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial:</p>
               <p>They do begin with <hi>Sarah Walker,</hi> who was Mrs. <hi>Sarah Stout</hi>'s Maid, and she tells you, That Mr. <hi>Cowper,</hi> when he came to this Town upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>he <hi>Monday</hi> 13th of <hi>March</hi> last, came to Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi> s house and dined there, and went away about four of the Clock in the Afternoon; but she tells you, that the <hi>Friday</hi> before, there came a Letter from Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi>'s Wife to Mrs. <hi>Stout,</hi> to let her know, that Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> would come and lodge at their house at <hi>Hertford</hi> at the Assizes, so that when he came, she thought that he had intended to have done according to that Letter.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65427:24"/>
she saith, that after dinner Mr <hi>Cowper</hi> went away, and came again at 9 at night, and there he supped, he was des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>red so to do, (and indeed had been invited to Dinner also that day,) and she doth say, that after Supper, there was a Fire made in his Chamber (for this young Gentlewoman Mrs <hi>Stout,</hi> prest him to lye at their house) and she ordered the Maid to warm his Bed, and I believe, says she, Mr <hi>Cowper</hi> heard her say so, for he was nearer to her than I at that time, and he doth not deny, but that he heard it; she says, that accordingly she went up to warm the Bed, and having staid there a while, she heard the door clap, and when she came down into the Parlour, where she had left them, they were both gone, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>he could not tell what the meaning of it was, and they waited for her all night, old Mrs <hi>Stout</hi> and this Maid, and she did not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come in all night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor was afterwards seen alive. But Mr <hi>Cowper</hi> was the last person seen in her Company.</p>
               <p>The other witnesses that came afterwards speak concerning the finding of the Body in the River, and tell you in what posture it was, I shall not undertake to give you the particulars of their Evidence, but they tell 'you she lay on her right side, the one arm up even with the surface of the water, and her body under the water, but some of her, Cloaths were above the water, particularly one says the rus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>les of her left arm were above the water, you have heard also what the Doctors and Surgeons said on the one side and the other concerning the swimming and sinking of dead bodies in the water, but I can find no crrtainty in it, and I leave it to your consideration.</p>
               <p>Another circumstance they build on, and which seems to be material, is of her Belly being lank, and that there was no swelling, whereas, say they, when a person is drowned, there is a great deal of water goes in, and makes the belly to swell, but here was no swelling that morning she was taken out, and no water come out of her mouth and nostrils, only a little f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>oth there was, and her Belly was lank, but, say they, on the other side, that may very well be, for perhaps she might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> choaked immediately, as soon as she was in the water, and, say they, you may not wonder at that, for it she went drown herself, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>he would endeavour to be choaked as soon as she could, for those persons that are drowned against their own consent do swallow a great deal of water, but those that drown themselves don't swallow much water, for they are choaked immediately by the water going into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>indpipe, that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call going the wrong way. The Doctors and Surgeons have talkt a great deal to this purpose, and of the waters going into the Lungs or the Thorax, but unless you have more skill in Anatomy than I, you won't be much edified by it, I acknowledge I never studied Anatomy, but I perceive that the Doctors do differ in their notions about these things, but as to matter of Fact. it is agreed to by all the witnesses for the King, that her body was l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nk, her belly was thin, and there was no sign of any water to be in it. They on the other side tell you, that her Stays was on, and she was streight laced, and that might occasion her bellys being so small, and hinder the water from going in.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I was very much puzzled in my thoughts, and was at a loss to find out what Inducement there could be to draw in Mr <hi>Cowper,</hi> or these 3 other Gentlemen to commit such a horrid barbarous Murder. And on the other hand, I could not imagin what there should be to induce this Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a person of a plentiful Fortune, and a very sober good reputation, to destroy her self.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, I must confess the evidence that the Defendants have given by these Letters, if you believe them to be this Gentlewomans hand writing, do seem to fortifie all that Mr <hi>Cowpers</hi> witnesses have said concerning her being melancholy, it might be a love distraction, and she might have been a vertuous woman for all that, for it might be a distemper which c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>me upon her, and turned her Brains, and discompos'd her mind, and then no wonder at her writing thus, in a manner different from the rest of the actions of her Life. Gentlemen, you are to consider and weigh the Evidence, and I will not trouble you any more about that matter. As to these 3. other Gentlemen that came here to this Town at the time of the last Assizes, what there is against them you have heard, they talk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> at their Lodging at a strange rar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> concerning this Mrs <hi>Sarch Stout,</hi> saying her business is done, and that there was an end of her Courting days, and that a Friend of theirs was even with her by this time. What you can make of it, that I must leave to you, but they were very strange expressions, and you are to judge whether they were spoken in jest as they pretend, or in earnest. There was a Cord found in the Room, and a Bundle seen there, but I know not what to make of it. As to Mrs <hi>Stout,</hi> there was no sign of any circle about her Neck, which, as they say, must have been if she had been strangled. Some spots there were, but it is said possibly those might be occasioned by rubbing against some Piles or Stakes in the River. Truly, Gentlemen, these three men by their talking have given great cause of suspition, but whether they, or Mr <hi>Cowper,</hi> are guilty or no, that you are to determin. I am sensible I have omitted many things, but I am a little a faint, and cannot repeat any more of the Evidence.</p>
