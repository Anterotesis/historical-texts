            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>There is an other which is called in Latyn, <hi>Actiua,</hi> in Englyſh prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and conſiſteth in doynge, as dawnſyng, and harpyng, wyth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lyke.</p>
               <p>The thyrde in Latyn maye be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Factiua,</hi> which beſyde the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe and ſtudye, leaueth behynde his woorke, as payntyng, &amp; buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng,
<pb facs="tcp:21869:7"/>
and of this kynde there be two artes, for ſome make the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes them ſelues, as weuyng &amp; tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſome correct and amend the thynges, whan they be made: as botchyng and clowtyng of old garmentes houſes, &amp; other thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges The fowerth in Latyn is called <hi>comparans,</hi> which in our tong may be called a gettyng arte, for it do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth make nothynge, but by ſtudye, &amp; induſtry getteth certen thynges as fyſſhynge and huntyng, theſe truly do make nothyng: but their ſtudy &amp; labor is to get ſomthyng. And to be brefe, Phiſicke as Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſayeth, is a kynde of thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes whiche reſtoreth theyr woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes nowe alreadye done, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth the ſame, and not of them whiche make theyr workes newe. For Phiſicke of her ſelfe maketh
<pb facs="tcp:21869:8"/>
not her examples, as the arte of buyldyng, knyttyng, and weuing dothe. But as that arte that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth olde houſes, and piceth olde garmentes: ſo phiſike doth amend the euyll conſtitution of mannes bodye.</p>

               <p>Therfore as Gallen counſelleth in the firſte boke of elementes, go not about to ſerche out or to finde in any naturall body, any thinge that is ſimple, and not mixt, or compounded, leſte thou loſe thy peyne, but be contented yf thou ſe a member that is could, hard, and drye, and a nother that is moyſte, rare, and fluxible, to thinke the tone to come of the yearth,

The ix. difference, which I ſayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was temperat, may be taken .ii. manner of wayes, ether tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat ſimple and abſolutly, or elles temperate in euerye kynde of

thinges: loke what is temperate ſimply, and abſolutly, that in the reſpect of all thinges, is temperat and in it the elementes be equally mingled, and ſuch a thinge muſt be knowen by cogitacion only, for other wayes it cannot, as Gallen is a manifeſte witneſſe in the firſte boke, that he writ in the defence of health.</p>
               <p>And that is temperat in euery kind, in the which, is the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity of contrary elementes, as is conuenient to the nature, not only of man and beſt, but alſo of trees, and plantes, and this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament is in all them that be hole accordynge to there nature, and it may be knowen of hys functions, and officis, who is hole according to hys nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21869:19"/>For he that can doe euerie thing well, which he is apt to doe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, is as hole as nature made hym, whether it be man or beſt or it be tree, or plant: as an apple tre is very well, or hole, according to his nature, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he bereth a great number of good apples, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an horſe, whan he runneth very ſwift. Therfore this is not the temperament, which is meſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by weyght, wherin ther is as many degrees of heat, as of cold, and of drineſſe as of moiſture, for that is no where, nor can not be knowen, but by cogitation, as is a foreſayd: but in this temperament which is in euery kynd of thinges the elementes be ſo mixt, that the temperament which commeth of the mixture, agreeth both to the nature of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, beſtes, and plantes.
<pb facs="tcp:21869:19"/>
Therefore it is called a tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, accordynge vnto iuſtice, which meſureth to euery man, not by weyght, but by dignity: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what ſoeuer thinge exceadeth this temperament, ether in heate, could, drynes, or moyſture, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame is not temperate: and of the ſame that redoundeth it taketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name, as if it be hete that is ſuperfluous then it is called hot, &amp; loke what thinge hath more hete, then colde, that ſame is hote, &amp; contrary, yf it haue more cold than heate, it is called could, &amp; lykewiſe that that hath more moyſture, then drines, is named moyſt: and agayne, yf it haue more drines the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moyſture, then it may be called dry: and here of it commeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſummer is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hote, becauſe it hath more hete then coulde, and wynter is called

colde, becauſe it hath more colde then heate: furthermore if a thinge excede in heat and moyſture to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or in colde and dryneſſe, or in hete and dryneſſe, or in colde and moyſture, then it muſt take name, of the qualities which excedeth: as yf heat and moyſture excede, then it muſt be called hote and moyſte: yf colde and drynes, cold and dry: and ſo of the other. And hereof it is euident, that ſumtyme one tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament is equall and temperate in one oppoſicion, and diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and not equall in an other.</p>
               <p>For yf it be not neceſſary, for that that is hote to be dry, but may be moyſt, then it may alſo be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, becauſe the meane is nygher to the dry temperature, then is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moyſt: and lykewiſe an other tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature that is colde yf it may as

               <p>The ſame anſwere may be made of drye and moyſte, that before is made of hote and colde. Therefore it is no maruayle, though there be ſumthinge temperate in the one halfe, and not temperate in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But here thou muſt take hede, yf thou be axed of what tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature a man, an aſſe, or an oxe is, that thou anſwere not ſymply and abſolutly: For to that that is ſpoken diuerſly, and is diuerie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of it ſelfe, no man can make ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely &amp; ſimply a direct anſwere: Therfore before thou make thyne anſwere, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> muſt bid hym, ſhowe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the aſſe, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oxe, whereof he douteth: then yf he dout of a man,

thou muſte haue a reſpect to the perfit man, whiche (as Gallen ſayeth in the firſte boke of his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peramentes) is neyther hote, nor coulde, and as he differeth from hym, ſo make anſwere, ſayinge eyther that he is hot, or otherwiſe as thy iudgement ſhall lede the: but yf he doubt of a beſt, then thou muſt haue an eye to the hole kynde of men. For all other kindes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto it, are diſtemperat, &amp; as he differeth from mankynde, eyther in hete, or otherwiſe, ſo ſhape hym an anſwere. And that thou be not deceyued, in makyng thyne anſwere, thou muſte vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtand, that heat, coulde, dry, and moyſt, be taken diuerſly: For firſt they be taken abſolutely, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that is to ſay without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of other bodyes: and of
<pb facs="tcp:21869:21"/>
this ſorte, the only elementes be hot, coulde, dry, &amp; moyſt: ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely they be ſpoken by exceſſe, as whan there is in one thing, more hete then coulde, more dryneſſe, then moyſture, or other wyſe: and of this faſſion bloud, fleme, wyne, oyle, &amp; honny, be called hot, colde, dry, and moyſt: and that, that is called hote, colde, dry, and moyſte of this ſort, is ſpoken yet .2. maner of wayes. fyrſt abſolutly, that is compared to no one alone, but to the hole nature of thinges, and of this faſſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a dog, ſimply, &amp; abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luetly taken, and not compared to any thing alone, is dry: otherwiſe that is to ſay not abſolutly, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to ſum one alone, may be moyſt, as to a piſmyre. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, there be .iii. diuers maner of compariſons, the firſt is betwyxt
<pb facs="tcp:21869:22"/>
two of diuers kyndes, as a man to a beaſte. The ſecond is whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſtemperate is compared to the temperate of the ſame kynde, as a man compared to the parfit man, whereof we ſpake before. The thirde is, whan .ii. diſtemperate of one kynde, is compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as one man to an other, one lyon to an other, one horſe to an other. Whoſoeuer dothe diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly examin theſe thinges, may eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iudge of what temperament the iiii. tymes of the yere, that is to ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpringe, ſummar, autumne, and winter, be. For euery one of theſe by hym ſelfe and without compariſon, maye be called hote cold, drye, or moyſt, &amp; of this faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſpring is withoute all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, becauſe there is not as is in wynter, more colde then heat: nor
<pb facs="tcp:21869:22"/>
as in ſummar, more heat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cold: lykewyſe there is a mediocritie of dryneſſe and moyſture, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hippocrates ſayeth, that it is the moſt holſumeſt tyme of all the yere, and a tyme in the which there chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeth no deadly ſicknes. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſte part of the diſeaſes of the ſpringe, happen by reſon that all the euyll humors be driuen from the innar partes, in to the ſkynne. Wherefore the diſeaſes be rather to be imputed to the body, then to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeare. For what body ſo euer hath good homours, that bodye remayneth ſtyll in healthe, ſo long as the ſpryng laſteth: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture it doeth not ſo in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, autumne or wynter, becauſe theſe tymes brede or encreſe euyll humors: as ſummar encreaſeth chollar, &amp; autumne melancholy, &amp; wynter fleme &amp; watriſh humors.
<pb facs="tcp:21869:23"/>
It is poſſible, that ſum man wyll reprehend my ſayinges, obiecting the begynnyng of the ſpringe to be coulde, accordyng to wynter, &amp; the latter ende hot, as in ſummar. In dede I confeſſe no leſſe, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> begynnynge of the ſpringe, to be a lytell coulde, and the latter ende, a lytell hote, but not in exceſſe, as it is eyther in ſummar, or wynter. Wherfore it can not be called hote and moyeſt, as ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me doe ſuppoſe, becauſe it can not be hot and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat, both at one tyme. As for ſummar by the conſent, as well of the Philoſophers, as of phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is hot and dry, becauſe there is in it more heat then could, more drineſſe, then moyſture. Autumne ſimply, and without exception, can not be called colde, and dry, as ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me holde opinion, for it is not
<pb facs="tcp:21869:23"/>
coulde, becauſe there is as muche heate as coulde, ſeing the middle of the day is much hotter, then the mornynge, and euenynge. Therefore it is founde to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperat, in heat, and coulde, and ſo mixt of bothe, that it can nether be called hote, nether coulde. Therefore it is full of perilouſe diſeaſes becauſe it is diſtempered both in heate, and coulde: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath more dryneſſe, then moyſture, therefore it is called dry. As for wynter it is moyſt, &amp; could, not becauſe it is more moyſt &amp; coulde, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other times of the yere, but becauſe there is more moyſture then drines, more could then heate. Nowe that I haue ſo brefelye (as I coulde) declared the temperamentes of the tymes of the yere, it is mete &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient,
<pb facs="tcp:21869:24"/>
to ſhewe in as fewe wordes as I can, the temperamentes of the iiii. ages, which are chyldehode, youth, mannes ſtate, and olde age: Chyldehode is from the chyldyng the ſpace of .xv. yere next folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, and it is hote and moyſt, and that is eaſie to be perceyued here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that the firſt conſtitution of the chylde, is of ſeede, and bloude, the whiche both be hote and moyſt. Youthe beginneth where chylde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod endeth, &amp; continueth .x. yeres: in this age ther is more firye heat, &amp; leſſe natural heat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode as Gallen witneſſeth in hys ſecond boke of temperamentes. Mannes ſtate begynneth at .xxv. and continueth to .xxxv. the which tyme is hote and dry: Olde age beginneth at .xxxv. and continueth the reſt of the lyfe, though ſumme

               <p>Theſe humours be called hot, could, dry, and moyſt, becauſe they be ſo in power, and not in acte, and ther is great difference betwixte thinges that be hot of power: and thinges hot in acte. For that thing is hot in acte, which is hot alredy, and that is hot in power, which is not hot alredy, but may, and is apt to be hot afterward, &amp; ſo we call bryne, or vinegar drye, though
<pb facs="tcp:21869:25"/>
they appere to the eye to be moyſt, yet experience hath proued them drye, becauſe they conſume the ſuperfluous humours, bothe of fleſh, &amp; alſo other thinges. Whan theſe .iiii. humours reſerue theyr forſayde qualities, then the body wherein they be, is hole, and with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out diſeaſe, and the before named humours, be called of the Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, naturall. The receptacles of bloud, be the vaynes, and pulſes, but the bloud, that is contayned in the pulſes, (as Gallen ſayeth in his firſt boke, and firſt chapter of affected places) differeth from the blowde of the vaynes, in that, that the blowde of the pulſes is both hotter, thynnar, &amp; yelower. The well of the blowde, is the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, &amp; not onely that, but alſo the firſt inſtrument of mannes bodye
<pb facs="tcp:21869:26"/>
and the naturall and true cullour of the blowd, is red: which Galen affirmeth in many places. Where blowde redoundeth the body is feat, fayer, mery, &amp; pleſantly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Flewme, of cullour is white, which at the length by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes of naturall heat, may be tourned in to bloude: and therefore ſeinge it is a nowriſhment but halfe boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nature hath prouided no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre, or peculier receptacle for the pourgynge of it. For flewme en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in the ſtomake or mawe, be cauſe it is carryed together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the iuice that came of the meate &amp; drinke vp in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuer, is at length by much alteration tourned into bloude, and that which is caryed together with the bloud in the vaynes, may ſkant be ſpared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it mittigateth the greate feruent, and outragious heat of
<pb facs="tcp:21869:26"/>
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud: therfore it hath morenede to tarry ſtyll &amp; be altered, then to be pourged, &amp; caryed away, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that remayneth behynde in the guttes, is pourged, &amp; caryed quite oute at the fundament, by reaſon of the chollar cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mynge fro the lyuer (as Gallen ſayeth in the .v. of his bokes, of the vſe of the partes of mannes body.) The excrement which falleth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brayne in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth, can not properly be called flewme but rather muck, or ſniuil: flewmatick bodyes, be ſlothfull, ſlepy, fleſhye, &amp; ſoone horeheared. Yelowe chollar hath his name, of his culour, &amp; nature hathe proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a proper place for it, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blather vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuer: for it was neceſſary for it to be parted from the bloud, leſt at the length y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole body, ſhould becumne yelowe, as it doth in the yelowe Iawndies.
<pb facs="tcp:21869:27"/>
Cholericke men be angry, ſharpe wytted, nymble, and quicke in all theyr affayers, inconſtant, and leane and good digeſters of theyr meat: melancholy is the dregges and filthe of the bloud, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is blacke, as it appereth in the name: it were great daunger, for it to be left in the liuer, therfore the ſplyne is prouided of nature, to receyue it, the which ſplyne yf it drawe leſſe then it ſhould do, then the melancholy, or blacke chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, is left with the blowde: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof the body getteth a black colour, or at the leaſt a feuer quartayne. Men that be melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, be ſottell, couetouſe, greate frettars with them ſelues, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faythful, ſad, and carefull, enuious ferfull, and weak ſprited. The vſe of theſe forſayde humors, is ſuch

                  <pb facs="tcp:21869:41"/>After the meaſure the Phiſition ought immediatly to marke well the qualitie of the meates: For ſuch as be hole, to the ende that they may kepe theyr health, muſte be fed with meates of lyke, &amp; not of contrary qualitie: and ſuche as be ſicke, ought to be fed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meates of contrary qualitie: As they that be ſycke for hete, muſt be remedied by meates that be coulde, &amp; they that be ſicke of colde diſeaſes, muſt haue hote meates: and in diſeaſes that be moyſte, dry meates: and in dry diſeaſes, moyſt meates. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuche as haue moyſt bodies, as childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, muſt be fed with moyſt meates: and ſuch as be ſicke of dry diſeaſes, as of feuers, muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be fed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moyſt meates, the tone to kepe theyr bodyes moyſt ſtyll, &amp; the other, to amende and correcte

their dryneſſe: and lykewiſe of the reſt. Such as be hote of nature, muſt eat hot meates, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may kepe theyr heat ſtyll, but yf theyr heat once waxe vnnaturall, then it muſt be brought in temper, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> healp of ſuch thinges, as are colde: and yf they be ouer colde, by heat: and yf they be ouer moyſt, by dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: but if theyr heat, colde, drineſſe or moyſture be naturall, &amp; excede not, then it muſt be cheriſhed ſtyll with meates of like qualities, as I ſaid before. Next the qualitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the cuſtume, for that ought not to be broken, except there be great cauſe whye, ſeing that ſuch meates as a man hath accuſtomed hym ſelfe vnto, although they be worſe, hurt not ſo much as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe, of the which he hath not accuſtomed to eat of. Therfore in
<pb facs="tcp:21869:42"/>
diſeaſes, the Phiſition may not be to buſie, in pluckyng away their pacientes from theyr accuſtomed meates &amp; drinkes: but if it happen ſo, that of neceſſitie there muſt be a change, then it may not be done raſhely, or all at ones, but fayre &amp; ſoftly, and by lyttell, &amp; lytell. For all ſudden mutations, be daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. And it is mete for the Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obſerue, in what meates y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſicke deliteth moſt. For ſuche as he hath pleaſure of in the eatinge, the ſame the ſtomake enbraſeth more gredely: and digeſteth or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth much ſoner, &amp; therfore they muſt be taken, &amp; preferred before better, though they be worſe. Fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thermore he muſt take heed what order his pacient kepe in hys diet, for it is a prepoſterous ordar, to beginne with quynces or orynges
<pb facs="tcp:21869:42"/>
and ende with ſallades, made of herbes, and oyle.</p>
               <p>Take this alwayes as a generall rule, that that meat which is moſt eaſy to be digeſted, ſhoulde be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before that, that is hardar: &amp; that alſo that is moyſt, before that that is drie: and that that is leuſe and ſlipperie, before that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is hard and byndinge. Amongeſt other thinges, the time of eatyng wolde not be forgotten.</p>
               <p>They that be hole, ſhoulde exerciſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelfes before they eat, &amp; ſhould not eat againſt theyr appetite, nor abſtayne whan ther appetite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh them: &amp; they that be ſicke, ſhoulde vtterlye forbeare, vntyll there fittes were in the declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ful finiſhed.</p>

&amp; the pacientes ſtrength ſo weake, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhall be nedefull to fede them, both in their fittes, &amp; out of theyr fittes: howbeit I leaue that to the diſcretion of the Phiſition. And I thinke it but well doone, to put you in remembraunce, what your diet ſhould be, in the .iiii. ſeuerall times of the yere: In winter, more meat and leſſe drinke, and meates and drinkes that be hot and drye, as roſted meates, and wyne then may ſafely be dronken, withoute water. In the ſpring, we ſhoulde eat ſumdele leſſe, and drinke a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell more then in wynter, and eate alſo more of fleſhe, and change fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> roſted to boyled: In ſummar we muſt endeuer oure ſelfes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> oure bodies may be ſoft, and colde, and therfore we muſt eat leſſe, &amp; drinke the more, and eat for the moſt part
<pb facs="tcp:21869:43"/>
boyled meates, &amp; ſuch as is colde. In Autumne we ſhould eat ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge more then in ſummer, and drinke leſſe, and of byggar drinkes be ſumthinge more bolder then in ſummer. And as the tyme is to be conſidered, ſo is the age alſo. For chyldren muſt be fed, with moyſt meates. And ſuch as be not yet at their groeth, becauſe their bodies be more temperate, muſte haue, more temperate meates. And luſty men ſuch as is alredye paſte theyr groeth, becauſe their bodies be hot, and dry, ſhoulde haue lyke meates, that is to ſay ſuche as is hot &amp; dry: olde men becauſe their bodies be ouer cold and dry, muſt be fed with meates, that be hote and moyſte.</p>

But the vtter vayne, which is called <hi>cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi> &amp; in engliſhe the head vayne, owghte to be ſmitten whan the partes aboute the necke be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head, and face. The mid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dell vayne, which is called <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> wolde not be medled with, but there as the other vaynes, appere not. There be vaynes alſo at the knees, and anclees, which whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſeaſe liethe lowe, is moſt meet to be opened. The laſt care, and charge ſhowlde be, of the ſtintyng
<pb facs="tcp:21869:52"/>
of the bloud: For how much the better it runneth, ſo muche the ſoonar it wolde be ſtinted, or ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but after that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vaine is ones ſmitten, it ſhoulde not be ſtayed, vntyl ether that the bloud, or pulſe were chaunged. The ſeconde way of emptiynge the body, is by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyne receyued in to the ſtomake, which ſhould not be vſed but wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body is replete with euyll, and corrupt humors: wherfore ſuch as be in healthe and haue good and ſwete humors, Hippocrates wold in no caſe to be purged, by any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, for feare of diſſoluing theyr power. But ſuch as haue nede of pourgynge, muſt firſt make them ſelfes apt &amp; meete for the ſame, by bathes &amp; eatyng of moyſt meates: for ſo they ſhall delyuer theyre guttes from obſtructions.
<pb facs="tcp:21869:53"/>
Howbeit yf the humors be thicke &amp; clammy, then they muſt be made thinne, &amp; ſubtell and apt to runne, by ſuche decoctions &amp; ſyrupes as doe incyde groſſe matter. But yf y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> humors be thinne and ſubtell, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue no nede of any prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyue, and the Phiſition ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to obſerue, that he pourge no humors whiche be crude and rawe, except for theyr multitude they ſwell the bodye, then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute any more delyberation, they muſte forthwithal be taken away with a pourginge medicyne: leſte the ſtrength of the body be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or the fyerye heat of the feuer encreſed, or finally the humors be dryuen to ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> principall part, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Nature ſhalbe leſſe able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the body: For yf nature be not holpen before that tyme, ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:21869:53"/>
ſhall be in ſuche a rage, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge can be done well or order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in the bodye. The next care is what humor ſhould be pourged. Therefore the Phiſition ſhoulde take heede that he pourge no moo humors, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be hurtfull to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye: As yf fleume do redounde &amp; hurt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, it only is to be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: yf chollar, ether yelowe, or blacke, offende the bodye, then he ſhould vtterly abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fleume and likewiſe whan water aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, it only ſhoulde be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye: for as Hippocrates ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, if ſuch humors be pourged, as ought to be, it profiteth the bodye, and is donne, withoute gryefe or payne, but elles it is cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Beſyde this, the time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeare woulde be conſidered, as well in pourging as in lettyng of bloud.
<pb facs="tcp:21869:54"/>
For there be ſumme tymes of the yere in the whiche it is very mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to lewſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bellie: For in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whan it is froſt or ſnowe, or in ſummar, when the heat is outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, whoſoeuer is pourged ſhal be much the worſe for it: and yet of both times, the leſſe mete for pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng, is the ſummar. For then the body is ſo aduſt, with heate of the wether, that it is not well able to beare the ſharpneſſe of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyne, and nature alſo beinge made weake with the heate of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, is more weakned of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicyne: inſomuch that many being pourged then, fall ſicke of feuers, &amp; be quite deſtitute of their ſtrength. Therefore the ſpringe tyme, of all other tymes of the yere, is moſte holſome, bothe to powrge the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to let bloude.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21869:54"/>In pourgynge the body, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion alſo muſt be conſidered. For yf it be very hot, it letteth the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge of the medicyne, becauſe it draweth the humors in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſkin, and the aboundaunce of heate healpeth to diſſolue the ſtrength. The age may not be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For chyldren becauſe they be not yet at their groweth, be nothing mete for pourgations: lykewyſe olde me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they waxe weake, ſhoulde not be troubled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any medicines. And as in all euacuations, ſo in pourging of the belly, the ſtrength of the ſicke muſt be earneſtly loked vpon: For ſo longe as the ſicke, maye abyde eaſilye the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of his humors, he may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be pourged, &amp; no longer though all be not gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21869:55"/>In leuſyng the belly, vehement &amp; ſtronge laxes, be vtterly to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred: for beſydes that they wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſtrength, they hurt marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly the ſtomacke. Laſte of all in pourgyng of the bellye, the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes wolde be taken heede to, of the Phiſicion, becauſe he may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine diuerſe thinges bothe of their ſubſtance, qualitie, and coulour. The thirde way to cleanſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is by vomit, wherof Nature hath much good: For they that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit often, for the moſt part be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hole. For there is euacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made as well of flewme, as of chollar: by meanes wherof, the ſtomacke is not filled with euyll humors &amp; the head findeth muche eaſe. Vomiting is moſt profitable for them that be cholerick, hauing large breſtes, ſhort neckes, &amp; wide
<pb facs="tcp:21869:55"/>
mouthes, it profiteth alſo to ſuch as by meanes of great eatynge &amp; drinkinge, reſerue crude, and rawe humors in theyr ſtomakes: yet he that wyll be hole and pourpoſeth to be olde, let hym not be to buſye with vomittynge: For the muche vſe of it cauſeth deafneſſe, &amp; hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the eyes, it breaketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vaynes of the breſte and lunges, it offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the teathe, and cauſeth head ache. Therfore it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Phiſitions dutie to declare, who is apt to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and who is not. For ſuche as be not apte to vomit, ſhoulde be pourged dounwarde, and in no-caſe conſtrayned to vomit: ſuch as be not apt to vomite be they that be betwixt fat and lene, hauynge theyr breſtes narrowe, and theyr neckes long: and ſuch as be leane, ſlender, and haue wyde breſtes, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:21869:56"/>
ſhorte neckes, be apt to vomit. In vomittyng the excrement muſt be loked well vpon, for the ſight of it, ſhall amend the coniecture of the Phiſicion. The forth way of emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, is by boxyng: which (as Gallen ſayeth in hys boke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wrote of boxing) doth not only make euacuation and drawe oute muche matter, but alſo eaſeth the payne, and diminiſheth the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, diſſolueth wynde, and ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp appetite where it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt loſt, confirming the ſtrength of weake ſtomakes, calleth againe life in ſwounes, and fayntynges, it draweth alſo ſwellynges and fluxes, from one part to another, &amp; ſtinteth bledyng, and ſtayeth we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens flowers. There be .2. kindes of boxing, on is withoute any ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifiyng, which preuayleth moſte in
<pb facs="tcp:21869:56"/>
drawing backe of humours, as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> drawing back of wemens flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to much, &amp; theſe be light boxing glaſſes, which be vſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out ſcarifiyng.

That is called na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural which ſpringeth of his owne accorde, without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> healp of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes inuention.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21869:57"/>Of naturall bathes ſumme be hote by the mixture of niter, ſalte, allume, brimſtone, chaulke, lyme, yro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, copper, goulde, ſyluer &amp; tinne, which ether lieth in the bothom of the bathe, or elles in the rockes, or hylles from whence the ſpringe cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, whereof water taketh his qualitie: &amp; by this reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bathes which be in a towne, called Bathe here in Englande, be hote: to the great admiration of all ignorante people. Theſe kyndes of bathes be good for ſuche as be diſeaſed in their ioyntes or haue crude, &amp; raw matter in theire bodyes, and be diſeaſed ether with pockes, pyles, or emeroides: but for men, that be in health, and haue ſwete humors they be nothyng mete, yea and the vſe of them, is very perilous. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall bathes, be made by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

witte, therefore they be not in all places lyke: But here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande they be nothing ſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, as in Germany and other places. For here there is but one hotte houſe, and therefore the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell parte of the humor is drawen out, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> groſſe is left behinde. But in Germany, &amp; in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they haue diuers houſes, firſt one, wher they put of their clothes &amp; an other where they be annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and rubbed, and in the thyrde houſe they ſweate and be waſhed: the forthe houſe is not ſo warme as the thyrde, &amp; the fyfthe is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what colde: nowe that I haue de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clared the partes of the artificiall bathes, whiche were vſed in the olde tyme, and yet be in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I purpoſe to ſhewe in as fewe wordes, the commodities of the

ſame, begynnyng with the firſte part, which is a warme houſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with fire, or wyth warme water and ſwete herbes, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente that the littell pores of the ſkynne may open eaſilye, and the hole body with all the humors, be ſumwhat warmed. The nexte houſe beinge ſumthynge warmer, ſtirreth vp the ſpirites, and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the groſſe humors, and the rubbyng with the annoyntynge, correcteth &amp; amendeth the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the ſenewes, ioyntes, and loynes: the thirde houſe by hys greate heat, diſſolueth mightilye the groſſe humours, by meanes, wherof nature pourgeth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of them: and the luke warme water, moyſteth the hole body, &amp; taketh away weryneſſe, yf ther be

any in the vtter partes: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fowerth houſe, becauſe it is ſumwhat col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, reducethe nature by litell, and litell, to here priſtinate ſtate.

The ſixt kinde of thoſe thinges which lewſeth the body, is ſweat: and it ought to be prouoked whan any euyll hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, is in the innar partes, as in feuers &amp; peſtilent agues.</p>
               <p>It may be prouoked diuerſly as by the heate of drye bathes, hote ſtones, &amp; yrons, or by ſwete herbes and warme water, ether in pottes or in blathers. But in all vehement, and ſharpe diſeaſes,
<pb facs="tcp:21869:59"/>
and eſpeciallye in hote agues, the Phiſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhoulde take great hede of the ſweat, markynge very dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlye which is good, and whych is euyll: For by them he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture muche of the cauſe of the grefe, but as Hyppocrates ſayeth, thoſe ſweates in feruent and hote diſeaſes, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng dayes, &amp; doe ende the feuer, be beſt and moſt holſume: and it is not euyll whan the patient ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in euery part of hys body, ſo hys paynes waxe leſſe withall: but wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body ſweateth muche, and the paynes encreaſe, it is not good: Howbeit it is worſt of all, yf the ſweate be cold.

<pb facs="tcp:21869:59"/>
ſhoulde take hede, that it be not to much, for feare of diſſoluyng of the ſtrength of hys pacient. The ſeuenth kynde of euacuation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, wherof we ſpoke before in the fowerthe chapter, of this ſame boke. The .viii. kynde is abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, or hungar, which doth not extenuat nor make euacuation of him ſelfe, but by meanes that that is not reſtored which w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> abſtinence or faſtinge, was waſted. Faſtyng or abſtine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> .ii. wayes eyther vtterly to forbeare bothe meate and drinke, or elles to take ſo much, as is ſufficient to kepe the ſoule and the body together, and no more. Ther is nothyng, that ſo muche profiteth ether the ſicke, or the hole, as doth abſtinence, yf it be taken in due tyme and orderly: and therfore Plinie, (none of the

worſt wryters of Phyſycke) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth ſobrietie in meates and drinkes, ſayinge that it is verye profitable for all men to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in their diet. And the very father of Phiſicke Hyppocrates, affirmeth moderate eatynge and drinking, to be the caſtel of health, and many tymes ſuch as be diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſicke, be cured onlye by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence. In preſcribynge of abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhoulde diſcret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider who may beſt beare it, for as Gallen ſayeth in his .2. boke of temperamentes. They y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue ſmall vaynes, haue but lytell bloude, wherfore they can not faſte without hurtyng theyre bodies, &amp; they that haue great vaynes, haue plentye of bloude, wherefore they maye the better away with abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, without any decay of theyr bodelye health or ſtrength: of ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:21869:60"/>
as be ſicke, they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be full of crude, &amp; rawe humors, be leaſt hurte w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> faſtyng, yea the beſt remedye to all ſuch is abſtine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: but to be brefe none ſhoulde be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to faſt of the Phiſicion, but ſuche as be ſtronge, or elles be ſicke of ſuche diſeaſes as cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of cruditie. As ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, if it be geuen in ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to ſuche as hath nede of it, profiteth very muche, ſo if it be taken out of time, or be geuen to ſuch as nede it not, it hurteth twiſe as much: It is taken out of time, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodye is weake &amp; the diſeaſe eaſy to be ouer cumme, or elles whan it is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto ſuch as be of nature chole<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ricke, for in ſuch it bredeth chollar &amp; cauſeth feuers with many frettes and pinchinges both in the belly &amp; alſo in the mouth of the mawe.</p>

thoſe thinges which healpe eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation: howbeit all ſlepe dothe not extenuat, nor at all tymes, but that only which is taken the body being hungery, or elles by and by after exerciſe and labor: for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heate in ſlepe is called in to the innar partes, whych whan it findeth no nurriſhment nor meate to be altered and digeſted, it doth waſte and conſume the profitable humors of all the body, and ſo of neceſſitie it both drieth the body, &amp; leſſenneth it alſo: the which thing Hyppocrates witneſſeth ſayinge: Much ſlepe drieth his body which before hath bene to muche pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged any manner of way. Alſo in hys .ii. boke that he writ of good ordar of diet, he affirmeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſlepe extenuateth the body which faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or kepeth abſtinence, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

Of all other tymes, that ſlepe whiche is taken in the morninge after exerciſe, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the body moſt, &amp; the ſame alſo doth ſlepe taken after bathes. For the bathe opening the poores, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euacuation of all the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes which lurked in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſkynne, and ſlepe immediatly folowinge the bathe, calleth in the naturall heat agayne and waſteth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable humidity of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> innar partes. The .xii. kynde of euacuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the prouoking of vrine, which ſhould be vſed whan ther is any obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or any great abundaunce of humors about that part of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which in latten is called <hi>gibba</hi> or els in the raynes or bladder, for if the obſtruction be in <hi>cauo hepatis</hi> (which as <hi>gibba</hi> is the plumppeſt

For Gallen ſayeth as the toppe of the liuer, which before is called <hi>gibba</hi> is clenſed by prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge of vrine, ſo the holowe part of the liuer, which I called <hi>cauum</hi> is pourged by lewſyng of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The which ſayinge he repeteth in the .vii. chapter, of his .ii. boke that he write to hys frynde Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, and in many other diuers, and ſundry places. In the prouokynge of vrine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Phiſicion muſt beware that there be no fluxe of bloude, nor exulceration in the raynes or bladder: for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is better to pluck from thence in to other partes of the body, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to drawe from other places thyther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21869:62"/>The .xi. kynde of euacuation, is the drawinge downe of the ſpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, or the excrement of the braine, by the mouthe: whoſe vſe is, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the breſte and the inſtrumentes of brethynge ſhoulde be pourged: wherfore whan the ſpettell is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall bothe in quantitie, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, then it declareth the breſt, &amp; the inſtrumentes of brethynge, to be in perfit health: but whan it is otherwyſe, that is to ſaye of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers cullours &amp; not equall, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the inſtrumentes of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge, and the hole breſt ſo farre to be diſtempered, as it differethe from hys owne naturall cullour, and quantitie. Wherfore the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicion ſhoulde diligently conſider what Hyppocrates hathe writ in the .ii. boke <hi>prog.</hi> and <hi>Aphor</hi> .43. &amp; alſo in ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of the other folowing.

The .xii. kinde of euacuation, is by holdyng medicynes in the roofe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouthe, which is called garge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, vnder the which kynde is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The .xiii. kynde is the bledyng at the noſe, which amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the obſtructions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brayne, &amp; the diſtillations from the heade, in to all partes of the body: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhoulde diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attende that in bledyng at the noſe, he knowe whan to ſtynt it, &amp; whan not: For ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me tyme, whan it hathe bled but a verye litell, it muſt be ſtaied incontinent.

for then it is better to healpe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to expell the nawghtie bloud, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſtay it: wherfore euery Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicion, ſhoulde wel remember this ſayinge of Hyppocrates: whan ſo euer the bledynge at the noſe, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eteth not the body, it muſt be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a dry medicyne. The .xiiii. kynde of euacuation, is wemens flowres, which chaunce to weme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at times appoynted of nature, that by the meanes of them, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye may be pourged, and ſo health defended: wherfore if the flowres be ſuppreſſed at any tyme, excepte that tyme that the woman goethe with childe, or geueth ſucke, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth health vtterly, and marreth the good conſtitution of the body, as well as whan they runne to muche, which Hyppocrates wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth ſaying as foloweth.
<pb facs="tcp:21869:64"/>
Of to many flowres, cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, but of to fewe or not at all, foloweth diſeaſes of the wombe. Yet in ſtopping of the flowres, the Phiſicion ſhoulde behaue hym ſelfe wiſelye, leſt he ſtop them to ſone or to late. For ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wemen hath them naturally longer, then other haue, which Hyppocrates witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſaying: to ſuch wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as haue moyſt bodies, their flowres conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth long, &amp; if they cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not downe quickly, they ſwell with all. The xv. kynde of euacuation is done by the hemorrhoides, which is the name of certayne vaynes cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minge to the loweſte parte of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the which nature purgeth the body of melancholye wherby it deliuereth the bodye, of many diſeaſes: which Hippocrates affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, ſayinge. They that haue the
<pb facs="tcp:21869:64"/>
hemorrhoides be ſafe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all paine of their ſides, and inflammatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their lunges, nor ſhal be troubled nether with byles, ſcurfe, nor no kynde of lepry. Therfore the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt take great hede in ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge of them, leſt they be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of great and perilous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſis, as of the dropſie, &amp; conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He that requireth a longer diſputation of this matter let hym reade ouer Hyppocrates bokes, written of the ſame matter. The xvi. kinde of euacuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or carnall copulation, which profiteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body much yf it be vſed moderatly and in due tyme: For it amendeth the fulneſſe of the body, and as Aetius in the .viii. chapter of hys .iii. boke, &amp; Agineta in the 3. chapter of his .i. boke witneſſeth,
<pb facs="tcp:21869:65"/>
whan the body is at the groweth it maketh it ſtrong, nymble, and quicke, and amendeth the hard ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byt of the bodye: For it mollifieth the inſtrumentes, and dilateth the pores and pourgeth the body of flewme: Morouer it quickneth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wit &amp; pacifieth anger, wherefore it profiteth all them, that haue loſt ther wyttes, either with anger or elles w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſorowe, it profiteth them alſo, which haue the fawling euil: &amp; ſuch as haue heauineſſe in theyr browes, and ache in theyr heades, many tymes be cured by it. Which Hyppocrates confirmeth ſaying: carnal copulation, which is called venus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amendeth all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes that cum of flewme, howbe it yf it be vſed to much, it hurteth the eyes, and all the ſenſis, and the head, ſenewes, breſt, raines, loynes
<pb facs="tcp:21869:65"/>
thyghes, and morouer haſteneth olde age and deth, and vtterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth the ſtrength of the bodye: and hereof it commeth that they that vſe it to much, be forgetfull, and be weake &amp; full of payne, both in their ioyntes, loynes, &amp; thighes, &amp; it bringeth many to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrangury, &amp; many to the gout. Of all tymes of the yere, it may ſafeſt be vſed in thy ſpringe, it is vtterly to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred in autumne, and in ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mar. Winter alſo by meanes of hys greate colde, is not very good: the beſt houre for it is as Galle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayeth whan the body is in a meane, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte full, and emptie, and exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nether in heat nether in colde, dryneſſe nor moyſture. Therefore who ſo euer wyll vſe it, let hym beware of cruditie, drunkennes, hungar, weryneſſe, vomittynge,
<pb facs="tcp:21869:66"/>
pourging of the belly, watchyng, and all other ſuch as healpeth to diſſolue the ſtrength of the body. After moderate eatyng is the beſt time of it, and before ſlepe, for that amendeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrength, and maketh that there foloweth no colde after it. For ſlepe immediatly folowing it, taketh away the werines of the muſcles and ſenewes, and calleth in the natural heat: which maketh the concoction perfit. Moreouer this time is beſt and apteſt, to the procreation of children for many cauſes: but eſpecially becauſe the woman whyles ſhe ſlepeth, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her huſbandes ſeed beſte. The .xvii. kynde of euacuation is perſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or euaporation, which is done ether by nature, or elles by medicine, which ſo finely ſubty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lith the humors, that they paſſe by

a man may be diſtempered in ſum part and yet be hole, and not ſicke: but whan the diſtemperature gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth ſo much, that it hurteth any action of the body, then it may be called a diſeaſe of the ſparmatike partes. Wherefore who ſo is of this ſort diſtempered, is ſicke: and he that is diſtempered and hath no action hurt, may not be called ſicke, but intemperat. For of them that be hole, yf ſum ſhoulde not be temperat and ſum intemperat, one of theſe .ii. muſte nedes be true, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all men alwayes to be ſicke, or elles all men to haue one diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emperature, which bothe be very falſe.

of the animall actions, be yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided in to .iii. for ether they be faultes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſences, as of hearing, ſeinge, taſtyng, ſmellyng, felynge, or els of mouinge, or finally of the principall actions, as of ymagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, thinkinge and remembring. Theſe be all the animall actions, of the which eche one may be hurt iii. manner of wayes: firſte if the action be vtterly extincte, as yf a man ſee nothyng at all: ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yf it be not vtterly aboliſhed, &amp; take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away but decayed ſumthing or not parfit, as whan a man ſeeth but euen ſcantly as they do, which the ignorant call ſand blynde. Thirdly wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is depraued, and wronge wraſted, as whan a man of force, ſeeth thinges which he did not beholde with hys common ſenſe, as they do which loke a gog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell:
<pb facs="tcp:21869:75"/>
And as it is euident, that all theſe fautes happen in the ſight, ſo they happen alſo in eche one of the other before named ſenſis.</p>
               <p>There be thus many as folowe naturall actions, appeticion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, digeſtion, pulſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, alteration, retention, expulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Of the which eche may erre .iii. manner of wayes, as is ſayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the actions animall: and the fautes or errors of the ſame, be accidentes folowyng diſeaſes. There be beſyde theſe .iiii. manner of accidentes, which be affections of oure bodies: as vnnaturall cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, ether in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole body, or elles in ſumpart of it: Fylthy ſauors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ether of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouthe, noſe, or eares and obſurde and vnnaturall ſapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, belonging to the taſte: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide theſe, hardnes, drines, &amp; rough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes

               <p>As for the vnnaturall inanitions, or detentions from whenſe ſo euer they cum, they be contayned vnder one of theſe .iii. differencis: For ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be vnnaturall i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hole ſubſtance, as that fluxe of bloude that is called commonly the emor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roydes: or elles they are in theyre qualitie, as ſumtyme it chaunſeth in wemens flowres: or finally in their quantitie, they be founde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, as the great abundance or lacke and ſcarſnes eyther of the vryne or ſweat.

Therfore firſt of all to the accomplyſſhynge, or

gettyng of this knowlege, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarye to expounde this worde <hi>Criſis,</hi> which the lattyns call <hi>iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium,</hi> &amp; in engliſh it may be called iugement: but at this preſent time it ſignifieth any ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mutation in euery diſeaſe whether it be longe or ſhort, and this ſudden mutation is parted in .iiii.

both vnparfit and euyll alſo. To y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowlege of this chaunge which is called <hi>criſis,</hi> the .iiii. times of the diſeaſe, that is to ſay, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, the encreaſynge, the heyght, and declination, muſt be obſerued, and marked of the Phiſition. The beginnyng is deuided in .3. the firſt inuaſion of the diſeaſe is the firſte beginnynge, &amp; is ſimple w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any bredth. The .ii. hath bredth, and continueth to the thirde day. The third is the tyme afterwarde, tyl y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> begynnyng of concoctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The time wherin the ſicknes groweth, is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the begynnyng of concoction, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the diſeaſe be at his ful ſtrength which before is called the heygth. The .iiii. tyme which is called the declination, begynneth after the heygth, and laſteth tyl the diſeaſe be ful paſt and ended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21869:79"/>Theſe be the vniuerſall tymes in diſſeaſes, beſydes whiche there is other called particular: as in ſuch feuers as kepe fittes, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the fitte, is the colde in the vtter partes: the growynge is whiles the body waxeth hote: and the ſtate, or hayght is, whan the heate is egally diſperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the body: the declination, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heat goeth away. Before I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare howe to knowe this ſudden mutation, which of the grekes is called <hi>Criſis,</hi> I thinke it expedient, and neceſſary to ſhewe in fewe wordes, the difference of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſignes &amp; tokens goinge before, which be of thre ſortes: of the firſt ſort, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſignes of cruditie, and concoction, as the excrementes of the bellye, the vryne, and ſpettel: by the ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of the nether belly it is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
<pb facs="tcp:21869:79"/>
how the ſtomacke altereth: the vryne ether declareth cruditie, or good concoction in the vaynes: the ſpettell ſhoweth ether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good, or euill conſtitution of the lunges, and inſtrumentes of breathing.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſignes what tyme of the diſeaſe ſo euer they happen, kepe alwayes theyre power firme and ſtable: For the ſignes of concocci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, alwayes declare health, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary ſignes, ether great paines longe ſicknes, deth, or finally the turnyng agayne of the euyll. Of the .ii. ſorte be the ſignes of life &amp; dethe: as quicke ſlepe, eaſy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge, goodnes of the pulſe, like in face to them that be hole, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume &amp; cumly liyng in bed, ſweat, and ſuch as to theſe be clene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Of the third ſort be the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge ſignes, of the which ſorte
<pb facs="tcp:21869:80"/>
there be .ii. kyndes: for ſum be as ſignes, and cauſes both together, as vomittynge, excrementes of the belly, the great quantitie of vryne, and ſweates, bledynge at the noſe, or the falling of humors out of one place in to another: and other be as ſignes alone, as watche, deade ſlepes, troubleſum dreames, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of breathynge, dimneſſe of ſight, dulneſſe of ſenſe, head, necke, and ſtomacke ache, ſinginge in the heade, involuntary teares, quiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neyther lippe, forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, face, eyes, &amp; noſe red, abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng of meat, vehement thurſte, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other ſuch lyke. All theſe, in that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they declare any ſudden mutation, be called iudgynge ſignes: and in that that they folow diſeaſes, they be called iudgynge accidentes.
<pb facs="tcp:21869:80"/>
Theſe haue not theyr power al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes firme, and certayne, as the ſignes of concoction, and cruditie haue, but they are to be liked if they happen after concoction, that is whyles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſickeneſſe is in the ſtate: and in the begynnyng, and before any concoctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they be not only not to be belyked, but to be fered, as deadly ſignes. Concernyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or propertie of ſignes, for this tyme, let this ſuffice: but as for ſuch ſignes, as declare ſudden mutation before called <hi>criſis,</hi> to be good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I entend yet (god willing) to ſpeake a lyttell more, whiche maye be knowen .iii. manner of wayes. Firſt yf before <hi>Criſis</hi> cum, there be concoction of the diſeaſe,
<pb facs="tcp:21869:81"/>
I meane of the vryne, the egeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſpettell: the which eche, ought to be conſidered in hys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place: For in the diſeaſes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breſt, &amp; lunges, the ſpettell ſhould be taken moſte heade of, and beſte marked, and yet the vryne ought not to be neglected, no nor the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementes of the belly nether, but in an ague, which is without any inflammation eyther of the lyuer raynes, bladder, or ſplene, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vrine muſt be regarded eſpecially: as yf the ſtomake, or mawe, be greued, the excrementes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> belly wolde be conſidered before the other. Yet the vryne, is not then to be abiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nether. Secundarily yf the cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge of it, be ſignified by any of the iudgynge dayes, it is to be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the Phiſition: the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the which dayes, I omyt,
<pb facs="tcp:21869:81"/>
becauſe I haue obſerued that ther is in them, more error then truthe, more ſuperſtition, then knowlege: and byſyde this, the ſcripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth vs Chriſten men, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue no dayes: yet yf any man be wylling to know them let him ſeke what Hyppocrates, &amp; Gallen hath written of them: &amp; then I doubte not (though he be dull wytted) but that he ſhall quicly know what is ment by them. Thirdly it is good, yf the meſure, and forme of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementes, be correſpondent, and aggreable to the diſeaſe: as yf in an hot burnynge feuer, the ſicke blede at the noſe: or after a feruent ſhakynge, ſweat much, and hot in all partes of hys bodye: or vomite muche chollar, or finally voyde much by ſyege, for ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feuer terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſhoulde ende: the quotidian not
<pb facs="tcp:21869:82"/>
only by much ſweatyng, but alſo by the avoydynge of flewme, both vpward, and dounward, in greate quantitie. The freneſie, is iudged by much hot ſweat, cummynge in euery parte of the body, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally yf the head ſweate feruently: yet ſumtyme it is iudged and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by bledynge at the noſe: howe be it in the lythargie, bledynge at the noſe is euyll.</p>
               <p>The pleureſie is betwixte theſe .ii. For bledyng at the noſe in it, is to be lyked better, then in the lithargy, &amp; worſe then in the phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. The inflammacions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuer and ſplene, be alwayes iudged by bledynge at the noſe: the liuer, if it blede on the right ſide, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſplene f the lift: beſide theſe, the age and complexion of the ſicke, and alſo hys forma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

the ſicke abydeth, with the tyme of the yere, and the preſent conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ayer, be to be conſidered of the Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiles he iudgeth <hi>criſis</hi> to be ether good or euil. For as the diſeaſe is cholerike, &amp; all theſe cholericke alſo, it is neceſſary that whan <hi>criſis</hi> happeneth, chollar ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully to be voyded: ſo if flewme redounde it is nedefull for flewme to be pourged: if diuers humors, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euacuation muſte be alſo of diuers humors. But whan the Phiſition ſhall know theſe thinges exactly, then of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende, he may eaſily know the reſt: for yf the ſicke, which alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die hath ſuffered <hi>criſis,</hi> be deliuered of his ague and other accidentes &amp; be better culloured, hauyng al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo better pulſes, and more ſtrength to riſe, without doubte the <hi>criſis</hi> was good.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:21869:83"/>The knowlege of the euyll <hi>Criſis,</hi> as ther is in it much coniecture, ſo ther is alſo in it much incertaynty: For as where nature is ſtrong, and ruleth eaſily the humors, ſhe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth orderly, and maketh an ende of her actions: ſo whan ſhe taketh a fall, her motions be both incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, and inordinate, and therfore hard to be knowen. wherfore ſuch a caſe requireth an artificer, and a well exerciſed Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the which may firſte declare whether there ſhall be any <hi>Criſis,</hi> at all or no: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>darily wether this day, or that: laſt of all whether it ſhall kyll the ſicke forthwith, or but only hurte hym.

of it: thirdly, by the manner, and faſhion of it: fortly by the mouyng of it.

Hitherto I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the ſubſtance of the vryne, wherfore now foloweth the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: of the which ther be .vi. diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencys in eſpeciall, which is white pale, tawny, yealow, red, &amp; blacke: For all the reſt be contayned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe. Vndar white is contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the cullar of criſtall, ſnowe, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:21869:86"/>
water, the which all ſignifie great cruditie. Not ſo whyte as theſe is milke, horne white, &amp; the hearres of a chammell: And as the vrynes of theſe cullars, differ from very white, ſo they declare better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction. After whyte they be next, that be ſum deale pale, the which becauſe they be a littell tincte, they ar not extreme crude. A pale cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is made, by the mixture of chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and water together, ſo that in the mixture there goeth but a litell chollar, to a great dele of water: of pale by meanes of concoction, ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time is made a light tawny which Actuarius, taketh to be the cullar of gilt. After a tawny followeth a light yelow, which is a cullar like the floures of cartamus, which is commonly called the gardyn ſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faron: after the which, commeth yealowe, whiche is the cullar of
<pb facs="tcp:21869:87"/>
ſaffaron: and a light red, whiche is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cullar of a certayne drug, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led bolum, is next: then red it ſelfe which is the cullar of a cherry: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe is a darke red, whiche is the cullar of a mulberry: and yet there is a darcker, which is made of whyte, and red, egally myxte together, and of the latyns it is called, <hi>Venetus</hi>: grene is the cullar of beetes, whiche the gardiners call the whyte beetes, or elles the cullar of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> precious Emmoroyde: Beſyde theſe, there is yet other cullars, as the cullar of oyle, the cullar of lead, and all cole blacke cullars, which is knowen almoſt of euery chylde. Yf I haue here in the diſcripſions of cullars, miſſe or wronge named any cullar, I praye the paynters, to accept my good wyll, and pardon my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancye:

The firſt is meate not wel altered, or diſgeſted, which is not apt to make bloude, wherfore it changeth the cullar of the vryne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame cullar that it ſelfe is of, which is wont to happen to them that is ſicke and diſeaſed, yea and ſumtyme to ſuch alſo as is hole: moreouer ſum medicine will alter the cullar of the vrine. The ſecond cauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> altering of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cullar in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water, is the drinke: for the vryne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly kepeth the cullar of thoſe thinges which is receyued in the
<pb facs="tcp:21869:88"/>
drinke. The .iii. cauſe is the colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation of ſuch thynges, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and melt in the body, as the fat, which whan it waſteth, for the moſt part cullereth vryne. Beſyde theſe there be other cauſes alſo whiche do the ſame, as exerciſe, hungar, ſlepe, watche, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a great many other ſuch like. which in the beholdynge of the vryne eche one by hym ſelfe ſhoulde be diligently conſidered of the Phiſition. Now I entende to declare what may be coniectured in the vrine of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, &amp; cullar. A thinne vrine, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth the lacke of natural heat, not without the obſtructions of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> liuer, raynes, &amp; ſplene, by meanes of cruditie: A thicke declareth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of matter, &amp; humors fillinge the belly, guttes, and the holowe partes of the liuer: which yf it be ſene in a feuer, thynne goinge
<pb facs="tcp:21869:88"/>
before, it ſignifieth the diſſoluing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feuer. But if after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the feuer is alredie cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vryne appere thick, nor in continuance of time waxeth no thinnar, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſignifieth plenty of humors. Concernyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cullars what white, pale, yelowe, &amp; read ſignifie, partly is alredy declared, &amp; more may be gathered, of theſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> folow. The darke red which is the cullar of the mulberry, ſhoweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the bloode burneth in the vaynes. The grene ſignifieth the worſte kind of chollar to be encreſed both in qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie, &amp; qualitie. That vryne which hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cullar of oyle, ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> colliquatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole body, or elles of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> raynes only. The blacke water ſumtyme declareth healthe as in the pourginge of mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>choly, but if grene went before, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is a very argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of death, &amp; it is more
<pb facs="tcp:21869:89"/>
to be feared in men then wemen. Now we be cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the quantitie which in them that be hole ſhould be ſo much as was dronken. The water excedeth in quantitie for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part, by meanes of theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes folowynge: firſt whan a man eateth and drinketh to much, the meat being to moyſt, or the drinke being watriſhe wine. The ſecond whan he hath taken medicynes, which prouoke vryne. The thirde whan the raynes is diſtempered with ouer much heat. The forth whan the belly is drier, then it ought to be naturally. The fyfte wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther procedeth no euacuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> belly nor other wayes, which Hyppocrates witneſſeth, ſayinge: Water much in quantity, made in the night, prophecieth of a ſmall ſiege: Litel water hapneth of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

cauſes: Firſt of littell drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge, drineſſe of meates, muche exerciſe, and other lyke vnto theſe, which be wont to dry the body. Secondarily, for meates &amp; medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyns whiche for their groſneſſe, make obſtruction in the liuer and ſplene, and other places. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the groſneſſe and clammy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of humors. Forthly for the plentifull pourgynge of the belly. Fyftly for the vehement heat, and drineſſe in a feuer. Sixtly, for the weakneſſe of the excretiue power, both in the raynes &amp; other partes ſeruynge to the avoydynge of the water, or vryne. The .iiii. thynge which in the vryne is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered be the contentes, ſo called (I thynke) becauſe they conſiſt in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye parte of the altitude of the body of the water.
