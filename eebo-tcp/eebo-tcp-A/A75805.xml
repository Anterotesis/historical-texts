         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I conſider how tenderly our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Chriſt recommends the precept
of mutuall love to all that profeſſe his
Name, making it the Character of
his followers, <hi>By this all men ſhall
know that you are my Diſciples, if you
love one another, Iohn</hi> 13. 35. And when I reflect
how highly the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exalts the ſame
commandment, abridging into this one precious ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
the whole duty of a Chriſtian, <hi>All the Law
is fulfilled in one word, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as
thy ſelf, Gal.</hi> 5. I cannot ſufficiently wonder, to ſee
moſt Chriſtians in this preſent age with fire and
ſword perſecute each other, only upon the account
of Religion: how are we degenerated from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Believers, who would rather have given their
own lives, to perſwade their Enemies to piety, than
ſought to take away the lives of their Brethren, to
force them to Hypocriſie?</p>
            <p>Yet hath it pleaſed the Lord Chriſt in our dayes,
<hi>upon whom the ends of the World are come,</hi> to infuſe
the like tenderneſſe into the breaſts of many conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
and godly-minded people of this Nation,
who ſeeing the deformity and unreaſonableneſſe of

of the earth, that an impartiall freedom
and abſolute incoercency in matters of Religion may
be firmly and irrevocably eſtabliſhed for all that
profeſſe the Goſpell of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For encouragement of which holy deſigne, woven
out of the bowels of mercy, and for determent of
thoſe tempeſtuous ſpirits, that with thunder and
lightning ſtrive to ſtorm mens conſciences, I have
endeavoured in this ſhort Diſcourſe to demonſtrate,
That Conſcience-perſecution amongſt Chriſtians
is clearly repugnant to the <hi>Light of Nature</hi>
the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and the <hi>Evidence of our own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>

               <p>1 SInce we have ſo happily ſhaken off that intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Yoak of Popiſh infallibility (<hi>which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we nor our Fathers were able to bear</hi>) it is
become to us not only tyrannicall, but abſurd, to
compell others to a way, that our ſelves confeſſe
may poſſibly be erronious; we ſee one Parliament
repeals thoſe Articles of faith which a former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted;
that form of worſhip which the Laws of the
laſt age introduced, is now generally exploded,
nay, the very laſt reformation ſetled with ſo ſolemn
a Covenant, and carryed on with ſo furious a zeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is already by better lights diſcovered to be meerly
humane, and therefore deſervedly laid aſide: The
late Synods Confeſſion of faith (hatched by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years ſitting) is now learnedly examined
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152182:3"/>
and indeed for a great part ſolidly confuted, by Mr.
<hi>W. Parker,</hi> and other learned perſons, in print; how
prepoſterous is it then to conſtrain a ſoul, not only
to forſake his conſcience, which may be truth, but
drive him contrary to his own heart, to a way that
may be errour.</p>
               <p>2 Since the Word of God is the ſole rule of Faith,
and no humane authority ſo highly impowred, as to
bind up our aſſents to whatſoever interpretation it
ſhall pleaſe propoſe; it clearly follows, that as all
the children of God have equall intereſt in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
of their Father, ſo no one amongſt them
has any right to impoſe a force upon the judgment
of his brother: One holds Baptiſm of children to
be neceſſary, another eſteems it unlawfull, a third
denies both theſe Opinions, admitting well that it
may, but not that it muſt be done: they confer Texts,
look into Original Tongues, pray inceſſantly to
God, and profeſſe ſolemnly the ſincerity of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions;
yet after all their diligences and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſtedfaſtly remain in their former perſwaſions;
Truly for my part, he that ſhould adviſe perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in ſuch a caſe (unleſſe his fire brought light too
with it, to demonſtrate the truth) would ſcarce ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
my ſuſpition, that his coales were fetcht from
the infernall pit.</p>
               <p>3 If we reflect upon the difficulties that incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
us in the way to truth, for <hi>ſtrait is the gate, and
narrow is the path,</hi> and withall conſider the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of our ſight, for <hi>here we ſee but in part, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
but in part,</hi> there will appear more reaſon
to endeavour the mutuall aſſiſtance and ſupport,
than malicious ruine and deſtruction one of another.
However, ſince all have neither equall depth of
naturall judgment, nor the ſame meaſure of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
illumination, <hi>but the Spirit bloweth how and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152182:4"/>
where it pleaſeth;</hi> we ought not to attempt ſo high a
preſumption, as to deſpiſe or perſecute our brother
for his innocent and blameleſſe miſtakes, leſt we be
found to fight againſt God, who is the free diſpoſer
of his gifts; we know <hi>the way of man is not in himſelf,
Ier.</hi> 10. 23. but his <hi>ſteps are ruled by the Lord, Pro.</hi> 20.
24. and therefore certainly, did we bear a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to God, we would be content to wait his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
who has engaged himſelf by his Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi>
3. 15. <hi>If any man be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall in
time reveal even this unto him;</hi> let us therefore enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſuch an one, who proceeds in the ſimplicity of
his heart, with <hi>Milk,</hi> till he grow ſtronger to digeſt
<hi>ſtrong meat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 All compulſion upon the Conſcience returns us
flatly to our old ſlavery under the <hi>Prelats,</hi> nay more,
to the implicite faith of the <hi>Papists,</hi> with this only
difference, that we are worſe than either, becauſe
our conſciences accuſe us of doing that which we
condemn in others; for whatſoever I am conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to ſwear or profeſſe more than I am convinced
of, proceeds from as great a tyranny as the High-Commiſſion,
and is as blind an aſſent, as can be
matched in the groſeſt Popery, and dare we <hi>think
that doing the ſame thing we judge in others, we ſhall
eſcape the judgment of God?</hi> Rom. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>5 Force is puniſhment, and conſequently not
juſt, unleſſe the offence be voluntary: but he that
believes according to the evidence of his own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
is neceſſitated to that belief, and to compell
him againſt it, were to drive him to renounce the
eſſentiall part of man, his reaſon. Why ſhould we
be commanded <hi>to try the ſpirits, 1. Iohn 4. 1. to prove
all things,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 21. If there be not a faculty in
the Soul to judge for her ſelf? why we are enjoyned
to <hi>hold faſt that which we find to be beſt,</hi> if after our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152182:4"/>
moſt ſerious and deliberate election we ſhall be
whipt out of our Conſcience by penalties? To what
purpoſe do we preach poor ſouls into juſt ſo much
liberty of Scripture, as may beget their torture,
and not permit them to reſt where they find ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
either prohibit to ſearch at all, or leave us
ſenſible of ſome benefit by teaching: To believe what
appears untrue, ſeems to me impoſſible; to profeſſe
what we believe untrue, I am ſure is damnable.</p>
               <p>6. As it is certain, whoſoever ſwerves from the
dictate of his Conſcience commits a grievous ſin,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. So without queſtion they that endeavour
by force or artifice to draw any man to profeſſe or
act contrary to what his foul believes, are as deeply
guilty of the ſame crime. <hi>When you wound the weak
conſciences of your brethren, you ſin againſt Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor.

Impriſonments, Forfeitures, &amp;c. both drive others,

deſperately do they attempt to extinguiſh the light

ſouls to ſhine and guide them, but in black ones to

with the advice of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 14. 13. Let us

And again 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. He denies that even
the Apoſtles themſelves have any ſoveraignty over
the Conſcience, but only Commiſſions to aſſiſt the

Dominion over your faith, but are helpers of

which Chriſt gave to his Apoſtles, <hi>Goe and teach,</hi> not
compell; <hi>and if any one receive you not, ſhake off the duſt
of your feet,</hi> not trample upon them, as duſt under
feet. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 14. Conſtaut to which Doctrine of
Meekneſſe, our Saviour thus inſtructs his Diſciples,
Mat. 23. 9. <hi>Be not called Rabbi</hi> (that is, Maſters in
ſpiritual matters) <hi>for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt,
and all you are brethren.</hi> To this belongs the patient
forbearing the <hi>tares,</hi> and letting them grow together
with the <hi>wheat</hi> till the time of harveſt, as alſo that
admirable preſident of mildneſſe towards the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi>
who refuſed to receive even Chriſt himſelf,
whereupon the Diſciples <hi>Iames</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
command fire from heaven to conſume them,
as in the days of <hi>Elias,</hi> but our merciful Lord rebuked
their zeal with this ſweet &amp; tender reply, <hi>You know
not what manner of ſpirit you are of, the Son of man is not
come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them,</hi> Luk. 9. 54.
which one example abundantly ſatisfies al objections
drawn from the practice of <hi>Elias, Iehu,</hi> the ſons of
<hi>Levi, &amp;c.</hi> in the Old Teſtament, for as they had
an expreſſe command from God to warrant their
Zeal, we have an expreſſe warrant from Chriſt to
command us meckneſſe. If any one ſhall ſhuffle in
a ſuſpition, that this moderate temper was meant on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the times of perſecution, when the Chriſtians
had no temporall Power; let him firſt confeſſe that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152182:6"/>
thoſe were the beſt and pureſt times, and then ſhew
a Warrant dormant under our Saviours hand (that
is in his Goſpel) to Commiſſionate his Diſciples as
ſoon as they ſhould get the ſword into their hands,
to cut the throats of all diſobeyers, and I ſubmit;
but if they can cite no ſuch authority, let them free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

an unwarrantable tyranny over the juſt privileges

eloquence, and by the admirable ſucceſſe of his
mildnes, condemn all thoſe politique Religions, that
confeſſe their own crazines, by uſing cruelty to ſupport
them: whereas to reduce the diſobedient only with the
ſpirit of gentleneſs and admonition, or at moſt deſertion,
argues indeed a Divinity in the Author, and a Purity in
the Ordinance: and here we may fitly apply the words
of our Lord, John 14. <hi>If it had been otherwiſe, I would
have told you:</hi> If the way of planting my Faith had been
by impoſing penalties on the hearers, and not rather by
expoſing the Preachers thereof to dangers, I would have
told you: If the meanes of preſerving Religion had been
by watering it with the bloud of refuſers to embrace it,
rather than of thoſe that ſought to propagate it, I would
have told you either by my example (all the world being
in the power of my Deity) or by my doctrine, all juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
proceedings concerning the government of my
Flock, being derived from the warrant of my Word.
Thus we ſee our gracious Law-maker, faithfull and
couſtant in his own Principles, <hi>The Son of man came
not to deſtroy mens lives but to ſave them.</hi> Thus we ſee
our own duty to <hi>learn of him, for he is meek and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of heart; let us not therefore judge one another any
more, but uſe our judgement rather in this, that no man

in caſes of this quality is in it ſelf ſufficiently certain;
however, 'tis the onely means God hath allowed
our nature to guide her reſolutions in the judging
of others.</p>
               <p>The ſignes then of tender Conſciences are theſe: If
they lead regular, vertuous, and peacable lives; If
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152182:9"/>
their Opinions be not juſtly accuſable of ſelf-intereſt or
licentiouſneſſe, but rather require of them a prudent and
religious ſeverity againſt the inclinations of corrupted
nature; If their judgements be ſteddy, not fann'd to
a new ſenſe with every breath of wind; If they continue in
the ſame perſwaſions at their death, which is no time
for diſſembling, at leaſt we ought to judge ſo; If they
not only die in their Faith, but for it not only give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
good part of their eſtates charitably, but ſuffer all
to be taken away patiently, and all this for Chriſts ſake,
or (to ſpeak more cloſely) for that which they believe to
be his will and commandment no higher teſtimony of a
true and real ſincerity can poſſibly be given, or eaſily
imagined; and whoſoever doubts after ſuch evidence,
(chiefly if many concur in the ſame way) deſerves to
be condemned, as the moſt paſſionate, malicious and
uncharitable perſon in the world; for though one man
may value his fancy above his life or eſtate, yet it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

they be diſcreet and rational in other negotiations) ſhould
agree to undo themſelves for a meer conceit, did not

               <p>By theſe rules we may eaſily conclude the admiſſion of
thoſe pious and religious perſons, who were impriſoned
and perſecuted by the late Prelates, into the number
of tender Conſciences; as alſo thoſe precious ſervants
of the Lord, who by a voluntary baniſhment left their

               <p>Whilſt I was finiſhing theſe lines aworthy friend of mine

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152182:10"/>
unbaiſed-minds perfectly ſatiſfactory, yet they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable
to a ſort of people in this Nation, whoſe being
diſcountenanced, is thought ſo profitable to the State, and
ſo pleaſing to a certain froward part of the Miniſtery, that
he feared my Reaſons might encounter ſome oppoſition,
unleſſe they met with very ingenuous and diſ-intereſſed
Readers; plainly telling me, that the meaſures I had cut
out for tender Conſciences, would fit the <hi>Papists</hi> as well
as if they had been made for them: For who live more
peaceably with their neighbors, (ſays he) who deal more
juſtly with all men than they? who are more conſtant in
their Religion, and more ſcrupulous in the obſervances
of their Law, than they? who ſuffer for their Faith, more
than they; nay, at this time, who beſides them? They
ſubmit their underſtandings to the definitions of their
Church, and their wills to the obedience of its Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
in Faſting, Confeſſion, and many other burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom
duties, all which are very diſagreeable to the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
of fleſh and blood, as containing the real practice
of the higheſt ſelf-denial that can be imagined: And for
the ſerious hour of death, I muſt confeſſe, I have known
many of us turn Papiſts upon our death-bed, but never
in all my life ſo much as once the contrary; and to ſpeak
ingenuouſly, I have often obſerved, that they who go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
us to them, ſeem (which you make the only judge)
more ſpiritual, retired, and devout than before they
left us; whereas of the Papiſts that become Proteſtants,
(beſides the worldly deſignes they may eaſily be thought
to have) moſt commonly they grow more licentious,
both in faith and manners, eſpecially the Prieſts, who
ſeldom or never are converted, if once paſt the age of
marrying.</p>
               <p>I, who had alwaies believed the puniſhments laid
upon them, were reducible to civill crimes, though
defended by them as points of Religion, reſolved
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152182:10"/>
to follow thoſe ſo certain and evident Principles,
which I had already framed (for diſcerning of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
conſciences) whitherſoever they ſhould lead
me; and therefore deſired my friend to bring me to
the knowledge of ſome moderate and diſcreet Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,
that I might examine their Tenents, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their eaſie excluſion from the privileges of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Conſciences: this my friend immediately did,
recommending one to me, a morally honeſt and
underſtanding man, though (ſayes he) a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
in his Religion, and a great deal for it; After
we had met, and agreed to diſcourſe with all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the <hi>Recuſant</hi> began with a ſhort ſtory of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſufferings of <hi>Papiſts;</hi> Whereof (he ſaid) <hi>Some
are ſequeſtred for Delinquency, and thoſe of all Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi>
(caeteris paribus) <hi>the moſt ſeverely, though of
all the moſt excuſable, beccauſe wholly depending upon
the pleaſure of the late King, and infinitely obliged to
his Royall Lenity; noting it as an unanſwerable argument
of their fidelity and gratitude toward ſuch as deal with
them in mercy, as alſo that their declining to receive
the Oathes of</hi> Supremacy <hi>and</hi> Allegiance, <hi>for which
they have heretofore been ſo violently perſecuted, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not from any averſion to civill obedience, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there were mingled in thoſe Oathes certain expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of a pure ſpirituall nature, repugnant to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
and altogether unneceſſary to the common ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others are equally puniſhed, that is, their whole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
ſequeſtred, allowing only a fifth part for their
wives and children, though in true reaſon they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
juſtifiable, having never been in any Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but found only in ſome Gariſons of the King, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were driven for refuge, being put out of the
protection of the Parliament by publique Proclamation,
their houſes every where rifled, their goods plundered,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152182:11"/>
and lives endangered by the Souldiers, whoſe condition
ſeems clearly to be within the equity of that Article of the
Armys Propoſalls, <hi>Aug. 1647. That the Kings meniall
ſervants, who never took up Arms, but only attended
on his Perſon, according to their Offices, be freed
from Compoſition;</hi> much more thoſe who had both the
civill reaſon of duty, and the unanſwerable argument of
neceſſity, to plead for their diſcharge: And (which is
yet more hard) ſome Recuſants of this Claſſe, who never
bare Arms, but were only found in Garriſons, for their
own perſonall ſecurity, as aforeſaid, are now ranked
among the higheſt Delinquents, and their Eſtates to
be ſold, ſuch are Sir <hi>Henry Beddingfield,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Gefford,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As for the ſingle Recuſants, two thirds of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
are ſeazed upon, only for the Cauſe of Religion,
under which notion are included all ſuch as were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
convict of not reſorting to <hi>Common-Prayers,</hi> or
do now refuſe the Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> a new Oath made
by the two Houſes, when the former kind of ſervice was
aboliſht, wherein the practice is ſtrangely ſevere, for
upon bare information, the eſtate of the ſuſpected is
ſecured, that is his rents, &amp;c. ſuſpended, before
any tryall, or legal proof, even in theſe times of peace,
and being once thus half condemned, he has no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
to help himſelf, but by forſwearing his religion,
and ſo by an Oath a thouſand times harſher than that <hi>Ex
Officio,</hi> they draw out of his own mouth his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>When the Sequeſtrators have thus ſeized into their hand
two thirds of the moſt innocent Recuſants lands and
goods, then come the Excizemen, Tax-gatherers, and
other Collectors, and pinch away no ſmall part of the
poor third penny that was left them; ſo that after th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to maintain them and their Children, being perſons for
the moſt part of good quality, and civill education: and
as for Prieſts, it is made as great a crime to have taken
<hi>Orders</hi> after the rites of their Church, as to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the moſt hainous treaſon that can be imagined, and
they are far more cruelly puniſhed than thoſe that murder
their own Parents.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe extreme and fatall penalties that ly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Recuſants meerly for their conſcience, there are
many other afflictions whereof few take notice, which
though of leſſer weight, yet being added to the former,
quite ſink them down to the bottome of ſorrow and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity;
as their continnall fear of having their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
broke open and ſcarcht by <hi>Purſuivants,</hi> who enter at
what houres they pleaſe, and do there what they liſt,
taking away not only all the Inſtruments of their Religion,
but oftentimes, Money, Plate, Watches, and other
ſuch popiſh Idols, eſpecially iſ they be found in the ſame
room with any Pictures, and ſo infected with a relative
ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>Another of their afflictions is, that they, I mean theſe
ſingle Recuſants, have no power to ſell or mortgage the
leaſt part of their Eſtates, either to pay their juſt debts,
or defray their neceſſary expences, whereby they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
of all commerce, and their credit being utterly
loſt, (upon which many of them now provide even their
dayly bread) they muſt needs in a ſhort time be brought
to a deſperate neceſſity, if not abſolute ruine; and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the moſt quiet and moderate amongſt them, ſhould
to deſire to tranſplant himſelf in a milder Climate, and
endeavour to avoid the offence that is taken againſt him
in his own Country, he cannot ſo diſpoſe of his eſtate here,
as by Bill of exchange, or any other way, to provide
the least ſubſiſtence for himſelf and his Family: A ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
far beyond the moſt rigid practice of the Scotch Kirk;
for there (as I am informed) the perſons of Recuſants
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152182:12"/>
are only baniſhed out of the Kingdom, and prohibited to
reſide at their own homes above forty dayes in a year,
which time is allowed them for the managing of their
eſtates, and their eſtates allowed them for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
abroad: A proceeding which their Principles would
clearly juſtifie, if they could juſtifie their Principles.
But in <hi>England,</hi> where compulſion upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is decryed as the worſt of ſlaveries; to puniſh men ſo
ſharply for matters of Religion, contrary to the principles
publickly received, is a courſe that muſt needs beget over
all the world a ſtrong ſuſpition and prejudice againſt the
honour and reputation of that State, which at the ſame
time can practiſe ſuch manifeſt contrad<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To this deplorable condition (<hi>ſaid he almoſt weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>)
are the Engliſh Catholiques now reduced, yet they
hear all, not only with patience, but even ſilence; for
amongſt the printed complaints ſo frequent in theſe times,
never any thing hath been ſeen to proceed from them,
though alwayes the chief, and now the ſole ſufferers for
their Conſciences, except (not to be altogether wanting
to themſelves) ſome modeſt Petitions humbly addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the Parliament, though ſuch hath been their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe,
that more weighty affairs have ſtill diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
their being taken into conſideration; elſe were
they admitted to clear themſelves of the miſtakes and
ſcandals unjuſtly imputed to them, they would not doubt
fully to ſatisfie all ingenuous, and unpaſſionate men, nay
even whomſoever, that were but moderatly prejudiced
againſt them.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwered, that as every one ſees the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of the Penalties which Papiſts ſuffer, ſo for
my ſelf, I believe the tenderneſſe of their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
becauſe they ſuffer: and upon this ground we

where they find clear proof of a valuable conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>THe Papiſt here firſt took for granted, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I could not deny, that if any Opinion
be probably true, perſecution in that caſe is
certainly unlawfull; becauſe otherwiſe both ſides,
for both are probable, if one be, might juſtifiably
perſecute one another, to the utter deſtruction of all
Society: and after returned this anſwer to my firſt
objection.</p>
               <p>We reverence indeed (<hi>ſaies he</hi>) the Angels and bleſſed
Saints, with a reſpect far more than we uſe to men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
far above their Dignity, but infinitely below the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration
we give to GOD, becauſe infinitely below his
excellency. All the miſtakes in this controverſie ariſing
from hence, that the language of men hath more distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveneſſe
and variety than the geſtures of their bodies,
and yet is far leſſe copious than the thoughts of their
minds; whence it is they ſo frequently apply to moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
conceptions the ſelf-ſame words and poſtures of
body, as the titles of <hi>ſacred Majeſty, moſt High, moſt
Mighty,</hi> given to Kings and States, the ſtile of <hi>Grace</hi>
to Dukes and Archbiſhops, of <hi>Lord</hi> to Noblemen, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
Ambaſſadors, &amp;c. of <hi>Worſhip</hi> to Gentlemen of
quality, and ſuch as bear any conſiderable Office in the
Commonwealth; ſo kneeliug to Parents, ſtanding bare to
the Parliament and other Courts, bowing to one another,
&amp;c. All theſe very expreſſions are the ſame we uſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God himſelf, and paſſe innocently, when rightly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152182:13"/>
underſtood; but to a ſcrupulous and wilfull ſpirit, how
offenſive would this one word <hi>Worſhipfull</hi> be, if it be
reflected with a little rigor and frowardneſſe upon it?
Now as every old woman has capacity enough to make a
different apprehenſion betwixt going to ſpeak with one at
the <hi>Lion</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> and going to ſee the <hi>Lion</hi> in
the <hi>Tower;</hi> ſo may any the moſt ſimple Catholique in
the world, by a very little teaching, learn to diſtinguiſh
the <hi>Crucifix</hi> which he ſees in the Church, from <hi>Chriſt</hi>
whom he believes to be in Heaven, and conſequently in
no more danger of committing Idolatry to that Picture,
than the other of fearing to be torn in peeces by the Sign.</p>
               <p>Upon this Argument of the Papiſt, I call'd to
mind what I had read my ſelf in Scripture, how the
Prophet <hi>Balaam</hi> fell flat upon the ground, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
an Angel, <hi>Num.</hi> 22. 31. and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> gave the
ſame honour to another, that ſtiled himſelf <hi>Captain
of the Lords Hoſt,</hi> and therefore could not be the
Lord, <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 5. 13. nay, he was commanded yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to <hi>put off his ſhooes, becauſe the ground was holy,</hi>
by the preſence of an Angel; theſe examples, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
being related in the Bible, without the leaſt
note of reproof, enforce us to admit ſeverall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of worſhip, infinitely differing in the intention
of the mind, though very little in outward expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
now by whatſoever names we <hi>Protestants</hi> ſhall
agree to call this behavior of <hi>Balaam, Ioſhua,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
all the Jews before the Ark and Cherubins,
I ſee plainly will fully expreſſe, and ſhrewdly juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
(at leaſt from Idolatry) all the approved pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of the Papiſts, which truly caſt up, as far as I
can diſcern, amouut to no more than a reverence
towards Saints and Angels, ſuitable to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of their State; and for Churches, Altars,
Pictures, &amp;c. only to an Eccleſiaſticall kind of good
manners. And by the Light of Nature thus for ſeems
to me evident, that all honor or diſhonor done to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152182:13"/>
the Image reflects upon the Principall, ſince not
one amongſt us but would condemn him for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant,
that ſhould ſhoot at my <hi>Lord Generals Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
without <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> and if any ſhould reprove
him for his temerity, we would preſently conclude
ſuch perſon wel-affected to the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not at all ſequeſtrable for <hi>Idolatry,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
we could prove that the abuſed and doting
people ſuperſtitiouſly adored the painted cloth,
which kind of worſhip, I am ſatisfied, no Recuſant
gives even to the Picture of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I think it probable, not certain, as the
Papiſts do, that the ſecond <hi>Commandement</hi> intends
not to forbid any ſuch inferiour ſpirituall civilities,
becauſe wiſe Governors contrive their Laws againſt
thoſe vices, to which they ſee their Subjects parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
inclined; and therefore down-right <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
by offering Sacrifice to Gods made with hands, and
repoſing confidence in their aſſiſtance, being the
common ſins of thoſe times, 'tis probable we
ought to interpret this <hi>Precept,</hi> as a proviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Heatheniſh Idolatry, not againſt ſuch kind
of reverences as the Jewes by Gods own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
uſed before the Ark and Cheruoins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agreeable to this, is the Opinion of the learned
Maſter</hi> Hobs <hi>in his</hi> Leviathan, <hi>where</hi> fol. 360. <hi>he
affirms, that</hi> to worſhip God in ſome peculiar place, or
turning a mans face towards an Image, is not to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the place or Image, but to acknowledge them holy,
that is to ſay, ſet apart from common uſe; for that is the
meaning of the word <hi>holy,</hi> which implies no new qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the place or Image, but only a new relation by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation
to God, and therefore is not Idolatry. But
to worſhip God, as inanimating or inhabiting ſuch place
or Image, is Idolatry; as alſo to worſhip God, not as
in animating or preſent in the place or Image but to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152182:14"/>
the end to be put in mind of him or ſome of
his works, in caſe the place or Image be dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or ſet up by private authority, and not by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of them that are our Soveraign Paſtors, is Idolatry:
For the Commandement is, THOV SHALT
NOT MAKE TO THY SELF ANY
GRAVEN IMAGE.</p>
               <p>Thus in my judgement doth that learned <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
abſolutely clear the Papiſts of Idolatry,
though perhaps he had more preciſely expreſt this
laſt way of tranſgreſſing the ſecond Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if he had call'd it <hi>will-worſhip</hi> rather than
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> becauſe there is onely a want of Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no exceſs in the degree of reverence: And
though afterwards he condemn praying to Saints
departed, as Idolatry, yet it is only upon a
particular ſuppoſition of his own, that there is yet
no ſuch thing as Saints in Heaven.</p>
               <p>When I had read this paſſage of ſo famous an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
to the Recuſant, he to requite my civility, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſhewed me the words of the <hi>Council of
Trent,</hi> which he ſaid differed nothing at all from Mr.
<hi>Hobs,</hi> and very little from me: For as I thought,
that the exhibition of ſome inferior kind of reverence
towards Churches, and other Inſtruments of piety,
was probably unforbidden; ſo that Council decrees
the abſolute lawfulneſſe thereof, in the 25. <hi>Seſſion,</hi>
where to the Canon concerning Images, are added
theſe words of explanation: <hi>Not that there is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
any divinity or vertue in them, for which they ought
to be worſhipped, or that they are to be petitioned for any
thing, or any confidence ought to be repoſed in Images,
as of old was done by the Gentiles, who placed their hope
in Idols, but becauſe the honour exhibited to them is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the Prototypes they repreſent, that ſo through
the Images, which we kiſſe, and before which we bare
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152182:14"/>
our heads and kneel down, we may adore Chriſt and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
his Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon occaſion of which words, the Papiſt aſſured
me, that in no Council is uſed the phraſe of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
worſhip,</hi> when they treat of theſe queſtions, nor
any thing concerning them commanded as neceſſary,
but only their lawfulneſſe declared, that ſuch as find
benefit by their aſſiſting the memory, or exciting the
affections, may ſafely uſe them, the reſt may let them
alone, provided they cenſure not the practice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
over whom they have no juriſdiction, nor
condemn the judgement of the Church, who has ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
over them.</p>
               <p>And hereupon we both agreed in this collaterall
obſervation, That if all modern Controvertiſts
would reſtrain their diſputes to poſitions generally
received as of Faith in the Church, of which they are
members, attending only to her expreſſions, and not
to the terms of particular Writers, the differences
amongſt Chriſtians, ſo fatal to the peace of <hi>Europe,</hi>
would be both leſſe numerous, and far more recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable.</p>

as firſt the promiſe of our SAVIOVR, <hi>Joh. 6. 5. The
bread that I will give is my Fleſh, which I will give
for the life of the world;</hi> and <hi>ver. 55. My Fleſh is
meat indeed, and my Bloud is drink indeed.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
The performance of that promiſe, in the words of
Inſtitution, <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body;</hi> punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
repeated by the other three Evangeliſts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26.
<hi>Mar. 14. 22. Luk.</hi> 22. 19. And thirdly, the places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the uſe of this Sacrament in the Apoſtles time,
1 <hi>Cor. 10. 16. The Cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe,
is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt? and
the bread which we break, is it not the participation
of the Body of the Lord?</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 29. <hi>He that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
Thus the great Apoſtle <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and all the four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts
unanimouſly teach the Doctrine of the Real
Preſence, &amp; not one ſingle place produceable that in direct
terms calls the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> a ſigne or figure of Chriſts Body,
notwithſtanding maintainers thereof, admit no proof as
authentical but the preciſe text of Scripture, yet in this ſo
important controverſie they flie to Logical inferences, and
Philoſophical diſcourſes, &amp; ſo make their own reaſon the
Iudge, and not the Word of God, rendring by their new
and private iuterpretations this great Sacrament inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in dignity, not only to the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> a type
of Chriſt, but even to <hi>Manna,</hi> which was but a figure
of this very myſtery.</p>
               <p>Surely, if we ſhall add to ſo many and evident texts
of Scripture, the conſtant judgment of the Fathers,
and the univerſal practice of the whole Christian world
for above a thouſand years (ſince ſo long is acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the abſolute Reign of our Religion) we may ſafely
conclude the Doctrine of our Saviours preſence in the
<hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be at leaſt probable, and conſequently Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
in no wiſe accuſable of raſhneſſe or obſtinacy,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152182:15"/>
in believing a Poſition ſo efficaciouſly recommended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them.</p>
               <p>But admitting the Doctrine of non-reality to be true,
(<hi>ſaid the Letter of the Recuſant</hi>) yet ought not Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
to be judged guilty of the ſinne of Idolatry, becauſe
their adoration is not intentionally directed to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but to the Perſon of Chriſt our Lord: and if He
be not there, their worſhip is miſtaken in the place, not
in the object, and therefore a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and no formal Idolatry which no temperate Judge will
impute unto ſin, much leſſe our mercifull Redeemer,

good meaning of his ſervants though mingled with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

her in the habit of a Gardener, <hi>John</hi> 20. 15. was never
accuſed as a defect of devotion; wherefore ſince the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
all profeſſe not to terminate their adoration in the

erroneous in their Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Nor can I ſatisfie my conſcience, ſince to this
point the Opinion of the <hi>Papists</hi> is no more oppoſite to
us, than that of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> why we ſhould freely
allow communion to <hi>theſe</hi> even of ſpirituall things, and
in the mean while not afford <hi>them</hi> ſo much as the liberty
to poſſeſſe their own temporall goods. The <hi>Lutherans</hi>
believe our SAVIOUR to be as really in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi>
as he was upon the Croſſe, but doe not adore him; the
Papiſts both believe and adore; for my part, I ſhould
clearly, either doe both, or neither, at leaſt I ſhall
never be brought to this partiality, to cheriſh the one as
brethren, and perſecure the other as enemies, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

               <p>BY the next Poſt I received from the ſame hand an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

               <p>We will divide (<hi>ſayes he</hi>) the main Queſtion into two
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:152182:16"/>
points, as it relates either to our equals, or Superiours:
for the firſt touching Commerce and Converſation, we
abſolutely diſclaim that ſcandalous opinion, <hi>That no
Faith is to be kept with Heretikes;</hi> and flatly deny,
that our engagement, promiſe, or contract, may
lawfully be broken by our ſelves, or diſpenſed with by
any Power on earth, to the prejudice of a third perſon,
of what Religion ſoever; and for <hi>equivocation, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
reſervation,</hi> &amp;c. I am confident, though I have
not here any opportunity to look into Books, that no Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Council mentions either any ſuch word, or any
ſuch thing; Schoolmen indeed diſpute frequently ſuch
ſubtilties, which by men of different principles and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in Religion are eaſily miſ-underſtood, and often
perverted, but amongſt <hi>Catholiques</hi> every one has li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to deny them as he pleaſes, without any prejudice
to Faith; and though thoſe speculations generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
encouragement, yet when they arrive at a certain
degree of niceneſse, they rather become an innocent curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity,
than profitable employment; and in ſuch an infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

it is impoſſible, but that through paſſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warineſſe,

and captious Readers applying their Whole ſtudy to find
faults, forget the good and wholſome notions they meet,
and remember nothing but the errours.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond branch concerning our duty to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
we deny, <hi>ſayes the letter,</hi> any earthly power
can diſpence with our civill obedience, and acknowledge
our ſelves bound, not only to the Law of Nature, but
by the expreſſe word of God, to <hi>render unto Caeſar the
things that are Caeſars, to be ſubject not only for
fear, but conſcience ſake;</hi> What Chriſtian Prince or
State is there in the world, whom the ſubjects ſerve

with more fidelity than the <hi>Spaniard, French,</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian,</hi>
all Catholick Dominions? and particularly in
<hi>England,</hi> where we are ſome of <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome of
<hi>Apollo,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Cephas,</hi> what compariſon is
there betwixt the behaviour of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> towards
<hi>H. 8. Edw.</hi> 6. and <hi>Eliz.</hi> and the fury of <hi>Lutherans</hi>
and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and indeed whereſoever
they are diſcontented, yet there is a vaſt difference, as
to Government, between theſe two caſes, to oppoſe by
force the introducement of innovations, by which the
peace muſt needs be endangered, and to attempt by force
the extinguiſhment of an ancient Religion, whereof the
people are univerſally in quiet, and immemoriall poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
the one drives others out of poſſeſſion, the other
maintains himſelf in, the one invades his neighbours
rights, the other defends his own.</p>
               <p>How many modern experiences (the eaſieſt argument
to be underſtood, and ſureſt to be relyed on) clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
this queſtion; if we but conſider the union of hearts,
and common intereſts of State, between the Proteſtant
and Catholick <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> where very
many Churches ſerve by turns upon the ſame day, for
the exerciſe of both Religions, dividing every Sundny
morning into 2 parts, and aſſigning to each about 3 hours
for their devotions; wherein they are ſo punctual to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
equality, that if the Proteſtants have the firſt three
hours one morning, next week they are to have the laſt;
and this they continually practice, without enterfering or
offending one another.</p>
               <p>To this ſo pregnant example (ſufficient of it ſelf to
clear the conſiſtency of theſe two Religions) I ſhall further
add their fair comportment, one towards another, in many
Provinces and Free-Towns in <hi>Germany;</hi> but moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable
is their friendly and peaceable living together
in <hi>Holland,</hi> even during ſo long and dangerous wars
with <hi>Spain; Spain</hi> the chief protector of the Catholick
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152182:17"/>
faith; <hi>Spain</hi> the moſt zealous propagator of the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
authority; to whoſe dominion if the Vnited-Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſhould again return, certainly the Catholicks there
might prudently promiſe to themſelves all poſſible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages;
yet notwithſtanding ſo great occaſion of jealouſie,
the States (than whom none are more vigilant over their
true intereſt) have not only with ſecurity, but exceeding
henefit to their Common-wealth, tollerated the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes</hi>
of quiet converſation, to live freely amongſt them.
And on the other ſide the <hi>Catholikes,</hi> ingratitude for ſo
favourable a treating, have exactly corresponded to the
mercy of their Magiſtrates, with a moſt conſtant, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
and faithfull obedience.</p>
               <p>To none of theſe ſuſpicions are the <hi>Recuſants</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in the leaſt meaſure obnoxious, becauſe whatever
change of Government can happen, they muſt expect but
a milder degree of diſaffection towards them, at moſt a
ſufferance, no encouragement, or particular confidence;
and infallibly, if the rigor of the Lawes (made upon
far different motives which are now no ways preſſing)
were qualified to a temper of mercy, that the <hi>Catholikes</hi>
might enjoy but halfe the Liberties to which they were
born, they would be the moſt quiet and uſefull Subjects
of <hi>England,</hi> ſince their Religion obliges to obey the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
commands of their Superiours, not only for fear,
but conſcience. Nor did ever the very worſt of them stir
in any ſedition at any time when they were admitted to
but halfe the common rights of Engliſh-men, nor were
they many that ever attempted their own relief by enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
their Countries peace, all the reſt ſitting quietly and
patiently under the burthens which the heavy hand of
thoſe times continually heapt upon them.</p>
               <p>Now that the crimes (though never ſo hainous) of a
few diſcontented &amp; desperate ſpirits ſhould be imputed
to their Religion, whoſe principles expreſly condemn
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152182:18"/>
ſuch conſpiracies, ſeems extremely rigorous; but when
to thoſe diſhonorable imputations are joyned intollerable
penalties both upon our lives and eſtates, and not only
againſt the then living Catholikes, but all their posterity
to this very day, ſurely it muſt needs appear the moſt
harſh and ſevere proceeding that ever was practiſed in
the world. Wherefore I ſhall cloſe this ſecond Letter with
my humble prayers to the gracious Redeemer of our
ſoules, that you would ceaſe to impute all our faults to
our Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we begin to commit no other faults
but our Religion, ſo ſhould we happily overcome our
own infirmities, and fully ſatisfie your jealouſies.</p>
               <p>When I had well peruſed this Gentlemans diſcourſe,
and attentively read his Letters, I muſt freely confeſſe
I could not have believed that either the Papiſts had
ſuffered ſo much from us, or been able to ſay ſo much
for themſelves, I do not mean in order to prove the
truth of their Religion, but the unreaſonableneſſe of
our perſecution; ſince really to my underſtanding,
our jealouſies of their obedience ſeem as uneceſſary unto
us, as prejudiciall to them; for I am confident there is
no Religion in the world, but by good Laws againſt
breach of peace, and due execution of them, may be
made conſiſtent with any Kingdome or Common-wealth
whatſoever. Who more oppoſite in beliefe then
<hi>Chriſtians, Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> yet we ſee by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that <hi>Jews</hi> are not inconſiſtent with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nor <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with that of the

               <p>As concerning the Doctrine we charge upon them, of

               <p>1. That the Pope or Church hath Power to abſolve any

               <p>2. That by the command or dispenſation of Pope or

for <hi>Error, Schiſme;</hi> or <hi>Hereſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That it is lawfull in it ſelfe, or by diſpenſation from
the Pope, to break promiſe or oath made to any of
the foreſaid perſons, under pretence that they are
Heretiques.</p>
               <p>Theſe they utterly diſclaim and renounce as no part
of their belief, profeſſing under their hands their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

and execution of them all: which gave me ſo much
the more ſatisfaction, by how much it was beſides my
expectation, nor have I now any thing to ſay againſt
them upon that account.</p>
               <p>And indeed, if we conſider theſe differences between

               <p>For my ſmall experience in the world, all the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that ever I heard of againſt the credit of our <hi>Papiſts</hi>
was their being diſabled by ſequeſtrations to pay their
debts, not taught by their Religion to deceive their
Creditors.</p>
               <p>If their Doctrines were ſo deſtructive to civil Society,
as our accuſations pretend; how comes it to paſs that
our fundamentall Laws were enacted by them, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted

I A. B. Do abjure and renounce the Popes Supremacy

               <p>1. Whether this Oath do not flatly contradict the

in Scripture, as Fundamental points of Chriſtian Faith,
but deduced from paſſages, to which the Anſwers are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
as probable by them, as the arguments by us, why
ſhould we ſo cruelly perſecute one another for Doctrines,

               <p>5. How ſhall we defend the Oath againſt this

nor any penal Oath againſt the moſt extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant

and the like? What can be more deſtructive to the

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:152182:22"/>
and ſcandalous blaſphemies of Mr. <hi>Fry,</hi> a late Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Parliament, who publikely in print not only
denies, but derides that Supreme Myſtery of <hi>Chriſtian

contented it ſelf with a moderate and favourable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
excluding him only from ſitting amongſt
them; and if his Dignity and publique Character
had not rendered him obnoxious to the crime of
ſcandal, he might perhaps have remained as free
from trouble, as all the reſt of his Opinion do, who
never yet have ſuffered the leaſt moleſtation for the

               <p>In particular at the Quarter-Seſſions at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
on the 24 of <hi>Iune</hi> 1651. there were five <hi>Ranters</hi>
convented before Colonel <hi>Baxter</hi> and other Juſtices,
and ſufficient proof, that they had maintained that
one <hi>Robins</hi> a Glaſier <hi>was a Prophet, and that his wife
was with child of the Meſſias,</hi> with ſuch other blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
ſtuffe: but four of theſe, not then abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſſerting theſe Opinions, nor yet denying them,
but evading the ſeveral queſtions demanded of them
by the Bench, were diſcharged, the fifth was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
(as he well deſerved) not for his Opinions,
but for calling the Juſtices Traitors, &amp;c. On the
ſame day a Gentlewoman great with child, and ſome
others, were alſo convented for a ſuppoſed hearing of
Maſſe, on the day commonly called <hi>Chriſtmas-day,</hi>
1650. at the then <hi>French-Agents</hi> in <hi>Long-Acre;</hi> and
though there was no direct proof that they were at
Maſſe, but at Mattins or Prayers before Maſſe, yet
Colonel <hi>Baxter</hi> did maintain againſt ſome other of
the Juſtices, that <hi>Mattins</hi> and <hi>Maſſe</hi> was all one, and
ſo the Gentlemen and the reſt were fined one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
marks apeece, and ſent to priſon, according to
the rigor of the Statute in that behalf formerly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152182:22"/>
made: The ſeverity of which laſt proceeding, and
the partiality of the firſt, needs no Comment.</p>
               <p>Why muſt the <hi>Papiſt</hi> be thus ſingled out from all
the reſt, and peremptorily forced to this hard choice,
of either forfeiting his eſtate, or forſaking his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
If we fear their increaſe, we overvalue their
Religion; If we doubt their diſturbing us, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue
our own ſtrength; abundantly ſufficient
are the means which God hath put into our hands, to
ſecure our ſelves from a few diſarmed Papiſts; abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ſufficient were this only proviſion, to exclude
them from Offices of importance, and execute ſevere
puniſhment upon ſuch as ſhould actually attempt any
thing to the diſcompoſure of the State.</p>
               <p>Nor can ſuch gentleneſſe and moderation towards
quiet Recuſants, be juſtly accounted a toleration of
them, becauſe (I conceive) that word ſignifies an
abſolute equality in all civil reſpects betwixt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of different judgements in Religion, elſe the
preſent ſufferings of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> paying their two thirds,
might by the ſame frowardneſſe be accuſed as a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
whereas the penalties indeed are altogether
intolerable. Not to inflict the utmoſt ſeverity of
puniſhment, is not preſently to be reputed an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the crime: God himſelf ſuffers all the ſins
we commit, but approves none of them; we our
ſelves daily permit miſchifs to avoid inconveniences,
and for that reaſon we prohibit not <hi>Maſſe</hi> in the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Ambaſſadors, nor puniſh Uſury, though the
Statute it ſelf, 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 8. brands it with the name
of Vice, and moſt Divines hold it a deteſtable ſin,
expreſly forbidden by the Law of God.</p>

               <p>In order to which collection, the moſt religious

If we ſuſpect the diſaffection of any Party, as the

their Country, by treating them at leaſt merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

yet ſurely it is a <hi>hard ſaying,</hi> and the moſt ſincere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of any Religion whatſoever find difficulty enough

worm that whilſt we walk fairly by, it proſtrates it
ſelfe before us, and lowly creeps upon the ground, if
when we tread upon it, it lift his head, and ſtrive to
wring it ſelfe from under our cruell feet? Notably to
this purpoſe is the old example of the <hi>Privernates</hi> an

the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> and being almoſt quite
reduced by force of Armes they diſpatch their Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
for terms of peace; the Senate ſternly ask them,
<hi>What new peace they could expect, who had ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently

the diſcourſe, allowing free liberty of reply to

his conſcience, by having given a reaſon of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and whom can we better imitate, then
ſo great an inſtrument of the liberty wee all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy?
or wherein can we follow him with ſo much
praiſe both of God and man, as in the mildneſſe
of his ſpirit, by which he conquers more powerfully,
than by the ſharpneſſe of his Sword? have not the

which our charity may gain to heaven? why do we
not erect a Committee to purchaſe Souls, as we have

there would in time grow ſociety, Commerce,

               <p>Nor can I forbear to confeſſe how extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome
that ſcurvy news was to me, of one <hi>Wright</hi>
a Jeſuite, being drawn to Tyburn as a Traytor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a hurdle for his Religion, on the 19 of May 1651.
becauſe I had ſo often commended the moderation
of the preſent autority, as having never ſpilt one drop
of blood for Religion: and though the <hi>Sequeſtrations</hi>
of all peaceable <hi>Recuſants</hi> were flatly againſt our
Maximes, yet the preſſing neceſſities of the State, &amp;
their purpoſe (which I alwaies believed) of taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all penalties upon the conſcience, after a ſhort
time, when the Government ſhould be a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſetled, exceedingly qualified the harſhneſſe of
thoſe pecuniary ſeverities; but now with grief I
muſt lay down my arms, and with ſhame revoke
all my arguments which I have hitherto uſed, to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
the injuſtice of our ſequeſtring for conſcience,
and pacifie the ruines of many welaffected and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
perſons, who highly diſliked even that <hi>Soul-money,</hi>
as King <hi>Iames</hi> uſed to call it, wherein as I
have had no ſmall ſucceſſe, ſo now I cannot with a
ſafe conſcience endeavour any more, leſt I ſhould
co-operate to deceive the people; <hi>Sequeſtrations</hi> I
confeſſe did ſhrewdly crack, but this killing has bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
quite in pieces all our Principles. Againſt
what have we principally fought all this while, but
coercencie in religion? For what have we made ſo
many tedious Marches, and Declarations, but <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of tender Conſciences?</hi> Is this <hi>to hold forth the truth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152182:26"/>
in love?</hi> Is this <hi>to instruct in meekneſſe,</hi> as becomes the

into the hands of the living God, let us alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that voice ſpeaking within us, <hi>They ſhall be

               </p>
               <p>Beſides the ſharpneſſe of the ſentence, the very
Trial (as I am informed) had many ſingular and
unuſuall paſſages, as that nothing was proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Priſoner, but that a great many years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
he had ſaid <hi>Maſſe</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and this only by
one Witneſſe, and one who in open <hi>Seſſions</hi> profeſt
a particular <hi>pique</hi> and quarrel towards him, alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
an old grudge as one of the reaſons why he
came up out of the Country to ſwear againſt him,
no diſturbance of the publike repoſe, nor ſo much
as the leaſt breach of peace laid to his charge, but
only his being a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and in <hi>England:</hi> And that

it were a faſhion as worthy to be tranſported into

if either party ſeem unſatisfied, his liberty is

made the Abjuring Oath on purpoſe to pinch

               <p>And, proceeding upon the ſame ſubject, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged
divers Papiſts by name, who have not only

of <hi>Abjuration</hi> and <hi>Engagement,</hi> and all this undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

debate upon their Petitions in <hi>Haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſhers-Hall</hi>
to be no longer puniſht, ſince they
were no longer guilty, the Commiſſioners declared
<hi>that it was not expreſt in any Act or Inſtructions from

they continue the ſequeſtrations as formerly, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
ſuch conformity as aforeſaid; In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
on Wedneſday the ſecond of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1651. It was
the caſe (ſayes my Presbyterian friend) of one
<hi>Smith</hi> a ſuſpected Papiſt, who had Lands in the
<hi>Soke</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> ſequeſtred; upon his appeal at
<hi>Haberdaſhers-Hall,</hi> he produced ſufficient proof that
he had been ſeveral Lords dayes at Church, and
had twice taken the Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> but one of
the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> made anſwer, that this was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
he muſt alſo take the <hi>Communion,</hi> otherwiſe
muſt continue ſequeſtred as a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> whereto
<hi>Smiths</hi> Councel replied, <hi>That if it were a mark of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
not to have received the Communion, we are</hi> (ſaid
he) <hi>all Papiſts in our Pariſh, for we have had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in our Church thoſe four years;</hi> And 'tis very
probable that that very <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> who made
this objection, hath not of late, and perhaps
will not receive the <hi>Communion</hi> in manner
as is preſcribed by the Statute: and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152182:28"/>
it is a very ſad caſe for us to force others, under
ſo great a penalty, as the Sequeſtration of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
to do that which we will not do our ſelves: all
the relief and hopes that <hi>Smith</hi> and others in his
condition (who have both gone to Church, and
taken the <hi>Communion,</hi> and Oath of <hi>Abjuration</hi>) have
received at the ſaid Hall, is, that the ſaid Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
have promiſed to move the Parliament, to
know <hi>what ſhall amount unto a Conformity;</hi> and it
might alſo be deſired, to know what Religion the
Papiſts (in caſe they be forced to leave their own)
ſhall conform unto, ſince we have three ſeverall
Religions, that at preſent ſeems to have an equall
power or influence; the Prelaticall or old Proteſtant
(as ſome call it) is eſtabliſht by law; the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
carries the vogue in the Pulpit; but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
has the power and Countenance of the
State. Certainly the aboveſaid ſtrange proceedings
muſt needs appear, both to all reformed Churches
abroad, and to very many conſcientious people at
home, as ſavouring of a deſign to make ſure of the
Papiſts eſtates, whatſoever becomes of their
ſouls.</p>
               <p>And all this while we hold forth <hi>meekneſſe,</hi> and
all this while we cry up <hi>Liberty of Conſcience!</hi> Is it
poſſible we ſhould ſo far forget our principles, as to
ſeize the eſtates of our neighbours and kindred for
Religion, and at the ſame time profeſſe to venture
all our own, to purchaſe freedom of Religion? is
it poſſible we ſhould expoſe our own lives in ſo long

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:152182:28"/>

Countrymen meerly for their Religion? have we
ſo ſoon forgot thoſe ſharp reproofs of the Apoſtle,
Rom. 2. <hi>Behold you are called Iews, and reſt in the
Law, and make your boaſt of God, you know his will,
and approve the things that are more excellent, you are
confident that your ſelves are guides of the blind, and
lights to them that are in darkneſſe, inſtructers of the
fooliſh, and teachers of Babes, who have the form of
knowledge and of truth in the Law; you therefore
who teach another, teach you not your ſelves? you
that preach a man ſhould not ſteal, do you ſteal? you
that abhor Idols, do you commit ſacrilege? In the day
when God ſhall judge the ſecre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God is not mocked; he promiſes indeed, that the

as ſeem <hi>meek</hi> only to inherit the Land.</p>
               <p>Thus ſharply went on my angry <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and
I confeſſe I was extremely aſhamed to hear him
ſay ſo much reaſon, that uſed to ſpeak nothing but
paſſion, and to ſee my ſelf ſo confounded by one,
that I have alwaies overcome with eaſe upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſubject, and ſhould have liked far better his
obſervations (which with grief I acknowledge to be
too true and open to all the World) if they had
come from an indifferent and unfactious ſpirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I ſuſpect they may perhaps proceed rather from
envy towards the gainers than pity upon the loſers:
for during the violent, and therefore ſhort, dominion
of the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> never were more cruel torturers
of the <hi>Conſcience</hi> than they, never a more tyrannical
Tribunal than their <hi>Iure divino Aſſembly,</hi> and claſſical
High-commiſſion; but the hand of the Lord ſtopt
them in their full cariere, and by wofull experience

               <p>Wherefore it ſhall be my dayly prayer to our great

conſidering that both their allegiance to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

            <p>IN the precedent part of this Diſcourſe,
I have demonſtrated (according to that
light which the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> hath infuſed
into my Soul) how much coercency in
Religion is repugnant to the Law of
Nature, and by many evident and unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Texts of Scripture, ſhewed, how diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it is to God, how improper to advance the
power of godlineſſe, and how extremely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
to the ſweet Spirit, which guided
our <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> in the propagation of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
And after in the ſame little treatiſe I
proceed to prove (by the expreſſe words of the
Parliaments and Armies Declarations) that
the great Principle wherein we glory, &amp; wch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
we have ſo long fought to eſtabliſh, is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Goſpel-freedom, &amp; abſolute deliverance
of the Conſcience from all Tyranny and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
            <p>Which Diſcourſe as I compoſed in all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe
of ſpirit, and afterwards offered to
the gracious Redeemer of our Souls, who
gave me the ſtrength and power to finiſh
it to his glory: So I find not only my ſelf (for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:152182:30"/>
which I humbly thank the bounty of my
God) confirmed in my former judgement,
but others in ſome meaſure convinced in
theirs, of the unreaſonableneſſe and ſinne of
Conſcience-Perſecution.</p>
            <p>Concerning which pious and modeſt temper
of mutuall forbearance, I ſhall only add to what
I have mentioned in the former part, this plain
and familiar Obſervation, That as the ſureſt
marke of a tender conſcience in our ſelves, is a
tender ſpirit to others, ſo the moſt infallible
ſign of a hard &amp; ſtony heart in our own breſts is,
when we ſlit in pieces and ſhipwracke the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of all that touch upon us: But praiſed for
ever be the Name of our God who ſtill proceeds
to guide and illuminate his Choſen, graciouſly
diſpoſing them neither to preſume upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for their knowledge, nor be cruell againſt
others for their ignorance, but humbly adore
and wait upon the Divine Providence in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
of all things: which fills my ſoul with
exceeding joy when I conſider it to be the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſenſe of all the truly Godly and well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in this Nation, that no quiet and peaceable
Chriſtian be deprived of the cheif content and
comfort of this life, which certainly conſiſts in a
reall and impartiall, yet unoffenſive, liberty
to ſerve his God according to his conſcience.
Many Petitions I could here cite in affirmance
of this Truth, from ſeverall Provinces of this
Land: but I ſhall trouble the Reader onely
with theſe two, the firſt was preſented to the
Parliament upon the ſix and twentieth of <hi>March</hi>

profeſſe to ſubmit their private
judgements unappealably to a truly-free
Generall Council, that we might once have
an end of all ſtrife and contention about
matters of Religion; others refer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
without further inſtance to a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Aſſembly of Divines, and very few but
will prefer the judgment of the ſupreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of this Nation, before their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſenſe, readily conforming to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
which the Parliament ſhall hold
forth to be the true meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
So that almoſt every one agrees in the
acknowledgment of an external Authority
to decide ſuch Controverſies as ariſe out of
the different interpretation of Gods word,
which is the main exception againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
in that they pin their Faith upon the
Churches ſleeve, and yield a blind obedience
(that is without appealing any further) to her
determinations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:152182:35"/>
And for the ſecond branch, I am ſure ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Proteſtants continue ſtill thoſe old cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
of baring their heads when they come
into a Church, nay of bowing at the name of
<hi>Ieſus;</hi> Practices that ly open to the greateſt
part of thoſe objections, whichour more
godly and conſcientious penns make againſt
the Papiſts in the queſtion of Pictures; yet I
hope there will never be the leaſt thought en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
of impoſing penalties upon the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and unſcandalous uſe of any ſuch Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:
rather let us apply our endeavours
to open their eyes with a mild and gentle
hand, than beat them out with the club-fiſt
of the Law.</p>
            <p>But when I reflect upon the third concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Recuſants paper, I am aſtoniſht
to conſider how education with a little mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Paſſion or intereſt, makes every ſlight
diſtemper amongſt Chriſtians ſo deſperate,
that it often becomes irrecoverable, and
endangers both the health and life of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.
Surely in many things we ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
miſtake one another. I profeſſe ſincerely, I
ſhould be ſo far from ſeizing on the Eſtate of
a Papiſt for refuſing that part of the Oath of
<hi>Abjuration,</hi> wherein he is compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Doctrine of Merits, that I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſuffer a thouſand deaths, rather
than abjure ſo great and manifeſt a truth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſenſe wherein they explain
themſelves, or affirm ſo great and manifeſt
an Errour, according to the ſenſe wherein
we explain our ſelves. For when we cenſure
the doctrin of Merits, we underſtand by that
word, our Deſerts, as they exclude the
merits of Chriſt, and abſtracting from the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:152182:36"/>
Covenant God hath been pleaſed to make
with us in his Son, and in that ſenſe we juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemn all opinions of Merit, even of
the beſt works, as preſumptuous and Luciferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
but I now ſee when the Papiſts affirm that
good works are meritorious, they include
both the promiſe of God, and the merits of
<hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and in effect when all is ſummed
up, it amounts only to this; that God hath
graciouſly promiſed, and will faithfully keep
his word, to reward all thoſe with eternall
life that believe in him, and obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.
In this ſenſe the Papiſts hold
mercifullneſſe to be meritorious, or avayla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſalvation, becauſe the Scripture ſayes,
<hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull, for they ſhall obtain
mercy.</hi> Mat. 5. 7. In this ſenſe the Papiſts hold
patience in affliction to be meritorious or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaylable
to ſalvation, becauſe the Scripture
ſayes, <hi>Bleſſed are they who are perſecuted for
Righteouſneſſe ſake, for theirs is the Kingdom
of Heaven.</hi> Mat. 5. 10. And this (as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by very underſtanding men amongſt
them) is the reall truth of their Doctrine,
concerning <hi>Good works,</hi> which in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
differs nothing from ours, but only in
the unſavory &amp; proud ſounding word Merit.</p>
            <p>The laſt Clauſe of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Noat, which
I have tranſcribed, is ſo full and ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that if they will be as good as their words,
I ſhall neither fear to have ſuch neighbors, or
need any Magiſtrat fear to have ſuch ſubjects.</p>
            <p>And to prove their truſtineſſe and fidelity,
in the obſervance of their Oathes, I cannot
imagin a more evident demonſtration, than
that they make a conſcience of what Oathes
they take; he that ſwears any thing without
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:152182:36"/>
diſtinction, may juſtly be ſuſpected to be as
falſe to men, as he is fearleſſe of God,
whereas no cleerer argument can be alleged
in the behalf of any, that they intend to keep
all the Oathes they take, than this, that they
will not take all the Oaths you offer; ſurely if
either the <hi>Pope</hi> or their own <hi>Conſciences</hi> could
give them this extravagant privilege, to be
bound by no Oath, they might without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
take any, and if they were allowed by
their Religion to ſwear any thing, certainly
they are all worſe than mad, if they do not
immediately poſt away to <hi>Haberd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhers-hall,</hi>
call for the Oath of Abjuration, ſwallow it
down quickly without any chewing, and ſo
ſave at leaſt 50000 l. a year in a morning.</p>
            <p>In the late Kings dayes, many <hi>Papiſts</hi> were
ſmartly puniſhed for not taking the Oath of
<hi>Allegiance,</hi> none for obſerving it, nay I have
heard ſome <hi>Papiſt D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>linquents</hi> argue for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that the utter ruine, which now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers
their whole eſtates, proceeds ſolely
from their performing to the late King that
ſervice, which he called <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and this
is yet a higher proof of their fidelity in their
promiſes, ſince they adventured with ſo much
hazard to keep that Oath in ſubſtance, which
they refuſed with almoſt as much hazard to
take, becauſe againſt their Conſcience in
ſome circumſtance.</p>
            <p>And now let any one judge indifferently,
whether they that firmly believe all the holy
Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament,
worſhip and adore only one God, rely upon
Ieſus Chriſt for their ſole Mediator, and
profeſſe it their duty to obſerve the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
of the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> may not reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:152182:37"/>
be ſuffered to live in their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
with the peaceable enjoyment of their
Conſciences in their private houſes, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
thoſe who will quietly ſubmit to ſuch
cautions and reſtrictions, as the <hi>Common-wealth</hi>
ſhall require for prevention of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,
or diſturbance of the publick peace.</p>
            <p>Beſides I am perſwaded a farre leſſe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will <hi>oblige</hi> the Papiſts, than <hi>content</hi> any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe hitherto all liberty has been
wholly denyed to them, and wholly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to every one elſe; So that they will glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receive, as a mercy and favour, what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
challenge as a right, and their affections
being once purchaſed at ſo cheap a price, as
a little private exerciſe of their Conſcience,
free from the fright and ſmart of penalties, I
am confident they will neither be ſuch fools,
as to forfeit their liberty, nor ſo ungratefull
as to forget them that gave it; ſince out of all
our Hiſtories not one example can be aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that they ever offered to move the leaſt
ſedition, in a time when they enjoyed but
half the liberties of free-born Engliſh-men.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall cloſe my thoughts upon
this paper, with a ſhort and free concluſion,
which I conceive abridges in few words the
whole difficulty betwixt ſubject and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
The Magiſtrate that protects any ſort of
people in his dominions, may juſtly require
their ſervice, and ſafely rely upon their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
but if he perſecute them, whether
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> or <hi>Papiſts,</hi> he will ſoon find, that,
as he may violently force their complyance,
he can never prudently reſt upon their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>But I muſt here beg leave to be diſpenced
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152182:37"/>
with in my promiſe of ending this period, till
I have added this obſervation, how many
Modern Authors of good account amongſt
us, have poſitively held forth to the people
(as an unqueſtionable truth) that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
by their principles, <hi>are not obliged to keep
faith with Hereticks;</hi> and I muſt acknowledge
I was once of the ſame opinion concerning
them, principally relying upon the credit
of Mr. <hi>Iames Howell,</hi> an ingenious traveller
in moſt of the Popiſh Countries, which makes
me the more wonder, that he ſhould take
ſuch an erroneous opinion upon truſt, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
it in print neer the end of his firſt part of
<hi>Dodona's Grove;</hi> where he ſayes, <hi>That one
of the Canons of the laſt great Council</hi> (which
muſt needs be the Council of <hi>Trent) was, that</hi>
HAERETICIS NON EST TENENDA
FIDES; The eſteem I had entertained of
that Authors ingenuity permitted me not to
acquieſce to ſome Recuſants verball denyall
of this aſſertion; but (for more ample ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in this ſo important a point) I took the
pains to peruſe ſome of their beſt writers, and
found them unanimouſly agree, <hi>that Faith is
not only to be kept with Hereticks, but even with
Turks, Iews, and Infidells, &amp; that indiſpenſably:</hi>
neither could I find one tittle to that purpoſe
in any Canon or Seſſion of that laſt great
<hi>Council,</hi> (as he calls it) but to the contrary;
For both in the 15 and 18 <hi>Seſſion,</hi> the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
ſayes expreſly, <hi>that whoſoever ſhall violate
the leaſt point of the Publick Faith, given for the
ſecurity of all Proteſtants, that ſhould repair to
that Council, ſhould be ſubject to thoſe penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
QUAS IURE DIVINO ET HU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANO

By which it evidently appeares, that the
Councill ſuppoſed, as a thing known and
certain, that whoſoever ſhould violate his <hi>faith</hi>
promiſed to <hi>Heretiques,</hi> was not onely puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by <hi>Humane Laws,</hi> but even by the <hi>Divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Law</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And certainly if it had been my unhappineſs
to have done any ſort of Chriſtians ſo much
wrong in publique, my conſcience (comming
afterwards to be better inform'd) would oblige
me to a publique reparation; for though wee
uſe no ſuch <hi>confeſſion,</hi> as the <hi>Papists</hi> practiſe,
yet the Law of naturall reaſon binds us to as
punctuall an obſervance of reſtitution, as any
Papiſts whatſoever, and that even to <hi>Papiſts</hi>
themſelves, when we do them any injury.</p>
            <p>But for a finall diſpatch of this point
concerning the Papiſts indiſpenſable obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of performing their promiſes, it was
my fortune to light upon a book of one <hi>Paul

ſets down theſe very words, DICO QUAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TO,

after, proceeding upon the ſame queſtion, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It was the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Robert Knightley</hi> a

hall</hi> to this effect, That he had never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
any thing againſt the Parliament, yet two
parts of his eſtate were ſequeſtred with ſuch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
for his Recuſancy, that he could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
ſubſiſt with neceſſaries by the remaining
thirds, when taxes and other charges were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted:
That he was therefore conſtrained to
borrow 50 l. upon Bond, and having disburſed
15 l. of the money, it ſeemes the <hi>Sequestrators</hi>
got notice that the Petitioner had ſomewhat in
his houſe worth a new ſequeſtration or review,
as they call it, thereupon they ſearch his trunkes,
find the remaining 35 l. pull out the guilty bag,
and two parts of it they ſequeſter into their own
pockets, to the uſe of the Common-wealth, and
for releef therein Mr <hi>Hanham</hi> appealed, but
found no redreſſe at preſent, more than an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for the ſub-Commiſſioners in the Country to
examine the buſineſs and certify, &amp;c. At the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of whoſe Certificate, I leave the Petitioner
to expect his doom.</p>
               <p>On the 31 of <hi>March</hi> 1652, the Petition of one
<hi>Hamond</hi> or <hi>Ammot</hi> was read, to this effect, That
the Petitioner never did bear Arms or aſſiſt the
Enemies of the Parliament, yet his eſtate had ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
under ſequeſtration ever ſince the year 1645,
and not one penny allowed him for his mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
That the Petitioner, being a Recuſant,
did in the time of the late war continue at his
own houſe, as long as he could without appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
danger of his life, but conſidering how ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152182:42"/>
even the moſt peaceable of his Religion
were to be affronted and ruined, by the dayly
miſcheifs they received from ſome diſorderly
ſouldiers, and eſpecially ſeeing one of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
(a Recuſant) ſlain at his own door, the
Petitioner did then, and not before, fly for
protection to a Gariſon of the late <hi>Kings,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
acting any thing in the leaſt kind againſt the
<hi>Parliament.</hi> And therefore humbly prayed he
might have a fifth of his eſtate &amp; the arrears al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him to buy bread. But it not appearing to
the Commiſſioners that he had wife or Children,
their anſwer was, <hi>they had not power to grant him
any releef.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor do I believe this mans caſe to be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:
For I am well ſatisfied, that a great part
of thoſe <hi>Papists,</hi> who are ſequeſtred as abſolute
delinquents, were never in actuall arms againſt
the Parliament, but onely fled to the enemies
Garriſons for ſhelter, yet no qualification or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in puniſhment is hitherto allowed them,
which would bee to my underſtanding very juſt
and reaſonable; Since whoever did obſerve the
fury and rage of moſt of our common ſouldiers
(at the begining of the late troubles) againſt
many of that party, will eaſily conclude the
Papiſts had reaſon to diſtruſt their own perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ſecurity amongſt them. And for inſtance, I
remember an officer of my acquaintance under
the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> told me, that at their
taking of <hi>Lincoln</hi> from the <hi>Cavaleers</hi> in the year
1644, he was an eye witneſſe of this Tragedy.
The next day after the Town was taken, ſome of
our common ſouldiers in cold bloud (meeting
with Mr. <hi>Price</hi> of <hi>Waſhingley</hi> in <hi>Huntington</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:152182:43"/>
Papist? I am</hi> (ſaid he) Price <hi>the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;</hi>
whereupon one of them immediately ſhot
him dead.</p>
               <p>In the ſame month of <hi>March</hi> there happned at
this Hall a very hard caſe, which was of a maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant
(whoſe name I do not remember) but
her Petition was to this effect; That her Father
and Mother both dyed, when ſhe was but 16
years of age, and being very poor, they left the
Petitioner only ſome old clothes and a little
houſehold-ſtuff, in all not above 5. or 6.
pounds, after whoſe death of Petitioner,
being an Orphan, betook her ſelf to ſervice,
and having ſerved ſeventeen yeares, for the
annuall wages of 7 Nobles, the Petitioner had
by her frugaliy increaſed her ſmall patrimony to
20 l. which being plac'd in the hands of <hi>A. B.</hi>
and of late diſcovered to be the Petitioners mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and the Petitioner a Recuſant; She humbly
prayd that they would pleaſe to take the ſad
and diſconſolate condition of a poor Orphan
into their charitable conſideration, whereby
the extremity of the Law might be qualified to
ſo mercifull a temper, that ſhe might not be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ruind, by loſing in a moment for her
Conſcience what ſhe had been ſo long in gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
by the ſweat of her browes. But the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
(though perhaps other wiſe willing)
concluded they had not power to give her any
releef, more than the bare thirds, unleſſe ſhe
would take the Oath of <hi>Abjuration;</hi> A thing
as far at leaſt above her underſtanding, as it can
be againſt her Conſcience,</p>
               <p>If it be unreaſonable (as many wel-affected
ſeem to urge) that the Prieſts and Miniſters
(who do or at leaſt ſhould perform ſome ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:152182:43"/>
offices for the good of the Soul ſhould tyth
a tenth part of the husband-mans labour: How
much more unreaſonable is it, that a poor ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maid-ſervant ſhould thus, meerly upon the
account of Conſcience, be ſequeſtred of two
thirds of that, which by many yeares labour
ſhe had gained and reſerved, as a ſuport a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the neceſſities of old age.</p>
               <p>On the 16th of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1652. The Caſe of
Miſtris <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> a Recuſant, was
heard, whoſe Petition ſpake to this effect; That
her late husband in his life time ſetled a leaſe of
<hi>Muck-hall</hi> (or ſuch like name) in <hi>Eſſex</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
value upon her in lieu of joincture, for
divers years yet in being, and was held of the
late Dean and Chapter of Pauls; That <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Andrews</hi> or Mr. <hi>Nathaniel</hi> his ſon had
bought the reverſion of thoſe lands at <hi>Gurney
houſe,</hi> and had ſince taken a leaſe for 7 years
of the Commiſſioners for Sequeſtration in <hi>Eſſex</hi>
of the whole preſent poſſeſſion, without the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners
conſent or knowledge, and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
regard to her thirds; And that the ſaid Mr.
<hi>Andrewes</hi> having now poſſeſſion of the whole
eſtate, had demoliſh'd the Petitioners Manſion
houſe, and did refuſe to pay the Petitioner her
Thirds, whereby ſhe was driven to a neceſſity
of wanting bread, being a diſtreſſed and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
widdow of almoſt 80 years of Age; She
therefore prayd her thirds and the arreares, and
that the ſaid leaſe might be annulled, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt was charitably granted, but as to
the Leaſe, and what her thirds ſhould be, ſhe
was left to the Mercy of Mr.</hi> Andrews, <hi>who I

               <p>That which in this caſe did moſt exact my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,

               <p>And now I am at the <hi>Gatehouſe</hi> I ſhall
give you the ſupplement of a like ſad ſtory,
mentioned in the 21 page of the firſt part of

gentle-woman, committed to priſon on the
24 of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1651, her name upon enquiry I
find was <hi>Delavall,</hi> an Engliſh woman, but
her husband a Frenchman; ſhe was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
alſo to the <hi>Gatehouſe,</hi> and with much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
got leave by Petition to goe out
upon bail, till ſhe was brought to bed, but was
an actuall Priſoner full 7 months of the 12,
which is preſcribed by the <hi>Statute,</hi> and the
Fine of 100 Marks ſtood charg'd upon her,
til ſhe was releeved by the late gracious Act
of <hi>Generall Pardon</hi> and <hi>Oblivion,</hi> (an <hi>Act</hi> that
no leſſe obliges all the People of this Nation,
to forget their private injuries, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the publique mercy of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:)
and all this poor Womans ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
merely grounded upon a bare ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that ſhe had been at the then <hi>French
Agents</hi> in <hi>Long Acre</hi> at Maſs, without ſo much
as one witneſſe that there was any Maſſe ſaid
there at all, It being the truth of the caſe (if
I may believe their moſt ſerious Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:152182:45"/>
that they were only at their other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

               <p>But to return to <hi>Haberdaſhers hall.</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in my obſervations there, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the caſes before recited, it was a familiar
thing to ſee Papiſts (I mean ſingle Papiſts,
without the adjunct of Delinquency) outed
of the poſſeſſion of the two ſequeſtred thirds
of their eſtates, by any ſtranger that would
offer in the box but 12 pence more than the
owner; which hath made divers owners
ſtrain themſelves to give more rent to the
State, than they could poſſibly make of the
two parts, rather than be outed of the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of their Antient patrimonies; And ſome
of them have aſſured me, that it happens ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
often, that neighbours, either through co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe
of revenge (for who can live ſo
innocently as to procure no Enemy, at leaſt
ſo happily as to have none,) ſet themſelves
to outvy the owners, and then recompence
the loſſe they have in the great rent they
pay, by mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uſing the lands they hire in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
of the owner.</p>
               <p>Beſides many times when the proprietors
have with much charge and long attendance
obtained Leaſes of the two parts for 7 years
in the Country, in purſuance of the Act of
Parliament; after improvement of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
by good husbandry, they are again ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and their Leaſes made void at this Hall,
under pretence of the want of ſome forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of <hi>Surveying, poſting, boxing,</hi> or the
like, which it ſeemes the Inſtructions
from theſe Commiſſioners do hold forth to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152182:45"/>
thoſe below, yet thoſe <hi>Inſtructions</hi> are not made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
whereby the partyes intereſſed might be adviſed
how to proceed regularly and certainly in a buſineſſe,
that ſo much concernes their ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p>Nor are the Recuſants permitted to ſell any of their
Lands, by Fining for the two parts, though for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their juſt Debts, nay though they ſhould
bee willing to tranſport themſelves beyond the Seas;
By which diſablement to ſell or Morgage the leaſt pile
of graſſe they poſſeſſe, many well-affected ſuffer much
prejudice, by non-payment of their true and ancient
debts, but divers of the Papiſts are thereby driven to
ſuch extream neceſſities, that they have expos'd their
bare Thirds to ſale; though I perceive few Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
will meddle therewith, unleſſe upon very diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
termes to the Seller, becauſe the Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
ſay, they are ſure to contract a charge and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to themſelves by their attendance at this Hall: For
in ſuch caſe, if the Papiſt can gain the favour to have
his Thirds partitioned from the other two; yet (as I
heard it argued) the State might, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſold ſuch
divided part, or by good husbandry improv'd it, evict
it from him, and aſſign him another Thirds of the
ſame Lands, that perhaps has been waſted by ill Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants;
For I found this alſo much complained of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Petitioners, that the Sequeſtrators or ſuch
Strangers to whom the Two parts are often demiſed,
rarely or never beſtow any Money on repairs of the
two Thirds, but take the Rents, as long as the Houſes
or Lands will yeild any; which is one reaſon, why ſuch
Cuſtomers many times out-bid the owners for the
renting thoſe two Thirds; the owners being alwaies
carefull to keep up the Houſes, and direct their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
to the beſt advantage and embetterment of the
Lands.</p>
               <p>Others I obſerved to complaine much of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152182:46"/>
long attendance, and great charge they were at in
gaining their Thirds, and an allowance of their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
Houſes, and of the many malicious and falſe
accuſations that Informers were permitted to bring
in againſt them: As (if I miſtake not) I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
ſome of the Solicitors ſay, that the Lady <hi>Saint
Johns,</hi> or her Husband Mr. <hi>Arundell,</hi> had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
for Delinquency five or ſix ſeverall times,
and ſtill cleared it. Witneſſes have been often ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned
to falſe accuſations, and yet when the party
injured (after long attendance and expence) has
cleered himſelfe of the Calumny, and conſequently
proved the malice of the Informer, no reparation
would be allowed for ſo dangerous a ſlander; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that upon the whole matter I have heard a
Recuſant (with tears in his Eyes) profeſſe ſeriouſly,
that ſo much attendance and charge was required in
getting their Thirds, and ſuch continuall fears and
vexations attended their condition, that if he could
by manufacture or any other honeſt calling get a
livelyhood, he ſhould eaſily reſolve to let his Third
part goe after the other two.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners themſelves (ſitting in a
treble capacity; Firſt for <hi>Compounding with Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,</hi>
Secondly, for <hi>Advance of Money</hi> upon the fifth
and twentyeth parts, and Thirdly, <hi>for Sequeſtrations</hi>)
can onely ſpare Wedneſday Mornings, for hearing
Petitions upon Sequeſtrations, and commonly
there is not a Committee (which muſt be at leaſt
four of the ſeven Commiſſioners) till after ten of the
clock, by which means they can ſcarce afford two
hours in a Weeke for the diſpatch of that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
So that whenſoever a Suitou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe complaints (for ought I could poſſibly be
informed) are not onely true, but far ſhort of what
this ſort of people ſuffers; which ſo much the more

of Papiſts Eſtates, upon the ſole account of Religion,
is not in their opinion warranted by Gods word,
but rather the contrary; And yet theſe men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

appeale to your owne Conſciences, whether yee have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
theſe Conditions in your urging ſo many dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Oathes upon this miſerable Nation theſe years by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt,
not onely in the Covenant, but in your ſolemn

whereby yoe enforced all men to ſwear to eſtabliſh by

many have yee enforced (by threatning and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Law, following upon them, depriving men of their
Eſtates) to ſwear and ſubſcribe to all ye injoyned or

other heynous ſinnes: I wiſh to God you had remembred
or would yet remember, how much you cryed out againſt
the Tyranny of Biſhops, (when they were urging ſome
of your number, who were refractory to Epiſcopacy)
that there ſhould be had ſome regard to tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
which were of another Iudgement: But ſo
ſoon as ye had got the power into your hands, neither
Miniſter nor Laird, Man, Woman or Child, was
spared, nor any regard had unto them, whatſoever
quality or condition they were of, all were forced not
onely to obey you, but (which is the greateſt tyranny
over mens Conſciences) they were made to ſwear, that
they thought, as yee would have them, albeit to your

               <p>And ſince we all ſay, that wee abhorre to violence
and force any ones Conſcience farther then to
ſecure the publick peace, and that onely as neceſſity
ſhall really appeare, and not upon any Voluntary
or Counterfeit pretence, I cannot ſee how the
taking of this Oath availes to make a man, either
a better Neighbour or a better Subject, and ſhould
be glad to know, whether the Parliament will
truſt honeſt Sir <hi>Richard Minſhew,</hi> Dr. <hi>Iohn Frier,</hi>
&amp;c. any more now, then before they tooke that
Oath, and became outward Conformiſts: Since
tis but too probable, they doe it not upon any
Conviction of Conſcience, but rather againſt
Conſcience, meerely to ſave their Eſtates from
Sequeſtration; And if ſo, none can deny, but
that it is the higheſt degree of perjury, and a
ſpirituall Murther of the Soule; Then let us ſadly
conſider, how diſadvantagious to the worke of
the Lord, and ſcandalous to the eyes of men it will
be, for us to fill up our Congregations with ſuch
unſanctified Members: The ingenious Author

<hi>If</hi> wee <hi>ſeriouſly reflect</hi> (ſayes hee) <hi>upon the deſigne

finde it was to ſet an end to that pompous adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the caſe of Mr. <hi>Anthony, Roane,</hi> who was executed at
<hi>Usk</hi> in <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſheire on the 4th. of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1650,
for poiſoning his Wife; This Gent. the very home
before his execution, made a publique confeſſion to
this purpoſe; That hee had been bred a Roman
Catholique from his infancy, and continued in that
Religion till ſome two or three yeares before his
death, when, being overcome by an unhappy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of preſerving his family from beggery, he
forſook the Belief of his owne Soule, and went to
Church to ſave his Eſtate; after which, the (Devil
taking advanage upon him in this diſturbance and
anxiety of Spirit) he confeſſed that he had falne
into many great Sinnes, but denied the guilt of
that horrid cryme of poiſoning his wife, for which he
was condemned to dye; delivering further with a
kind of confidence, that if he had had the grace to
have continued conſtant in his Religion, he believed
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e had never ſo highly tranſgreſſed the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his God, nor come to ſo unhappy amend.
And openly declared (with much ſeeming repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
that he dyed in his old Religion.</p>
               <p>And it is a generall obſervation among the Papiſts
themſelves, that many of them, who ſtrain their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
to ſuch complyance, doe come to untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ends; as I confeſſe we have lately had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy

               </p>
               <p>Certainly this is a ſad conſequence of wreſting
the inward perſwaſion of poore Soules from that
Belief, which their own Conſcience tells them is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152182:50"/>
true, thereby making them leſſe carefull of their
owne ſalvation, and their honeſty and credit of leſſe
reputation, even with thoſe, who force them to this
change. For the heart of man is ſo fraile and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that it ſeldom is drawne by violence from thoſe
principles, which it has long been uſed to eſteem
and practiſe, but becomes ſlack and negligent in
what concernes the other World, and by degrees
growes very often wholly inſenſible of any thing, but
ſenſuality.</p>
               <p>Upon the newes not long ſince, of ſome Papiſts
taking the Oath of <hi>Abjuration</hi> and frequenting the
publique places of meeting, I conceived my ſelfe
ſufficiently furniſht to anſwer a certaine old ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which a Recuſant of my acquaintance uſed
often to repeat in my hearing, that <hi>SANGUIS
MARTYRUM EST SEMEN ECCLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIAE:</hi>
This upon all occaſions hee applyed to
the ſufferings of Papiſts, both here in <hi>England</hi> and
ten thouſand miles off in <hi>Japan,</hi> in which two
Iſlands have of late been ſharper perſecutions,
(ſaid he) for matter of Religion, then in any other
place of the World; This he continually inſiſted
upon, as a Soveraigne remedy for all his ſorrowes,
nor could we ever beat him from this laſt hold,
wherein hee fortified himſelf, <hi>SANGUIS
MARTYRUM;</hi> &amp;c. nay more, hee ſometimes
ventured to affirm with ſtrange aſſurance, this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that his Church encreaſed and proſpered ſtill,
even whilſt it was actually under the greateſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
that his Church was, as the Palme tree, the
heavier weights are laid on, the more it flouriſheth.
I having gotten this advantage by the late coming
in of ſome Papiſts to our Religion, went preſently
on purpoſe to my Recuſant to put him to the
queſtion, and as it were a little triumphing, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152182:50"/>
what hee thought now of his old Latin Proverb
(in which hee had formerly ſeemed to place ſo
much confidence) and whether the Palme tree did
not ſometimes break a twigg by laying on ſo many
weights; To which he replyed with a little ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and Choller, That ſome dead or Canker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten
Branches, as they can beare no weight, ſo they
can bear no fruit, even whilſt united to the Stock,
and much leſſe after their diviſion: But ſoone reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
himſelfe to his uſuall temper, he calmly,
yet earneſtly undertooke, that as there have been
at leaſt twenty Preiſts put to death in <hi>England</hi>

                  </gap>ince
the beginning of this Parliament meerly upon the
account of their Religion or function, ſo hee could
name a far greater number of perſons of quality,
who have in the ſame ſpace of time reconciled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Catholique Union. When I urged
him to the proofe of this aſſertion, he imediately
delivered me a liſt of twenty Preiſts, who during
theſe late revolutions have been hang'd, drawne and
quartered either for taking orders beyond Seas or
exerciſing them on this ſide the Seas, and withall
promiſed (upon the allowance of a little time for
recollection) to furniſh me with a Roll of ſome

name, to recompence ſuch Errour, with the intereſt
of two for one, unleſſe he might be diſpenſed with
upon the inconveniency of diſcovering thoſe, who
can no longer live unruined for their Religion, then
they are unknown to profeſſe it.</p>

               <p>I muſt ingenuouſly confeſſe, I knew not well
what anſwer to make the Papiſt in this point, but
ſtill to expreſſe my diſlike of ſuch perſecution
even of any ſort of Chriſtians: And am very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
that were they treated more mercifully and
invited to come to our ſpirituall conferences, (which
my Recuſant told mee hee would not at any time
refuſe, were it onely to diſcourſe in an amicable
Chriſtian way the points in difference betweene us)
we ſhould gaine more of them to us, or at leaſt
hinder the growth of their Religion more, then any
tortures of body, or Sequeſtration of their Eſtates
are like to doe.</p>
               <p>Nor is it reaſonable to exact of ſuch as diſſent
from us any other kinde of preſence at our Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
then to propoſe their difficulties in a modeſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152182:53"/>
and peaceable way, and patiently to heare our
Anſwers; without expecting they ſhould preſently
joine with the Congregation; for that were to
oblige them, to profeſſe before they are ſatisfied, and
practice, before they know what it is they doe;
Whereas the Scripture commands us firſt <hi>to try all
things, and then hold faſt that which is beſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some, who have not onely the forme but the
power of Godlineſſe in this Nation, have of late
(in order to the advancement of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome)
been induced to move and endeavour a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admittance
of the <hi>Iews</hi> amongſt us, in hope to be
happy inſtruments in their converſion, which the
Scripture holds forth in the 11. to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
And why ſhall we not alſo (upon like grounds of
Chriſtian Charity) endeavour the converſion of
all other people of different perſwaſions in point
of Chriſtianity, by <hi>being mercifull</hi> unto them, <hi>as our
Heavenly Father is mercifull Luke</hi> 6. 36.</p>
               <p>But nothing ſo afflicts my ſpirit, as to conſider
the cruell gripes we give the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in reſpect of the
light hand, which the <hi>Turke</hi> himſelfe beares over
his Chriſtians; To which purpoſe I ſhall here
humbly offer an exact Parallel of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſome Godly people ſeem to ſcruple; They thinke

be not laid on for their different Judgement, why
are they taken off, when they conforme in their

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nalty, which ſurely is the greateſt hinderance of

ever offered to any upon the ſingle ground of
diffidence in their affections to the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but onely to ſuch as are ſuſpected of
Popery.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the Compariſon I began to
mention between the ſtate of <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and
of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>Turks Dominions,</hi> I finde by the
beſt information I can gather, the Great Turks
manner of bearing himſelfe to his Chriſtian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to be ſtrangely more temperate and leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable
of cruelty or covetouſneſſe, than wee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
uſe to one another; for as our Travailers
unanimouſly relate, the whole Annuall Fine that
any Chriſtian payes the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> upon the ſcore
of Religion, comes to no more than a <hi>Zeccheen,</hi> which
is leſſe than our <hi>Angell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet what ever wee can object againſt our
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> may with at leaſt as much reaſon
charge upon his <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> Some Anceſtors of the
Chriſtians have heretofore taken up Arms, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
with Forraigners againſt the eſtabliſht Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of their Countrey; and yet the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi>
(whom wee ſo much abominate as tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
and barbarous) can forgive the poſterity
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152182:54"/>
of ſuch undeſerving Parents, and let them live quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under ſo ſmall an annuall tribute for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
Whereas our ſelves (whom wee ſo highly
commend for Chriſtian meekneſſe and charity) can
never forget the Crimes of a few Papiſts, never
give over puniſhing the Children for the faults of
their Fathers. The Chriſtians under the Turke,
cannot certainly be free from ſuſpicion of being
diſaffected to their Magiſtrate, both upon former
practices, and the Principles of their Religion;
yet reſts hee ſatisfied with diſarming them, and
excluding them from all Offices of Truſt, and
Places of Importance, to the intereſt of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Whereas we are ſo far from contenting our
ſelves with ſuch prudentiall cautions for our ſecurity,
that we proceed to ſeize upon the beſt part of their
eſtates, which in a ſhort time muſt of neceſſity
reduce them to abſolute ruine and deſperation:
And yet there is one conſiderable ground of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
altogether unapplyable to the Papiſts of
<hi>England,</hi> which is, that the <hi>Turke</hi> came from a
ſtrange Country, to invade at once both the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
and Religion of the <hi>Grecians;</hi> whereas the
Papiſts are all Natives of this Land, borne with
the ſame title to the Common liberties, that our
ſelves have, and for Religion they onely ſtand pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
in their old way, profeſſing to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unſatisfyed concerning the Reformation wee
hold forth unto them: Nor doe the <hi>Turkes</hi> inſiſt
upon that common Objection, That <hi>Chriſtians</hi> no
where ſuffer <hi>Turkes;</hi> and therefore no reaſon they
ſhould tollerate <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as taſting more of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh
ſpight and revenge, than manly Nobleneſs
and Gallantry: How would theſe unhappy miſled
Soules exceede us Chriſtians in moderation towards
ſuch as are otherwiſe minded, if they had read that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152182:54"/>
Golden Rule of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> that wee ſhould <hi>render
good for evill?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the inhumane practice of the <hi>Turk</hi> in taking
away ſo many Children from the Chriſtian Parents
is extremely cruell and deteſtable, though as Sir
<hi>Henry Blount</hi> (a perſon both compleatly learned,
and perfectly civill,) obſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s in his <hi>Voyage to the
Levant,</hi> when that cuſtome was firſt introduced,
many politick reaſons might be alleged to excuſe
(not juſtly) ſo wicked and tyrannicall an inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if hee could have ſo much as excuſed his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and tyrannical uſurpation; The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> being
then very numerous, and by a barbarous ſtranger
newly deprived of the Dominion of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
All which circumſtances naturally increaſe
and heighten the ſuſpition of an Uſurper, whoſe
ſight was certainly far leſs ſharpe than his Sword, if
hee did not clearly ſee, that his new conquered ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
might perhaps for a time want an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but neither will, reaſon, nor ſtrength to attempt,
by his expulſion, the juſt recovery of their owne
liberties.</p>
               <p>But ſince the affairs of Turky are ſo eſtabliſh'd,
that the <hi>Muſſelman</hi> hath no longer any jealouſy of
the Chriſtians, thoſe unnaturall cruelties of Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Parent of his Child, are altogether laid
aſide, and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> permitted to purchaſe with

enjoyes this comfortable Liberty, as they give
their Children Birth, ſo to guide their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Not one of theſe conſiderations, but argues in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

powers ſhut againſt them, to all advantages in the
Nation; By which means they have neither ſo much
diſobligation to the preſent Government, nor any
poſſibility to worke the leaſt diſturbance of its
Peace.</p>
               <p>And therefore, however upon the firſt <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
it was neceſſary to take a ſharpe and reſolute
courſe for diminution of the Papiſts power, yet ſince
they are reduced to ſo low and weake a condition,
that wee cannot handſomly even feign a danger
from them, it is become now unneceſſary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
(by our owne maximes) unlawfull to
continue the ſame penalties upon them; No other
cauſe being truly ſufficient to juſtify our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others, but a true neceſſity of preſerving our
ſelves.</p>
               <p>And theſe I conceive may by the reaſons, why
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have of late made their addreſſes to the
<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that are appointed by Parliament <hi>for
Regulation of the Laws,</hi> building their hope upon this
ground, that as the cauſes of ſo great ſeverity
againſt them are ceaſed, the ſad and ruinous effects
may no longer be continued; And certainly they
could not have choſen a more proper way to obtaine
reliefe, than the applying of themſelves to that
<hi>Committee,</hi> it being compounded of perſons, whoſe
abilities beare an excellent proportion to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Worke they have undertaken, having in
one halfe yeare ſeen further into the defects of our
Law, and the exceſſes of its practice, than many Ages
formerly have been <hi>able</hi> to diſcover, and whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
is ſo remarkable, that in the ſhort ſpace of
a few Moneths, they have deſign'd a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
of more Errours, than many Ages formerly

Charity hath already provided a favourable courſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152182:55"/>

                              <p>THe Crime imputed to them is onely their

               <p>In ſtead of my opinion concerning theſe foure
Propoſalls of the Papiſts (becauſe to my ſenſe they
carry in themſelves both their owne evidence and
juſtification) I ſhall beg the Readers permiſſion to
ſet down a particular conceit, which I have often
obſerved to be very well reliſht by all that have
examined it. That doubtles there is no way more
ſuitable to the firſt Principles of all Reformed
Churches, no way ſo probable to ſatisfie all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
as not to impoſe any other Obligation for
proof of conformity, than this profeſſion <hi>to believe
the holy Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament to be
the Word of God, and to live according to the Precepts
plainly contained therein;</hi> this acknowledgement to
bee expreſt in generall tearms without deſcending
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152182:63"/>
minutely to particular queſtions, which have certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been the chiefe cauſe of ſo many Controverſies
and Diviſions in the World.</p>
               <p>And now I humbly appeale to the honorable and
religious <hi>Committee for propagation of the Gospell,</hi>
Whether the ſweet Spirit of the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> (who
gave his Apoſtles no further power,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 24.</note> than to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
ſuch as refuſed to heare them) be reconcilable
to the former practices of the high Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or the preſent practices of our Sequeſtrators;
Whether, when the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preſcribes the
<hi>Servants of the Lord to forbear, and in meekneſſe inſtruct
thoſe that are contrary minded,</hi> hee ſhould bee thus
croſ-interpreted, that the Eſtates of thoſe who are
contrary minded, be firſt ſecured or <hi>forborne,</hi> and
then after a time quite taken away, <hi>to inſtruct them in
meekneſſe,</hi> or how to bear patiently the loſſe of the vain
and tranſitory riches of this World.</p>
               <p>And now I humbly appeale to the honorable and
learned <hi>Committee for regulation of the Law,</hi> whether
(ſince all thoſe penalties which the rigorous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of former Ages have, under pretence of zeal,
impoſed upon the Conſcience, are either by diſuſe
forgotten, or by expreſs Act of Parliament revoked)
the Papiſts alone ſhould ſtill be continued under the
ſame ſeverities, nay their burthens encreaſed by the
ſtrange method of the new proceedings towards
them, their Conſciences being now not onely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable
in the Common way of indictment, but
compellable even to accuſe themſelves by the new
Presbyterian Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> againſt the known
Principles of the ancient and reverend Laws of this
Land.</p>
               <p>And now with an humble confidence, I appeale
to the renowned Parliament of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>England,</hi> whether in this generall <hi>Goal-delivery</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:152182:64"/>
of the Conſcience from the tyranny and
oppreſſion of the Prelates, the conſciences of Papiſts
alone, ought ſtill to be kept in priſon? Whether,
when all the fetters, which the Rigid Kirkeſmen
had bought up in <hi>Scotland,</hi> are broken in pieces juſt
as they were locking them faſt about our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
in <hi>England,</hi> the Conſciences of Papiſts alone
ought ſtill to bee continued in chains? Whether,
when all the Societies profeſſing <hi>Christ Ieſus,</hi> and
living obediently to the Magiſtrate, and peaceably
one with another, are protected in the quiet and
unoffenſive exerciſe of their Conſciences, the Papiſts
alone ſhould be forced under the penalty of ſo great
a ruine, not only to profeſſe, but ſwear againſt their
Conſciences? A courſe that in a ſhort time will
unavoidably bring them either to abſolute beggery,
or, which is worſe, to hypocriſie, or, which is worſt of
all to perjury.</p>
               <p>All the people of this Nation look upon you as
their common Father, all promiſe themſelves liberty
and protection under your Government, (though
ſome may juſtly be excluded from ſharing in the
Government.) Were there in my Family one child
that profeſt to finde ſatisfaction in the way of the
Papiſts, and lived dutifully to mee and lovingly
with his Brethren, I ſhould account it a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturalnes
to deprive him altogether of his portion,
much more of that which hee has received from the
bounty of any collaterall Kinſman, or acquired by
his own particular diligence and improvement;
And though ſome Papiſts have heretofore beene
truly chargeable with heinous crmes againſt their
Country, yet why ſhould our Juſtice over-reach to
condemne all, for the offences of a few? If they
have formerly abetted competitors to the Crown,
why ſhould the puniſhments ſo long out-live the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:152182:64"/>
fault? certainly of Offendours being dead, their
treſpaſſes ſhould rather be buried in their Graves,
and not like Ghoſts walk to affright and pinch their
Children.</p>
               <p>It is time wee ſhould now mix a little mercy to
allay the fumes of ſo much juſtice, which otherwiſe
will not aſcend to the Almighty's Throne in the
odour of ſweetneſſe.</p>
