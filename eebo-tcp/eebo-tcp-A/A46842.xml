         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That her Husband and she (with their Family) came lately from</hi> Delft <hi>in</hi> Holland, <hi>where M.</hi> Junius <hi>was then living, and of good repute among the Ministers and best People there.

And his Wife dying there,
<pb facs="tcp:99142:3"/>
some reasons moved him to returne for</hi> Holland. <hi>At his departure, the</hi> Indians <hi>shewed great affection to him, being greatly desirous of his stay: But not prevailing with him, they desired him to promise, either that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe would returne to them, or else that he would instruct one in their Language, and send him over to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to teach them further: This he undertooke. And at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from them, they brought him many Presents; so that hee returned worth the value of about ten thousand pounds. M.</hi> Junius, <hi>since his returne to</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>married againe; and he hath endeavoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct a young man in their Language, to send to them; and hath Printed some Catechismes in that Tongue, to send over unto them: the substance hereof, M.</hi> Cresset <hi>had from his owne mouth, when they were at</hi> Delft.</p>
            <p>This was testified by Mistris <hi>Cresset</hi> to me, in the fifth Moneth, call'd <hi>Iuly,</hi> about the seventh day, 1646.

divers yeares in the <hi>East-Indies</hi>; during which time, he gained so much knowledge in the Language there used, as that he was able to Preach to the Natives.

He hath laboured to teach their Language to some young men; and according to his promise, to send one over to them. And he hath gotten a Catechisme, and some other things, Printed in their Language, to send to them. Thus much I heard from him my selfe.</p>

               <hi>October</hi> 28. 1646. Foure of us, (<hi>saith the Honoured Relator,</hi>) (having sought God) went ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to appointment, to the Wigwam (<hi>or Tent made of Boughs, and Mats,</hi>) of <hi>Waaubon,</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi>-Governour: Where he found many <hi>Indians</hi> gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together from all quarters to learne of us the Knowledge of God.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Waaubon</hi> having yeelded up his eldest Son to be educated by the <hi>English</hi> in the Knowledge of God.)</p>
            <p>The Summe of Christian Religion was declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their owne Tongue; the <hi>Indians</hi> attending di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently; and professing they understood all that was taught them: Of <hi>Sinne,</hi> and <hi>Mercie,</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>(The Sermon was above an houre.) Then we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>Questions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether they all understood?</hi> They answered with multitude of voices, <hi>they all understood, all that was spoken.</hi> Then we desired them, if they would, to propound <hi>Questions</hi> to us. Which they readily did.</p>
            <p>The first Question, <hi>How may we come to know Iesus Christ?</hi> (Some words in the <hi>Answers,</hi> needed the helpe of our <hi>Indian</hi> Interpreter: But a few words from the <hi>Preacher,</hi> were more regarded, then many from him.)</p>
            <p>The second Question was, <hi>Whether God, or Iesus Christ, did understand</hi> Indian <hi>Prayers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Occasion</hi> was this. The partie said, hee was lately praying in his <hi>Wigwam,</hi> that, <hi>God and Iesus Christ, would give him a good heart.</hi> — and his fellow <hi>Indian</hi> interrupted him, and told him, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> had been used to hear <hi>English</hi>-men pray, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood them: but understood not <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:99142:13"/>The third Question by another; <hi>Whether</hi> English-<hi>men were at any time so ignorant of God, and Iesus Christ, as they?</hi> And three Questions more, and we propounded three to them.</p>
            <p>And thus having spent three houres with them, we asking, <hi>If they were not wearie?</hi> they answered, <hi>No.</hi> When we concluded, the Chiefe of them asked, <hi>When we would come againe?</hi> So we appointed the Time.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">II Time.</note>
               <hi>The second time,</hi> was <hi>Novemb.</hi> 11. 1646. at <hi>Waau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons Wigwam</hi> againe; where we found many more <hi>Indians</hi> met, then the formertime: and they had prepared Seats for us. After <hi>Prayer</hi> we asked three Questions of the younger <hi>Indians,</hi> and gave them Answers in the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Our Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions.</note>1 Quest. <hi>Who made you, and all the world?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Quest. <hi>Who doe you looke should save you from Sinne, and Hell?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Quest. <hi>How many Commands hath God given you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Ten.</p>
            <p>In these three, we made them all perfect; encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them to learne, by giving somewhat to each Child, and desiring their <hi>Parents</hi> to teach them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly afterwards.</p>
            <p>Then we <hi>Preached</hi> to them, as formerly; of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> of its <hi>Punishment,</hi> of <hi>Gods now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Salvation to them.</hi> — Hereby some were greatly affected: One wept much.</p>
            <p>After Sermon, wee would have them aske <hi>Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of us.</p>
            <p>

            <p n="2">2. Another asked, <hi>Seeing we all come from one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; how came the</hi> English <hi>to know God, more then we?</hi>

            <p n="3">3. Quest. <hi>How may we come to serve God?</hi> These we <hi>Answered.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Gods anger burnes like fire against all such sinnes; but if he fly to Gods mercie in Christ, and repent, God will forgive, and pittie him.</p>
            <p>Upon this <hi>Answer,</hi>

            <p>One said, <hi>We much thank God for your comming.</hi> We told them, <hi>God is Musquantum</hi> (that is, <hi>very angry</hi>) <hi>for the least sin, in their thoughts, words, or actions.</hi>

               <hi>The third time,</hi>
               <note place="margin">III Time.</note> November 26. 1646. was our third meeting with <hi>Indians,</hi> where they had built more <hi>Wigwams</hi> there.

            </p>
            <p>The same weeke one <hi>Wimpas</hi> a sage <hi>Indian,</hi>

in hearing, came to that Preacher, bringing his Son and three other <hi>Indian</hi> children, desiring they might be brought up with the <hi>English,</hi> to know true God, and not to grow rude, as at home they would. The two young-men offered their service to the <hi>English,</hi> for the like end; All were accepted. These two cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie us, that the old man [<hi>who had asked if such an one could be saved,</hi>] his wife and one of his six Sons, which were <hi>Pawaws [that is, charming Witches,]</hi> God hath convinced of that sinne: and they resolve to heare the Word, and seek to the Devill no more.</p>

               <hi>The fourth time,</hi> was <hi>Decemb.</hi> 4. where another <hi>Pawaw</hi> had some terrour struck into him, upon a <hi>Question</hi> propounded.</p>
            <p>The said two young <hi>Indians,</hi> related, how some become <hi>Pawaws</hi>; and that their imployment is, to cure the sick, by certaine odd gestures, and beatings of themselves: and blowing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath moved the <hi>English</hi> in their <hi>Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Court</hi> to purchase so much Land for the <hi>Indians,</hi> as to build them a Town neer the <hi>English,</hi> for their help, calling it <hi>Noonatomen,</hi> that is, <hi>Rejocying.</hi> This pleased the <hi>Indians</hi> greatly: who about that time, made these Lawes.</p>
