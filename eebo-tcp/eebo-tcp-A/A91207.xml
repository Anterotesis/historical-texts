         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This force mentioned in all theſe 5.

That force was only by a few unarmed tumultuous <hi>London</hi> Apprentices, who had neither Sword, nor Muſquet, nor Pike, nor Stick in their hands; This upon the ſecluded Members, was by whole Regiments, Troops, Companies of Horſe and Foot, armed with Swords, Muſquets, Pikes, Piſtols. 2. That force was upon this account; only to preſſe the Houſes to repeal an <hi>Ordinance</hi> ſurreptitiouſly procured to <hi>ſettle the Militia of London,</hi> without their privities, to the diſſervice of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Parliament, paſſed but 3. daies before: Theirs to prevent a <hi>ſettlement</hi> of the Peace of the Kingdom, upon our vote touching the Kings Anſwer to the Propoſitions of both Houſes, for the publick Peace, Safety, and honour of the Parliament, and three Kingdoms. 3. Their tumult and force laſted but a few houres, and part of one day, and then vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: That ſecluding and ſecuring the Members, continued ſundry years, and ever ſince the Junctoes two laſt ſittings till this preſent. 4. That force neither ſecluded, nor ſecured, not drove away any one Member from the Houſes during its continuance, but only kept them tumultuouſly in the Houſe till the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 23 was repealed by them, and then vaniſhed: This was purpoſely imployed to ſecure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 40. and ſeclude the Majority of the Members of the Commons Houſe, and whole Houſe of Peers by violence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Privileges, Truſts, and our Laws; and is ſtill continued for that end. 5. That force cauſed ſome few eminent Members, only to abſent themſelves from the Houſes, and repair to the Army, 3. or 4. daies after the force was ended, upon the Armies invitation, being the far leſſer part of both Houſes; This force ſecured, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118614:15"/>
and actually kept out and drove away 5. parts of 6. from the Houſe, and that by practice and combination of ſome Members of the Houſe, to ſeclude the reſt, leſt they ſhould over-vote them; and ſince by their expreſſe Orders and Commands, kept out by armed guards for that end. 6. This force was by ſuch who were never raiſed, commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, waged to preſerve the Houſes and Members from violence, that they might freely ſit and vote without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance. This by Souldiers, ſpecially raiſed, commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, intruſted, paid to defend their perſons and Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, freely to ſit and vote without interruption or ſecluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 7. That force was condemned, diſowned, by all the Members of both Houſes, as well thoſe who remained ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or thoſe who abſented themſelves. This juſtified, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, commanded even by thoſe now ſitting, though they condemned it as <hi>Treaſonable and Criminal,</hi> in theſe Apprentices, and in <hi>Cromwel, Lambert,</hi> and other Army-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſince, in their own caſes. 8. This inconſiderable force, <hi>nulled and made void all Votes, Acts, Ordinances paſſed</hi> not only during the continuance of this horrid actual, viſible force upon the Houſes on <hi>July</hi> 26. but likewiſe from that day till the 6. of <hi>Aug.</hi> only becauſe thoſe few Members (invited to the Army) <hi>were forced,</hi> as they affirmed, <hi>to abſent themſelves from the ſervice of the Parliament, and could not return to ſit in ſafety before that day,</hi> though there was neither force nor guards during that ſpace upon either Houſe to deter or drive them thence.

            <p>If any Object, That true it is, the Parliament by the common Law and Cuſtom of the Realm determines by the Kings death; but by the Statute of 17 <hi>Caroli, c.</hi> 6. which <note place="margin">Object.</note> enacts, <hi>That this preſent Parliament now aſsembled ſhall not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved unleſſe it be by Act of Parliament to be paſsed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;</hi> continues the Parliament ſtill in being, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings beheading, ſince no Act of Parliament is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for its diſſolution.

Now the intent of the Makers of this Act, and the end of enacting it, was not to prevent the diſſolution of this Parliament by the Kings death, (no wayes intimated nor inſinuated in any clauſe thereof, being a clear unavoidable diſſolution of it to all intents, not provided for by this Law) but by any Writ or Proclamation of the King, by his Regal power, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of both Houſes; which I ſhall manifeſt by theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, From the principal occaſion of making this Act. The King (as the COMMONS in their <note n="*" place="margin">Exact Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, p. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>Remonſtrance of the ſtate of the Kingdom,</hi> 15 <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1641 complain) had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved all former Parliaments during his Reign, without and againſt both Houſes approbation, to their great diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and the Kingdoms prejudice, as his Father <hi>King James</hi> had diſſolved others in his Reign: and during their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance adjourned and prorogued them at their pleaſure. Now the fear of preventing of the like diſſolution, proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118614:17"/>
or adjournment of this Parliament after the Scotiſh Armies disbanding, before the things mentioned in the Preamble were effected by the Kings abſolute power, was the only ground and occaſion of this Law (not any fear or thoughts of its diſſolution by the Kings untimely death, then not ſo much as imagined, being before the Wars or Iriſh Rebellion brake forth) the King very healthy, not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and likely then to ſurvive this Parliament, and many others, in both Houſes judgement, as appears by the Bill for triennial Parliaments. This undenyable Truth is expreſly declared by the Commons themſelves in their foreſaid <hi>Remonſtrance; Exact Collection,</hi> p. 5, 6, 14, 17. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together; where in direct terms they affirm, <hi>The abrupt diſſolution of this Parliament is prevented</hi> by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bill, by which it is provided, it ſhall not be diſſolved or adjourned without the conſent of both Houſes: <hi>In the Bill for continuance of this preſent Parliament,</hi> there ſeems <hi>to be ſome reſtraint of the Royal power in diſſolving of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; not to take it out of the Crown, but to ſuſpend the execution of it for this time and occaſion only;</hi> which was ſo neceſſarie for <hi>the Kings own ſecurity,</hi> and the <hi>publick peace, that without it we could not have undertaken any of theſe great charges, but must have left both the Armies to diſorder and confuſion, and the whole Kingdom to blood and rapine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which paſſages we have a clear reſolution of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons themſelves, immediately after the paſſing of this Act: that its ſcope and intention, was only to provide againſt the Kings <hi>abrupt diſſolution of the Parliament by his mere royal power, in ſuſpending the execution of it for this time and occaſion only,</hi> and that <hi>for the Kings own ſecurity,</hi> (not his Heirs and Succeſſors) <hi>as well as his peoples peace and ſafety.</hi> Therefore not againſt any diſſolution of it by his natural (much leſſe his violent) death; which can no waies be interpreted, <hi>an Act of his Royal power,</hi> (which they then intended hereby, <hi>not to take out of the Crown, but only to ſuſpend the execution of it for this time and occaſion, and that for his ſecurity:)</hi> but a <hi>natural impotency,</hi> or <hi>unnatural diſloyalty,</hi> which not only ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the Kings power for a time, but utterly deſtroys and takes away him and it without hopes of revival for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the very title of this Act <hi>(An Act to prevent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118614:17"/>
which may happen by the</hi> UNTIMELY <hi>adjourning, proroguing or</hi> DISSOLUTION <hi>of this preſent Parliament)</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates as much, compared with the body of it, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, as well <hi>againſt the adjourning and proroguing of both or either Houſes without an Act of Parliament,</hi> as againſt the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Parliament without an Act.</hi> Now the <hi>Parliament</hi> cannot poſſibly be ſaid to be <hi>adjourned</hi> or <hi>prorogued</hi> in any way or ſenſe, much leſſe <hi>untimely,</hi> merely by the Kings death, (which never <hi>adjourned or prorogued any Parliament)</hi> but only by his Proclamation, writ, or royal command, to the Houſes or their Speakers, executed during his life, as all our Journals, <note n="¶" place="margin"> 61. 3 Parl. 2.

And therefore this title and Act coupling adjourning proroguing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving this Parliament together, without conſent of both Houſes, by Act of Parliament, intended only a Diſſolution of this Parliament by ſuch Prerogative waies and means by which Parliaments had been untimely adjourned and prorogued as well as diſſolved by the Kings mere will without their aſſents; not of a diſſolution of it by the Kings death, which never adjourned nor prorogued anie Parliament, nor diſſolved any formerly ſitting Parliament in this Kings reign, or his Anceſtors ſince the death of King <hi>Hen:</hi> the 4th. and King <hi>James,</hi> the only Parliaments we read of diſſolved by death of the King ſince the Conqueſt; and ſo a miſchief not intended nor remedied by this Act.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The prologue of the Act implies as much; <hi>Whereas great ſums of mony must of neceſſity be</hi> ſpeedilie <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and procured for the relief of his Majeſties Army</hi> and <hi>People</hi> (not his Heirs or Succeſſors) <hi>in the Northern parts,</hi> &amp;c. And for ſupplie of other <hi>his Majeſties preſent</hi> and <hi>urgent occaſions</hi> (not his Heirs or Succeſſors future occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) <hi>which cannot be ſo timely effected as is requiſite, without credit for raiſing the ſaid monies; which credit cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, untill ſuch obſtacles be firſt removed, which are occaſioned by Fears, Iealouſies and Apprehenſions of divers of his Majeſties Royal Subjects, that the Parliament may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed, prorogued or diſſolved</hi> (not by the Kings ſodain
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118614:18"/>
or untimelie death, of which there was then no fear, jealouſie or apprehenſion in any his Majeſties loyal Subjects, but by his royal Prerogative and advice of ill Counſellors) <hi>before Juſtice ſhall be duly executed upon Delinquents,</hi> (then in being, not ſprung up ſince) <hi>publique Grievances</hi> (then complained of, not others introduced ſince this Act,) <hi>redreſſed; a firm peace betwixt the two Kingdoms of England and Scotland con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and before ſufficient proviſions be made for the repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> the ſaid Monies (not others ſince borrowed) <hi>ſo to be raiſed: All which the Commons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled having duly conſidered, do therefore humbly beſeech your Majeſtie, that it may be declared and enacted, &amp;c.</hi> All which expreſſions, related TO HIS late <hi>Majeſtie</hi> onlie, not to his Heirs and Succeſſors; and the principal ſcope of this Act, being to gain preſent credit to raiſe monies to disband the Scotiſh and Engliſh armies then lying upon the Kingdom, manie years ſince accompliſhed; yea Juſtice being ſince executed upon <hi>Strafford, Canterbury,</hi> and other Delinquents then impeached; the publick Grievances they complained of (as the Star-Chamber, High-Commiſſion, Ship-mony, Tonnage and Poundage, Fines for Knighthood, Biſhops Votes in Parliament, with their Courts and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions, and the like) redreſſed by Acts ſoon after paſſed, &amp; a firm peace between both Nations concluded before the Wars began; and this preamble's pretenſions for this Act all fullie ſatisfied divers years before the Kings beheading: it muſt of neceſſity be granted, that this Statute never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to continue this Parliament on foot after the Kings deceaſe: eſpecially after the ends for which it was made were all fully accompliſhed: and ſo it muſt neceſſarily be diſſolved by his Death.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This is moſt clear by the body of the Act it ſelf: <hi>And be it declared and enacted by the King our Soveraign Lord,</hi> with the aſſent of the <hi>Lords and Commons</hi> in this <hi>preſent Parliament aſſembled,</hi> and by the authority of the ſame, That <hi>this preſent Parliament,</hi> now <hi>aſſembled,</hi> ſhall not be <hi>diſſolved,</hi> unleſſe it be by <hi>Act of Parliament to be paſſed for that purpoſe;</hi> nor ſhall any time or times <hi>during the continuance thereof, be prorogued or adjourned,</hi> unleſs
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118614:18"/>
it be <hi>by Act of Parliament,</hi> to be likewiſe <hi>paſſed for that purpoſe.</hi> And that <hi>the Houſe of Peers</hi> ſhall not at any time or times <hi>during this preſent Parliament be adjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> unleſſe it be <hi>by Themſelves;</hi> or <hi>by their own order.</hi> And in like manner that <hi>the Houfe of Commons</hi> ſhall not at any time or times <hi>during this preſent Parliament</hi> be adjourned, unleſſe it be <hi>by Themſelves;</hi> or <hi>by their own order.</hi> Whence it is undeniable, 1. That this act was only for the prevention of the <hi>untimely diſſolving, Proroguing and adjourning of that preſent Parliament then aſſembled,</hi> and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 2. That the King himſelf was the <hi>Principal Member of his Parliament,</hi> yea, our <hi>Soveraign Lord,</hi> and the <hi>ſole decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and enacter of this Law, by the Lords and Commons aſsent.</hi> 3. That neither this Act for continuing, nor any other for <hi>diſsolving, adjourning or proroguing this Parliament, could be made</hi> without, but only by and <hi>with the Kings Royal aſſent thereto;</hi> which the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> aſſembled <hi>in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in their <note n="*" place="margin">Exact Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. p. 69, 70, 736, 709, 722.</note>

That it was neither the Kings intention in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this Act <hi>to ſhut himſelf out of Parliament, or create both or either Houſe a Parliament without a King,</hi> as he profeſſed in his <gap reason="foreign">

Nor the Lords nor Commons Intendment to <hi>diſmember</hi> him from his Parliament, or make themſelves a Parliament without him; as their foreſaid <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance</hi> teſtifies, and the words of the Act import: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it the Kings, Lords or Commons meaning by this Act, to ſet up a Parliament only of Commons (much leſſe of a remnant of a Commons Houſe ſelected by <hi>Colonel Pride,</hi> and his Confederates of the Army to ſerve their turns, and vote what they preſcribed) without either King or Houſe of Peers; much leſſe to give them any ſuper-tranſcendent authority to vote down and aboliſh the King and Houſe of Lords, and make them no Members of this preſent or any future Parliaments, without their own order or aſſent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which ſo great uſurpation, and late dangerous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parliamentary encroachments this very Act expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides in this clauſe, <hi>That the Houſe of Peers</hi> (wherein the King ſits as <hi>Soveraign</hi> when he pleaſeth,) <hi>ſhall not at any time

That neither the King, Lords nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons intended to ſet up a perpetual Parliament, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail it upon them, their heirs or ſucceſſors for ever, by this act, which would croſs and repeal the Act for <hi>triennial Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> made at the ſame time, and on <hi>the ſame</hi>

               <hi>day in Law;</hi> but to make proviſion only againſt the untimely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of this, till the things mentioned in the Preamble were accompliſhed and ſetled; as the <hi>Preamble,</hi> and theſe oft repeated words, <hi>any time or times during the continuance of this preſent Parliament,</hi> concludes; and that during His Majeſties reign and life, not after his <hi>death;</hi> as theſe words, coupled with <hi>The Relief of his Majeſties Army and People; and for ſupply of his Majeſties preſent and urgent occaſions</hi> in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble,</hi> manifeſt. Therefore, this Act can no waies continue it a Parliament after the Kings beheading; much leſſe after the forcible excluſion both of the King and Lords Houſe, and majority of the Commons out of Parliament by thoſe now ſitting, contrary to the very letter and proviſion of this act; by which device the King alone, had he conquered and cut off, or ſecluded by his forces the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> Houſes from ſitting, might with much more colour have made himſelf an abſolute Parliament, to impoſe what Taxes and Laws he pleaſed, on the people; without Lords or Commons, or any 40. of the Commons Houſe, or any 7. or 8. Lords concurring with him, ſecluding all the reſt by armed power, make themſelves an abſolute ſtanding Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, for him, his heirs and ſucceſſors, by vertue of this act, than thoſe few Commons ſitting ſince his tryal &amp; death do, or can do. 6.

or diſſolving of <hi>this preſent Parliament, contrary to this preſent Act, ſhall be utterly void and of none effect.</hi> Now death, and a diſſolution of this Parliament by the Kings death, cannot (as to the King) be properly ſtiled, a <hi>Thing done, or to be done</hi> (by Him) for the adjournment, proroguing or diſſolving of this Parliament, <hi>contrary to this preſent Act;</hi> which cannot make the <hi>Kings death utterly void and of none effect,</hi> by reſtoring him to his life again. Therefore the diſſolution of the Parl. by the Kings death, is cleerly out of the words and intentions of this Act, eſpecially ſo many years after its Enacting. 7. This preſent Parl. &amp; every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof, being ſpecially ſummoned by the Kings <hi>Writ,</hi> by the particular name of <hi>CAROL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S REX,</hi> not <hi>REX</hi> in general, only to be <hi>His Parliament and Council, and to confer perſonally with Him, of the great and urgent affairs concerning Him</hi> and <hi>His Kingdom,</hi> not his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors;</hi> and theſe Writs, and the Elections upon them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>His Court</hi> by Indentures, and the perſons ſummoned and choſen by vertue of them, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only in <hi>His</hi> Parliament, for no other ends but thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in <hi>His Writs;</hi> it would be both an abſurdity and abſolute impoſſibility to aſſert, that the King, or both Houſes, intended by this Act, to continue this Parliament in being after the Kings beheading or death: unleſſe they that maintain this paradox, be able to inform me and thoſe now ſitting, how they can confer and advice with a <hi>dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed King,</hi> of <hi>things</hi> concerning <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>His</hi> Kingdom; and that even after they have abjured his Heirs and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and Royal line, and extirpated <hi>Monarchy</hi> it ſelf, and made it <hi>Treaſon</hi> to aſſert or revive it; and how they can continue ſtill <hi>His Parliament and Council,</hi> whoſe head they have cut off; and that without reviving or raiſing him from his grave, or enſtalling <hi>His right Heir and Succeſſor in His Throne,</hi> to repreſent His Perſon; neither of which they dare to do, for fear of loſing their own <hi>Heads and Quarters</hi> too, for beheading him. This Tax therefore being impoſed on the Kingdom long after the Kings beheading, and the Parliaments actual and legal diſſolution by it, muſt needs be illegal, and meerly void in Law to all intents; becauſe

Now it is evident to me, that there is no neceſſity of keeping up this Army for the Kingdoms common Good, but rather a neceſſity of disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or the greateſt part of it, for theſe reaſons: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole Kingdom with <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally exhauſted by the late 18. years Wars, Plunders and heavy Taxes; there being more monies levyed on it by both ſides, during theſe 18. laſt years, than in all the Kings Reigns ſince the Conqueſt, as will appear upon a juſt computation: all Counties being thereby utterly unable to pay it. 2. In regard of the great decay of Trade, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary dearth of cattel, corn, and proviſions of all ſorts; the charge of relieving a multitude of poor people, who ſtarve with famine in many places, the richer ſort (eaten out by Taxes and Free-quarter) being utterly unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. To which I might adde, the multitude of maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souldiers, with the widows and children of thoſe who have loſt their lives in the Wars, which is very coſtly. 3. The heavie Contributions to ſupport the Army, which deſtroy all Trade, by fore-ſtalling, engroſſing moſt of the Monies of the Kingdoms, and enhancing their prices, keeping many thouſands of able men and horſes idle, only like moths, and locuſts to conſume other labouring mens proviſions, eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, and the publick Treaſure of the Kingdoms, when as their employment in their Trades and Callings, might much advance trading, and enrich the Kingdoms. 4. There is now no viſible Enemy in the field or elſewhere, and the fitting Members boaſt there is no fear from any abroad, their Navie being ſo Victorious. And why ſuch a vaſt Army ſhould be ſtill continued in the Kingdom to increaſe its

When the King had two great Armies in the Field, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Garriſons in the Kingdom, this whole Army by its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Eſtabliſhment, conſiſted but of twenty two thouſand Horſe, Dragoons and Foot, and had an Eſtabliſhment only of about Fortie five thouſand pounds a month for their pay, which both Houſes then thought ſufficient, as is evident by their <note n="o" place="margin">A Collect. &amp;c. p. 599, 876.</note> Ordinances of <hi>Febr.</hi> 15. 1644. and <hi>April</hi> 4 1646. And when the Army was much increaſed without their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſixty thouſand pounds a month was thought abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficient by the Officers and Army themſelves, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and reduce all ſuper-numeraries, maintain the Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed Army and Garriſons, and eaſe the Country of all Free-quarter; which Tax hath been conſtantly pain in all Counties. Why then this Tax to the Army ſhould now be raiſed above the firſt Eſtabliſhment, when reduced to twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand, whereof ſundry Regiments are deſigned for <hi>Ireland,</hi> (for which there is thirty thouſand pounds a month now enacted, beſide the ſixty for the Army) and this for the common good of the Realm, and that the Taxes ſince ſhould be mounted to 120. thouſand pounds each <hi>month</hi> and now again to one hundred thouſand pounds for thoſe 6. months, for which they have paid in 35. thouſand pounds, 9. months ſince before hand; only to murther our <hi>Protestant</hi> Brethren, and <hi>Allies</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> deſtroy and oppreſſe each other, and keep up an <hi>Anti-Parliamentary Conventicle</hi> of <hi>Tyrants</hi> and <hi>

Therefore there is no neceſſity to keep up this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or impoſe any new Tax for their maintenance, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying rheir pretended Arrears: which I dare aver, the Free-quarter they have formerly taken in kinde, and levied in money, if brought to a juſt account, as it ought, will double, if not treble moſt of their antient Arrears, and make them much indebted to the Country. And no reaſon they ſhould have full pay and Free-quarter too, and the Country bear the burthen of both, without full allowance of all the Quarters levied or taken on them againſt Law, out of their pretended Arrears.</p>
            <p>And if any of the ſitting <hi>Tax-Makers</hi> here object, That <note place="margin">Objct.</note> they dare not truſt the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Cities and Counties of the Realm with their own or the Kingdoms defence: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a neceſſity for them to keep up the Army, to prevent all dangers from abroad, and Inſurrections at home.</p>

After ſome expoſtulations, he promiſed to make them examples, and caſhier them; and to remove them forthwith from my houſe: but the only right I had, was, that more of his Company repaired thither, making all the ſpoil they could, and taking away ſome Braſſe and Pewter, continued there till near four of the clock; and then marched away only out of fear I would raiſe the Country upon them; many of whom profered me their aſſiſtance: but I deſired them to forbear till I ſaw what their Officers would do; who inſtead of puniſhing any of them, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to play the like <hi>Rex</hi> almoſt in other places where they quartered ſince, marching but three or four miles a day, and extorting what monies they could from the Country by their violence and diſorders.

In few words; As long as we keep an Army on foot, we muſt never expect to be exempted from Free-quarter or Wars; or to enjoy any peace or ſettlement: and as long as we will ſubmit to pay contributions to ſupport an Army, we ſhall be certain our new Lords and Governors will continue an Army to over-awe and enſlave us to their wils.

reſoved to pull it up by the roots</hi> as ſuch, then it neceſſarily folows, Firſt, That they are much more ſo after the Kings death, and their ſuppreſſion of the Lords Houſe, and purging of the Commons Houſe to the very dregs, in the opinions and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of thoſe now ſitting, and all other rational men. And no wayes enabled by Law to impoſe this or any other new <hi>Tax</hi> or <hi>Acts</hi> upon the Kingdom, or to create any new <hi>Treaſons, Confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Sequeſtrations</hi> and <hi>Penalties;</hi> and being themſelves in truth the worſt and greateſt of all Traytors and Tyrants. Secondly, that theſe grand Saints of the <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>Steerſmen</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Parliament,</hi> and all Gown-men confederating with them, knowingly ſit, vote and act there againſt their own judgments and conſciences, for their own private, pernicious ends. Thirdly- that it is a baſeneſs, cowardize, and degeneracy beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, for any of their <hi>fellow-members</hi> now acting, to ſuffer theſe <hi>Grandees</hi> in their <hi>Aſſembly</hi> and <hi>Army,</hi> to ſit or vote toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, or to enjoy any Office or command in the <hi>Army</hi> under them, or to impoſe any <hi>Tax</hi> upon the people to maintain ſuch Officers, Members, Souldiers, who have thus vilified, affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their pretended <hi>Parliamentary Authority,</hi> and thereby induced others to contemn and queſtion it: and forcibly excluded and impriſoned the greateſt part of the Members and whole Houſe of Peers, in order to their own future excluſion, and as great a baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them and others for to pay it upon any terms.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Secondly he there affirms, that <note n="d" place="margin">P. 26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Oliver Crumwel</hi> by the help of the <hi>Army,</hi> at their firſt <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt the Parliament, was no ſooner up, but like a perfidious, <hi>baſe, unworthy man,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Houſe of Peers were his onely white boys,</hi> and who but <hi>Oliver</hi> (who before to me had called them in effect, both <hi>Tyrants</hi> and <hi>Uſurpers)</hi> became their <hi>Proctor,</hi> where ever he came; yea and ſet his ſon <hi>Ireton</hi> at work for them alſo; inſomuch that at ſome meetings, with ſome of my friends at the Lord <hi>Whartons</hi> Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, he clapt his hand upon his breaſt, and to this purpoſe, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in the ſight of God upon his conſcience,</hi> THAT THE LORDS HAD AS TRUE A RIGHT TO THEIR LEGISLATIVE <note place="margin">Note.</note> and JURISDICTIVE POWER OVER THE COMMONS, AS HE HAD TO THE COAT UPON HIS BACK, and he would procure a friend, <hi>viz.</hi> Maſter <hi>Nathaniel Fiennes</hi> ſhould argue and plead their juſt right with any friend I had in <hi>England.</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:118614:41"/>
And not onely ſo, but did he not get the <hi>General and Councel of War at Windſor</hi> (about the time that the Votes of no more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes were to paſs) to make a <hi>Declaration</hi> to the whole world, declaring THE LEGAL RIGHT OF THE LORDS HOUSE, and THEIR FIXED RESOLUTION TO MAINTAIN and UPHOLD IT? which was ſent by the <hi>General</hi> to the <hi>Lords</hi> by Sir <hi>Hardreſſe Waller:</hi> and to indear himſelf the more unto the Lords, in whoſe houſe without all doubt he intended to have ſate himſelf, he required me evil for good; and became my enemy to keep me in Priſon, out of which I muſt not ſtirre, unleſs I would ſloop and acknowledge, the Lords juriſdiction over Commoners; and for that end he ſets his agents and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments at work to get me to do it: yet now they themſelves have ſuppreſſed them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whence it is moſt apparent. 1. That the <hi>General, Lieutenant General Cromwel,</hi> Col. <hi>Ireton, Hariſon,</hi> and other Officers of the Army now ſitting as Members, and over-ruling all the reſt, <note n="*" place="margin">See my Plea for the Lords and Houſe of Peers, (yea &amp; all other Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Members, ſitting with them.</note> have wittingly acted againſt their own knowledges, Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Judgments, Conſciences, in ſuppreſſing the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> and depriving them of their <hi>Legiſlative</hi> and <hi>Juriſdictive</hi> Right and power, by preſuming to make Acts, paſs ſentences, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Taxes without them, or their aſſents in Parliament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expreſs Acts of 16 &amp; 17 <hi>Caroli. c.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 12, 14, 20. and hundreds of Ordinances, Remonſtrances, Declarations, the Proteſtation, Vow and Solemn League and Covenant made this Parliament, by the Votes of moſt now ſitting. 2. That this Tax enforced upon the Commons and Kingdom, for their own particular advantage, pay and enrichment, and to ſuppreſs the Houſe of Lords, is in their own judgments and conſcience, both unjuſt and directly contrary to the Laws of the Realm, being not aſſented to by the <hi>Lords:</hi> and therefore to be unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly and ſtrenuouſly oppoſed by all the Lords and other <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen</hi> who love their own or Countries Liberties, or have any <hi>Nobility,</hi> or <hi>Generoſity</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Thirdly, he <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 34. 39, 40. 56, 47.</note> there aſſerts in poſitive terms in his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and his confederates; That the purged Parliament now ſitting, is but a <hi>pretended Parliament, a mock-Parliament;</hi> yea, <hi>and in plaine Engliſh,</hi> NO PARLIAMENT AT ALL, <hi>but the ſhadow of a Parliament.</hi> That thoſe Company of

            </p>
            <p>If then their principal admirers, who confederated with the Army, and thoſe now ſitting, in all their late proceedings; and cryed them up moſt of any, as the <hi>Parliament and Supreme Authority of England</hi> before, at, and ſince the late force upon the Houſe, and its violent purgation, do thus in print profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſclaim them, for being any real <hi>Parliament,</hi> or Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> to make <hi>Acts</hi> or impoſe <hi>Taxes</hi> upon the people: or ſet up High Courts of Juſtice to try and condemn the <hi>King,</hi> or any Peers or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Preemen; the ſecluded <hi>Lord; Members,

Presbyterians, Royaliſts,</hi> and all others, have much more cauſe and ground to diſavow and oppoſe their uſurped Parliamentary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and illegal Taxes, Acts, as not made by any true <hi>Engliſh Parliament,</hi> but a <hi>Mock-Parliament</hi> only.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He therein further avets: <note n="f" place="margin">Pag. 52. 53. 56. 57. 58. 59.</note> 
               <q>
                  <hi>That the death of the King, in Law indiſputably diſſolves this Parliament,</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>though it had been all the time before never ſo intire and unqueſtionable to that very hour.</hi> That no Neceſſity can be pretended for the continuance of it; the rather, becauſe the men that would have it continue ſo long as they pleaſe, are thoſe who <hi>have created theſe neceſſities on purpoſe, that by the colour thereof they may make themſelves great and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi> That the main end wherfore the Members of the Commons houſe were choſen and ſent thither, was, <hi>To treat and confer with King</hi> Charles <hi>and the Houſe of Peers, about the great Affairs of the Nation, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore are but a <hi>third part,</hi> ot <hi>third eſtate of that Parliament,</hi> to which they were to come and joyn with, and who were legally to make permanent and binding Laws for the people of the Nation. And therefore <hi>having taken away two of the three Eſtates that they were choſen on purpoſe to joyn with to make Laws,</hi> the end both in reaſon and law of the peoples truſt, is ceaſed: for a <hi>Minor</hi> joyned with a <hi>Major</hi> for one and the ſame end, cannot play <hi>Lord paramount</hi> over the <hi>Major,</hi> and then do what it pleaſe; no more can the <hi>Minor</hi> of a <hi>Major; viz. one Eſtate of three, legally or juſtly deſtroy two of three,</hi> without <hi>their own aſſent,</hi> &amp;c. That the Houſe of Commons ſitting freely within its limited time, in all its ſplendor of glory, without the awe of armed men, <hi>neither in Law, nor in the intention of their Chooſers, were a Parliament;</hi> and therefore of themſelves alone have no pretence in Law to <hi>alter the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Parliaments,</hi> &amp;c. concluding thus: <hi>For ſhame</hi> let no man be ſo <hi>audaciouſly</hi> or <hi>ſottiſhly</hi> voyd of Reaſon, as to call <hi>Tho.

the People, much leſs A PARLIAMENT, what pretence of <hi>Law, Reaſon, Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Nature can there be for you to alter the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Parliaments,</hi> and force upon the people, the <hi>ſhew of their own Wills,</hi> luſts <hi>and pleaſures for laws</hi> and <hi>Rules of Government,</hi> made by a PRETENDED EVERLASTING, NUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LED PARLIAMENT, a Councel of <hi>State,</hi> or <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> and <hi>a Councel of War,</hi> or rather by <hi>Fairfax, Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Ireton?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now; if their own late confederates and creatures argue thus in print againſt their being and continuing a Parliament, their Juriſdiction, Proceedings, Taxes, and arbitrary pleaſures, ſhould not all others much more do it, and joyntly and magnanimouſly oppoſe them to the utmoſt, upon the ſelf-ſame grounds, for their own and the publick eaſe, Liberty, Safety Settlement, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Rights, Priviledges, Freedome, Splendor of our true Engliſh Parliaments?</p>

               <q>Fifthly, He there likewiſe affirms, <note n="g" place="margin">P. 53. 54. 59. 41.</note> that thoſe now fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> have perverted the ends of their truſts more then ever <hi>Strafford</hi> did: 1.
