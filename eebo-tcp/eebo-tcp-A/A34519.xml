            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF THE
RESOLUTOIN
OF THE
States Provincial
OF
FREEZLAND,
Relating to the LEVYES under Debate in the
States General, Fryday the 15./25. Feb. 1684.</head>
            <p>THE States of <hi>Freezeland</hi> having ſeen and examined two
Meſſages from <hi>H. H. M.</hi> dated <hi>February</hi> 1684. tending
to the end that <hi>H. E. M.</hi> with the firſt, would bring in
their Conſent for Levying 16000 Men, upon which,
this Government, upon a ſerious Conſideration, and full Agreement
of all parties, concluded to bring in their Advice, That <hi>H. E. M.</hi>
cannot underſtand of what Neceſſity or Advantage it will be to agree
to the ſaid Leveys; but that it ought to be rather apprehended and
lookt upon, as that which will tend to a ruining deſtructive War: To
carry on which, this Province do look upon themſelves unable to
bear their part, by reaſon of their being ſo much in Arrear already;
As alſo by reaſon of the <hi>Low Prices</hi> of their Corn, Fat Cattle, and their
Eſtates; as alſo other Inconveniences that attend them; but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
conſidering that the States are deſtitute of all <hi>Alleys,</hi> from whence
they may certainly expect any aſſiſtance; and therefore it muſt be
lookt upon as a Matter of ſo much the more Danger; for that in the
former War they received ſeveral aſſiſtances from others, and yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
no Remarkable advantages againſt <hi>France:</hi> Beſides which, it
ought to be conſidered, That the Forces which are to be raiſed, will
not be ſo eaſie to be attained, but if raiſed not of ſufficient ſtrength,
to obtain a better Peace from the K. of <hi>France,</hi> then he himſelf hath
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107470:2"/>
offered. As alſo it is conſidered and apprehended, and not without
great reaſon, the unexpreſſable Diſaſters which may befall this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
in particular, from the <hi>French</hi> Confederates, as being deprived
of all the Forces of this City for their defence, which will be little
enough to oppoſe the <hi>French</hi> Force in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> where the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
ſhew ſo little Zeal in their Conduct, and do hardly put any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in execution with earneſtneſs, except ſuch as may ſerve to ingage
this State in a War, and have hardly one ſhare of thoſe Troops ready
which they ought to have, before this State was obliged to ſend them
any aſſiſtance; much leſs to think of a Rupture for their ſakes, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Notorious, That none of thoſe <hi>Alternatives</hi> are ſo conſiderable as
to equalize the greatneſs of the Danger to which this State muſt not
only expoſe themſelves, but all the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> by a War;
and not only <hi>England</hi> but the Emperour, have already declared their
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>atisfaction, as alſo very unacceptable to this State, That His <hi>Catholick</hi>
Majeſty ſhould publiſh a Declaration of War, without accquainting
His <hi>Alleys</hi> therewith.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> hath alſo already declared, That it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to accept of thoſe <hi>Alternatives,</hi> as ſo ſuddenly to engage in ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
a VVar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Adding withal, That he is not obliged in ſuch Caſe to
aſſiſt either Us or <hi>Spain.</hi> For all which reaſons, VVe think it beſt to
deſiſt from thoſe <hi>Leveys,</hi> and to let the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſee by that, that this
State cannot think it good, That for preſervation of a little, for which
they take ſo little care of the whole, to expoſe themſelves to ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Dangers; and therefore they do give their Advice, That they
be earneſtly preſſed to accept of one of the <hi>Alternatives,</hi> and that ſuch
Methods be uſed with all ſpeed; with Conferences and Treatys, as may
tend to the ſecuring of this State in a deſired Peace, and that the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reir</hi>
may remain without danger. The States of this Province do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
That if a Peace cannot be obtained, that then a Truce for
20 years is more to be deſired, then a VVar in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands;</hi>
eſpecially conſidering, that in proceſs of time, the Emperour may be
freed from his <hi>Turkiſh</hi> VVar, and the K. of <hi>England</hi> from his National
Troubles, and ſo in a better Capacity to ſecure the Peace. <hi>Thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
