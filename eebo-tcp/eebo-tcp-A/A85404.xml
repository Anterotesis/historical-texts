         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> main was this:
The Architects of the deſigne, preſent Mr. <hi>Downham</hi> with their papers,
wherein they had collected and put down in writing onely ſome of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
and moſt abſurd opinions, which are now extant in their Teſtimony, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
his hand by way of concurrence with them, as intending to teſtifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them publickly. In this draught which they brought to him, and
whereunto they deſired and obtained his hand and ſubſcription, there was not
the leaſt mention or word of any error of mine, or of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hamonds.</hi> From
whence (by the way) it is obſervable, how with as little <hi>truth,</hi> as common
ſenſe, or good Engliſh (of which afterwards) this young peece of preſumption
writes thus, pag. 41. <hi>In which paſſage you bring in, AND THAT
TRULY, the whole number of 52. as teſtifying againſt you, &amp;c.</hi>
In which words (though not many, as you ſee, in number) there are two
contraries (at leaſt) unto truth. Firſt, that in that <hi>paſſage,</hi> wherein I went
about to make <hi>Teſtardus my Patron</hi> (a paſſage no where to be found in my
book) <hi>I ſpeak to the whole Colledge or Covent of</hi> 52. There is not a
word, ſyllable, or tittle, of any ſuch addreſſe, in that paſſage, wherein I ſpeak
<pb facs="tcp:161817:4"/>
of <hi>Teſtardus.</hi> Secondly, that <hi>I bring in, and that truly, the number
of 52. to teſtifie againſt me.</hi> For I confeſſe, that if I did in this, or any
other paſſage, <hi>bring in,</hi> or preſent 52. <hi>as teſtifying againſt me, I did it
not TRULY,</hi> (though I preſume, pardonably not ſuſpecting forgery in
<hi>a teſtimony to the truth of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> eſpecially being a teſtimony alſo
<hi>to our ſolemne League and Covenant,</hi> and this exhibited by ſo many,
calling themſelves Miniſters of Chriſt, and theſe all of them, <hi>ſolemne</hi>
pretenders to an inviolable obſervation of this Covenant) becauſe Mr.
<hi>John Downham</hi> whoſe name they have printed amongst the ſubſcribers,
and who is one of the 52, <hi>did NOT teſtifie againſt me;</hi> and many
more of the 52. might be as innocent as hee in this behalfe, for ought I
know, or have reaſon now to judge. Are theſe falſe-fingred men, theſe
forgers of teſtimonies, theſe <hi>opprobria &amp; propudia generis humani,</hi>
the ſhames and blots of mankind, <hi>Mr. Jenkin</hi> his <hi>reverend and beloved?</hi>
Very probably they may ſo be, himſelf being one, and (it's like) the firſt
born of them. But are theſe <hi>the Paſtors which the Lord Jeſus hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
after his own heart</hi> for his people? No great marvell if the forlorn
conſcience of this man giveth him full liberty of ſpeaking all maner of evill
of me, when at the infinite holineſſe, the dreadfull power, the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
majeſty of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelfe cannot ſecure him againſt
the reproach of his pen, which not onely maketh the vileſt of men <hi>Paſtors</hi>
of his <hi>providing</hi> for his people, but alſo aſſerteth theſe for <hi>Paſtors accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own heart?</hi> But to the ſtory; Theſe Setters having obtained
their deſires of <hi>Mr. Downham</hi> in this kind, how honourably (think we)
did they reward him for his courteſie? Firſt, they goe and foyſt into that
catalogue of errors, which he had ſubſcribed, what ſayings and ſentences of
other men they pleaſed, without demanding his judgement about them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he thought them errors or no Yea (that which was as baſe an affront
as could have lightly been put upon an ancient, reverend, and learned man)
they inſert in this catalogue, under the name of errors, ſeverall paſſages
out of a book of <hi>Dr. Hamonds,</hi> which <hi>Mr. Downam</hi> himſelfe had licenſed
but a little before; and ſo repreſent him, not only as a man of a deſultory and
inconſiſtent judgement in his ſedate and beſt compoſed yeares, but alſo as a
man of no more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience or cordialnes to his friend, than to blow hot &amp; cold
with the ſame breath, to kiſſe and kill in the ſame houre. If this be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of <hi>Sion Colledge</hi> to their friends, what may their adverſaries ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from them? If this be their oyle, what are their ſwords? Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conſcious (it ſeems) that they bad abuſed him, by way of reparation,
they make him Captain of their black guard, conferring upon him the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

            <p>But the beſt is, that our <hi>Collegrate</hi> ſons of <hi>Sion</hi> doe not build up but pull

that the clean birds amongst them begin to loath and forſake it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it ſtands all thoſe of this nation in hand, whom either the intereſt of

I have heretofore had to doe with ſome of the keeneſt ſons of high
Presbytery, who (I am certain) bad <hi>diviſim</hi> &amp; <hi>conjunctim,</hi> more ſtrength

in the ſame guilt, <hi>&amp; tamen eundem exitum non perhorreſcere,</hi>
and yet not to feare the ſame iſſue. But when men have armed themſelves
with a brow of braſſe, they make account they are bravely accoutred, ſufficiently

I do not well know how to prove, that the Sun is not a ſackcloth, or that
the ſtarres are not clods of earth, eſpecially by any ſuch arguments which
are like to convince, or to be regarded by him, who indeed judgeth them to
be ſuch. And there are ſeverall things aſſerted by me in <hi>Sion Colledge
viſited,</hi> and in thoſe paſſages of mine tranſcribed in the <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> which
<hi>Mr. Jenkin</hi> denies, or cavils at, which I acknowledge are very difficult for
me to prove; I mean, by any clearer light, than that wherewith they ſhine of
themſelves. If a man will deny that <hi>Chriſtus,</hi> in Latine, ſignifies in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> or that perſon, God and man, who according to the Scriptures,
came to ſave the world; or that <hi>Gentes</hi> ſignifies the Gentiles, or the
Nations of the earth, as contra-diſtinguiſhed to the Jewes: or that <hi>ſuaculpâ perire,</hi> ſignifies in Engliſh, to periſh by a mans own fault, (with
many the like) I muſt profeſſe, that I know not well how to prove them. So
again, if a man will deny that twice two makes foure, that the Sun is full
of light, that ſweet things are ſweet, that bitter things are bitter, &amp;c. I ſhall
be at a loſſe to make any ſubſtantiall demonſtration of them, eſpecially to
the ſatisfaction of <hi>Mr. Jenkin,</hi> or men of the ſame line of reaſon and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding

defects in him: 1. In point of Conſcience. 2. Of Learning, or Clerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
3. Of Judgement, or Apprehenſion. 4. (and laſtly) Of Civility,
and common Ingenuity. I ſhall not furniſh every of theſe heads

with matter ſo intirely appropriate unto them reſpectively, but that
ſome things more directly appertaining to one, will occaſionally

were they not accompanied with the other two, I confeſſe I could ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

him, in reſpect of his want of learning, judgement and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the ſame, or greater, he is burthened with them, and rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
inexcuſable, under his defect of conſcience and ingenuity, For
when the light and vigor of conſcience, and principles of modeſty
and ingenuity are ſo ſoon extinguiſhed, it is an undeniable ſigne that
men have ſinned at ſo much the higher, and more deſperate rate.
And very unhappy muſt needs be the condition of ſuch men, who

preſently addes, that <hi>for the moſt of them to have performed his taske, he
ſhould have accounted it an act of (not to ſay too) great condeſcention:</hi> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe
the condeſcention in them had been as great, as it would be
in the Maſter-fidlers belonging to a countrey conſort, to excuſe the
little Boy, and carry the great Fiddle themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) is it likely that Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> can have the conſent
of his conſcience, to ſay, <hi>my other writings are below the moſt,</hi> and
this <hi>laſt</hi> to be VERY FEEBLE, <hi>and below my ſelfe,</hi> when as <hi>the
fifth rib of</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenkins Religion</hi> (High Presbytery I mean: for which
metaphor I ſhall give account hereafter) lies bleeding at the foot of
the other, being as good as broken in peeces by them; and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
with many others of his <hi>Collegiate</hi> fraternity, caſt out of the
poſſeſſion of their patience (that I ſay not, of their wits) by the laſt.
If <hi>my other writings were below the moſt;</hi> the <hi>cauſe</hi> of High-Presbytery
being ſo ſhaken, ſhattered, and diſmantled by them, muſt needs <hi>be</hi>
(in ſtrength, and capacity of being maintained) <hi>below the moſt</hi> of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
unleſſe for the ſtaving off of this conſequence, Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> will ſay,
that the cauſe I ſpeake of, is good, but the defenders of it are weake
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161817:7"/>
and inſufficient. I give him leave to chuſe his horn; but goared hee
muſt be either by the one horn, or the other, of the <hi>Dilemma.</hi> And
for <hi>Sion Colledge viſited,</hi> if this be <hi>below my ſelfe,</hi> it is a ſigne that Mr.
<hi>Jenkin,</hi> and his <hi>Reverend Sirs,</hi> grow downwards, or backwards, as
well in patience, as in learning and knowledge. For I appeal to all
judicious and diſengaged men, that have found ſo much time as to
loſe in reading Mr. <hi>Jenkins Buſie Biſhop,</hi> whether both the patience
of the man be not overcome, and his learning overcharged, with that
writing. If Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> notwithſtanding all this, will ſay in his ſoule
and conſcience, hee verily beleeves that the ſaid writing called <hi>Sion
Colledge viſited,</hi> is a <hi>very feeble Pamphlet,</hi> let this Animadverſion be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from under this head, and carried on to the third, to prove
him a Defective in judgement and underſtanding. But I ſuppoſe there
is no occaſion for the remove.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> whereas (in the ſaid Title page) he inſinuates me guilty
of <hi>cavills againſt the Miniſters of London for witneſſing againſt my er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
touching the holy Scriptures, and the power of Man,</hi> &amp;c. it argues (in
his own metaphor) a <hi>crazy conſcience.</hi> For I never <hi>cavil'd</hi> againſt, nor
had any thing to doe with, either on the right hand, or the left, <hi>the
Miniſters of London for witneſſing againſt any errors of mine whatſoever,</hi>
nor did I ever charge them w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> any ſuch crime. That which I charged
them with, (not <hi>cavil'd againſt them,</hi> for) was unconſcionable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
dealing with the words &amp; writings of their brethren, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wronged them, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracy againſt ſeveral truths of God, (bound
up indeed in the ſame bundle with many errors, as Chriſt was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
amongſt tranſgreſſors,) and incenſing the Magiſtrates againſt
thouſands that are godly &amp; peaceable in the land, becauſe not of their
faction, &amp;c. With theſe things, and ſome other of like notorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency
with theſe, I confeſſe I charged them. But that they
ever <hi>witneſſed againſt any error</hi> of mine, it never came within the verge
of my thoughts. Doth not then my young adverſary abaſe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
greatly in this point alſo?</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> when in the ſame Title page he affirmeth, that in his <hi>Buſie-Biſhop,
the impertinency of my quotations out of the Fathers, M. Bucer, and
Mr. Ball, are manifeſted,</hi> he plainy declares, that it is all one with him
to ſay that ſnow is black, as that it is white: yea more eaſie, to ſay
that what is not done, is done, than to ſay that it is not done. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!
what hath the young <hi>Glorioſo</hi> done to the value of the leaſt haire
of his head, towards a <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of any <hi>impertinencie in</hi> any <hi>of my
quotations</hi> he ſpeakes of? Or if he underſtand not what the <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161817:7"/>
of a quotation</hi> meaneth, or wherein it conſiſts, let this note ſerve
under the third head, and prove him debile or <hi>crazie</hi> in his intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.
For to cite other words, of a different, or contrary import, to
thoſe quoted by me out of the ſame Author, is no <hi>manifeſtation</hi> at all
of any <hi>impertinency in my quotation.</hi> It is indeed a diſcovering of the
nakedneſſe of an Author, to preſent him as contradictious to himſelf.
Nor is there any practice or courſe more ready and direct, to ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
cancell, and diſſolve the intereſt of all humane Authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
and to render all Authors, but as ſo many ciphers in matters
of religion, than to expoſe the unſtableneſſe of their judgement to the
eyes of men. For he that ſpeaketh contradictions, as to matter of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,
is as good as ſilent, and as ſpeaking nothing at all. And for
my part, I neither am, nor ſhall be, at all offended with Mr. <hi>Jenkin,</hi>
for duly preſenting any Authors whatſoever, Fathers or others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the order of Hagiographie, as divided from, and inconſiſtent
with themſelves, in any difficult or diſputable point in Chriſtian
Religion. To goe on in this courſe I ſhall rather give him the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of
<q>
                     <l>Macte nova virtute, puer.</l>
                     <l>Brave youth, advance in this new valour thine.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For by this meanes he will help to teare and pluck off that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of fleſh, wherewith the faces of many notable Truths of God
have been ſo bumbled and muffled up, that the generality of men
could never come to a cleare and orderly ſight, or view of them. Not
that I would have the names or memories of men deſerving well of
Religion and Chriſtianity in their generations, unkindly or unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
handled in the leaſt; but that their authority and greatneſſe of
name might not (contrary to their deſires) be abuſed to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
or diſadvantage of any truth; nor, in any particular opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they aſſert or hold, be exalted above the ſtrength and worth
of thoſe grounds, whether of Scripture, or Reaſon, by which they
maintain it. I heartily wiſh, that in all our diſputes about matters of
Religion, all names of men whatſoever might be but ſtanders by, and
lookers on, and that onely their arguments and reaſons might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.
And whereas the young man, (<hi>p.</hi> 41.) either very ignorantly, or
(which is worſe) very contra-conſcientiouſly, chargeth me with <hi>going
about to make Teſtardus my Patron;</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 44. with bringing Mr. <hi>Bucer,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> to bleſſe me. And again, that <hi>I come to the Fathers for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage</hi>
(which is his Coccyſme, or Cuckow-note, that he ſings ten
times
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161817:8"/>
over.) I muſt tell him, for his learning in theſe ſayings, hee (as the
the Engliſh proverb phraſeth it) muſeth as he uſeth. For becauſe
himſelf, and others of his capacity, uſe to make <hi>Patrons</hi> for their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
of their books and Authours, having commonly no better
pillars to ſupport the Pile and Fabrick of their judgements, than
fleſh and blood; therefore he conceiteth that all other men, who
make uſe of Authors, doe it upon the ſame termes, and ground. But
when the Lord Chriſt cited the teſtimony of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, in the
behalf of himſelfe, and that Doctrine of his, wherein he avouched
himſelfe the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and Son of God, did he goe about to make
him a <hi>Patron,</hi> either to himſelf or his Doctrine? Nay, doth he not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
diſclaim any ſuch thought or intention as this, in theſe words,
<hi>I receive not teſtimony from man</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">John 5. 34.</note>, and as expreſly declare what his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
was in producing this teſtimony (in the words following)
<hi>but theſe things I ſay that ye might be ſaved:</hi> plainly ſignifying, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he nor his Doctrine, had any need of any forraigne or extrinfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
aid from any Authority of men whatſoever, for the countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
or aſſerting of either, in the eyes or judgements of conſidering
and unprejudiced men, being both full of a native light of their own,
abundantly ſufficient for the conviction and ſatisfaction of ſuch; and
therefore the reaſon which moved him to inſiſt upon the teſtimony
of <hi>John,</hi> was, that ſuch partiall, froward, and ingaged men as they
were (for he ſpeakes unto the Jewes,) might have the advantage of
a teſtimony more creditable with them, to be convinced of, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that, which was ſo neceſſary to be beleeved by them, for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
In like manner, the reaſon why I quote either <hi>Teſtardus,</hi> or
<hi>Hierome,</hi> or <hi>Auſtin,</hi> or any other Authour, as concurrent in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with me about my Doctrine, or opinion, which I teach, is not
by way of <hi>patronage,</hi> or countenance unto them, or as if I conceiv'd
that intelligent, free, and diſengaged men were not ſufficiently ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of truth in them only by the pregnancy of thoſe Scriptures, and
grounds of Reaſon, upon which they are built, without being relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
againſt their feares, by a conjunction of humane Authority; but
that M. <hi>Jenkin,</hi> &amp; ſuch as lye under the ſame diſadvantage with him,
for diſcerning and beleeving Truth, being ſo ſervile, and ſo bowed
down in their judgements and underſtandings, that they dare not,
(or howſoever will not) call any thing Truth, which men, voted Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
by a reciprocall vote amongſt themſelves, doe not call ſuch
with them, might have a ſuſtentory, or encouragement ſuitable to
their weakneſſe in this kind, and not be afraid of Truth, as of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:161817:8"/>
clean <hi>ſpirit,</hi> for want <hi>of fleſh and bones.</hi> Therefore when he ſpeakes of
<hi>manifeſting the IMPERTINENCY of my quotations,</hi> I cannot
readily imagine what he ſhould mean by his <hi>Impertinency:</hi> or how, or
by what light given by him, he ſhould imagine that he hath <hi>manifeſted</hi>
any ſuch thing in them, or againſt them. If by the <hi>IMPERTINEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CY
of aquotation,</hi> he meanes, a contrariety of ſence, or import, to
ſomewhat which the ſame Author affirmeth or denieth elſwhere, all,
or the greateſt part of his own <hi>quotations</hi> are every whit as <hi>IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERTINENT</hi>
as mine. For he <hi>quotes</hi> nothing from any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
in oppoſition to me, but what hath been counter-quoted by me
from the ſame. Nor doe I, either in <hi>Sion Colledge viſited,</hi> or in any
other of my writings, <hi>quote</hi> any Author, for any ſuch end or purpoſe
as this, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that the Author which I <hi>quote,</hi> never expreſſed
himſelfe otherwiſe, than according to the tenor of the words, which
I <hi>quote</hi> from him. If not to prove ſuch a thing as this by a <hi>quotation,</hi>
be to <hi>quote</hi> an Author <hi>IMPERTNENTLY,</hi> I confeſſe M. <hi>Jenkin</hi>
hath ſaid ſomewhat (though not ſufficient neither) to <hi>manifeſt the
IMPERTINENCY of my quotations:</hi> but howſoever, the IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERTINENCY
of his own are equally <hi>manifeſt</hi> (as hath been ſaid)
by the ſame light. Or if by this his IMPERTINENCY, hee
meanes the <hi>Impertinency</hi> of them in reſpect of the actuall accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the end intended and deſired by them, which was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
and ſatisfaction of Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> and others, of the truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
and aſſerted in them, I confeſſe (as touching himſelfe) he hath
ſufficiently <hi>manifeſted</hi> this <hi>Impertinency</hi> in them, by declaring himſelfe
an enemy to ſuch Truths, my <hi>quotations</hi> notwithſtanding. But in
this ſenſe of the word, <hi>IMPERTINENCY,</hi> his own <hi>quotations</hi>
are altogether as <hi>IMPERTINENT</hi> as mine; inaſmuch as I, and
many others (to my knowledge) are far from being ſatisfied by them,
touching the truth of what hee conceiv'd to be comprehended in
them. If young <hi>Thraſo</hi> will undertake to <hi>manifeſt</hi> IMPERTINENCY
(in any regular or tolerable ſignification of the word) in my <hi>quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
he muſt clearly and lightſomly prove, either that <hi>vera juſtitia</hi>
doth not ſignifie, true, but hypocriticall, righteouſneſſe; or that <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revelatum

as any of theſe: otherwiſe I make no queſtion, but the next
time that he and his conſcience meet, either he will come off with this
faire interpretation of his words, that the <hi>IMPERTINENCIE of
my quotations</hi> (i. all the <hi>IMPERTINENCIE</hi> that is in them,
which indeed is none at all) <hi>is manifeſted in his Buſie-Biſhop:</hi> for in
this ſence (I confeſſe) the <hi>IMPERTINENCIE</hi> of them, is here
<hi>manifeſted:</hi> 1. there is no more <hi>IMPERTINENCIE</hi> in them,
than what is by him <hi>manifeſted,</hi> which (as was ſaid) is none at all:
or elſe, with this penitent confeſſion, that hee dealt unkindly by
his Conſcience, when he talk'd of <hi>IMPERTINENCIE in my
quotations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas he pretends (in the ſame Title page) that in his <hi>Buſie-Biſhop
my Cavils againſt the Miniſters of London, are anſwered:</hi>

being no jot or tittle of ſuch imployment in my Book for his <hi>Buſie-Biſhop</hi>

<hi>with abundant rage in oppoſing Chriſt in his Scriptures, Grace, Miniſters,
Government; his rage</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>againſt the two laſt, reaching up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Elijah</hi> was the man charged by <hi>Ahab</hi> to be the <hi>troubler of Iſrael:</hi>
but <hi>Ahab</hi> himſelfe (with his Fathers houſe) was the man who indeed
and in truth was the troubler thereof, <hi>Elijah</hi> being the <hi>Chariot and
Horſmen of Iſrael. I have not troubled Iſrael</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elijah</hi> to him) <hi>but
thou &amp; thy Fathers Houſe</hi>

M. <hi>Jenkin</hi> with his <hi>Sinonian</hi> band, is the man who really &amp; according

                  <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 7. 2.</note>. Theſe obſtinate and blinde <hi>Jewes</hi> called
that a <hi>deceiving of the people,</hi> which was nothing elſe but an inſtructing
of them in the truth, and a preſerving of them from being <hi>deceived.</hi> In
like manner this ſonne of ſhame, wilfulneſſe and folly, calls that an

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:161817:9"/>
a juſtifying, a magnifying, an exalting of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them.
It was the expreſſion of a man, as eminent both for pietie, parts, and
place, as either of our Univerſities affoord, and not of the abhorred
order of <hi>Independency</hi> neither (as his preferment ſufficiently teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,)
finding me charged by the teſtimony-mongers of <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi>
with the foul crime of denying the authority of the Scriptures, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſeen my tractate upon that ſubject, that <hi>he wondred how ever it
ſhould come into the hearts of theſe men, to lay ſuch a thing to my charge,
how they durſt traduce me as a man denying the authority of the Scriptures,
when I had written ſo clearly, fully, &amp; effectually, in the defence and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
hereof.</hi> Theſe, or words to this effect, he uſed to ſome of his
friends; adding further this regretfull <hi>Epiphonema: But I ſee wee are
fallen into times wherein men dare doe and ſay any thing.</hi> Words of like
import have come from ſeverall other men of worth and judgement.
But as they, who charged the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> with <hi>deceiving the people,</hi>
were the <hi>deceivers</hi> of them themſelves: ſo the truth is, that Mr. <hi>Jenkin,</hi>
&amp; his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peers, who burthen me with <hi>oppoſing Chriſt in his Scriptures,</hi>
are themſelves the men of this abomination. For whilſt in their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings
<hi>they turn the glory</hi> of the abundant grace, love, ſweetneſſe and
bounty of God, expreſſed in the Scriptures towards men, into the
ſimilitude of the moſt unnaturall, unreaſonable, unconſcionable
cruelty and blood-thirſtineſſe of a tyrant, and withall repreſent
<hi>Chriſt</hi> as the Image and <hi>Expreſſe Character</hi> of this God, doe they not
<hi>oppoſe,</hi> and that with an high hand, <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Scriptures? Or what
<hi>oppoſition</hi> is <hi>Chriſt</hi> capable of <hi>in his Scriptures,</hi> greater than this, that
theſe, diametrically contrary to their native tenor, tendency, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
ſhould be made acceſſory to his diſgrace, and to the miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of him in the mindes, judgements, and conſciences of men;
as if all the love, care, bowels, and compaſſions which hee bare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
farre the greateſt part of them in his death, being interpreted,
were nothing elſe but bloody purpoſes, intentions, &amp; deſires, to make
them two-fold more the children of wrath, and this to the dayes of
eternity, than otherwiſe they had been? And that as for thoſe few,
whoſe ſalvation he is ſuppoſed to have intended in his death, that
theſe were as much in the love and favour of God before, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, and had eternall life and ſalvation ſetled upon them by the
unchangeable decree and purpoſe of God from eternity, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
relation to, or conſideration of it? The teachers and avouchers
of ſuch doctrines as theſe, are they who <hi>oppoſe Chriſt</hi> in his Scriptures,
not they who deny ink and paper, and whatſoever is materiate or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:161817:10"/>
formed by man, to be preciſely, and in propriety of ſpeech, the word

               <p>That I <hi>oppoſe Chriſt in his grace,</hi>

an <hi>oppoſition of Chriſt in his grace:</hi> but will rather reverberate this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
upon himſelfe and his mates, who tremble not to informe
the creature againſt the Creator (bleſſed for ever) as if from eternity
he had ſhut up his grace, mercy, love, from and againſt the whole
generation of men (ſome few of them onely excepted) with the iron
bares of an ireverſible, indiſpenſable decree, and this without any
regard and conſideration had, either to, or of, their obduration, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence,
or unbeliefe: thus making him like a King, or other
man, who ſhould marry and deſire to beget children, with a full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and intention to make the farre greateſt part of them ſlaves, yea
and to put ſome as ſoone as they ſhould be borne; others not many
yeares after, to a moſt cruell, ſhamefull, and tormenting death. If
there be any <hi>oppoſers of Chriſt in his grace</hi> under heaven, the teachers
of ſuch doctrines as theſe are the firſt born in the ingagement.</p>
               <p>But it may be this <hi>ſwelling peece of vanity,</hi>

the great Gingler otherwiſe, is as well in this, as in other his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings

me life and health, and opportunity otherwiſe, to give a diſtinct and
perfect account of my judgement about the ſtrength or intereſt of

I give as little to the former (and much more to the latter) as
M. <hi>Jenkin</hi> and his Aſſeſſors do I ſhal only add this one thing (for the

by way of gift, power, or endowment, except <hi>Nature,</hi> with her
gifts and endowments, be given away from God, or from the grace
of God in Chriſt, and aſcribed unto ſome other Author, Founder,

it, as any wayes derogating from the grace of God, or <hi>Chriſt. Sed

               <p>Whereas he expreſſeth himſelf as ſomewhat more qualified about

                  <hi>and Grace,</hi> but with great indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

him for a man, whoſe heart ſits cloſer to his own intereſts of
honour and profit, than to his Maſters greateſt concernments? yea,
I verily beleeve, that had I not <hi>touched the apple of</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenkins eye,</hi> he
would not have ſaid ſo much unto me, as <hi>black is my eye,</hi> for any <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi>
I have made againſt Chriſt. I have made bold to <hi>viſit Sion Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
&amp; to <hi>blaſpheme</hi> (as her worſhippers interpret) <hi>the great Dieana of
high Presbytery;</hi> therefore I muſt ſuffer as an <hi>oppoſer of Chriſt in his
Scriptures, Grace:</hi> yea, and as a man whoſe <hi>rage reacheth up to heaven,</hi>
in <hi>oppoſing him,</hi> firſt and principally <hi>in his Miniſters, and</hi> then in his
<hi>Government:</hi> my <hi>oppoſing him in his Miniſters</hi> (that ſhould be) is the
<hi>root of the matter: Scriptures, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> too, ſhould have
gone for nought, had not theſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> of his been oppoſed. But
upon what ſimple and ridiculous pretences, he raveth againſt me, as a
man <hi>oppoſing Chriſt</hi> either in <hi>Miniſters,</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> is argued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſecond head.</p>
               <p>Not long after (in this Preface) he profeſſeth,<note place="margin">Sect. 11.</note> that his <hi>hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
to my miſ-led followers</hi> (becauſe <hi>led</hi> out of the <hi>broad way</hi> of <hi>High-Presbytery)
is like that of Moſes to the people, that they would depart from
the tents of this man.</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> in this profeſſion, hath charged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with a very difficult task, againſt his next, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove, that
<hi>Moſes</hi> made ſome ſuch <hi>requeſt</hi> as this <hi>unto the people, viz.</hi> that they
<hi>would depart from my tents.</hi> He tells me of <hi>three or foure prophanations
of Scripture</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Page 59.</note>: But he that <hi>prophanes Scripture</hi> himſelf, as Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi>
doth, more than <hi>three</hi> or foure times in his <hi>Buſie-Biſhop,</hi> is a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent
judge of this miſdemeanour in others. But to levie the
Scriptures againſt any principle, or practice in High-Presbytery, or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:161817:11"/>
Presbyterians, muſt by the deciſive authority of this young Dictator,
needs be a <hi>prophanation</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>He further <hi>requeſts</hi> them,<note place="margin">Sect. 12.</note> that <hi>they would not feed upon chalk and
coales in corners.</hi> I make no queſtion but the perſons he meanes will
gratifie him in this requeſt, with an overplus: and that they will take
heed of <hi>feeding</hi> upon ſuch ſtuffe as he ſpeakes off, either in <hi>corners,</hi> or
in more open places. It is well known that there is more <hi>Chalke</hi> and
<hi>Coales</hi> about Chriſt-church, than is to bee found in, or about the
Warehouſe in <hi>Colemanſtreet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſince he tells them,<note place="margin">Sect. 13.</note> that <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath provided
them Paſtors after his own heart,</hi> I wonder how he dares attempt to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
or withdraw them from ſuch <hi>Paſtors?</hi> They keep to the <hi>Paſtor
which the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath provided for them.</hi> But for thoſe <hi>Paſtors</hi>
which Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> (I ſuppoſe) meanes, he or they, or both, ſhall doe
well to prove them <hi>Paſtors according to the heart of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> for
their ſpirit, wayes, and works, ſtrongly import another (much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring)
conformity.</p>
               <p>If <hi>under Prelacy they hated thoſe Doctrines as hell, which now they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to heaven,</hi> I truſt they doe but imitate St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in time
came to <hi>build</hi> up that <hi>faith, which ſometimes he deſtroyed</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 1. 23.</note>. It ſeemes it
is a law in <hi>High-Presbytery,</hi> that that which is <hi>crooked,</hi> muſt never be
<hi>made ſtraight,</hi> nor that <hi>which is turned out of the way,</hi> ever bee <hi>healed:</hi>
or elſe that this Government is built of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Oke, ſo that there is no
danger, or poſſibility, that any cobweb of error, or falſe doctrine
ſhould ever be found about it.</p>
               <p>And whereas (in the laſt place) he deſires them not <hi>to be offended at
his acrimony</hi> (wherein he commends himſelfe for being more boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
to mee,<note place="margin">Sect. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>than to all the men in the world beſides, put together</hi>) I truſt
that herein alſo they will grant him his deſire. For (as <hi>Hierome</hi>
ſaith) <hi>majores non ſcandalizantur: well-grown Chriſtians are never</hi>
ſcandalized, or <hi>offended:</hi> the reaſon whereof is, becauſe they know
that there are <hi>wolves in ſheeps cloathing,</hi> as well as in their own skins:
and that there is no unworthy, impious, or abominable thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
but there is vileneſſe and wickedneſſe enough in ſome prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
Chriſtian Religion, to perpetrate and doe it. Now the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the reaſons and cauſes of things, is an antidote or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative
againſt admiration, and ſo againſt any diſtemper or diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
in the minde or affections, when ſuch things come to paſſe,
which to others, who are ignorant of the cauſes producing them, are
like to occaſion diſturbance and offence. I make no queſtion but my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:161817:11"/>
                  <hi>followers</hi> fully know, that Mr. <hi>Jenkin,</hi> before this, might have, &amp; that
now, he (indeed) hath pride, ignorance, &amp; wickedneſſe in him every
wayes ſufficient, to exhibite and affoord, all that <hi>acrimony</hi> he ſpeakes
of as beſtowed on me, and in this reſpect I am full of hope, that they
will not be offended at it in the leaſt, however they may bee affected
with ſorrow &amp; grief of heart, to ſee a young man by the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, turn'd into a <hi>pillar</hi> of ſuch unſavoury <hi>ſalt.</hi> For what is
that <hi>acrimony</hi> he ſpeakes of, or what are the ingredients of it, but affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
jeers, childiſh ventoſities &amp; puffs of wit, charges made of moſt
notorious, palpable, and broad-fac'd untruths, ſenſleſſe and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
vilifications, which his beſt friends are aſhamed of, exaltations
of ignorance and folly in Criticiſms, and ſuch like over-ingagements
of his ſtrength, unchriſtian revilings, diabolicall ſlanders, &amp;c. This is
the true compoſition of Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> his <hi>Acrimony;</hi> they that have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe to do with their time, but to read his Pamphlet, may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of any Commentary, ſo find it.</p>
               <p>This conſidered, certainly either his ſenſe, or conſcience, or both,
failed him, to ſay concerning his <hi>Acrimony,</hi> that it <hi>is leſſe than I deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
For can any man, whatſoever his demerit, or crimes be, <hi>deſerve</hi>
to make another man ſinfull, or wicked? Doth the Devill himſelfe
<hi>deſerve</hi> to be belied, ſlandered, reproached, reviled? At whoſe hand,
or from whom, <hi>deſerveth</hi> he theſe things, or who ſhall do the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in caſe he deſerveth them? I know none but M. <hi>Jenkin,</hi> and thoſe
that take the ſame liberty of conſcience (or, from conſcience rather)
with him, that are like to inflict ſuch penalties as theſe upon him.
Such executions are no work for <hi>Arch-angels.</hi> But this <hi>Mancipium</hi> of
abſurdities, and all manner of illiterateneſſe, that in matters of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larſhip,
regular and manlike learning, ſcarce <hi>knowes his right hand
from his left,</hi> will yet ever and anon be perking up into <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> his
chaire, and as if he underſtood what he cenſures, will tell men how
oft he <hi>takes them tardy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the further furniſhing of this head,<note place="margin">Sect. 15.</note> I ſhall onely preſent the
Reader with a catalogue of ſome of thoſe many broad-fac'd and
ſhameleſſe untruths (with a briefe eviction annexed unto them reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively)
together with ſome other ſtraines of a ſemblable impiety,
which lie thick ſcattered, like dung upon the face of his Pamphlet.
Firſt, there is a neſt of this ſerpentine brood I ſpeak of, (baſe and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid
ſlanders and untruths) in the very firſt halfe page of his booke.
Here he affirmeth, 1. <hi>That my work is to kill Religion.</hi> 2. that <hi>I advance
her head in my Preface, to break her neck in my book.</hi> 3. that <hi>in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:161817:12"/>
of my booke, I lay Religion among the clodds.</hi> 4. that <hi>I deny the
Scripture to be the Foundation of Religion.</hi> 5. (within two lines after
the end of this firſt page) <hi>that were my wit but halfe ſo keen as my will,
they ſhould in a ſhort time neither have Religion nor Miniſter left among
them.</hi> Might he not with as much truth, yea, with as much likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of truth, have charged me to have uttered all thoſe ſcurrilous,
foul-mouth'd, unmanly, and moſt unchriſtian ſpeeches againſt the
Parliament and Army, which (as the <hi>Pulpit-Incendiary</hi> informes the
world) have been the devout oriſons, and pious ejaculations of the
circumforaneous tribe of our morning Lecturers? I confeſſe, that if
either my <hi>wit</hi> or <hi>will</hi> knew how to effect it, we ſhould neither have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch <hi>Religion,</hi> which ſtands in railing, <hi>left amongst us;</hi> nor any
<hi>Miniſter,</hi> who in ſtead of <hi>lifting up his voyce like a Trumpet, to cauſe</hi> the
people <hi>to know their abominations,</hi> ſhould lift it up <hi>like a Trumpet,</hi> to
<hi>prepare</hi> and <hi>cauſe</hi> the people to commit <hi>abominations.</hi> As for that
foundation of his, that <hi>I deny the Scripture to be the foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi>
upon which he builds this pile of lying vanities, we ſhall (under
the next head) ſo raze and demoliſh it, as not to leave one ſtone of it
upon another, which ſhall not be thrown down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 2. he ſaith,<note place="margin">Sect. 16.</note> 1. that <hi>my rage againſt the Miniſters made me write
non-ſence,</hi> and ſo page 4. and I know not how oft beſides, he tells me
of my rage, rage, rage, againſt the Miniſters;) whereas the words,
which through ignorance of his mother tongue he calls <hi>non-ſence,</hi> are
as regular, proper, and ſignificant, as the Engliſh tongue will beare;
and thoſe which (novice-like) he would ſubſtitute in their place, are
meerly barbarous, making <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an abſurd ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leciſme,
(as we ſhall, God willing, ſhew more at large in the ſecond
head). And ſecondly, there is not the leaſt occaſion given by me,
why he ſhould imagine the leaſt <hi>rage</hi> in me againſt the Miniſters he
ſpeaks of: He cannot but know, that in my <hi>Sion Colledge viſited,</hi> I give
them as friendly &amp; faithfull counſel as himſelfe can do; not is there
any ſentence or expreſſion in all the book, ſavouring of any rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them. In the ſame page he is not aſhamed to ſay, that <hi>he finds
two abominable falſities within the ſpace of two lines;</hi> whereas the truth
is, that he contracts the guilt of <hi>two abominable falſities</hi> in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my words. For firſt, he affirmes, that I ſay, <hi>That the Miniſters of
the Goſpel, are ONELY ſo reputed by men, for want of knowing and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
better;</hi> whereas my words are clearly of another tenor, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie,
and import: nor doe I ſo much as ſpeak of the <hi>Miniſters of
the Goſpel</hi> (truly ſo called) but onely of ſuch, who not being ſuch,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:161817:12"/>
notwithſtanding aſſume the title and dignity of being ſuch, unto
themſelves, and receive it accordingly from <hi>inconſiderate men.</hi> And
beſides, the word ONELY is here falſly foyſted in; he findes no
ſuch word amongſt thoſe of mine, which hee pretends to cite. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he affirmes that I ſay, <hi>that they</hi> (the Miniſters of the Goſpel)
<hi>have veſted themſelves with the priviledge of being the ground and pillar of
Truth;</hi> whereas 1. I uſe no ſuch barbarous or illiterate expreſſion, as
<hi>veſting</hi> any <hi>man,</hi> or men, <hi>with any priviledge:</hi> nor 2. doe I ſpeak, what
I ſpeak in this point, concerning the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> (truly
ſuch) but (as before is expreſſed) concerning thoſe, who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and are called by others, ſuch <hi>Miniſters,</hi> being really and in
truth nothing leſſe. Therefore the <hi>two abominable falſities</hi> he ſpeaks
of, are his own, not mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Sect. 17.</note> Fearing (it ſhould ſeem) that hee might want variety of
<hi>falſities</hi> to fill the mouth of his <hi>Buſie-Biſhop,</hi> hee again chargeth me
with ſaying, <hi>The Miniſters have veſted themſelves with the priviledge of
the Church, &amp;c.</hi> Let him ſhew me theſe words in my book, and I ſhall
diſcharge him of the Whetſtone. <hi>Page</hi> 4. he ſaith, that <hi>the deſigne of
my deluded followers, is to raze and levell the Church of Chriſt, and to
preach as well as John Goodwin (as indeed they may ſoone doe.</hi>) Mr.
<hi>Jenkin,</hi> the ſooner my <hi>followers</hi> ſhall be able to <hi>preach, as well</hi> as I, I
judge it ſo much the better, and more honourable to me. If it were
the will and pleaſure of him, who is able to effect it, I ſhould greatly
rejoyce if the thing might come to paſſe before the morrow next. It
ſeemes your prayer is, that your <hi>followers</hi> may never be able to <hi>preach,
as well as you:</hi> you are a mountaine, and therefore afraid of <hi>levelling.</hi>
But why muſt it needs be one and the ſame deſigne, to <hi>raze,</hi> and to
<hi>levell the Church of Chriſt?</hi> When <hi>Moſes</hi> wiſhed, <hi>Would God that all the
Lords people were Prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon
them</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Numb 11. 29</note>, was his deſigne, or wiſh, <hi>to raze the Church of Chriſt?</hi> When
the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> propheſied thus: <hi>Every valley ſhall be exalted, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mountain and hill ſhall be brought low</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Eſay 40. 4.</note>: did he propheſie of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
or <hi>razing</hi> of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> or of the exaltation and
glory of it? Queſtionleſſe the raiſing and lifting up of the weaker
members of the Church, in gifts and ſpirituall endowments, to the
line and <hi>levell</hi> of thoſe that are ſtrong, would be ſo farre from <hi>razing</hi>
the Church of Chriſt, that it would <hi>gird her with ſtrength,</hi> and bee a
beautifull crown upon her head. But it is plain, that by, the <hi>Church
of Chriſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> (according to the old Pontificiall, and Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
notion) meanes the <hi>Clergie:</hi> and makes account that if their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:161817:13"/>
or honour be impaired, the Church muſt needs fall. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
whereas he ſaith, that <hi>the deſigne of my deluded followers,
is to raze, &amp;c.</hi> if his meaning could be excuſed, his words were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
(the crime of <hi>idleneſſe</hi> onely excepted) for they neither touch,
nor concern any man. Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> may ſend his learned ignorance,
with his unconſcionable honeſty, and my <hi>deluded followers,</hi> to dwell
together in one of the Caſtles which he hath built in the aire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Sect. 18.</note> He chargeth me with <hi>ſtriking at the Pillar</hi> [meaning the
Miniſters of <hi>Sion Colledge] becauſe of the Proclamation, the Goſpel that

of Salvation (which himſelfe, I preſume, will not deny to be
his meaning) then is his meaning alſo blaſphemouſly baſe; his

<hi>hang upon</hi> ſuch a <hi>crazy pillar,</hi> as the Collegiate fraternity of <hi>Sion Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi>
Or doth Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> think, that the Doctrine of ſalvation is
ſupported by <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi> and muſt needs fall to the ground, if this
ſhould ſink, or fall? If this bee the thought of his heart, I profeſſe
plainly, it is none of mine, nor of any affinity with any of them: and
therefore when he chargeth me with <hi>ſtriking at the pillar</hi> hee ſpeakes
of, <hi>becauſe of the Goſpel that hangs upon it,</hi> he chargeth me with that
which never was in all my thoughts, no nor ever came neere unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

ſhould have acknowledged the charge, as true. For that <hi>Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of impiety, and oppoſition to the Truth, which <hi>hangs upon the
pillar of Sion Colledge,</hi> and would (I beleeve) ſoon fall to the ground,

Is <hi>Sion Colledge</hi> alſo <hi>in the clouds?</hi> I feare rather among the <hi>Clods.</hi>
But if I be <hi>alwayes in the clouds</hi> when <hi>I write,</hi> I am continually in my
<hi>writings,</hi> where (as the Scripture ſaith) <hi>the ſtrength of God dwelleth.
His excellency</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) is over Iſrael, and his ſtrength is in the

                  <note n="a" place="margin">Pſa. 68. 34.</note>. I confeſſe that when I write, I finde and feele the ſtrength
of God neere unto me, and with me. I am content to beare the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

But take Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> in his notion of my being <hi>alwayes in the clouds</hi>

his in his Preface, where he ſaith of my <hi>laſt peece (Sion Colledge viſited</hi>)
that <hi>it was beneath my ſelf,</hi> &amp; this, of my being <hi>alwayes, when I write,</hi> in
the <hi>clouds?</hi> Certainly there is nothing that can make peace between
theſe two, but onely this ſuppoſition, that in all my former writings,
I was <hi>in the heavens;</hi> and that in the laſt, I fell no lower, nor neerer
to the earth: <hi>than the clouds.</hi> And <hi>in the clouds</hi> (I acknowledge) that
ſometimes I am, when I write, <hi>viz.</hi> relatively, (I mean, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

ſome of them he takes out of one ſentence, and others, out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

youthfull blood, not being well capable of <hi>advice,</hi> in conjunction
with his firſt love to the <hi>fifth rib of his religion,</hi> riſeth up thus. <hi>His
plain meaning is: Be doubtfull whether thoſe damnable errors and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
be ſuch, or no: be Scepticks, Seekers, &amp;c.</hi> Was the man ever cut out
for an Interprer, either of the word of God, or of Men, who ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
miſuſeth the minde and meaning both of the one, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

or not to deport themſelves as if they were infallible, bidd
them <hi>be doubtfull whether damnable errors, and hereſies, be ſuch or no?</hi>
Is not this rather the Spirit, and cleare importance of ſuch an advice,
Take heed you call not ſuch things, ſuch opinions, <hi>damnable errors or

this <hi>Prelaticall</hi> piece of Presbytery, a little after, would needs make
the world believe, that <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the greateſt ſuffer of
them all by my Pamphlet.</hi> The truth is, that none <hi>of them all</hi> need to
have been any <hi>ſufferer</hi> at all by the <hi>Pamphet</hi> he ſpeaks of, the face of it
being clearly ſet, not to curſe them, but to bleſſe them altogether. If
they <hi>ſuffer</hi> by it, they may thank the pride and ſtiffeneſſe of their own
necks, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> will not ſtoop to the yoke of ſound counſel, or a through
Admonition. But for the booke, whatſoever now they <hi>ſuffer</hi> from
it, they have only ſome ſuch cauſe of complaint againſt it, as they
have againſt that <hi>corner-ſtone wch</hi>

impenitency, and unbelief, daſh themſelves in pieces againſt
it. As for his intituling <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to the preheminence of martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
amongſt them, it is but a ſtraine of <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> his rhetoricke of

Whether I do not, in a due &amp; regular ſenſe, affirme and avouch the

<hi>the foundation of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> I appeale to theſe

if by Scripture, be meant, the matter and ſubſtance of things contained and
held forth in the books of the Old and New Teſtament, commonly knowna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Proteſtants by the name of Canonicall, I fully, with all my heart,
and all my ſoul, beleeve them to be of Divine Authority, and none other than
the word of God: and (God aſſiſting) ſhall rather expoſe my ſelfe to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
deaths, than deny them ſo to be.</hi> Can any man, yea can Mr. <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi>
himſelfe, in words more perſpicuous and plain, aſſert his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
and beliefe of the <hi>Divine Authority of the Scriptures,</hi>
than theſe? So that Mr. <hi>Jenkings</hi> charge againſt me of the denying
the Scriptures to be <hi>the foundation of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> ſtands onely
upon the authority, credit, or baſe, of ſuch an argumentation as this.
God hath taken a courſe that <hi>we might ſerve him without feare</hi> (as is
evident, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74.) therefore he hath taken a courſe that we ſhould
not <hi>feare</hi> him <hi>at all,</hi> or in any ſignification of the word, <hi>Feare:</hi> which
concluſion is diametrally oppoſite to the whole courſe and current
of the Scripture, and no wayes followes from the premiſes. In like
manner, he that ſhould inferre, <hi>becauſe it is ſaid</hi> (1 Sam. 15. 29.) <hi>that
the ſtrength of Iſrael</hi> (meaning God) <hi>is not a man that hee ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi>
that therefore GOD can in no ſence repent, ſhould belie
the holy Ghoſt, who expreſly ſaith (<hi>Geneſ.</hi> 6. 6.) that <hi>it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
the Lord that he had made man on the earth:</hi> yea and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
who ſaid thus to <hi>Samuel, It repenteth me that I have ſet up Saul to
be King,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 11. If I ſhould reaſon thus, Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> denies the
woodden Horſe made for unruly Souldiers to ride, to be a living
creature: therefore he denies an horſe ſimply and in every ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the word, to bee a living creatures; might not Mr.
<hi>Jenkin</hi> conclude me to be a Woodden Diſputant? Yet this is the
Logick by which he proves that I deny <hi>the Scripture to be the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Religion.</hi>

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Sect. 35.</note> when <hi>Auſtine,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bucer,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball, &amp;c.</hi> deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

tenor
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:161817:19"/>
to nor of their writings elſewhere ſeeme to oppoſe, how impatiently
importune is Mr. <hi>Jenkin,</hi> to have the ſenſe of the particular place o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled
and interpreted, by the Analogy of what hee conceives to
be their judgement elſewhere? Why then, in as much as he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
but one place onely, wherein I ſeem to deny the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be
of <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> or the <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi> whereas in twenty
and ten places I clearly aſſert them for ſuch, yea it is my entire, drift,
ſcope, and deſigne in the whole Treatiſe, to prove them to be ſuch;
why (I ſay) doth he not regulate and meaſure the ſence of that one
place, by the conſtant and expreſſe tenor of the reſt of the Treatiſe?
But Mr. <hi>Jenkin,</hi> I ſee, hath <hi>a weight</hi> and <hi>a weight,</hi> an <hi>Ephah</hi> and <hi>an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phah,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Sect. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>concerning that very particular ſence, wherein I doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
(and I think all intelligent and conſidering men with me</hi>) deny
the Scriptures to be the word of God, and foundation of Religion, <hi>I expreſſe
my ſelfe thus, p. 15. of the ſaid Diſcourſe.</hi> Though I doe not beleeve that
any Originall Exemplar, or Copy of the Scriptures now extant amongſt us, is
ſo purely the word of God, but that it may very poſſibly have a mixture of the
word of men in it; yet I confidently beleeve that the providence of God, and
the love which he beares to his own glory, as well in the condemnation of the
wicked and unbeleevers, as in the ſalvation of his choſen, have ſo farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed
and watched over the great and gracious Diſcovery and Revelation
which he hath made of himſelfe by Jeſus Chriſt unto the world, that thoſe
books, or writings, wherein it was in all the branches &amp; particularities of it
at firſt imparted unto the world, neither as yet have ſuffered, nor ever ſhall
ſuffer, any ſuch violation, mutilation or falſification in any kinde, either
through the ignorance, negligence, or malice of men, but that they will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſufficiently, yea abundantly to furniſh the world, men of all ſorts and
conditions, with the knowledge of all things neceſſary to be knowne, either
for their honourable and Chriſtian deportment in this preſent world, or for
their everlaſting ſalvation and exaltation in that which is to come. <hi>By
which words it clearly appeares, that though in a ſenſe (limited and
explained by me) I deny the</hi> Scriptures to be the foundation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>yet I hold and aſſert them to CONTAIN the</hi> Foundation of
Religion, <hi>i. thoſe gracious counſels and intendments of God unto the
world, by Jeſus Chriſt, upon which</hi> Chriſtian Religion <hi>ſtands, and is
built. Why then did Mr.</hi> Jenkin Anania's <hi>it with my opinion, and
keep back one part of it?</hi>

Fourthly,<note place="margin">Sect. 37.</note> concerning my ſaid opinion, for which I beare the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniatory
charge of Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> pen, I write thus (<hi>pag.</hi> 17. of the
ſaid Diſcourſe) <hi>Seventhly and laſtly, the</hi> TRUE AND PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PER
<hi>Foundation of Chriſtian Religion, is not</hi> INK AND PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PER,
<hi>nor any booke, or bookes, not any writing, or writings whatſoever,
whether Tranſlations or Originals; but that ſubſtance of matter, thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
counſels of God, concerning the ſalvation of the world by Ieſus Chriſt,
which indeed are repreſented, and declared, both in Tranſlations and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals;
but are eſſentially and really diſtinct from both, and no wayes, for
their Natures &amp; Beings, depending on either.</hi> Why then did not M. <hi>Ienkin,</hi>
charging me with denying the <hi>Scriptures to be the foundation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
as with a dangerous error, mention and relate this my opinion
truly and fully, with ſuch explications of mine about it, without
which it is unpoſſible for any man to know what mine opinion was
in this behalfe? Particularly, why did he not charge me with <hi>denying
the Scriptures to be</hi> [THE TRUE AND PROPER] <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Religion?</hi> Why doth he leave out thoſe words [THE
TRUE AND PROPER] which are eſſentiall to the true ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of that opinion of mine, which he pretends to repreſent? Again
ſecondly, why doth he not plainly acknowledge and declare, that
when I deny the <hi>Scriptures to be the foundation of Religion,</hi> I meane by
the Scriptures, the INK AND PAPER wherewith, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they are either written, or printed, and what ever elſe is found in
them, or appertaining to them, beſides the <hi>ſubſtance of matter, and
thoſe gracious counſels of God concerning the ſalvation of the world by Ieſus
Chriſt,</hi> which are contained and repreſented in them; this being an
eſſentiall ingredient alſo in that opinion of mine? but it may be <hi>the
fifth rib</hi> of Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> Religion, hath need of the <hi>pious frauds</hi> of the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> for her corroboration and ſupport: and can you then blame
him for a little logerdemain now and then?</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Sect. 38.</note> why doth this young Academick, contrary to the
principles of Logick, and all regular Argumentation, yea, in full
conformity with the weakneſſe of illiterate Diſputers, deny the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
without denying or anſwering any thing at all to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes?
I lay down ſeverall Arguments, and Grounds of Reaſon, to
prove the <hi>Scripture</hi> not to be <hi>the foundation of Religion</hi> (in the ſence
wherein I deny it ſo to be) and he, without any anſwer, or ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
given to ſo much as any one of theſe Arguments, denies my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
and votes it for an error deſtructive to the foundation of
Religion. It is like the bent and figure of the <hi>fifth rib</hi> of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:161817:20"/>
required the Anomalie of theſe proceedings at his hand.
But</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">Sect. 39.</note> doth not himſelfe diſtinguiſh (p. 7.) and affirme, that in a
ſenſe the Scriptures <hi>are not the foundation of religion? Elſe what is the
Engliſh of theſe words, in terminis his own? May not Chriſt be the onely
foundation in point of mediation: and the Scripture in point of manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and diſcovery?</hi> Hath the man a <hi>Fungus</hi> a Muſhrome, in ſtead of
<hi>caput humanum,</hi> upon his ſhoulders, to quarrell with me for denying
(in a ſenſe) <hi>the Scriptures to be the foundation of Religion,</hi> and yet to
deny as much himſelfe? Or did I ever, or doe I any where deny
them to be ſuch <hi>a foundation,</hi> in reſpect of repreſentation and <hi>diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
i. to repreſent and diſcover him who is the <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi>
by way of <hi>mediation?</hi> Or doth, or can this young <hi>Pragmatico</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
from any writings of mine, any jot, letter, ſyllable, word, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
of any ſuch import? I confeſſe, that to call the <hi>Scriptures the
foundation of Religion in point of manifeſtation or diſcovery</hi> (taking the
words <hi>manifeſtation and diſcovery,</hi> properly, in their uſual and known
ſignifications) is as ridiculous and abſurd a metaphor, as the ſtiling
of Prerbytery <hi>the fifth rib of Religion.</hi> For can he that onely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts,
makes known and diſcovers unto me, where ſuch, or ſuch an
houſe, or towne, ſtands, or what the ſituation or manner of building
of either is, be in any tolerable conſtruction, or ſenſe, called <hi>the
foundation</hi> of either? Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> thinks that he <hi>manifeſts</hi> and <hi>diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
the <hi>feebleneſſe</hi> of <hi>Sion Colledge viſited:</hi> is he therefore the <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
either of the book, or of the ſuppoſed (or rather, pretended) <hi>fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe,</hi>
which he <hi>diſcovers?</hi> But to affirm (as he doth) the <hi>Scripture
to be the onely foundation of Religion, in point of manifeſtation and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi>
is not onely <hi>abſurdum abſurdo abſurdius,</hi> but moſt Atheologicall

bookes written concerning him? The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> informs us, that
<hi>Chriſt by his Spirit went and preached unto the Spirits in priſon, which

                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Certainly the Scriptures were not extant in
the dayes of <hi>Noah; Moſes</hi> (who was born divers hundreds of years

There is nothing more frequent in Proteſtant-writers than to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

                  </gap>, the eſſentiall or ſubſtantiall word, from the written

of the houſe and lineage of Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> learning. I confeſſe there is
difference enough to make a diſtinction, between <hi>eſſe,</hi> and <hi>cognoſcere;</hi>
witneſſe Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> himſelfe, who hath a tall mans portion in the

               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">Sect. 40.</note> and laſtly, that the Scriptures, whether written, or
printed, are not <hi>truly and properly the foundation of Religion,</hi> I demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
in the ſight of the Sun, to the ſhame and confution of all thoſe
faces, which have charged the Aſſertion and Tenet upon me, as an
Errour, by theſe arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If Religion was <hi>founded,</hi> built, ſtood firme and ſtable in the
world, before the Scriptures were, then cannot the <hi>Scriptures</hi> be <hi>truly
&amp; properly</hi> the <hi>foundation of religion.</hi> This propoſition needs no proof,
beyond the explication of the terms. By the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> I meane the
Book, or books, commonly known by this Name amongſt us, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the gracious counſels of God concerning the ſalvation of the
world by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> are declared and expreſſed, either by writing
or printing: as they were (for matter and ſubſtance) revealed at firſt
by God himſelfe, unto the firſt writers, or pen-men of them.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi> we meane (I preſume) on all hands,
that which mainly and primarily ſupports it, and without which
it cannot ſtand, or have a being among men. If Mr. <hi>Ienkin</hi> meanes
any thing elſe either by <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or by his <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi> I
muſt excuſe him from blaming, or medling with any opinion of
mine concerning the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or <hi>foundation of Religion.</hi> Therefore
I aſſume:</p>
               <p>But <hi>Religion</hi> was founded, built, ſtood firm &amp; ſtable in the world
before the Scriptures were. Ergo.</p>
               <p>This latter propoſition, beſides the native pregnancy and evidence
of Truth in it, is fully proved by me <hi>page</hi> 10. of my diſcourſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of the Scriptures: where (for diſpatch
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:161817:21"/>
ſake) I deſire the Reader, if unſatisfied in this point, to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 41.</note> If the foundation of Religion (truly and properly ſo called)
be unperiſhable, and what cannot be thrown down, or deprived of Being,
then can no booke, or bookes whatſoever under heaven, and conſequently not
the Scriptures themſelves, be this foundation.</p>
               <p>But the foundation of Religion (truly and properly ſo called) is unperiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
&amp;c. Ergo.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence in the Major Propoſition, is evident: becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
booke, all bookes whatſoever, are <hi>periſhable,</hi> may bee burnt
or conſumed by fire, or miſcary by many other caſualties, that may
poſſibly befall them.</p>
               <p>The Minor Propoſition ſtands firm upon this bottome: <hi>viz.</hi> that
no building or ſuperſtruction whatſoever, can exceed the <hi>Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in ſtrength, or continuance. Therefore if the Church of God,
which is built upon the <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi> bee unperiſhable, and
which cannot be prevailed againſt, to ruine or deſtruction, (which
the Scripture every where aſſerteth) moſt certain it is, that the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>
on which it is built, is unperiſhable alſo. If the foundation of
Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> Religion, be his Bible, then is his <hi>Religion</hi> no ſuch <hi>treaſure,</hi>
but that <hi>theeves</hi> may <hi>break through, and ſteal</hi> it from him. For how
ſhould it continue or ſtand, the <hi>foundation</hi> of it being gone? Or in
caſe his Bible ſhould be caſually burnt with fire, the <hi>foundation of his
Religion,</hi> and conſequently his Religion it ſelfe, ſhould be conſumed.
<hi>Diogenes</hi> hearing that <hi>Plato</hi> had given this definition or deſcription
of a man,<note place="margin">Animal bipes implume.</note> that he was a <hi>living creature, with two feet, without feathers,</hi>
gets a Cock, and pulls off all his feathers whilſt he was alive, and
throwes him in amongſt ſome of <hi>Platoes</hi> Scholars,<note place="margin">Ecce hominem Platonicum.</note> wiſhing them to
behold their Maſter <hi>Plato</hi> his Man. If ſome ſuch odd-conceited fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
as <hi>Diogenes,</hi> ſhould uſe meanes to get Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> his Bible, and
having defaced, rent and torn it, ſhould come and caſt it into the
midſt of his Auditors, with this Elogie, <hi>Ecce fundamentum religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
Jenkinianae,</hi> Behold the goodly <hi>foundation of the religion</hi> of your
Maſter <hi>Jenkin,</hi> it might prove a more effectuall conviction unto him
of his folly, than ſeven demonſtrative reaſons adminiſtred by a more
ſober man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If any booke, or bookes whatſoever, either that which is called
the Scripture, or any other, be the true and proper foundation of religion, then
may religion be truly and properly ſaid to have been founded by men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:161817:22"/>
But Religion cannot truly and properly be ſayd to have been founded by
men, but by God. Ergo.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> will deny the Aſſumption, at the perill, both of
his conſcience, and reputation, be it. The conſequence in the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
is evident. For as the Apoſtle ſaith concerning houſes, that <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
houſe</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>is built by ſome man</hi> (as our Tranſlators
render it:) So is it as true concerning <hi>bookes,</hi> that every <hi>book</hi> now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in the world, every Bible, in what language ſoever, whether
printed, or tranſcribed, whether conſiſting of paper, parchment, or
other like materiall, was built and form'd, and made into a book by
men. There is no point, letter, ſyllable, or word, in any of them, but is
the workmanſhip of ſome mans hand, or other. If Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> hath
a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Bible that fell out of heaven, written, or printed without
hands, he is defired to produce it for the accommodation of the
world. Yet he muſt know, that though he could produce ſuch a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or copie of the Scriptures, as this; it would not follow that this
book muſt needs be the <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi> inaſmuch as <hi>Religion</hi>
might take place, be profeſſed and practiſed in truth and power by
men, where this book never came, nor was heard of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 43.</note> If thoſe Tables of ſtone, wherein the Law was written by the
Finger of God himſelfe,<note n="a" place="margin">Exo. 24. 12. 32, 16.</note> were not the foundation of this law, nor of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
exhibited unto it, then neither is any Bible or Book whatſoever, the
foundation of Religion.</p>
               <p>But the Tables of ſtone written immediatly by God himſelfe, were not
the foundation of the Law written therein, nor of the obedience exhibited
unto it. Ergo.</p>
               <p>This latter propoſition is evident, becauſe theſe <hi>Tables of ſtone</hi> were
broken in pieces by <hi>Moſes</hi> ſoon after<note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 32. 19</note>, and yet the law ſtood firme,
and obedience hath been given unto it untill this day.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence in the Major cannot reaſonably be doubted or
denied. For doubtleſſe there is as much, (if not much more) reaſon,
to judge thoſe <hi>two Tables,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are ſaid to have bin <hi>the work of God,</hi> &amp;
the writing in them, <hi>the writing of God graven upon the Tables</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 32. 16</note>, to have
been the <hi>foundation</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> written in them, and of the obedience
either due, or exhibited unto it; as there is to judge any book what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
either written, or printed, by the hands of men, to be the
<hi>foundation</hi> of that <hi>Religion,</hi> the grounds and principles whereof are
declared in it, and no more but declared: eſpecially confidering that
this <hi>Declaration</hi> hath (as hath been ſaid) been formerly made by God
without any ſuch book, and might be made again by him, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:161817:22"/>
yea and (doubtleſſe) would be made, if there were any juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
or neceſſity for it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Sect. 44</note> 
                  <hi>If any booke, or bookes whatſoever, Bible or other, be the true
and proper foundation of Religion, then is not the true and proper founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of religion neceſſarily uniform, and conſiſtent in all things with it ſelfe.</hi>
The reaſon of this Propoſition is, becauſe it is very poſſible that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through negligence, ignorance, want of memory, or the like, in
Scribes, and Correctors of the Preſſe, ſome ſuch error may be found
in every copie of the Scriptures now extant in the world, which will
render this copie contradictious to it ſelfe; yea it is poſſible, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch errors as this may be found in the beſt and trueſt copies that
are. I now aſſume:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the true and proper foundation of religion, is neceſſarily uniform and
conſiſtent in all things with it ſelfe. Ergo.</hi> If this Propoſition be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious,
<hi>the true and proper foundation of Religion</hi> muſt be divided
in, and againſt it ſelfe: and how then (according to our Saviours
own Maxime and Rule, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 25.) can either it, or the Religion
built upon it, ſtand?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 45.</note> If any booke or bookes, Bible, or other, bee the true and proper
foundation of Religion, Then is the foundation of Religion ſomewhat that
is viſible, and expoſed to the outward ſenſes of man. <hi>This needs no proof,
unleſſe Mr.</hi> Jenkin <hi>will deny, that Bibles, or the Scriptures, are legible,
and may be ſeen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But certain it is, That the true and proper foundation of Religion, is
not any thing that is viſible, or expoſed to the outward ſenſes of men; but
ſomewhat that is ſpirituall, and apprehenſible onely by the mind and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of men. Ergo.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this propoſition is, if <hi>the proper foundation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
be the object of the outward ſenſe, then is there nothing neceſſary
to be beleeved by any man to make him truly religious, but what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he ſees with his eyes, handles with his hand, or the like. For he
that beleeves or builds upon, <hi>the true and proper foundation of Religion,</hi>
(queſtionleſſe) is truly religious. But men are not made <hi>truly religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
by beleeving onely what they ſee with their outward ſenſe of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
otherwiſe, every man or woman, that did but look into a Bible,
and ſee ſuch and ſuch words and ſentences written, or printed there,
and beleeved accordingly, that theſe words and ſentences were here
written or printed, muſt needs hereby become <hi>truly religious.</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if men may be made <hi>truly religious,</hi> onely by looking into a Bible,
ſeeing what is there written, or printed, and by beleeving that what
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:161817:23"/>
he ſees there written, or printed, is indeed there written or printed
accordingly, Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> hath ſmal reaſon to deny, but that a <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man hath power to ſupernaturall good;</hi> at leaſt if he judgeth true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to be ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 46.</note> the true and proper foundation of Religion is intrinſecally,
eſſentially, and in the nature of it, unchangeable, unalterable in the leaſt,
by the wills, pleaſures, or attempts of men.</p>
               <p>But there is no book or books whatſoever, Bible or other, but in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of them may be altered or changed by men. Ergo.</p>
               <p>For the Major, <hi>If the proper foundation of Religion,</hi> were intrinſecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
&amp; in the nature of it, changeable and alterable by men, then can
it not be any matter of truth; becauſe the nature of truth is like the
nature of God himſelfe, unchangeable, unalterable by Men, Angels,
Devils, or any creature whatſoever: yea God himſelfe cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it, any whit more than <hi>deny himſelfe,</hi> or change his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Being.</p>
               <p>For the Minor, that alſo is no leſſe evident: Experience teacheth
us, that bookes, or Bibles themſelves, are <hi>de facto</hi> changed and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by men from time to time; every new Edition, or Impreſſion (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt)
commending it ſelfe for ſomewhat corrected or amended in
it, which was delinquent or defective in the former: And if Mr. <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi>
be not diſſenſed altogether, he cannot but know, that <hi>à facto ad
poſſibile, efficax eſt illatio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly (and laſtly</hi>) If the Bible,<note place="margin">Sect. 47.</note> or Scripture (in the ſenſe formerly
explained) be the true and proper foundation of Religion, it muſt bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
and meant, either of the Bible and Scriptures, as in the Originall
languages onely, or onely as tranſlated into other languages, or as both.</p>
               <p>But it is neither true, that the Bible or Scriptures in the Originall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
onely, nor onely as tranſlated into others, nor as both, are this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Religion. Ergo.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> will ſay, that they are the <hi>foundation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
onely as they are in the originall languages, then they that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not theſe languages, cannot build, (at leaſt with underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
upon this foundation: and conſequently can never be truly <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.</hi>
If ſo, what will become of Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> own Religion?</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the Bible, or Scripture, be the foundation we ſpeake
of, onely as tranſlated into other languages; then it is alike unpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
that any <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Grecian,</hi> who underſtands onely the language
wherein he was born, ſhould become truly religious.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) if they he this <hi>foundation,</hi> in both the ſaid
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:161817:23"/>
confiderations and reſpects, or as well in the one, as the other, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently;
then two things, or more, in completeneſſe of being, really
and ſpecifically differing one from another, and between themſelves,
may notwithſtanding be one and the ſame identicall and numericall
thing. This conſequence is evident upon theſe two ſuppoſitions:
1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That the <hi>foundation of Religion</hi> is but one and the ſame numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.
2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That Bibles, or the Scriptures, in ſeverall languages dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſpecifically amongſt themſelves. Both theſe ſuppoſitions are preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
enough in Truth. For 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. If the <hi>foundation of Religion</hi> were
not numerically and identically the ſame, then men by becomming,
or by being made <hi>Religious,</hi> ſhould multiply <hi>foundations of religion:</hi>
yea, and <hi>foundations</hi> in this kind ſhould both increaſe, and decreaſe,
in their number, as the number of perſons <hi>Religious,</hi> either encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
or decreaſeth. Which though it looks like an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of
Maſter <hi>Ienkin's</hi> learning and wit, yet is ſufficiently ridiculous to an
underſtanding man.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That Bibles, or the Scriptures, in ſeverall languages, differ
ſpecifically, amongſt themſelves, is evident likewiſe. For two things,
or more, which differ more then numerically, muſt needs differ ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically
(at leaſt) there being no middle or third kinde of difference
between that which is numericall, and that which is ſpecifical. Now
certain it is, that an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible (for example) and a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Bible
(and ſo an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible, and a Latine) differ more then numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
the one from the other; becauſe they differ more than either
two <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bibles, or two Spaniſh Bibles, differ from one another;
and yet theſe differ numerically the one from the other.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Ienkin</hi> by <hi>the advice of the learned</hi> (by which Mr. <hi>Vicars,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 48.</note> if
he and his ſpeak Truth, compoſed his learned picture, and Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill)
ſhall here anſwer, that two things, which differ only numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
may yet differ more between themſelves, then either of them
differs from ſome third, which differs from neither of them more
than numerically: ſo that every difference which is more then nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall;
is not neceſſarily ſpecificall: as a man that is learned, differs
more from a natural Idiot, than either of them differs from a ſober
man without learning; yet it followes not from hence, that any of
theſe three men differ from other ſpecifically, they being all men
properly and univocally; I anſwer,</p>
               <p>That every difference which is more then numerical, muſt needs
be ſpecificall, in one kind or other; i. muſt needs argue a difference
in ſome things (at leaſt) which ſpecifically differ one from the other,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:161817:24"/>
though not neceſſarily in any thing which is eſſential to the things,
or perſons, which are ſaid thus to differ. As for example: a learned
man differs not from an idiot, or ignorant man, in any thing which
is eſſentially requiſite to the nature, and ſimple being of a man: theſe
have a humane body, and an humane ſoule (which is all that is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially
requiſite to the ſimple being of a man) as well as he. But
yet he differs from them both in the endowment of learning: which
learning differs ſpecifically both from the ignorance, which is in the
one; and the incapacity of knowledge, which is in the other. Such
differences as theſe, the Logicians call ſpecifical, but not ſimply ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical,
but ſpecifical accidental, or, <hi>in ſpecie accidentali.</hi> This confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
the exception mentioned is of no value againſt the argument,
which it pretends to oppoſe. For though the difference betweene an
<hi>Hebrew Bible,</hi> and a <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> be but ſpecifical accidental, i. in reſpect
of the two ſpecifically different languages, wherein they are written,
neither of theſe being eſſential to the booke, which we call the Bible,
or the Scriptures; yet ſuch a difference as this is ſufficient to prove,
that they cannot be one and the ſame thing numerically, either Bible
or Scriptures: and conſequently, neither <hi>diviſim,</hi> nor <hi>conjunctim,</hi> the
proper <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi> which (as was lately proved) is nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically
one and the ſame. As though the difference which is in point
of learning, and ignorance, between two men, the one of them being
learned, the other ignorant, be not ſufficient to prove that they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſpecifically eſſentially the one from the other; yet being ſufficient
to prove that they differ ſpecifically accidentally, it is abundantly
ſufficient to prove that they differ numerically, and cannot poſſibly
be, or make, one and the ſame perſon.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> (I truſt) before he baul,<note place="margin">Sect. 49.</note> or brays againſt me any more,
as a man erroneous for denying <hi>the Scriptures to be the foundation of
Religion,</hi> will vouchſafe to anſwer theſe 8. arguments, &amp; that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-like,
not after that ſmal-ſenſe rate, at which he hath written in
his <hi>buſie Biſhop.</hi> Or if he had rather clamour, then clerk it, or ſhall
do only the one, becauſe hee hath no good faculty at the other, I
ſhall apply that ſoft and gentle remedy (good both for him, and my
ſelfe) neglect.</p>
               <p>Before I leave the particular in hand, I muſt needs (for the credit
of my Antagoniſt, being but a young beginner) acquaint the Reader
with that <hi>Hercule in</hi> and ſignall argument of his (<hi>page</hi> 22.) being the
quinteſſence, and ſpiritfull extraction of many pages; yea of all hee
argueth againſt me about the Scriptures. <hi>How can any</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:161817:24"/>
the matter and ſubſtance of the Scripture, to be the word of God, when
as he muſt be uncertaine, whether the written Word, or Scriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the matter is contained, are the word of God, or no?</hi> But is not this a
queſtion of the ſame profound calculation, with this: How can a
man believe that the <hi>Sun</hi> is a <hi>greater light,</hi> and the Moone a <hi>leſſer,</hi> if
he be <hi>uncertaine,</hi> whether every jot and tittle of what is read in our
Bible, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 16. be <hi>the word of God, or no;</hi> becauſe here it is ſaid, and
<hi>God made two great lights, the greater, &amp;c?</hi> Or with this: How can
a man believe, that there are any ſuch ſeaſons in the yeare, as <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and Winter,</hi> if he <hi>muſt be uncertaine,</hi> whether that be the word of
God, or no, Pſal. 74. 17. <hi>Thou haſt made ſummer and winter?</hi> If there
be no meanes poſſible, to <hi>believe</hi> the <hi>matter and ſubſtance of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
if a man <hi>be uncertaine whether the written word or Scriptures, (i.</hi>
whether every thing, ſentence, phraſe, word, ſyllable, letter, point
that is found in our printed Bibles: for this muſt be his meaning, if
he meanes to argue againſt me) <hi>be the word of God, or no,</hi> miſerable is
the faith of Maſter <hi>Jenkin,</hi> yea miſerable is the faith of the whole
world. For what aſſurance can any man have, that the Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Bible heretofore, and the Printers of them of later times,
have in nothing miſtaken, or miſcarried about them? Are Scribes
and Printers, Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> his <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> or doth he not
veſt in them the infallibility of the immediate pen-men of the
holy Ghoſt? If the knowledge and faithfulneſſe, or unerringneſſe
of Printers and Tranſcribers, be the <hi>foundation</hi> of Maſter <hi>Jenkin's</hi>
Faith, I confeſſe that hee and I build upon two very different <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">Sect. 50.</note> if it be unpoſſible for mee to <hi>believe</hi> that <hi>the matter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Scriptures</hi> is <hi>the word of God,</hi> if I be <hi>uncertain whether the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
word be the word of God, or no;</hi> how came the Patriarchs, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men and women, who lived in the firſt two thouſand years of the
world, to <hi>believe it,</hi> ſince it was not only <hi>uncertain</hi> unto them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Bibles, or Scriptures, or <hi>word</hi> now <hi>written,</hi> were the <hi>word of
God, or no,</hi> but whether ſuch a <hi>word</hi> ſhould ever be <hi>written,</hi> or no?
Doubtleſſe the ſame way to bring me to <hi>believe,</hi> what they <hi>believed,</hi> is
as open before the glorious God at this day, as it was then; ſeeing
he hath not hedged it up, either againſt himſelfe, or me, with the
<hi>thrones</hi> of any threatning, or decree.</p>
               <p>Againe: though I willingly acknowledge (and prove it at large,
in my Treatiſe concerning the Divine Authority of the Scriptures)
that the manner of the phraſe and ſtyle of the Scriptures, is a rich
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:161817:25"/>
character of their <hi>Divinity,</hi> and a very conſiderable ground to prove
that they are <hi>the word of God;</hi> yet is not this character of equal weight
or power for ſuch a conviction, with the <hi>matter and ſubſtance</hi> of the
Scriptures. Therefore the nature, beauty, worth, weight, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of theſe (I meane, of the <hi>matter and ſubſtance of the Scriptures</hi>)
is ſufficient to perſwade, and bring men to believe, that they are <hi>the
word of God,</hi> or things which came from God, though they had not
the gracious and ſuper-added advantage of any thing in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
whereby to believe, that they, in reſpect of their language,
ſtile, and all particularities of expreſſion, were the word of God. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that were the <hi>matter and ſubſtance of the Scriptures</hi> underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
and faithfully declared and held forth, in any other Book or
writing, beſides the Scriptures, and which Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> himſelf would
not call <hi>the written word of God,</hi> there were no impoſſibility at all,
nor much improbability, but that conſidering men might come to
believe them to be <hi>the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet again:<note place="margin">Sect. 57.</note> Doth not the Scripture it ſelf plainly affirm and teach,

this <hi>kindneſſe or goodneſſe of God</hi> towards them, <hi>leadeth</hi> them to the

God will be gracious unto them, and forgive them their ſins:
in as much as without the knowledge or beliefe hereof, it is unpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

If this be ſo, then may men who are <hi>uncertaine</hi> whether <hi>the

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Sect. 52.</note> doth not the Scripture alſo as plainely affirme, that the

                  <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 1. 19, 20.</note>:
and yet further, that the Gentiles (without <hi>the written word</hi>) both

other things of like conſideration. Now I would gladly know
of Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> by his next, whether neither the <hi>power of God,</hi> nor <hi>the

<hi>How can any man believe the matter and ſubſtance of the Scriptures to be

or Scriptures, wherein the matter is contained, be the word of God, or no?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing more (as to the point in hand) I would gladly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of by Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> in his next, <hi>viz.</hi> what the ground-worke
and foundation of that Faith of his is, whereby he believes that every

be found in every Bible, or copie of the Scriptures, printed, or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
Original or Tranſlated, throughout the world, is the word of
God, or any part of it; conſidering 1. the manifold, yea and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
diſagreements that are generally known to be betweene many of
them: and 2. that the <hi>word of God</hi> is but one, alwayes uniforme, and
conſiſtent with it ſelfe, without the leaſt variation or change. It is
more than to be feared, that whilſt he pretends the eſtabliſhment of
men in the Faith of the Scriptures, hee ſpreads a ſnare in their way,
and ſteers a direct courſe to caſt them upon the quick-ſands of inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable
difficulties and uncertainties.</p>
               <p>Whereas I take my <hi>Teſtimonialiſts</hi> tardy,<note place="margin">Sect. 54.</note> in making it <hi>an infamous
and pernicious errour againſt the Divine Authority of Scriptures,</hi> to ſay
that a ſuperſtruction, is not a foundation, or that the act of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
being built upon <hi>the foundation of Religion, cannot be this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it ſelfe;</hi> with what <hi>acumen</hi> (thinke ye) doth this novice-underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker

Chriſt is the foundation, and therefore</hi> not any <hi>act of man, as</hi> the <hi>believing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:161817:26"/>
of</hi> the <hi>Scriptures, 'tis very falſe and feeble.</hi> What man! is it a very
<hi>falſe and feeble</hi> Argument, to infer, that becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> begat <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
therefore <hi>Iſaac</hi> was <hi>Abraham's</hi> Son? Or thus: <hi>Iſaac</hi> was the Son of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi>
therefore he was not the Son of <hi>Moſes;</hi> is this a <hi>falſe &amp; feeble

pregnancy and frame; The timber of an houſe, is part of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,

The <hi>Arminians</hi> affirme, that <hi>there is a ſupernaturall power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
upon the will, and that God by this means doth worke immediately
upon the will, &amp;c.</hi> They <hi>attribute all the praiſe of converſion to God,</hi> and
<hi>place the cauſe of mens diſobedience and unbeliefe in themſelves, &amp;c.</hi> They
acknowledge <hi>a neceſſity of ſpeciall grace unto perſeverance, &amp;c.</hi> I preſume
Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> concurs in all theſe, and in twenty things more, which
they teach: and why is not he an <hi>Arminian</hi> for joyning with them in
many things, if I muſt needs be an <hi>Arminian</hi> for joyning with them
in ſome few? eſpecially conſidering that upon a legitimate debate and
examination, ſome of thoſe things wherein he agrees with them, will
be found every whit as much, yea or more, erroneous than thoſe,
wherein my judgement fals in with theirs.</p>
               <p>But this ſtratagem of Maſter <hi>Jenkin</hi> in attempting to defame ſuch
Truths, as hee hath no mind ſhould be received, and to cauſe the
judgements and conſciences of weake men to loath them, by telling
them, that ſuch and ſuch opinions dwell in the tents of ſuch and ſuch
erroneous &amp; dangerous men, is but an old Papiſticall device, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they alſo endeavoured to render ſuch Truths of God, as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comportant
with their Intereſts, hatefull unto the weak and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
people amongſt them. Thus <hi>Prateolus</hi> (a great Popiſh Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeologer)
to render this chriſtian and ſound opinion as erroneous
and hereticall amongſt his party, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is lawfull for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to eate what meates he pleaſeth on any day, though the Church
ſhould forbid it, ſolemnly tells them, that it was the opinion of <hi>Jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
the Heretique. So to make them out of love with receiving the
Sacrament in both kinds, he tels them that it was the practiſe of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius</hi>
the Heretique. To defame the judgement and opinion of
thoſe, who deny Purgatory, he informs them that it was one of the
hereſies of <hi>Armeni</hi> to deny it. And it is an argument much inſiſted
upon by Popiſh writers, to bear off Proteſtants from that Doctrine of
Juſtification by Faith alone, that this was a Doctrine taught by <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Magus.</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenkin,</hi> the queſtion, with wiſe and conſidering
men, in matters of Faith is not, with whom we <hi>lovingly joyne hands,</hi>
but from whom wee unkindly <hi>with-draw hands.</hi> So that I ſeparate
not in an opinion from <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it concerns me not at
all with whom I <hi>joyne.</hi>

vindicate himſelfe thus: the accuſation of blasphemie, is as old as

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Sect. 48.</note> In going about to wreſt the paſſages cited by me from
Mr. <hi>Bucer,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> out of my hand, how
miſerably doth he flunder in quagmires of non-ſence and abſurdity!
Let us view him in this poſture once for all, <hi>page</hi> 37, 38. where wee
ſhall find him up to the eares in mud, ſtrugling and working with
his braine might and maine, to fetch off Mr. <hi>Balls</hi> words from my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.
Mr. <hi>Ball's</hi> words are theſe: <hi>No man is hindered from believing
through the difficulty or unreaſonableneſſe of the command, or through his
own ſimple infirmity, as being willing and deſirous to believe,</hi> but <hi>not able,
which inability deſerves piety: but his inability is of corruption &amp; wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
he doth not believe, becauſe he will not: he is unable, becauſe he doth
not covet, or deſire, which is inexcuſable.</hi> Well: how doth Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi>
waſh theſe words from all ſtaine and tincture of confederacie with
my opinion, which affirmeth, <hi>that men are not wholly deſtitute of all
power to doe what God requires of them as ſimply neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> &amp;
particularly <hi>to repent, and believe?</hi> In the might of his weakneſſe hee
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:161817:28"/>
riſeth up thus, p. 37. <hi>What is here that gives you the leaſt countenance in
your errors?</hi> Why (Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi>) who either ſaid, or thought, that
here was any thing of ſuch an import? I profeſſe ingenuouſly, I
know nothing written by any man whatſoever, that gives me <hi>the
leaſt countenance in any error.</hi> I cite the words, not ſo much by way
of countenance, either in any Error or Truth, as of concurrence, &amp;
this onely with Truth. But what childling, but Mr. <hi>Jenking,</hi> would
have raiſ'd the duſt of ſuch a ridiculous demand up ſuch an occaſion?
But it may be he redeemes his reputation by that which followeth:
if he doth, it is with a, <hi>nihil minus.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſaith, and that
truly, that unwillingneſſe to beleeve hinders a man from believing: but he
doth not ſay, that any man of himſelfe can be willing.</hi> But (Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi>)
when I tell you that Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Apples,</hi> why doe you (by way
of anſwer) tell me, that he doth not ſpeake of Oyſters? Who ever
ſaid, that any <hi>man of HIMSELFE could be willing to beleeve?</hi> Or
that Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> ſhould affirme any ſuch thing? The ridiculouſneſſe of
the expreſſion, <hi>a man cannot be willing,</hi> is enough to acquit any judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
man from the guilt of ſuch an aſſertion. But what if Mr. <hi>Ball</hi>
doth not ſay, that <hi>any man of HIMSELFE can be willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve?</hi>
Doth this hinder, but that he may ſay every whit as much as
I ſay, or as my opinion importeth? <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not ſay, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1.
that <hi>Babylon is fallen:</hi> but yet he ſaith, that <hi>in the beginning God made
Heaven and Earth.</hi> Therefore if the doctrine that lieth upon me, to
prove, be either this; <hi>There is a God:</hi> or this, God is the great Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
of the world, or the like, I may very properly, for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of either, cite <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>In the beginning God
made Heaven and Earth;</hi> though he doth not here ſay, that, <hi>Babylon
is fallen.</hi> Where did Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> ever meet with any ſuch aſſertion or
opinion of mine, as this; that <hi>Man of HIMSELFE</hi> can <hi>be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to beleeve?</hi> As <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſometimes ſaid to the Jewes, <hi>If I ſhould ſay, I
know him not, I ſhould be a lyar like unto you</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">John 8. 55.</note>: So ſay I to Mr. <hi>Jenkin;</hi>
If I ſhould ſay or hold, that <hi>Man of himſelf could be willing to beleeve,</hi>
I ſhould be as abſurdly erroneous as He and his partners are in many
of their Doctrines. My ſenſe and opinion (as to the point in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
is this: that naturall men have ſuch endowments from God, and
ſuch a gracious aſſiſtance, or concurrence of God with them for the
acting of theſe endowments in order to repentance, and beleeving,
that did they act according to their power, &amp; means vouchſafed unto
them, they might <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>beleeve.</hi> As for any will, or willingneſſe
in ſuch men, to do either (I mean, either to repent, or to beleeve) I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:161817:28"/>
aſſerted it: much leſſe, that they had any ſuch will, or willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as this, of <hi>themſelves.</hi> My opinion (as to this particular) scltar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this: That upon the firſt motion &amp; riſing up of the will, in a true
and reall willingneſſe to repent and beleeve, men ceaſe to be any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<hi>Naturall men,</hi> and become regenerate, God in this caſe accepting
the will for the deed. Now whether Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> (in the words cited by
me) doth not in cleare and pregnant importance, ſay every whit as
much as this, let men without braſſe on their forehead, and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in their eyes, judge. <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is hindered from beleeving,
through the difficulty, or unreaſonableneſſe of the command.</hi> Certainly,
a man hath power to doe that, from the doing whereof he is not
<hi>hindered</hi> by any <hi>difficulty</hi> relating to the performance of it. If the
<hi>command</hi> of God, wherein he commands men to beleeve, hath no
ſuch <hi>difficulty</hi> in it, whereby they are <hi>hindered</hi> from obeying it, have not
men power to obey it, and conſequently to <hi>beleeve?</hi> Beſides, though
Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> doth not ſay, that <hi>Naturall men of themſelves cannot be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to beleeve</hi> (no more than I ſay it) yet he ſaith that, which clearly
ſuppoſeth, that ſuch men want no power, no not of being <hi>willing,</hi> or
of making themſelves <hi>willing,</hi> to beleeve. For if there be no ſuch <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty</hi>
in the <hi>Command</hi> he ſpeaks of, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> naturall men, are, or need
be <hi>hindered</hi> from obeying it, it muſt needs follow, that there is no ſuch
<hi>difficulty</hi> in it neither, but that ſuch men may be <hi>willing</hi> to obey it; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as there is an abſolute impoſſibility for men to act or do that
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is unpoſſible for them to <hi>wil.</hi> Men indeed may ſuffer, what it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
they ſhould be willing, or make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves willing, to ſuffer: but
they cannot be ſaid to act or do, or to be able to act or do, but onely
what is poſſible for them to <hi>wil,</hi> or to make themſelves <hi>willing,</hi> to do.
And this is the <hi>apex</hi> &amp; utmoſt point of what I hold touching <hi>the natural
mans free will, or power to good ſupernaturall:</hi> wherein it is moſt evident
either that Mr. <hi>Balls</hi> judgement was fully commenſurable with mine;
or elſe incommenſurable with his own words. Beſides, when Mr.
<hi>Ball</hi> ſaith; <hi>That a man doth not beleeve, becauſe he will not,</hi> hee
doth not reſolve his non-beleeving, or unbeliefe, into any weakneſſe,
or deficiency of power in him, to <hi>will,</hi> or to make himſelfe willing,
(as Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> would imply:) but into his <hi>will</hi> it ſelfe, into the
actuall and preſent frowardneſſe and indiſpoſition of his will, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
whereof it voluntarily chuſeth to continue in unbeliefe, whereas
the nature of it is ſuch, yea and the grace of God in conjunction
with it is ſuch, yea and a thouſand ingagements upon it, and
motives round about it, are ſuch, that it both ought, and might, as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:161817:29"/>
voluntarily chuſe the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> a purpoſe and reſolution to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
or (which is the ſame) to ſteere an effectuall courſe of meanes
for believing.</p>
               <p>But juſt ſuch work as he makes in interpreting Mr. <hi>Balls</hi> words,<note place="margin">Sect. 59.</note> to
demonſtrate their non-concurrence with me in my opinion, (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
much worſe) he makes alſo in a like attempt upon the paſſages
cited by me from <hi>M. Bucer,</hi> and ſuch work as hee makes in this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
through the ſteadineſſe and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> of his hand, he makes
the like in conſtruing my citations from the Fathers. As it is ſaid of
<hi>Joſhua,</hi> that <hi>as he had done to Hebron, and Libnah, and to her King, ſo hee
did to Debir and her King</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ioſh. 10. 39.</note>: ſo doth Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> ſtrike the ſame unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
ſtroke in dealing with all my quotations: as he deales by M. <hi>Ball,</hi>
and his words, ſo he deals by M. <hi>Bucer</hi> and his words; and ſo again,
with <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and his words, and with <hi>Hierome</hi> and his words: hee
leaves nothing of their native ſenſe, or ſavour remaining. To inſiſt
upon the particularities of every ſtory, were to require more in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of the Reader, than I could recompence him in weight or
worth of matter.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Sect. 60.</note> whereas he troubles himſelfe with quoting ſeverall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
out of Mr. <hi>Ball, Bucer, Auſtin, &amp;c.</hi> of a contrary import
(as he after his weak manner imagineth) to that opinion, which I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
to be aſſerted by them in the paſſages cited (reſpectively) by me,
I would gladly know of him, what is the <hi>diſtinct ſound</hi> that this <hi>trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
maketh:</hi> or to what part he intends to ſaile with this wind. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
I am, that what he doth in this kinde, hath no manner of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
in it to diſable the pertinency of the words or paſſage cited by
me, in regard of my purpoſe or intendment in theſe citations. My in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and drift in citing theſe Authors, was not to prove, or ſo much
as to inſinuate, that they no where elſe in their writings delivered
themſelves with any ſeeming contrariety, to the ſubſtance or import
of the reſpective places cited by me; but onely to ſhew and prove,
that the opinion aſſerted by me in oppoſition to Mr. <hi>Jenkin,</hi> and his
<hi>Teſtimonying</hi> Conſiſtory, was neither ſo irrationall, nor ſo farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from truth, but that men of worth, of ſound judgement, and
much learning, formerly had embraced it; yea, and had left it upon
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:161817:29"/>
record in their writings, that they judged it to be a truth; at leaſt
that they thus judged, when they made the record. So that unleſſe
Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> can prove, out of the writings of Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> M. <hi>Bucer, &amp;c.</hi>
that they were at that time, when they wrote thoſe reſpective paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
cited by me, of a contrary judgement to the tenor, purport, and
contents of them, hee ſhall but beat the aire in any attempt what
ſoeuer to ſeparate between me, and my end, in theſe citations.
What the genuine and proper tendency of theſe his counter quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
is, is elſewhere declared, and proved to be nothing elſe, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the breaking (as it were) the bones, and ſtrength of the authority
of theſe Authors, and conſequently, the eaſing of the Truth (in
many points) of the burthen and weight of their <hi>Authority,</hi>
which lies heavie upon her, and keeps her from lifting up her head
in the world, with ſo much freedome and diſpatch, as otherwiſe (in
all likelihood) ſhe might doe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Sect. 61.</note> if the information were worth a Readers time to peruſe,
it were eaſie to ſhew, how irrelative to his purpoſe, the greateſt part
(if not the whole number) of all his quotations are; there being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few of them (if any) but that, Reaſon, and good Grammar, and
Lexicons, being the Interpreters, I can willingly ſubſcribe unto. And
yet how conſiderable a part of his inconſiderable Pamphlet, labours

               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">Sect. 62.</note> how like himſelfe is he, and acts he, in telling me, that

the <hi>Scriptures</hi> made uſe of by them both, and that much more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,

Will he ſay that the Scriptures become <hi>threed bare</hi> by being ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

any of the illuſtrious ſayings of his book, were quoted a thouſand
times over by a thouſand men, I beleeve he would not complaine of
their being made <hi>threed-bare</hi> hereby. Howſoever the queſtion is not
(among wiſe men, whatſoever it may be among <hi>Novices</hi> and ſhuttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads)
whether <hi>quotations</hi> have <hi>been</hi> oft <hi>uſed,</hi> or no, nor yet by whom

evident, both from the context it ſelfe, where this expreſſion ſtands,
and alſo from the frequent tenor of Scripture-expreſſion elſe-where,
that by being <hi>dead in ſins and treſpaſſes,</hi> the Apoſtle only meanes, that
they were guilty of death, or liable to condemnation, for thoſe <hi>ſins
and treſpaſſes, wherein in times paſt they had walked.</hi> For 1. this their
death in <hi>ſins and treſpaſſes,</hi> is explained, by their being <hi>children of
wrath,</hi> verſ. 3. 2. That <hi>quickning together with Chriſt,</hi> oppoſed to
this <hi>death,</hi> as a remedie to a diſeaſe, is interpreted, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13. to be
<hi>the forgiveneſſe of their ſins and treſpaſſes.</hi> Both which plainly ſhew,
that the death ſpoken of by the Apoſtle in the place which Mr. <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi>
citeth, is not a <hi>death,</hi> which either ſtandeth in, or which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
implyeth, an utter impotency in men to believe, but which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
in guilt, and obnoxiouſneſſe unto death. 3. The Scripture
oft expreſſeth the eſtate and condition of guilt, by the term, <hi>death.</hi>
See Gen. 20. 3. 2 Sam. 9. 8. 16. 9. 19. 28. Rom. 8. 10. 2 Cor. 5. 14.
1 Tim. 5. 6, &amp;c. And for thoſe other Scriptures, Joh. 14. 17. Rom.

here brought upon the ſtage by him.</p>
               <p>4. (And laſtly) that <hi>death in ſinnes and treſpaſſes</hi> here ſpoken of,
whatſoever, is meant by it, is not aſſerted or repreſented by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
as the condition of a meer naturall man, or of men conſidered as
naturall: but of men who have actually, and for a long time lived in
diſobedience againſt God, contrary to the effect of the Law, written
in their hearts by the finger of God, is evident from the expreſſe

<hi>Among whom alſo we all had our converſation in time paſt, &amp;c.</hi> So that
from this place (however) nothing can be inferr'd concerning any
defect, or want of power to believe, in meer naturall men; though
ſuch an inference ſhould be yielded againſt ſuch men, who have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted

reaſoneth otherwiſe, to prove my opinion a delinquent againſt the
Truth, appears by the conſtant tenor of his arguing, wherein he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth

                  </gap> Maſter <hi>Jenkin</hi> thus: Sir, If you be able to travail upon your ten
toes within 3. or 4. dayes to a place an hundred miles off, where you
muſt appeare by that time, or elſe you are a dead man, though you
be lazie, and perhaps as willing to dye, as to take the paines of ſuch a
journey: <hi>what place is there left</hi> for the kindneſs of any of your friends
to accommodate you with a wel-going horſe, or Coach for your
journey? A man may have power of doing, yea and of willing, that,
which yet, left unto himſelfe, he neither will ever actually will, nor
doe. So that notwithſtanding ſuch a <hi>power</hi> as Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> ſtriketh at
in the dark, yet there <hi>is place</hi> enough for all that <hi>Grace</hi> of God, which
the Apoſtle attributes unto him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. In <hi>working both to will, &amp;
to doe</hi> in men, <hi>of his good pleaſure.</hi> Yea if Mr. <hi>Ienkin</hi> would quit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
like a man, &amp; reaſon home, in ſtead of hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e way (like a child)
he would manifeſtly perceive, that there is a farre larger <hi>place left for
grace,</hi> by that opinion, which he calls error, then by that, which he
ſeekes to enthrone in ſtead of it: and this in more reſpects then one.
For 1. as he is a farre greater ſinner, who knowes how to doe well,
and hath all things neceſſary thereunto, and yet doth evill, than he
that doth evill, having no power at all to doe well: ſo is it a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
act of <hi>Grace</hi> to forgive the ſin of the former, than of the latter.
Now the latter is Maſter <hi>Jenkin</hi> his Sinner, and the former, mine.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:161817:33"/>
2. For God to give a man ſtrength and power to believe, twice over,
or after a forfeiture made by ſinne and wickedneſſe, of the firſt dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is an act of more grace, than to conferre them onely once, and
that without any ſuch provocation. Now Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> his opinion
<hi>leaves place</hi> onely for this latter act of grace, which is farre the leſſer;
whereas my opinion, makes roomth for the former, which is the
greater. 3. (And laſtly) to ſave greater ſinners, is an act of more
grace, or of Greater Grace, than to ſave leſſer. Now whether
that opinion which preſents men impenitent and unbeleeving before
God under a ſufficiency of grace, and meanes otherwiſe, both to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and beleeve, doth not preſent them as farre greater ſinners,
than Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> opinion doth, which denies them ſo much as a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
to doe either, I referre to Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> himſelfe with the fagge
end of reaſon and underſtanding, which is left him, to conſider, and
(if he pleaſe) determine. In the meane time, had not the man (think
ye) a prodigie of provocation upon him, to cry out, <hi>What place is
here left for grace? What agreement with the Apoſtle?</hi> It ſeemes there
is no agreement between Wood and Trees, in Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick;
nor any <hi>place left</hi> for ſo much as one man to ſtand, where there
is ſpace enough for an hundred. Surely Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> Theology is like
his Philoſophy, who would undertake to argue and make good this
Poſition;

I muſt make ſuch an anſwer as that, to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> demand, <hi>Who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

                  </gap>; i.
For who makes thee to differ; or, who ſeparates thee (as the former
tranſlation had it) But firſt, how doth my opinion, which onely
ſaith, that <hi>by the improvement of Nature a man may attain to ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
upon which ſaving converſion followes,</hi> neceſſarily lead me to
ſuch an anſwer to the Apoſtles queſtion, as this young <hi>Simplicius</hi>
will needs thruſt into my mouth? Muſt Mr. <hi>Jenkin,</hi> becauſe he hath
a paire of long legges, needs walk as far in a day as they are able to
carry him? or is it <hi>not far from blaſphemy</hi> to ſay, that it is poſſible
for him to ride on an horſe, becauſe he is able enough to go on foot?
Or doth he in every kind, whatſoever he is able to doe? If ſo, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
I am, that his ability in arguing, or drawing conſequences, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſcant.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Sect. 67.</note> in caſe it were true, that <hi>a man by the improvement of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
hath</hi> [actually, and <hi>defacto] attained ſuch a conviction, upon which
ſaving converſion followes;</hi> doth it follow from hence, that therefore
this attainment muſt needs bee reſolved into himſelfe, or his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
as the ſole or primary cauſe hereof? For (ſuppoſing that the
Apoſtle here ſpeakes of ſuch <hi>differing</hi> which is made by beleeving)
that his queſtion doth not intend to exclude the creature it ſelf from
ing the cauſe [in a ſence, <hi>viz.</hi> in a way of inferior, ſubordinate, and
dependent efficiencie, or cauſality] of its <hi>differing,</hi> or ſeparation here
ſpoken of, is evident from hence; viz. becauſe this <hi>differing,</hi> or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his from others, either conſiſteth in, or is cauſed by, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.
So then, if it be the creature it ſelfe, and not God, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth,
then is it the creature it ſelfe, and not God, which [thus far,
and in this reſpect] <hi>maketh</hi> it ſelfe to <hi>differ.</hi> But it ſeems by Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi>
his Logico-divinity, that if Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> ſhould ſay, that he beleeveth,
<hi>it would not be farre from blaſphemy;</hi> Poſſibly it might not <hi>bee farre</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:161817:34"/>
from untruth: but as for any affinity or neerneſſe unto <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> it
may (I ſuppoſe) be meaſured by the neighbourhood of the Eaſt to
the Weſt. Therefore it is as clear as the light, that the Apoſtle in this
demand, <hi>Who maketh thee to differ?</hi> (ſuppoſing, as before, that he here
ſpeakes of any ſaving <hi>difference</hi> between man and man) intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to put the creature upon this conſideration and acknowledgment,
<hi>viz.</hi> that God, and God onely, was the originall, prime, and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
cauſe of that happy eſtate and condition, by the attainment
and enjoyment whereof, he differed from all others, who had not
attained it; not to occaſion him to confeſſe or acknowledge, that
himſelfe could in no ſenſe, or conſideration at all, be looked upon as
the cauſe thereof. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) evident it is,<note place="margin">Sect. 68.</note> to him that will but view the
context, that the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak here of any <hi>difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
man and man, which is made by <hi>Faith,</hi> or by any ſaving work
in either; but of ſuch a <hi>difference</hi> onely which ſtands in more and
fewer, or in greater and leſſer gifts: which kinde of difference in the
primitive times, was very frequent, between perſons, who were parata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
in all things ſaving, one with another. And that God indeed, is
not onely the principall, but the ſole cauſe of ſuch <hi>differings</hi> as theſe
between men and men, is more evident, than to be matter of doubt
or queſtion unto any man. But how, or wherein, doth the Apoſtles
queſtion, thus underſtood, relate unto my opinion, concerning the
<hi>power of naturall man to good ſupernaturall?</hi> If M. <hi>Jenkin</hi> underſtand
Scripture no better than thus, (which it ſeemes, by many other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreted
places in his pamphlet, he doth not) certainly the <hi>Chalk
and Coales in Corners,</hi> are more wholſome nouriſhment, than the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges</hi>
and <hi>Quailes</hi> that are cook'd and <hi>fed upon</hi> in the pompous
Baſilique neere <hi>Newgate,</hi> not ſo properly, as commonly, termed
<hi>Chriſts-church:</hi> unleſſe (haply) the Epiſcopall conſecration of the
place, be a ſtanding antidote againſt all infection and unwholſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Doctrine, that ſhall be delivered there. I have good ground
to beleeve, that the perſons which he pities, as <hi>feeding upon Chalk and
Coals in corners,</hi> will by the goodneſſe of their food, and bleſſing of
God upon it, be nouriſhed up to <hi>eternall life,</hi> when as the wrath of
God (I feare) would come upon the quail-eaters in Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> his

the firſt, that unleſſe ſuch an anſwer be given to the firſt, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth

is, <hi>Whether I mean, that grace is an adjutory by way of influence into the

as appoſed me with his firſt queſtion: For whether it bee the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundneſſe
of the queſtion, or the ſhallowneſſe of my apprehenſion, I

each heaving at his reſpective end, &amp; lifting up the work like a peece

than this? <hi>As two men</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that between them both carry a burthen,

that if by a <hi>Phyſicall influence upon the will,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> meaneth any
other kinde of working or acting upon it by God, than by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of the Word, or then that which is proper to bee wrought

in men, either apart from the word, or in any other way, or after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other maner than thoſe, wherein the word may be ſaid properly,
&amp; according to the nature and frame of it, to communicate &amp; to have
part in the action, I deny any <hi>Phyſicall influence of grace upon the will,</hi>
in the act of converſion. It paſſeth my underſtanding to conceive,
how the will ſhould be wrought or acted into a conſent in any kind,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:161817:36"/>
otherwiſe than by argument, motive, or perſwaſion; unleſſe it be by
force, violence, or compulſion; which Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> himſelfe will not
heare of: yea, the truth is, I do not well underſtand, how any other
force, violence, or compulſion it ſelfe can do it, but only that, which
conſiſts either in the weight, or proportion of an argument or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
one, or more: or elſe in the effectuall explication, urging, and
preſſing of ſuch arguments. As the naturall frame and ſtructure of
a man, renders him uncapable of ſpeaking by any force, or courſe of
violence whatſoever, otherwiſe than by opening his mouth; yea, and
of ſpeaking, though his mouth be opened, without the conſent of
his will: ſo doth the eſſentiall conſtitution and fabrick of the will,
exempt it from a capacity of being drawn or brought into a conſent
by any other meanes, method, or way whatſoever, but onely that of
argument, motive and perſwaſion. Again, it no whit leſſe paſſeth my

theſe works be wrought in men, by any ſuch kind of action, or work,
which immediatly reacheth the will, and wherein it is unpoſſible that

<hi>Phyſicall;</hi> more than it is poſſible for Iron and Clay to mix
and work together, or for the underſtanding and will of a man to

and quick in theſe difficulties, than mine, who am ſtricken in
yeares, and he pleaſe to open ſuch veins of truth unto me, whereof I
am ignorant, I ſhall willingly ſit at his feet to reap the benefit and
bleſſing of his head. But if by <hi>a Phyſicall influence of the will,</hi> he means
nothing elſe, but either an inward excitation of the ſoule, or <hi>opening
of the heart</hi> by the Spirit of God, whereby a man is made to mind, or
to attend unto the things of his peace, (as it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. that
the <hi>Lord opened the heart of Lydia, that ſhe attended unto the things ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

in the act of conſenting, and in all other acts requiſite hereunto, ſo
that a ſufficient light of conviction ſhining in the judgement or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
God ſuffereth nothing to intervene to the diſturbance
of the will, ſo as to prevent or hinder the regular motion thereof,
which, in ſuch a caſe, is to conſent: or 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> (and laſtly) if hee meanes
by his <hi>Phyſical influence,</hi> any ſuch repreſentation of things to the mind
or underſtanding of a man, whereby the will is brought over after
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:161817:36"/>
an effectuall and potent manner, to give up her ſelfe in conſent unto
them; I acknowledge a <hi>Phyſicall influence of Grace upon the will.</hi> But
the truth is, I doe not well underſtand what the man meaneth by
his <hi>Phyſicall influence</hi> (and am fully perſwaded that himſelfe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth
himſelfe as little in it, as I) ſo that I cannot give that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and diſtinct anſwer which upon a diſtinct explication of the
queree, I am ready to doe. But they that propound blind queſtions,
muſt expect anſwers accordingly. Onely let me add this further (in
the point in hand) that for any other <hi>Phyſicall influence</hi> upon the
will, than that which I have expreſſed and acknowledged, (which
I confeſſe to be very untowardly and unproperly ſo called) himſelfe
acknowledgeth none, at leaſt if he meanes as he ſaith, page 51. For
here (more like a reaſonable man, than himſelfe) he writeth thus:
<hi>To whatſoever object it [the will] is carried, it is not without the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
counſell of the practicall judgement. The will being a rationall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
never moveth but</hi> per modum judicij, <hi>upon apprehenſion of ſome
goodneſſe, to which it moves. Nor is it in any motions compulſorily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwayed,
but worketh according to its own proper motion, and to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its own nature.</hi> Surely he that ſaith theſe things, if he be of a
conſiſtent brain, doth not ſuppoſe the will capable of any other <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi>
in order to the moving of it, but onely that which is <hi>ſuaſory</hi>
and <hi>morall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> profundum,<note place="margin">Sect. 72.</note> 
                  <hi>or bottom of his querees, is this:</hi> If I grant that
Grace is certain, infallible, and determinative in its operation upon the
will; he deſires to know, whether I mean that this invincibility and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of the working of grace, be onely to be look'd upon as ſuch <hi>reſpectu
eventus,</hi> in regard of what doth fall out, and <hi>de facto</hi> doth come to paſſe,
or whether the certain determination of the will by grace, proceedeth from
the powerfull nature of that grace of God, which (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith) no hard
heart is able to refuſe. <hi>They that clearly underſtand this queſtion, may
give a cleare anſwer to it. All that I clearly underſtand of it, is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of abſurdities; what I conjecture of ſenſe in it, I ſhall give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
unto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, he maketh the <hi>invincibility and infallibility of the working of
grace,</hi> and <hi>the certain determination of the will by grace,</hi> to be one and
the ſame; whereas it is evident, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. that <hi>invincibility</hi> and <hi>infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
are but modifications of the act, or <hi>working of grace;</hi> whereas a
<hi>determination</hi> of the <hi>will,</hi> is either the <hi>act</hi> it ſelfe, or elſe (if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
paſſively) the product, or effect of ſuch an act.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:161817:37"/>
Secondly, he ſuppoſeth, that if there be an <hi>invincibility and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in grace,</hi> there muſt needs follow <hi>a certain determination of the
will by grace.</hi> Wherein <hi>Supponit quod non eſt ſupponendum</hi> (a misbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
very incident to novice Diſputants) For grace may be <hi>invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
and infallible</hi> in the working of it, i may <hi>invincibly and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
produce ſuch an effect in the ſoule, which anſweres the nature,
meaſure, and degree of it, and yet not neceſſarily produce <hi>a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
determination of the will</hi> to a ſaving conſent, or a through act of
beleeving.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Sect. 73.</note> is it not a very ridiculous queree, to demand, <hi>Whether the
certain determination of the will by grace, proceedeth from the powerfull na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of grace;</hi> conſidering firſt, that effects doe not proceed from the
natures of their cauſes, but from the actuall engagements of their
cauſes in a way of efficiencie, to produce them? 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That <hi>Grace</hi> is not
a naturall, but a voluntary or free working cauſe, and ſo doth not
neceſſarily act, or work, when it doth work, <hi>ad extremum potentiae,</hi>
to the uttermoſt extent of its power, but according to ſuch meaſures
and degrees of efficiencie, as it ſelfe pleaſeth. So that how <hi>powerfull</hi>
ſoever the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> be, it no way followes, that <hi>a certain deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the will</hi> muſt neceſſarily follow upon the motion, acting,
or working of it. It was the <hi>grace of God,</hi> which is ſo <hi>powerfull in the
nature</hi> of it (for God hath but one Spirit of grace, which is alwayes
in reſpect of his nature uniformly and equally <hi>powerfull</hi>) which
wrought upon the <hi>ſtiff necked</hi> and hard-hearted <hi>Jewes</hi> for many ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
generations; yet we know that they <hi>reſiſted</hi> this grace and
<hi>Spirit</hi> of God, neither were their <hi>wills</hi> penitently or ſavingly <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>

               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Sect. 74.</note> nor is there any over-plus of <hi>acumen</hi> in that diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
exhibited in this queree, between an <hi>invincibility and infallibility</hi>
of a cauſe, <hi>reſpectu eventus,</hi> in reſpect of the event, or effects, and the
<hi>powerfulneſſe of the nature</hi> of a cauſe. I doe not underſtand how a
cauſe may be termed <hi>invincible and infallible</hi> in reſpect of the event, or
effect, which is not very <hi>powerfull in the nature</hi> of it. But</p>
               <p>Fifthly (and laſtly) that which the young man would demand in
this <hi>Queree,</hi> as farre as my ſoule is able to enter into his ſecret, is
briefly this, whether the act, or worke of God, in, and about the
converſion of a man, be ſo ſtrong, powerfull, and over-hearing, as
to carry, or produce the effect of his actuall converſion, againſt all
the poſſibility that is in him to hinder it? If this be the intent of his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:161817:37"/>
queree, I anſwer: My ſenſe clearly is, that according to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
courſe of the grace of God acting, and working, in, and about the
converſion of men, there is no man actually converted, but might
poſſibly have acted, or demeaned himſelfe ſo, as never to have been
thus converted. The account of my judgement herein (for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent)
is briefly this: I conceive, that though the grace of God, acting
in, and towards the converſion of a man, ſubdues and takes away all
the actuall rebelliouſneſſe, or gainſayingneſſe of the will, yea and
poſſibly all inclination towards any rebellion in this kind, (which is
abundantly ſufficient as to his actuall converſion) yet it doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
or take away all poſſibility from the <hi>will</hi> of rebelling, or of
doing wickedly. Nor doe I apprehend how it is poſſible for the
will, either of men, or Angels, being a creature, ever to be made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
unto God, in ſo tranſcendent and glorious a priviledge &amp; perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as a non-poſſibility of ſinning, or doing wickedly. It is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and higheſt pitch of perfection competible to a created being, to be
like unto God in actuall holineſſe, in actuall hatred and deteſtation
of ſinne, in firm and ſtable reſolutions to continue holy for ever: but
for a ſimple and abſolute impoſſibibility to ſinne, I conceive it to bee
one of the incommunicable properties of God, as being ſimply and
abſolutely unchangeable. From hence then it undeniably (and <hi>ex
abundanti</hi>) followes, that even then, when God is ready (as it were)
with the hand of his grace lifted up to ſtrike that bleſſed ſtroke,
whereby a man is actually converted, there is a poſſibility in him to
hinder the work, or effect it ſelfe, of this converſion; inaſmuch as it
is impoſſible for any man to receive actuall converſion from God, in
any act of ſinne whatſoever. By the way, if I had as much a minde
to cry out againſt M. <hi>Jenkin</hi> for a <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> as he hath to clamour
out this <hi>Impiety</hi> againſt me; I have another manner of ground or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
now before me to call him a ſonne of this guilt, than ever hee
had to aſperſe me with ſuch an imputation. For is not he a <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer,</hi>
who claimeth part and fellowſhip in any of the incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
properties of God? Or doth not Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> made this <hi>Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi>
claim when he aſſerteth himſelfe under the ſame impoſſibility
of ſinning, with God? Or doth hee not aſſert ſuch an impoſſibility
as this to himſelfe, when he ſuppoſeth it impoſſible for him to ſinne,
when God is about to convert him?</p>
               <p>Beſides, if there be a poſſibility in man to ſinne after the worke of
grace and converſion wrought in him; certainly, and much more, is
there a poſſibility in him to ſinne at any time before ſuch a work. If
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:161817:38"/>
it be poſſible for a man to ſtumble in the day, much more poſſible is
it, that he may ſtumble in the night: And if a wiſe man may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen,
much more a weake and fooliſh. Now if there be a poſſibility
for a man to ſinne at any time before his converſion, then is there a
poſſibility in him alſo to hinder his coverſion; becauſe (as hath been
ſaid) it is unpoſſible for any man to be converted in, or under, an act
of ſinne: converſion it ſelfe ſtanding in ſuch an act, which includes
(at leaſt) an averſion from all ſinne (at leaſt in purpoſe, affection, and
deſire) which muſt needs be a act of righteouſneſſe. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſenſe in the point onely be, that a man being now converted, hath
no power to hinder his converſion, i. to prevent the doing of that,
which is done already, I know no man like to oppoſe him, unleſſe it
be in a dreame. And whether himſelfe doe not clearly acknowledge
a power or poſſibility in the will, to withſtand the work of converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
attempted by God, ſo as to prevent and hinder the actuall effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, I appeale to theſe words of his, <hi>page 52. Nay this efficacious
determination of the will by grace, is a moſt happy adjurory to it, TA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KING
NOTHING AWAY B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T THE PRAVITY
and rebellion of it, but preſerving and RESTORING ITS TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E
LIBERTY.</hi> Firſt, if grace in the act of converſion, <hi>takes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the will, but the pravity and rebellion of it,</hi> then it leaves it a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
or power of <hi>rebelling</hi> or <hi>depraving</hi> it ſelfe. For there is nothing
more evident, than that there may remain a liberty or power of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling</hi>
in the <hi>will,</hi> when the <hi>rebellion</hi> it ſelfe is taken away from it.
There was no <hi>rebellion</hi> in the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> during his innocence: but
yet there was a liberty or power in it to <hi>rebell:</hi> otherwiſe it could not
have rebelled afterwards. Again 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. if the <hi>adjutory of grace preſerves</hi>
and <hi>RESTORES the true liberty</hi> of the <hi>will unto it,</hi> then it inveſts
it with no other <hi>liberty,</hi> than that which was naturall to, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
inherent in it, i. to that <hi>liberty,</hi> wherein, and wherewith it was
created. Nothing can be ſaid to be <hi>reſtored,</hi> but what was formerly
poſſeſſed and enjoyed. And beſides, doubtleſſe that <hi>liberty</hi> wherein
the will was firſt created, is the <hi>true liberty</hi> thereof. Now then, if
<hi>grace,</hi> in, or about the act of converſion, veſteth no other <hi>liberty</hi> in
the will, but <hi>the true,</hi> native, originall <hi>liberty</hi> of it, wherein it was
created, moſt certain it is, that it leaves a <hi>liberty</hi> or power in it to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi>
and conſequently to oppoſe the work of converſion, even to the
fruſtration and defeature of it: inaſmuch as the <hi>true liberty,</hi> wherein
it was created, was none other <hi>liberty</hi> (as hath been ſaid) than what
left the will under a power or poſſibility of rebelling. This may

certaine that nothing in nature doth neceſſitate him to it: and

It were eaſie out of the ſame Treatiſe of this great <hi>Subſcriber,</hi> to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe

let men be <hi>encouraged</hi> to flie, to number the ſtars, to touch the moon,
&amp;c. Therefore (doubtleſſe) hee doth not judge <hi>believing</hi> a matter of

performance. And if <hi>God excludeth none</hi> [from believing] then hath
he not inflicted any ſuch puniſhment upon men for their ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi>

For certainely he that thruſts out a mans eyes, and doth not

                  <note n="a" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sib's</hi> ſouls conflict, <hi>page</hi> 162.</note>. This clearly implies, that neither the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of ſinning,</hi> nor the impotency of believing, under which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality

voluntarily contracted: and withall, that naturally they have power
to doe that, which, had they wills to doe, would prevent their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi>
Againe not long after: <hi>Our conſciences tell us to our faces,
that we might do more than we do to hinder ſin; and that when we ſin, it
is not through weakneſſe, but out of the wickedneſſe of our natures.</hi> If our

his, and no part of it, mine, in the cauſe depending, I deſire the

(being the words of our Engliſh Divines, members of this <hi>Synod) we
are to judge of thoſe adjutories</hi> or <hi>helps of grace, which are vouchſafed, and
adminſtred unto men, by the nature of the benefit that is offered, and by the
manifeſt word of God, not BY THE AB<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE OF THEM,
OR THE EVENT.</hi> If there can no judgement or eſtimace bee
<hi>made</hi> of the <hi>aids of grace</hi> (viz. in point of ſufficiency, or inſufficiency,
for the enabling of men to believe) either by the <hi>abu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e of them,</hi> or <hi>by the
event,</hi> then mens non-believing, or periſhing, is no argument or proof
at all, that they had not ſufficient meanes given unto them, whereby
to have prevented both the one and the other. Again, if they bee to
be meaſured or judged of (in the conſideration mentioned) by <hi>the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
offered</hi> in the Goſpel, which is forgiveneſſe of ſins, ſalvation, &amp;c.
then are they to be judged as ſufficiently efficacious for the enabling
men both to repent, and believe; in as much as without theſe the ſaid
<hi>benefits</hi> cannot be obtained. A little after they affirme; that there is
<hi>not the leaſt intimation in the Scripture, that God ever takes away the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
of Grace, or the aid of exciting Grace from any man once given unto
him in order to ſalvation, but for their preceding ſinne, and burying of it
through their own default.</hi> Yea and affirm this to have <hi>been the opinion
of the Orthodox Fathers, who had to doe with</hi> Pelagius: and accordingly
cite <hi>Auſtin</hi> for it. In which paſſage they cleerly ſuppoſe, 1. that men
who never come to believe, or to be ſaved, have a talent of grace
vouchſafed unto them by God in order to their ſalvation, (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

ſufficient, upon, and by improvement, to ſave them; and
if ſo, ſufficient alſo to make them believe) and 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. that the reaſon
why men doe not believe, and in fine come to be ſaved, is not any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
or with-holding of Grace ſufficient hereunto, on Gods part, but
their owne voluntary abuſe, or <hi>burying</hi> of it, being given unto them.
So that if theſe men be friends to their own principles, words, and
ſayings, they cannot be enemies to my opinion about the <hi>the power of
the naturall man to ſupernaturall good.</hi> If men will ſtagger, &amp; not ſtand
their owne ground, ſay, and unſay, affirme in premiſes, deny in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions,
I cannot help it. In the meane time, though many things
they ſay may be of worthy concernment for the cleering and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of many truths in Religion, yet is their ſimple vote or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in matters of Religion, of ſmall value.</p>
               <p>I preſume by this time I have ſatisfied Maſter <hi>Jenkin's</hi> deſire to the
full, and have given him <hi>out of the Orthodox,</hi> a ſufficient proportion of

citations and ſayings for the <hi>filling of halfe a page</hi> (unleſſe it be a page

are cleerly avouched, which the Grand Committee of <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi>
out of a deſire to enrich themſelves with the ſpoyles of my name and

leaſure and opportunity for a further ſearch into the writings, both
of theſe, and other learned men amongſt us, of reputation enough
to be counted <hi>Orthodox,</hi> might <hi>fill many pages</hi> with quotations of a

               <p>I now expect, that Mr. <hi>Jenkin,</hi> and his fellows, ſhould either put

<hi>Grammar Scholars.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Ienkin</hi> (I perceive) went lame to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity,
and halts upon his <hi>Engliſh</hi> leg to this day. For what ailes
the <hi>Lectio</hi> he ſpeaks of? Doubtleſſe much the ſame kind of ailement,
which was in the houſe complained of by <hi>Harpaſie</hi> (in <hi>Seneca</hi>) for
being darke, when as ſhe her ſelfe was blind. And as her blindeneſſe
was all the darkeneſſe of the houſe; ſo is Mr. <hi>Ienkin</hi> his ignorance, all
the <hi>unproperneſſe</hi> in the <hi>Lectio.</hi> Queſtionleſſe if he had tendered the
<hi>Lectio</hi> to his Teaching Elder Mr. <hi>Vicars,</hi> and deſired his advicement
upon it, before he had taken the Cenſorian rod into his hand to ſmite
it; Mr. <hi>Vicars</hi> would have taken pitty on him, and diſſwaded him
from proclaiming the ſhame of his folly ſo loud, as to ſay, that hee
finds that which is crooked, in that which is ſtraight; and that which
is rough, in what is perfectly ſmooth. For though M. <hi>Vicars</hi> his
learning doth not lye ſo deep in the old <hi>Italian</hi> tongue, called Latin,
(there being, haply an unhappy antipathy betweene his <hi>Genius,</hi> and
it) yet I make no queſtion but that he is a Maſter of ſome competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in his Mother-tongue, &amp; can underſtand a piece of plain <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
Speake then, Mr. <hi>Vicars,</hi> ſpeake out: know neither Father nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Friend nor foe, in the judgement: is it <hi>very improper to ſay A
PRIVILEDG IS VESTED IN A MAN?</hi> or is it <hi>more
proper</hi> to ſay, <hi>A MAN IS VESTED IN A PRIVILEDGE?</hi>
Say, did you ever meete with this latter conſtruction of the word,
<hi>VESTED,</hi> in any good Engliſh Author? or have you not met with
the former, in very many? Say, is it very <hi>improper</hi> to ſay, that the
river runs in the channell? and <hi>more proper</hi> to ſay, that the channell
runs in the river? Is it very <hi>improper</hi> to ſay, that the fruit grows upon
the tree? or <hi>more proper,</hi> that the Tree growes upon the fruit? But
concerning the regular &amp; <hi>proper</hi> conſtruction of the word, <hi>VEST,
VESTED,</hi> &amp;c. let Mr. <hi>William Prynne</hi> umpire between Mr. <hi>William
Ienkin</hi> and me. Well known it is, that he is no friend, or flatterer of
mine, nor enemie to Maſter <hi>Ienkin:</hi> and withall, that for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in the propriety of the Engliſh tongue, he is above, and Mr.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:161817:43"/>
                  <hi>Ienkin</hi> beneath. I have not had leaſure or opportunity of late, to
ſearch much into his writings; but two places, wherein he uſeth the
word, have occurred unto me. In his firſt book, concerning the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne
power of Parliaments and Kingdomes,</hi> p. 50. he writes thus:
<hi>Now it is clear on the contrary ſide, that the King hath not the power of the
whole Realm VESTED in his Perſon,</hi> &amp;c. In his <hi>Full reply to certaine
briefe Obſervations and Antiqueries,</hi> towards the cloſe whereof, he was
pleaſed to make ſome <hi>briefe Animadverſions</hi> (as hee calls them) upon
my <hi>Theomachia,</hi> he writes thus (page 24.) <hi>Why may they not (the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people) likewiſe delegate a lawfull Eccleſiaſticall legiſlative Authority
in Church affaires, to their elected Parliamentary, and Synodicall members,
which was never actually in themſelves, as well as M.</hi> Goodwin <hi>delegates
the power of determining who ſhould be fit perſons to receive the Sacrament,
and to become members of his Independent Congregation, to eight ſelect ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes,
which was never actually VESTED in himſelfe, nor transferrible
thus to others, &amp;c.</hi> How doth Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> his pulſe beate upon this
potion? will he ſay, that <hi>rage againſt the Miniſters made Mr.</hi> Pryn <hi>to
write non ſence?</hi> or that <hi>his pen was drunke with madneſſe?</hi> Let him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
charge him, or diſcharge me. For (as the ſaying is)
<q>
                     <l>—Facinus, quos inquinat, aequat.</l>
                     <l>A crime makes equall, where it doth pollute.</l>
                  </q>
Well might he conclude, as he doth (towards the beginning of his
Preface) <hi>Never was an Over ſeer ſo over-ſeen.</hi> I eaſily beleeve, that <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
ſince the mountains or hills were brought forth, was there ſuch a
Novice, that took upon him the office of an <hi>Over-ſeer,</hi> and performed
it with that height of inſolency, and depth of ignorance, which Mr.
<hi>Jenkin</hi> hath done. Many <hi>Biſhops</hi> have been <hi>buſie</hi> in reforming that

Mr. <hi>Vicars,</hi> the Teaching Elder, cannot make true Latine: Is not the

in ſuch things only, but even in thoſe alſo which are of a far greater
and more difficult import.</p>
               <p>By the way, I cannot reaſonably judge, but that hee diſſembles,
when he ſaith, that his <hi>ſoule pitieth my cheated chapmen and followers;</hi>
elſe why did he refuſe to rectifie the judgements of ſuch of them, who
not long ſince upon the alarm of a magnificent challenge ſounded
by him in his pulpit, came unto him, to propound their ſcruples and
doubts, about the Doctrine which he had taught, concerning the
nature of a true Church? He could not but know, that, in his ſenſe,
and according to the tenor of his doctrine, they were in an error. If
then <hi>his ſoule pitied them,</hi> why did he refuſe conference with them,
they ſo earneſtly and frequently deſiring and preſſing him, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his pulpit-promiſe and ingagement, hee would anſwer
thoſe objections (very materiall and ſtrong, as they ſuppoſed) which
they had againſt his doctrine? Why did he after ſeverall delayes
and put-offs, at laſt take ſanctuary, and ſhift for himſelfe, under this
poor and creeping refuge; <hi>viz.</hi> that it was the advice of his brethren,
that he ſhould not diſpute with them, unleſſe it were by writing.</p>
               <p>Another like pageant of illiterate arrogance he playes,<note place="margin">Sect. 85.</note> p. 50. where
he meets with another <hi>Lectio,</hi> as much too hard for him, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
yet he is reſolved to have a ſaying to it, though that which he
ſaith be never ſo ridiculous and abſurd. My expreſſion was this:
<hi>Theſe men have exchanged the Fathers Adjutorium, into their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſorium.</hi>
Upon the head of this expreſſion he pours out this flood of
folly. <hi>For your accuſation brought againſt the Subſcribers of exchanging
(as you word it) the Fathers Adjutorium into their own Compulſorium;
firſt, for the Lectio: In what garden of authority did you gather that flower
of elegance, to exchange one thing into another? Had you ſaid, they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
the Adjutory for the Compulſory; or thus, they have exchanged the
Adjutory into the Compulſory, though the matter had been baſe, yet the
ſenſe had been currant: but now this expreſſion of (exchanging into) makes
the whole ſentence not ſo much worth as braſſe ſilvered over: 'twas a miſtake
of Permutare, for Mutare: &amp; I ſhould adviſe you to ſtudy that eaſie worke,

What a mirrour or glaſſe have wee here preſented, wherein to
behold Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> profound learning and humility together in
their own native colours and ſhapes! Firſt, for his learning, doth not
this ride on horſe-back, in <hi>theſe</hi> words: <hi>Twas a miſtake of Permutare
for Mutare?</hi> Illiterate ſoule! Is the man ſo ignorant, as not to know,
that Prepoſitions in compoſition, many times, make no alteration or
difference at all in the ſignification of Verbs? If his pride had not
been a debtor unto him of ſhame, it is probable he might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
with his Dictionary about the ſignification of theſe two verbs,
<hi>mutare</hi> and <hi>permutare,</hi> before he had uttered his ignorance in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch an emphaticall and ſignall difference as alwayes found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theem: and ſo have ſaved his face from the covering of this
ſhame. If he had look'd into his <hi>Thomas</hi> Dictionary, hee ſhould
have found, that as <hi>permuto</hi> ſignifies, to <hi>change one thing for another,</hi>
and <hi>to barter,</hi> ſo doth the ſimple verb <hi>muto,</hi> ſignifie to <hi>change, to barter
or exchange one thing for another.</hi> So in the judgement of thoſe who
underſtand the propriety of the Latine tongue at another manner of
rate than M. <hi>Jenkin;</hi> there is no more difference between <hi>permutare</hi>
and <hi>mutare,</hi> in Latine, than there is in Engliſh, between, to <hi>barter,</hi> and
to <hi>barter;</hi> to <hi>change one thing for another,</hi> and, <hi>to exchange one thing for
another.</hi> Yea the Dictionary I ſpeak of would have informed him,
that <hi>permutare in contrarium,</hi> i, (according to his own tranſlation) to
<hi>exchange one thing into another,</hi> is an expreſsion uſed by <hi>Pliny</hi> (no igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Author in the Latine tongue.) And I would know of him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in that <hi>eaſie work,</hi> which his humility <hi>adviſeth me to ſtudy,</hi> where
he findes (to the rendring of himſelfe a very ridiculous <hi>Critique, Nil
permutabis, emeſve,</hi> the word <hi>permutabis,</hi> hath any other touch, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or ſtreine of ſenſe or ſignification in it, than what might have
been as well expreſſed, by the ſimple, <hi>mutabis.</hi> It is no wayes like, that
the Author of the verſe prefer'd the compound, <hi>permutabis,</hi> before
the ſimple, <hi>mutabis,</hi> for the ſenſe of the word, but for the verſe, which
ſtood in need of the Prepoſition to compleat it. And if wee
conſider the proper force and import of the prepoſition, <hi>ex,</hi> in the
Engliſh word, <hi>exchange,</hi> why may not <hi>one thing</hi> be properly enough
ſaid to be <hi>exchanged</hi> into another? nay, can one thing be ſaid to be
<hi>changed</hi> into <hi>another,</hi> without being <hi>exchanged,</hi> i. <hi>changed out</hi> of it ſelfe
firſt, and ſo <hi>changed</hi> into another? But this it is to have to doe with
Novices, who underſtand not <hi>quid diſtant aera lupinis.</hi> And whereas
he in the ſimplicity of his pride, asks me, <hi>In what garden of authority
I gathered that flower of elegancie,</hi> which he ignorantly ſeeks to blaſt;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:161817:45"/>
I might upon terms of ſobriety and good reaſon, ask him, where, or
from what Author he learned to call <hi>a miſtake</hi> of a compound verb
for a ſimple, <hi>groſſe non-ſenſe.</hi> But unleſſe he ſhould be ever and anon

pride and inſolency had his throne in the heart of a young man, I
feare Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> affords him the accommodation. In one place of his

                  <note n="a" place="margin">Page 89.</note>, (I know not how often) he means in impropriety of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

trees from men, in caſe he came to a Forreſt, or Wood, he might very
poſſibly imagine, that he ſaw as many men as trees. Nor is it any great

Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> hath muſtered up a ſmall body, in his pamphlet. I might

<hi>Truths</hi> of God. See a cleare inſtance hereof, in the progreſſe of the
late mentioned argument: as ſimple as 'tis, it muſt be fathered on the
Scriptures, yea Scripture upon Scripture muſt be cited (or rather abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
in the juſtification of it: <hi>according to Scripture,</hi> (ſaith he) which
<hi>ſaith, That natur all men cannot know the things of the Spirit of God,
1 Cor. 2. 14. and yet that the God of this world hath blinded them, 2 Cor. 4.

(it is onely Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> that ſaith this, the Scripture ſaith it not:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:161817:48"/>

that his right hand cannot forget her cunning in citing the words

In this peece of diſcourſe, the intentions of theſe men in lifting
up the Scriptures, and ſo in uſing of them, may be clearly ſeen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the vaile of their ignorance may be conceived to hide them. He
chargeth me (<hi>page</hi> 34.) according to the known tenderneſſe of his
conſcience, that <hi>ſtill I would have fain the Scriptures counted hereticall
with me;</hi> In which ſaying alone, there is more arogant and deſperate
<hi>blaſphemy,</hi> than can well be ſuppoſed incident to any other man, than
him that ſpake it. For doth it not clearly ſuppoſe, that the Scriptures
themſelves muſt <hi>be hereticall,</hi> if they ſhould teach or hold forth any
other doctrine than what M. <hi>Jenkin</hi> teacheth? And if ſo, then not
the Scriptures, or their authority; but M. <hi>Jenkin</hi> his judgement and
authority, muſt be the touchſtone of Truth and Error: and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
muſt be look'd upon as <hi>Hereticall,</hi> if they ſhall preſume to teach
or aſſert any thing contrary to him; and conſequently, muſt ſubmit
themſelves to the regulation of his judgement, in their ſenſe and
meaning, and in whatſoever they affirm. But whether <hi>I would fain
have the Scriptures counted hereticall, with me,</hi> or no; evident it is, that
M. <hi>Jenkin would fain</hi> draw them into communion and fellowſhip
with himſelf, in a moſt abſurd, inſulſe, and unſavoury opinion; in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about to prove from them, that he that is as blinde, as a man that
is <hi>dead,</hi> had <hi>need</hi> yet <hi>to be blinded by Satan,</hi> or may further, or to a
greater degree of blindneſſe, be blinded by him. As for that Scrip.
1 Cor. 2. 14. by which he ſeekes to prove it, it appeares by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
it for ſuch a purpoſe, that he underſtands little of it. For firſt,
evident it is from the ſeries of the context, that by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
tranſlated, the <hi>naturall man,</hi> is not meant, the man that is ſimply or
meerly <hi>natural,</hi> or unregenerate, or that hath nothing at all of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
in him, but ſuch a kinde of men, whom two or three verſes after (viz.
<hi>cap.</hi> 3. 1. 3.) he twice expreſſeth by the name of, <hi>Carnal;</hi> whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
he calls <hi>Babes in Chriſt.</hi> So that evident it is, that by <hi>naturall</hi>
there, and <hi>carnall</hi> here, he meanes onely weak <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſuch as for
the preſent had made little progreſſe in the knowledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and
of the Goſpel. This interpretation is further confirmed, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. from
hence, viz that one and the ſame kinde of perſon, whom hee calls
<hi>ſpirituall,</hi> is oppoſed both to the <hi>naturall</hi> man there (as <hi>cap. 2. v.</hi> 15.)
and likewiſe to the <hi>carnall</hi> man, here (<hi>cap.</hi> 3 1.) 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. From hence,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:161817:48"/>
that as the Goſpel ſpeakes frequently, of two kindes (or degrees ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> weak, and ſtrong, expreſſing them by ſeverall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations;
ſo the one ſort of them, <hi>viz</hi> the <hi>ſtrong,</hi> is (amongſt other
denominations) frequently expreſſed by the term, <hi>ſpirituall. If any
man think himſelfe to be a Prophet, or Spirituall</hi> [i. excellent, and of a
greater growth in knowledge than ordinary] <hi>let him acknowledge
that the things I write unto you, are the commandements of the Lord,</hi>
1 Cor. 14. 37. So again: <hi>Brethren, if any man be overtaken in a fault,
ye which are ſpirituall,</hi> [i. more able than your fellowes,] <hi>reſtore ſuch
an one, &amp;c.</hi> Gal. 6. 1. To paſſe by other inſtances of like import;
<hi>And I (Brethren) could not ſpeak unto you, as unto ſpirituall</hi> [i. as unto
ſtrong, or underſtanding <hi>Chriſtians] but as unto carnall, even as unto
babes in Chriſt,</hi> 1. Cor. 3. 1. So then the word <hi>Spirituall,</hi> when ſpoken
of perſons, or <hi>ſpirituall</hi> man, being never found in the writings of this
Apoſtle oppoſed, to the meere <hi>naturall,</hi> or <hi>carnall</hi> man, but very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to the weak, and leſſe underſtanding <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> it is no wayes
reaſonable to imagine ſuch an oppoſition here: the ſcope and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of the context, no wayes requiring it, but riſing up in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to it.</p>
               <p>The reaſon (by the way) why the weake <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is,<note place="margin">Sect. 92.</note> and well
may be, <hi>termed naturall,</hi> or <hi>carnall,</hi> is, becauſe he retaines much of the
meere <hi>naturall,</hi> or <hi>carnall</hi> man in him: he is ſtill under the guidance
of many falſe principles and notions of things, which are more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
found in meere <hi>naturall,</hi> and <hi>carnall</hi> men; and conſequently
his diſpoſitions and practices are in a great meaſure like unto theirs
alſo. A denomination may truly, and with ſufficient proprietie of
ſpeech, be given, upon a graduall participation onely of a form,
though it be not inherent in the higheſt, or moſt perfect degree of it.
As for example, Silver is called white, though it be not as white as
ſnow: and a man or woman, may be called black, though they bee
not as black as a <hi>Negro.</hi> So a man may be termed an ignorant man,
not onely when he knowes nothing at all, but when he knows little
in compariſon of what he might, and ought to know, and what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

not becauſe they are wholly, or altogether either the one, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but becauſe there is much of that genius and temper, many of
the properties &amp; principles of thoſe, who are altogether ſuch, found
remaining in them. The Apoſtle himſelf gives this account unto his

it is, from the tenor and carriage of the context, that the Apoſtle

<hi>able to beare.</hi> Such things <hi>of God,</hi> as before (viz. verſe 6. and 7.
of this chapter) he had called, <hi>wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>the wiſdome of God;</hi> and
afterward, (viz. c. 3. v. 2.) he calls <hi>meat</hi> (oppoſed to <hi>milk</hi>) i. <hi>ſtrong

Goſpel, ſuch as are eaſie of apprehenſion even to thoſe that are <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi>

were: and yet be ſome wayes capable and apprehenſive of ſuch of
<hi>the things of God,</hi> the knowledge whereof is of abſolute neceſſity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

and demonſtrations, by which the original and deſcent of the

any thing that makes not for his turn, ſhould not deny it.
But</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.<note place="margin">Sect. 94.</note> That power, or ability, which the Apoſtle here denies to his
<hi>Animal,</hi> or <hi>naturall</hi> man (who ever he means by him) of <hi>knowing the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:161817:49"/>
things of God,</hi> or <hi>of the Spirit of God,</hi> may well, nay (of neceſſity) muſt
be underſtood onely of an immediate, actuall, or preſent capacity,
or power. So that his meaning may be onely this: The <hi>Animall,</hi> or
<hi>Naturall man,</hi> whilſt he continues meerly ſuch <hi>[animall,</hi> or <hi>naturall]</hi>
or <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> hath no principle, or power, directly, actually,
and <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> to know ſavingly, <hi>the things of the Spirit of God.</hi> But
this proveth not, but that ſuch a man, <hi>animall,</hi> or <hi>naturall,</hi> may
have ſuch principles even for the preſent, which by a due and regular
improvement, &amp; ſuch whereof, by the never-denied aſſiſtance of God
at firſt, he is very capable, may advance and riſe through the ordinary
bleſſing of God in ſuch caſes, into ſuch a capacity, or power, as is
contended for. A childe, or youth of ten or twelve years of age, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
(haply) conſtrue, or underſtand a chapter in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible, or
lift a great weight, which requires the ſtrength of a man to heave it,
whilſt hee remaines yet a childe: hee hath no immediate or actuall
power to doe either of theſe; yet ſuch a power, or principle he hath
in reference unto both, by a regular imployment and improvement
whereof, he will, or may in time, according to the ordinary courſe
of Gods providence, be able to doe either. A man that ſtands upon
the floore of a low room, hath no power of ſtepping into the upper
room, immediatly; but he hath a power of conveying himſelfe, if he
pleaſeth, by the opportunity of ſtaires made for ſuch a purpoſe. The
Apoſtle himſelfe, in this very context of Scripture (viz. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. 2.)
ſuppoſeth that theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who being <hi>carnall,</hi> and <hi>babes in
Chriſt,</hi> were <hi>NOT</hi> for the preſent) <hi>ABLE to beare meat,</hi> had yet
ſuch a principle, or capacity in them, by the growth and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
whereof, they might in time come to ſuch an abilitie. <hi>I have
fed you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with milk, and not with meat: For HITHERTO
ye were not able to beare it, neither YET NOW are ye able.</hi> In that
he ſaith to them, that <hi>they were not YET able to beare it,</hi> as being
<hi>Babes,</hi> he plainly implies, that by uſing meanes to <hi>grow in grace,</hi>
and <hi>in the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> they might in time through the
ordinary bleſſing of God (ordinary I mean in ſuch caſes) come to be
able.</p>

Chriſtians,</hi> or of meere <hi>naturall</hi> men (though the former be leſſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable)
as well the one, as the other, may (according to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Dialect, and phraſe of Scripture) be ſaid to be <hi>unable,</hi> or, to
have <hi>no power to know,</hi> or <hi>to diſcern the things of God,</hi> either becauſe
of that great difficulty, which lies in the way of ſuch men to attaine
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:161817:50"/>
the <hi>knowledhe or diſcerning</hi> of theſe things; or elſe becauſe of that
great averſneſſe or indiſpoſition, which is incident to both theſe
ſorts of men, to ſteere a courſe of meanes proper or likely, to render
them capable of ſuch <hi>knowledge,</hi> or <hi>diſcerning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For firſt, as the Scripture is wont to expreſſe a number, next to
<hi>none,</hi> (I mean, a very few, a number inconſiderable) by the word,
<hi>none,</hi> ſimply; <hi>There is NONE that doth good, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 14. 3. and
elſewhere; and ſo likewiſe in greater ſums or accounts, to omit the
fractions, or odd unites, expreſſing onely the round number (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there are many examples in Scripture ready enough to be found)
ſo likewiſe when a thing is very unlikely to come to paſſe, and (as it
were) neere to an impoſſibility, it oft-times takes no notice of thoſe
few degrees of probability, or poſſibility, under which it lieth, but
calls it (ſimply) a thing unpoſſible, or which cannot be done. Thus
<hi>Chriſt</hi> having firſt ſaid to his Diſciples (<hi>Matth. 19. 23.) Verily I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, that a rich man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> in
the next verſe, to carry up their apprehenſions to the due height and
pitch of the difficulty, hardneſſe, or unlikelihood of the thing, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
it by a ſimilitude importing an unpoſſibility. <hi>And again I ſay
unto you, it is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a
rich man to enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi> Yet that he doth not here
ſpeak of a Logicall, i. a ſimple and abſolute impoſſibility, but of a
morall onely, is evident from <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. where he reſtraines the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of it unto men, and ſuppoſeth it poſſible enough with God:
<hi>With men this is impoſſible, but with God all things are poſſible.</hi> Now
that which is Logically, or ſimply impoſſible, is impoſſible with God
himſelfe, as well as with men. And that which in this verſe he affirms
to be <hi>impoſſible with men,</hi> v. 23. he had repreſented onely as very <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,</hi>
and what was very ſeldome likely to come to paſſe. <hi>Verily I ſay
unto you,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. i. that <hi>very hardly,</hi> or with
great difficulty, will, or <hi>ſhall a rich man enter into the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
Many times the rareneſſe onely, or the great unlikelihood of an
effect, is expreſſed, ſometimes by the difficulty, otherwiſe by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
of it. The like paſſage is to be ſeen, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 23, 24. Thus
when the Lord expoſtulated with his people after this manner, <hi>Jer.
13. 23. CAN the Ethiopian change his skin? or the Leopard his ſpots?
Then may ye alſo do good, who are accuſtomed to doe evill;</hi> he ſeems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
(as to the manner of the expreſſion) a kinde of impoſſibility in
them to repent, or turn unto God. Which impoſſibility notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is not to be meaſured, or computed by the ſtrict definition of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:161817:50"/>
what is ſimply and preciſely <hi>impoſsible</hi> (for in that ſenſe it was not
impoſſible for them to repent, notwithſtanding their long habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
cuſtome in ſinning, as appeares by the examples of thoſe,
who have repented upon ſuch termes as theſe) but onely by the
nature and definition of what is marvellouſly unlikely, and what
lieth (as it were) in the borders or confines of an impoſſibility.
This interpretation fully agrees with <hi>Auſtines</hi> notion in the caſe.
<hi>How hardly</hi> (ſaith he) or with what difficultly <hi>doth ſuch a man riſe,</hi>
(or get up, meaning, to repentance, or a courſe of well-doing)

for men to number any number that is finit: and that the
number of theſe Saints was not ſimply infinit, appeares from
hence, <hi>viz.</hi> that elſewhere in Scripture they are called, <hi>few, a little

of it notwithſtanding above the other, is not ſimply infinit. The
line of this interpretation is to be ſtretched over very many other
places of Scripture of like expreſſion and phraſe with thoſe, in
which inſtance hath been given. According to the tenor of this
expoſition (which is, as we have heard, fully conſiſting with the
familiar Dialect, and frequent manner of ſpeech in the Scripture)
thoſe expreſſions in the paſſage in hand, <hi>Cannot receive, Cannot

have power to beleeve, and repent,</hi> he cites (among other Scriptures
every whit as impertinent) <hi>without ſtrength,</hi> Rom 5. 6. <hi>God worketh
in us to will and to doe.</hi> Certainly the man underſtands nothing of
the ſenſe and meaning either of the one place, or the other. In the
former, we are ſaid to be <hi>without ſtrength,</hi> or rather to have been
<hi>without ſtrength,</hi> not in reſpect of our condition as repaired, relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and ſtated by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but in reſpect of that condition, whereinto
we were expoſed by the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> and whereinto we ſhould
certeinly have periſhed, had not <hi>Chriſt</hi> interpoſed by his death for
our deliverance. The tenor of the Apoſtles words is expreſſe: <hi>For
when we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly.</hi>
So that this Scripture, affirming men to have been weak, or <hi>without
ſtrength,</hi> i. unable to help or ſave themſelves from death, without the
death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for them; rather ſuppoſeth them endued with, or as

therefore it is midnight; ſhould draw the true portraicture of
Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> his reaſoning from the Scripture in hand. For to
prove, that the Scriptures <hi>deny ſtrength</hi> in thoſe who periſh, <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
and repent,</hi> he brings a Scripture, which (as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
ſuppoſeth it.</p>
               <p>Nor doth his latter Scripture any otherwiſe relate to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
than the Eaſt unto the Weſt. For <hi>Gods working in us, both to will
and to doe,</hi> clearly ſuppoſeth, that men have power both <hi>to will and
to doe;</hi> ſo farre is it from <hi>denying</hi> it, or ſuppoſing the contrary. Yea it
is <hi>Gods working in us both to will and to doe,</hi> that enableth us both to
the one, and the other. The Apoſtle himſelfe earneſtly preſſeth and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:161817:54"/>
perſwadeth the <hi>Philippians, to will and to doe</hi> (in effect) upon this
ground, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>it is God</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is <hi>working in them to will,
and to doe, of his good pleaſure. Wherefore (my beloved) as ye have alwayes
obeyed not as in my preſence onely, but now much more in my abſence, worke
out your ſalvation with feare and trembling. For it is God that worketh,
&amp;.</hi> Phil. 2. 12, 13. From the connexion between the exhortation,
or duty laid down (in the former verſe) and the motive, in the latter,
evident it is, that <hi>Gods working in us both to will and to doe,</hi> doth not
neceſſarily ſuppoſe, that either <hi>to will or to doe,</hi> are actually, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more to doe <hi>wrought</hi> in us: no more, than his <hi>purging Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>

after the ſame manner, God worketh, or is <hi>working both to will, and

whereof, Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> ſhall doe well to take knowledge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Dialect and phraſe in ſuch expreſſions; as <hi>viz.</hi> that when an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

the actual production of it, it is very uſual and frequent in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
when any one of theſe cauſes have contributed that efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
which is proper for it to exhibit towards the production hereof,
to mention the effect as produced by this cauſe, though it be not
actually produced, the other cauſe, or cauſes, not having given in
their influence or concurrence herevnto. As for example, <hi>The purging
of Jeruſalem</hi> (lately mentioned) was an effect, which depended,
partly upon God, or his interpoſall by his Word, Spirit, Mercies,
Judgement, &amp;c. partly upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> her ſelfe, in comporting with
God in thoſe adminiſtrations, wherein he applied himſelfe unto her,
for her <hi>purging,</hi> and ſo in ſuffering her ſelfe to be <hi>purged</hi> by him.
Now becauſe God had done that, which was neceſſary or proper
for him to doe towards this effect of <hi>purging</hi> her, he had for a long
time <hi>ſtroven with</hi> her, by his Word, by his Spirit, by his long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by his judgements, to bring her to repentance, in this reſpect
the effect it ſelfe, (I mean, the <hi>purging of Jeruſalem</hi>) is attributed unto
him, though it was not effected or brought to paſſe, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> her
ſelfe denying, or with-holding that, which was neceſſary on her part,

with a ſtronger hand of Scripture, and rationall demonſtration, than
all thoſe of contrary judgement have been able to reſiſt. Suppoſe
M. <hi>Jenkin</hi> his opinion were, that there is another World in the
Moon, or that the Sunne is the center of the Univerſe, or that the
earth moves, the heavens ſtanding ſtill, or that there are nine Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchies,

who thruſt his ſpeare into our Saviours ſide, was <hi>Longinus,</hi> the name
of the penitent Thiefe crucified with him, <hi>Dyſmas,</hi> with the like; and
the man ſhould be ſo importunely confident of his judgement in
theſe particulars, that without all queſtion or debate, he judged all
men <hi>Erroneous and Hereticall,</hi> that were not partakers of the ſame
fooliſh faith with him; in caſe I, or any other man, conſidering the

poſitively and for certain? But in M. <hi>Jenkins</hi> Logick, there is
no difference (it ſeems) between beleeving that the Moone is made of

Whereas M. <hi>Jenkin</hi> by <hi>vera juſtitia</hi> (in the paſſage cited by me from
<hi>Bucer</hi>) will needs underſtand, <hi>the duties of righteouſneſſe commanded in

affirm the words to ſignifie, <hi>True righteouſneſſe.</hi> Preſently after, in

could be juſtified out of Chriſt.</hi> Reader, wouldſt thou know the ground
of this charge alſo? I onely tranſlate <hi>Bucers</hi> Latine words into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,

Gentes etiam ante revelatum eis Chriſtum, verae juſtitiae fuiſſe compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi>
i. <hi>It was rather Pauls minde and intent, to object</hi> [or ſuggeſt] <hi>unto
the Jewes, that the Gentiles, even before Chriſt was revealed unto them,
were obtainers</hi> [not <hi>of the duties commanded in the Law,</hi> as M. <hi>Jenkin</hi>
would abſurdly interpret, hereby making <hi>Bucer</hi> to affirm that, which
is notoriouſly falſe, and that in a very uncouth and harſh phraſe:
For the Gentiles never <hi>obtained the duties commanded in the Law,</hi> or
the <hi>true righteouſneſſe</hi> of the Law, neither <hi>before Chriſt was revealed unto
them,</hi> nor ſince, but] of <hi>true righteouſneſſe.</hi> Nor doth it any wayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that in caſe <hi>Bucer</hi> ſhould imagine, that <hi>the Gentiles</hi> were juſtified
<hi>before Chriſt was revealed unto them, [viz.</hi> in the miniſtery of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
of which kinde of <hi>Revelation</hi> it is evident he ſpeaketh] that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he muſt needs <hi>imagine that men may be juſtified out of Chriſt.</hi> God
hath ſeverall wayes to <hi>reveale Chriſt</hi> unto men, beſides the externall
miniſtery of the Goſpel: nor is <hi>Faith</hi> ſaid to <hi>come by hearing,</hi> as if
there were no other way by which it is poſſible to <hi>come:</hi> but onely
becauſe it is the ordinary way by which God hath appointed that
it ſhould <hi>come.</hi> Many things are ſimply and indefinitly affirmed in
the Scriptures, which doe not import an abſolute univerſality, but
onely a commonneſſe or frequency of truth. When our Saviour
ſaith, that <hi>if any man walk in the day, he ſtumbleth not</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 11. 9.</note>; his meaning
is not to affirme, that no man whatſoever, <hi>walking in the day,</hi> ever
<hi>ſtumbled</hi> (this being notoriouſly untrue) but onely, that men <hi>walking
in the day,</hi> doe not ordinarily <hi>ſtumble,</hi> or, are not likely, or apt to

meanes and incomes, more than any three (I beleeve, I might
ſafely ſay, than any foure) Independent Miniſters in all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And yet I doe not look upon him neither as a man <hi>anointed
with the oyl of that joy and gladneſſe</hi> I ſpeak of, <hi>above</hi> all <hi>his fellows: I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:161817:61"/>
there are more than a few of them, whoſe <hi>anointing</hi> is richer
than his.</p>
               <p>4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. What Sanctuary doth M. <hi>Jenkin</hi> think will protect him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſhame of that aſſertion of his, that the Independent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are the <hi>Preachers under worldly glory?</hi> Doth he count it matter
of <hi>worldly glory</hi> unto Miniſters to be diſcountenanced by the State
where they live; to be made, and publickly declared, uncapable of
thoſe favours and priviledges, which are granted generally to other
Miniſters, or Preachers in the Land; to bee ſequeſtred from their
meanes and livelihoods; to be diſgracefully thrown out of places
more creditable (at leaſt, in vulgar repute) for the exerciſe of their
Miniſtery, and thruſt into holes and <hi>corners</hi> (as himſelfe calls them)
yea and to be upbraided herewith from time to time; to be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
both unto Magiſtrates and people, by thoſe that are like to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
by both, as Sectaries, Schiſmatiques, Erroneous, Hereticall,
Factious, Troubleſome, Dangerous to the State, and what not?
If theſe, and ſuch like things as theſe, bee matters of <hi>worldly glory,</hi>
then may the Preachers of whom M. <hi>Jenkin</hi> ſpeaketh, be truly ſaid,
to be the <hi>Preachers under worldly glory:</hi> but if not, hath not he avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to the ſhame and confuſion of his face?</p>

any of M. <hi>Jenkins</hi> Bibles, whether <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> or <hi>Originall,</hi> moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it is not the word of God. If in ſtead of ſaying, <hi>I am PAYED

am paid for</hi> teaching them, or for inabling them [inſtrumentally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the ſaying had been tolerable enough, for matter of truth, though
little enough, for matter of conſequence, or import. But M. <hi>Jenkin</hi>
hath little cauſe to be offended with me, for being <hi>payed</hi> for teaching
my people ſo, that I may <hi>heare</hi> them ſpeak the things of God with
comfort; when as himſelf is <hi>payed</hi> for teaching his people (I feare)

of a Miniſter of Chriſt! How, or wherein, or whereby, doe <hi>I labour
to bury the name</hi> of the man thou ſpeakeſt of? Is this to <hi>bury his name,</hi>
to ſay, <hi>that he was never counted an Arminian, nor branded for an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,
or a man of rotten judgement, unleſſe it were by the Miniſters of
Babylon?</hi> Or is it to honour <hi>his name,</hi> and keep it alive? Or is the
ſhewing of thoſe monuments of Truth, which he reared up, yet living,
and dying, left behind him, unto the world, (I mean, the quotation
of his writings) <hi>a burying of his name?</hi> Or is a proper tranſlation, or a
like interpretation of his words, a <hi>buriall of his name?</hi> Or have I
ſaid, or done any thing in relation to him, more than theſe? But
that he chargeth me, with <hi>making my throat an open ſepulcher</hi> to <hi>bury
his name</hi> in, I impute not ſo much to his malice, as to the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderateneſſe
of it (though this may well be a ſymptome of the
ſtrength and heat thereof) For doth the man think, that I wrote
with my mouth, or could he imagine, I ſhould write with my <hi>throat,</hi>
Or can he chargeme (ſomuch as in pretence) with any unkindneſſe,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:161817:65"/>
or cruelty to <hi>Bucers Name,</hi> otherwiſe than in, or by my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings?</p>
               <p>Reader, I am loath to weary thee with any more proofes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of the concluſion in hand. Thoſe that have been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

evinceth himſelfe in his <hi>Buſie-Biſhop,</hi> extreamly defective, and (in
a manner) totally eclipſed even in matters of civility, modeſty, and

of my words and ſayings, which have not been yet

Pamphlet, and withall argue and detect the wilfulneſſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
of them, I ſhould (I verily beleeve) make another book every
whit as bulky and big as this, the materials would be ſo many. But I

               <p>There is yet a third man,<note place="margin">Sect. 119.</note> whom I cannot call, but onely conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
by his name: the man hath been already touch'd in (the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
of the diſcourſe) with whom I deſire to debate a few particulars,
though very briefly, before I cloſe. The man I mean, is the Author
of a late ſcurrilous Pamphlet, which fronteth, <hi>Sion Colledge what it
is, &amp;c.</hi> but pageth, <hi>Sion Colledge vindicated,</hi> i. what it is not (a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
intimation, I conceive of the lubricity, or verſipelliouſneſſe of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:161817:65"/>
the Author, whom no man can well tell, either <hi>what he is,</hi> or <hi>what he
is not.</hi>) Touching his name; he is not willing (it ſeemes) to expreſſe
it by any letters further off from <hi>GREATA,</hi> than thoſe that
are next to it, <hi>viz.</hi> C. B. Yet I halfe believe this C. B. to be that
ſame D. D. who lived not long ſince in Colemanſtreet; and who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
demanded (as I am credibly informed) by the Collectors of the
Aſſeſſments for the Army, a ſmall ſumme which he was aſſeſſed upon
that account, taking up a Bible in his hand, wiſh'd the Devill take
him if ever he paid it; and yet very honeſtly paid it a while after. I
will not over-confidently aſſevere this D. D. I ſpeake of, to be that
C. B. whom I am to ſpeak with: becauſe C. B. may diſſemble; and
whereas they pretend to be the proemiall or initiall letters of a mans
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> name, &amp; Sir-name, they may prove the Epilogicall or finall
letters of them, yea or letters of ſome middle place. Nay who knows,
but that poſſibly they may be letters borrowed to ſerve a turn, and
to deceive, by inticing a man to challenge ſuch or ſuch a perſon by
name, for the Author of the book, becauſe they agree to his name,
when as he in the mean time lies upon the catch in ambuſh, to fall
foule upon him that ſhall ſo challenge him without ſufficient proofe.
Therefore bee this C. B. who hee will, I ſhall neither nominate
him, nor any other man, upon ſo ſlight a foundation as two letters
affoord.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding I cannot eaſily diſengage my thoughts from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon the ſame D. D.<note place="margin">Sect. 120.</note> 
                  <hi>I</hi> ſpake of: they wil, do what I can, ſecretly
challenge him for the Author of the piece, the conſideration of many
circumſtances animating them hereunto. Firſt, that <hi>fell and fiery</hi> Spirit
that beats up and down in the veins of it, reſembles the man. 2. The
authors ſymbolizing with their principles, who (as the Apoſtle ſaith)
<hi>glory in their ſhame,</hi> in his <hi>accounting it his honour to be a member of Sion
Colledge</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Title page.</note>, ſtrengthens the conjecture. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ſtile &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alect
of the piece <hi>bewrayeth</hi> him. 4 To plow with clandeſtine heifers,
together w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> underhand practiſes to know what he ſhould not know,
are known practiſes of his. 5. That encyclopaedicall knowledge of
the ſtate of <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi> and of all things relating to it, from the
<hi>Cedar in the Lebanon</hi> thereof, even <hi>to the byſſop that ſprings out of the
walls</hi> thereof, which magnifies it ſelfe in the piece, is (I conceive) the
appropriate character of the man. 6. The notion of <hi>Biſhop</hi> and
<hi>Chancellor</hi> working in his fancy who is the Author of the piece,
ſtrongly tempteth me to a belief, that the ſaid D. D. is the man who
in his book of <hi>zeale,</hi> &amp; when he <hi>wrought at the fire,</hi> ſpake many an hot
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:161817:66"/>
and affectionate word for <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> But yet this conſtellation is
made onely of ſuch ſtarres, <hi>quae tantum inclinant, non neceſſitant,</hi> which
onely incline, but doe not neceſſitate. Therefore ſince the humour of
the man is to ſpeak his name in a <hi>parable,</hi> but his mind <hi>plainly,</hi> let us
leave his <hi>parable</hi> (to his own explication) and weigh what it is which
he ſpeaks more plainly.</p>
               <p>In his Title page hee talkes of <hi>two fell and fiery Satyrs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 121.</note> the one, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Sion Colledge viſited;</hi> the other, the <hi>Pulpit Incendiary;</hi> from the
<hi>ſlanderous defamations</hi> whereof, he promiſeth a <hi>Vindication of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Sion Colledge.</hi> To <hi>vindicate the Society</hi> he ſpeakes of, from the
<hi>ſlanderous defamations</hi> of the two Treatiſes he nameth, is no ſervice at
all to this <hi>Society;</hi> no more than it would be in a <hi>Chirurgian</hi> to heale
a man of ſuch wounds, which he never received. As for one of the
Treatiſes, <hi>Sion Colledge viſited,</hi> certain I am, there is no <hi>ſlanderous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation</hi>
in it of that <hi>Society:</hi> nor doe I remember any ſuch miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
in the other. If C. B. deſired to deſerve honorably of his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi>
he ſhould have undertaken (and quitted himſelfe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly)
a <hi>Vindication</hi> of the members thereof, from thoſe crimes and
unworthy deportments, which with evidence, and manifeſtneſſe of
truth the ſaid two writings lay to their charge. But in this caſe,

or elſe the capcious conſtructions, which he makes of ſome of
their expreſſions. When they charge <hi>Sion Colledge</hi> with ſuch and
ſuch unchriſtian miſdemeanours, and crimes, C. B. avoucheth
with importune confidence, the innocencie of the walls and edifices
of <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi> and tels us a long ſtory of the <hi>converſion of a large and
ancient houſe in Alphage Pariſh, into a Colledge,</hi> and of the commendable
intentions of the <hi>Founder</hi> of this Colledge, with many ſuch good

Painter; who, when one that had hardly eſcaped drowning in a
wreck at Sea, came to him, and offered him money to make him a
Table, wherein his perſon, danger, and eſcape, might be artificially
drawn, made him this anſwer; Sir, if you pleaſe, I will draw you a
very faire Cypreſſe tree. C. B. is excellent at one thing: but it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
thing that lay upon him to doe. He hath painted us a goodly
<hi>Cypreſſe tree:</hi> but what is this to a <hi>ſhipwrack?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So again when we challenge and charge <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi> as aforeſaid,
C. B. chargeth us with <hi>ſlanderous defamations,</hi> and thinks that he <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates</hi>
this <hi>Colledge</hi> and Society with an high hand, by proteſting or
proving, that the matters of fact charged by us, were not tranſacted,
concluded, or done by this Colledge, or Society, in their <hi>Collegiate</hi>
capacity, or in the formalities of their Corporation. Truly (C. B.)
we confeſſe that very poſſibly our <hi>ſenſes</hi> may not be ſo much <hi>exerciſed</hi>
as yours, <hi>in diſcerning</hi> the puntillo's of Law; and probable it is
we may faile in ſome formality of expreſſion: but when we charge
<hi>Sion Colledge,</hi> or the <hi>Society</hi> hereof, with miſdemeanour, our intent is
to charge the members hereof, as well <hi>diviſim</hi> as <hi>conjunctim:</hi> and
when the greater part, or any conſiderable number of the members
of this Society, are found guilty of the crimes which we lay to their
charge, the reſt no wayes declaring againſt them, we make account
that we ſpeak properly enough, and nothing but the truth, when we
charge the <hi>Society</hi> (ſimply and indefinitly) with ſuch things. But
that is the thinneſt <hi>Fig-leafe</hi> of all the reſt, wherewith C. B. goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to cover his own, and his Colleagues <hi>nakedneſſe;</hi> to pretend,that
when they doe meet to agitate and conſult of their affairs (which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times prove the Kingdomes miſeries) they doe not meet in <hi>Sion
Colledge.</hi> As for the place of their meeting, whatſoever it is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it is, it is but <hi>Aſini umbra,</hi> or <hi>lana <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the ends of their meetings, and their tranſactions at their meetings,
be the ſame, it is all one to me, and I ſuppoſe to all others, where their
Rendez-vouz be, whether they meet at the <hi>quondam</hi> Dean of <hi>Pauls
Colledge,</hi> or at the preſent Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> Houſe, or at Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi>

               <p>But why doth he ſtile the two bookes he ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">Sect. 1. 22</note> 
                  <hi>two fell and fiery

of Poetrie, rebuking vice ſharply, and not regarding perſons.</hi> The man (as

the ſharp accuſations, the ſevere workings and ſmitings of a guilty
conſcience within him. Which conſcience (I confeſſe) might very
poſſibly be awakned, and ſet on work by the two bookes he ſpeakes
of, to doe that ſevere execution upon the man: but the Law, which
onely teacheth and admoniſheth a Judge of his duty in puniſhing a
malefactor, is rather to be juſtified and commended, than any wayes
cenſured for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">Sect. 123.</note> out of the <hi>Amalthean</hi> horn of his Title Page, we have
a promiſe, of, <hi>a little taſt, by the way, of another young thing of Mr. J.
Goodwins, running about with the ſhell on the head, before it be all hatcht,
&amp;c.</hi> What? muſt C. B. needs <hi>taſte</hi> of <hi>a young thing before it he all
hatcht?</hi> Behold the <hi>unmaturalneſſe</hi> and <hi>unrulineſſe</hi> of the mans appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite!

                  <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 23. 19. 34. 26, &amp;c.</note>. <hi>But Gallio careth for none of theſe things.</hi> I looke upon
this unrulineſſe of appetite, as a further character (beſides thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned)
of that D. D. I ſpake of; for ſo common fame reporteth him
a man of an irregular appetite, as well in reſpect of reals, as perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.
Yet if C. B. be this D. D. me thinks ſo grave and mighty a man
of warre, ſhould not think the ingagement worthy his grandure, to
enter the liſts againſt <hi>a young thing with the ſhell on the head.</hi> Is there
no mercy neither for <hi>young,</hi> nor old, with the members of <hi>Sion Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi>
But how came C. B. to meet with that <hi>young thing</hi> he ſpeakes
of, in that poſture which he deſcribes? For confident I am, that that
would willingly have kept the neſt, &amp; not been <hi>running about before it
had been all hatch'd,</hi> had not ſome unnaturall thing befallen it. But
alas! Doth not our <hi>Engliſh</hi> proverb inform us, that <hi>he muſt needs

would not have made any ſuch breach upon his golden occaſions, as
the compiling of this <hi>vindication</hi> (ſuch as it is) hath put him upon,
had he not had the opportunity of commending himſelfe for a man

               <p>The ſaid Title page yet bleſſeth us with this one bleſſing more,<note place="margin">Sect. 124.</note>
which conſiſteth in ſuch a diſcovery or notification of the Author;
whereby a <hi>little</hi> doore of hope to obtain the <hi>great</hi> happineſſe of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him out in due time, is opened. The tenor of the words and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
together, is this: By C. B. <hi>who accounts it his honour to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Sion Colledge.</hi> In good time. <hi>Who accounts it</hi> HIS <hi>honour.</hi> Hath
the man no more <hi>honour</hi> that he <hi>counts</hi> upon, or can call HIS, but only
his ſimple <hi>being a member of Sion Colledge? Judas</hi> had the <hi>honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a member</hi> of the Colledge of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Apoſtles (a better foundation
I wiſſe, than that of C. B. his <hi>Sion Colledge</hi>) yet the ſpark of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
was ſoon quenched in the deluge of wickedneſſe, which burſt
out of him. But why, or upon what account doth C. B. <hi>account it his
honour to be a member of Sion Colledge?</hi> Himſelfe tells us (pag. 3.) that
<hi>the whole company of the Miniſters of London, and the ſuburbs</hi> (being <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents
of Churches) together with their Aſſiſtants and Lecturers, for the
time being, are all incorporated by Charter, as fellows of this Colledge:</hi> So
that by his own account it is no more <hi>honour to be a member of Sion
Colledge,</hi> than it is to procure a Church-living (whether by hook, or
by crook) or a Readers place, or a Lecture <hi>in London.</hi> And if this be
an <hi>honour</hi> to any man, certainly it is <hi>minimum quod ſic,</hi> the leaſt atome
or duſt that ever was filed off from the maſſe or wedge of Honour.
Beſides, if C. B. be the D. D. my thoughts run ſo much upon, I know
not well how, according to the tenor of his own informations, to
allow him that <hi>honor</hi> which he ſo highly accounts of, I mean; of <hi>being
a member of Sion Colledge.</hi> For ſince his <hi>Incumbency,</hi> or <hi>leaning upon Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
Pariſh (which complained grievouſly of his leaning hardupon it)
he neither was, nor yet is (to my knowledge) either an <hi>Incumbent</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or of any <hi>Church in London</hi> or ſuburbs, or any <hi>Aſſiſtant,</hi> or <hi>Lecturer</hi>
unto any ſuch <hi>Incumbent.</hi> Therfore there is no dore that I know of for
him to enter by into <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi> as a <hi>member</hi> thereof: but when the
dore is ſhut, he can climb, and get in by the window. If he hath any
colour or pretext of claim to the <hi>honour</hi> (as himſelfe reputeth it) of
the memberſhip which he challengeth, it is in the loweſt and laſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of all the reſt (according to his owne Table of <hi>Herauldry</hi>) I
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:161817:68"/>
mean, that of a <hi>Lecturer (for the time being.</hi>) But whether he be a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
or putative <hi>member</hi> onely of the <hi>Colledge</hi> he ſpeaks of; or whether
it be an <hi>honour</hi> to him to <hi>account it his honour to be</hi> ſuch <hi>a member of it,</hi>
as he is, or no; certain I am, that it would be a greater <hi>honour</hi> to him
by farre, if this <hi>Colledge</hi> could think it an <hi>honour</hi> to it to have ſuch a
member, as he. But though I cannot much commend this <hi>Colledge</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for principles of ingenuity, or for any great wiſdome in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for their own <hi>honour;</hi> yet I conceive they are not upon any ſuch
terms of defiance with their reputation, as to ſay, that they <hi>account it</hi>
their <hi>honour</hi> to have ſuch a <hi>member,</hi> as C. B.</p>
               <p>In the very entrance of his Piece,<note place="margin">Sect. 125.</note> he confeſſeth himſelf to have been
in a great diſtemper, when he read the 2 books, which (the diſtemper,
as it ſeems, yet remaining on him) in his Title page (as we heard) he
calls, <hi>two fell and fiery Satyrs;</hi> yea, here alſo he mingles words, which
plainly declare him to have been under the regiment of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as well when he <hi>wrote</hi> his own piece, as when he <hi>read</hi> thoſe other.
So that I cannot beleeve that common ſaying to be univerſally true,
viz. that <hi>to tell a dream is the part of a man waking.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Narrare ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis eſt.</note> The words of his

far miſtake the natures and reſpective purports of the two diſcourſes
he names, as to call them one while, <hi>two fell and fiery Satyrs,</hi> another
while, <hi>two ſcurrilous paſquils.</hi> He <hi>read</hi> them (he ſaith) <hi>with</hi> MUCH
ASTONISHMENT: if he had not ſaid it, his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> upon them, would have ſaid it for him. For both theſe ſpeak
him a man ſuffering <hi>much</hi> in his intellectuals, when he peruſed them.
A man of a ſerene and undiſturb'd fancy, could not lightly have pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
upon ſuch uncouth, wild, and extravagant appellations as thoſe,
by which he calleth them. That the diſtemper was not off him, any
whit more when he <hi>wrote,</hi> than when he <hi>read</hi> it, is beyond all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
confirmed by this ſaying of his, that <hi>Sion Colledge viſited,
was written by an Apoſtate member thereof.</hi> For I would fain know of
C. B. (if he be yet come to himſelfe, or to a more conſidering man)
upon what account he voteth me <hi>an Apoſtate member of Sion Colledge;</hi>
or wherein ſtands this my <hi>Apoſtaſie?</hi> Was that blind man, to whom

Chriſt reſtored his ſight, <hi>John</hi> 9. an Apoſtate from the Jewiſh wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

Or was <hi>David</hi> an <hi>Apoſtate</hi> from his religion, becauſe his enemies <hi>drave

                  </gap>cy, in <hi>Magnus</hi> Pariſh;
and thereby <hi>diſmembred</hi> himſelf from the <hi>Colledge</hi> he ſpeaks of? Yea is
it not likely that he would have continued in this his <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> all his
dayes, had he not been reduced and reconciled by the friendly media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many hundreds <hi>per annum?</hi> But if a Lecturers place in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
be the cure of his <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> in this kind, why is not mine apoſtaſie
healed alſo, who have accepted ſuch a relation as well as he? For
though the <hi>hundreds</hi> I ſpake of were his reconciliation, <hi>motivè,</hi> yet is
his place of a <hi>Lecturer,</hi> ſimply conſidered, and without the adjunct
of an Epiſcopall demeſne annexed, which reconciles him <hi>formaliter, &amp;

is as potent to inveſt me with the <hi>honour of being a member of

               <p>Again, conſidering that it is ſo generally known what an <hi>Exchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

(the common road to a <hi>Chancellorſhip</hi> in thoſe dayes) me
thinks it argues the reliques (at leaſt) of a diſtemper upon him, to

with his eſſayes to jeere and flout, make up the greateſt part of what
he pamphlets againſt me) I ſhall only touch two or three particulars
of ſomwhat another nature, in the charge whereof he magnifies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
at an extream rate of height and grandure againſt me. His firſt-born
charge againſt me (upon which he runnes a long diviſion in a
multiplicity of words, p. 14. and again, p. 19, 20.) is this, that I ſay in
my Epiſtle (which yet doth not begin with it neither, as C. B. ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth)
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:161817:69"/>
that <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great Biſhop of their ſouls, ſome few
months ſince, was pleaſed to adminiſter (by the hand of his weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
ſervant) a monitory viſitation unto ſome, profeſſing themſelves his
Miniſters, &amp;c.</hi> upon occaſion of theſe words, he chargeth me firſt,
with <hi>inward rancor of heart againſt the Colledge;</hi> and then, with <hi>a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
fathering of all, little ſhort of blaſphemy, upon Chriſt, and the
Almighty himſelfe.</hi> And (ſoon after) at a man fallen into a new trance
of <hi>aſtoniſhment,</hi> or as not recovered out of the former, he epiphone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's
it thus: <hi>O horrid preſumption, thus to entitle his railings, and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to the Almighty!</hi> But firſt, (good C. B.) where are the <hi>railings
and ſlanders you ſpeak of?</hi> Certainly the place of them is no where to
be found, but in your diſtempered fancy; diſtempered (I fear) with
a more malignant &amp; dangerous diſtemper, than that of <hi>aſtoniſhment.</hi>
You neither do, nor can, ſhew any one inſtance, either of the one
miſdemeanour, or the other, in that piece againſt which your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
ſo rageth: In that Epiſtle, or Preface you ſpeak of, you
onely find <hi>a monitory viſitation,</hi> intituled (as you call it) <hi>unto Chriſt;</hi>
no <hi>railings,</hi> or <hi>ſlanders.</hi> Nor doth it follow, that becauſe <hi>I intitle</hi> the
body or ſubſtance of that viſitation unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I muſt therefore <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title</hi>
unto him alſo all, or any, the infirmities found in the <hi>adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
A man may, and ought, intitle God to the act of his beleeving;
and yet not intitle him to any deficiency, or weakneſſe therein.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Whereas you are ſo zealouſly diſpleaſed, that I ſhould intitle
<hi>Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>viſitation</hi> you ſpeak of, and cry out of little leſſe than
<hi>blaſphemy</hi> in it, it no wayes troubles me (nor need to trouble any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
conſidering there is nothing more incident to men, that have
too much wil on ways that are ſinful, than to riſe up with deep indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

<hi>a tree of fiftie cubits high?</hi> or to have ſuch a Viall of wrath, or
ſuch a flood of fiery indignation poured out upon it, as this
great <hi>Rhadamanth</hi> hath prepared and decreed in theſe words:
<hi>Therefore (viz.</hi> becauſe <hi>the Records will ſpeake for themſelves,</hi> i. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Crow is black, and not white) <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith hee) I
<hi>know none but himſelfe, who doth boldly take authority, and delights

himſelfe: otherwiſe he might <hi>know</hi> another beſides me, who farre
more <hi>IMP<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DENTLY</hi> than I, <hi>changeth names at pleaſure.</hi>
For 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, when a perſon, or thing, hath two, or more names, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations,
he that calleth them by one of theſe names, and not
by the other, doth not hereby <hi>change the name of it:</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi>
called <hi>Peter</hi> by the name of <hi>Cephas</hi> (as he doth 1 Cor. 1. 12) did he
<hi>change his name at pleaſure;</hi> eſpecially calling him <hi>Peter</hi> elſwhere,
as I uſually call C. B. his beloved palace, where hee thinkes his
<hi>HONOR</hi> dwelleth, by the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Sion Colledge?</hi> Therefore
it is a moſt frivolous and falſe charge upon me, to ſay, that I
<hi>change the name of his Colledge,</hi> becauſe I once, or ſometimes, call
it by a name, by which it is not ſo vulgarly knowne, or called.
How much more ſhameleſly falſe is it, to ſay, that I either <hi>IMP<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>

               <p>Secondly, though he ſaith here, that he <hi>knowes none but me,</hi> that
hath ſo <hi>IMP<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DENTLY changed the name</hi> of that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of his eyes, <hi>Sion Colledge;</hi> yet a few lines before, hee had
ſaid, that he <hi>thinkes he knoweth another. As for the information</hi>
(ſaith hee) <hi>which you intimate out of the ancient Records, I THINK
it came originally from a famous Atheiſt.</hi> Surely this perſon whom
he calls an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> (by a worſe <hi>change of a name,</hi> I wiſſe, than that
of <hi>Sinon,</hi> for, <hi>Sion Colledge</hi>) yea a <hi>famous Atheiſt,</hi> whom he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects

               <p>3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> (And laſtly, to this) is not C. B. himſelf a far more <hi>Impudent changer
of names,</hi> and this <hi>at pleaſure,</hi> then I? He pretends not to lay any other
<hi>changing of names</hi> to my charge, but only of a dead edifice. Nor is the
Name pretended to be given by me by way of <hi>exchange,</hi> any wayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull,

<hi>points of the greateſt weight</hi>) but his frequent, and almoſt continuall

in <hi>Paul</hi> to be a <hi>Contradictor in chief</hi> to the world: nor did the
frequency of his contradictings and conteſts with men in his way,
any wayes evince him to be any other, than a moſt meek, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
quiet, and peaceable man. The great <hi>Knower</hi> of <hi>Hearts,</hi> and
<hi>ſearcher of the veines,</hi> in whoſe preſence I write, knoweth, that if
himſelfe would be pleaſed to diſcharge me of the ſervice of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting</hi>

with mine own weakneſſe and errors, he ſhould give me one of
the firſt-born deſires of my ſoule in the things of this life, into my
boſome. As for <hi>Revenge, I</hi> have alwayes (ſince <hi>I</hi> underſtood any
thing in the things of God) judged it not onely an un-chriſtian,
but a moſt effeminate, baſe, and ignoble paſſion or diſtemper: yea
at this very houre, my thoughts hardly ſuffer me to conceive of it,
as conſiſting with thoſe things which accompany ſalvation. But
to practiſe <hi>Revenge,</hi> when no injury hath been done, but rather a
kindnes, and office of love, as <hi>the telling of a man his own freely is,</hi> is a
farre more unmanly, unnaturall, and horrid diſtemper, than <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi>
it ſelfe (properly ſo called.) I wiſh that it were but as eaſie
for others to forbeare injuring of me, as it is for me to neglect and
paſſe it by, when they have done it. But whether it be either C. B.
himſelfe, or his common Report, or whoſoever, that burden me
with the crimes of <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Revenge,</hi> certain <hi>I</hi> am, that they are
ſtrangers to my ſpirit, and converſe in the world. The Apoſtle
<hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of himſelfe chiefly, yet (as it ſeems) in conjunction
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:161817:74"/>
with ſome others, ſaith they were, <hi>as deceivers, yet true</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 8.</note>. They were

from ſtrangers, of ſuch crimes, from the demerit and guilt
whereof, all that are intimate, and throughly acquainted with us,
as God, our conſciences, our boſome friends and acquaintance, do
