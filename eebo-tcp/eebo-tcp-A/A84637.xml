            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat through his ill managed Ambition, and inſufficiency for Government, together with the defection of the <hi>Army,</hi> he is enforced to addreſs Himſelf to this Honourable Houſe, having been taught that moderation with which he lately diſciplin'd his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Richard</hi> the late Protector, and peaceably ſubmit to their Wiſdom and Authority: And he is the rather contented with this Providence, ſince he ſees it is the unavoydable Fate of that Family, its Dependants and Allies, to be bafled and become the ſcorn, contempt, and deriſion of the Nation. His <hi>Excellency</hi> not being able to mount above the Clouds of your diſpleaſure (which through my Lord <hi>Lamberts</hi> diminiſhing Spectacles ſeemed to appearance no bigger than a mans hand, and are now overſpreading his Eſtate and Fortunes) in moſt humble wiſe proſtrates himſelf at your Feet, acknowledging with the Army-ſorrow his deviating into unequal paths, and his ill requiting ſuch Good and Gracious Maſters and Miſtreſſes as you have been, with his rebellious and undutiful carriage and demeanour. The Woman that <hi>Oliver</hi> gave him deceived him, and offered him of the <hi>forbidden fruit, and he ſaw it was good, and did eat thereof,</hi> and <hi>LO</hi> here he is in the briars of <hi>Wallingford</hi> Garden. And your Petitioner hopeth that his Ignorance and Seducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may ſomething mitigate and extenuate your disfavour and anger towards him.</p>
            <p>Your Suppliant further ſheweth, That he was plunged over head and ears into theſe bottomleſs deſigns by the Anabaptiſts, and that inſtead of waſhing himſelf clean, and making himſelf whole in their <hi>Jordan,</hi> he hath contracted ſuch a Leproſie, that he deſerves to be kickt out of the Camp, and never more to come near the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Albeit your Petitioner hath ſome ground of hope from the remembrance of his many ſignal and eminent ſervices done to the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> viz. his expedition to <hi>Worceſter</hi> and back again, with the loſs of one nights reſt; his Sea-ſick diſtemper in his paſſage to <hi>Ireland,</hi> but more peculiarly his ſtanding in <hi>Lamberts</hi> light and way, and intercepting his direct influence upon the <hi>Army,</hi> and diverting the torrent of the Souldiery into a ſafer and ſmoother channel, ſo that he might preſume to vye Merit either with Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> or Saint <hi>George</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, let his Piety, Zeal, Love to, and Delight in the Saints, all the ſincerity, uprightneſs and integrity of Spirit he hath left, come before you, let his meekneſs and temperance ballance his late haughtineſs and vain glory, and let not the rigor and ſeverity of your indignation force him to cry out with <hi>Baalams</hi> Beaſt, <hi>Am not I the Aſs on which thou haſt ridden ever ſince I was thine, and was I wont to do ſo unto thee? Why ſmiteſt thou me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In tender reſpect, and in ſerious conſideration therefore of theſe piteous Premiſes, may it pleaſe this Honourable Houſe out of their Noble Goodneſs and Clemency in this Bleſſed Time of Reſtauration, and as a token and earneſt of their mild and gentle Government, and that the enemies thereof may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and ſay, this is the end and reward of all Rebells; to readmit him him into the number of the ſeven Commiſſioners of the Army, and if the places be filled up, and there be no vacancy, to add one to the number, and make him the eighth Wiſe Man. If this ſhall by your grave Wiſdoms be thought a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, (rather then run after Partridges and Larks with his Brother-in-law,) His humble requeſt is that you would pleaſe to confer on him the Office of Mace-Bearer to the Speaker, it being a blunt Tool and befitting his courage, and will lie eaſier and handſomer on his ſhoulders then the Government. But if this alſo may not be conceded (he being rejected every where, and no party to take to) be humbly implores the favour of this Houſe for a Pattent to be granted to him for <hi>Arche's</hi> place, it being as cheap to be a Fool of your making as of his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>And your Petitioner ſhall ever pray, &amp;c.</closer>
