            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and this necessitie iumps with the sympathy of our <hi>constellations</hi> (for I thinke wee were borne both vnder the same <hi>Horoscope)</hi> that wee aduise and deuise some Proiect for the proceedings and successefull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of our <hi>Plantations.</hi> As you obtayned a <hi>Patent</hi> of the <hi>Southermost part of Newfoundland,</hi> and transplanted thither some of your <hi>countrimen of Wales,</hi> baptizing the same by the name of <hi>Cambrioll:</hi> so haue I got a <hi>Patent</hi> of the neighbouring Country vnto yours West ward beyond <hi>Cape Briton,</hi> Christning it <hi>New Scotland.</hi> You haue spent much, and so haue I in aduancing these hopefull Aduentures.

            <p>Wee need not complaine with our <hi>Sauiour</hi> in the <hi>Gospell,</hi> that <hi>the Haruest is great, and the Labourers few;</hi> for we haue many Labourers, which would willingly manure this maiden Soile, and with the painfull sweate of their browes reape what they sow.

The natiue and genuine salt of the earth, which fructified our Corne fields with so many infinite ploughings of our Ancestors and ours is spent; nor will Lime or Marle euer recouer them to the pristine and ancient vigour and fertilitie. <hi>English Cloth,</hi> which heretofore was dignified with the Title of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> growes out of request, yea (and with inward griefe I speake it) in contempt also among the Owners and Inhabitants themselues.

Neuerthelesse, <hi>inuit√¢ Inuidi√¢,</hi> in despite of Enuie, and of all malicious <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> which by their inuisible wheeling about the brains of Castawayes, doe vse to seduce their phantasies to crosse the very best Designes, whereof no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hath more cause then my selfe to complaine: wee ought to perseuere in constancie, and to out-dare For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune vnder the <hi>Almighties</hi> Banner. What incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did the <hi>Israelites</hi> feele, before they conquered the Land of <hi>Canaan?</hi> How many Persecutions did the <hi>Church</hi> endure, before the true <hi>Christian Faith</hi> was planted? None enters into <hi>Heauen</hi> without Crosses and fierie tryals composed of briers and brambles, which the <hi>Romanes</hi> termed the <hi>vnluckie Woods.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs lay aside all scrupulous doubts. Let vs cut

our Coats according to the cloath, taking care thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to husband the meanes allotted to our <hi>Plantations;</hi> which we shall the more easily accomplish, if we haue not passionate Superiours to controll vs, nor Coadin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in counsell to condemne vs. Commonly where many Directors are, the Directions prooue confused: which is the cause, that priuate houses be better built, &amp; with lesser charge then publicke edifices of the like proportion. Yea and we shall doe more in these places, where we haue eleuated our cogitations, and leuelled our ends for a thousand pounds, then others haue in <hi>Virginia</hi> or the <hi>Summer Ilands</hi> for forty thousand, so that wee transport for the space of the first two or three yeeres none but Fishermen and Labourers. By these we shall performe miracles, and returne yeerely into <hi>Great Brittaine</hi> a surer <hi>Gaine,</hi> then <hi>Iasons Golden Fleece</hi> from <hi>Colchos;</hi> euen with sixe moneths prouision and Nets, three men in one Boat shall reape a Golden Haruest, and get worth ten pound a weeke in Fish being brought into <hi>Europe</hi> or exchanged there in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; which besides the increase of <hi>Shipping</hi> and <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> will propagate our <hi>Plantations</hi> in a short time. Only heere lyes the <hi>Gordian</hi> knot to vndoe, a Rich man will not forgoe his natiue smoke, nor are poore men of abilitie now at first to get thither. For although we haue his Maiesties countenance propitious vnto these profitable Enterprizes, specially you of <hi>New-Scotland,</hi> yet all our wits cannot worke that impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in <hi>Misers</hi> heads to lend their helping hands to this goodly Proiect.

And if we should, men are now-adaies so <hi>Penny-wise and Pound foolish,</hi> they will sooner bestow fortie pounds vpon a glorious suit of apparell, then fortie shillings to better their brethren. Although these Golden hopes doe shine as cleere as the noonetide Sunne, yet will not they enlighten muddie apprehensions, nor quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en earth-creeping wits, vnlesse we could more firmely build vp and restore the <hi>Office of Assurance,</hi> which the <hi>Moorish Pirats</hi> haue lately endamaged. After I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my Answer, Master <hi>Elueston</hi> thus addressed his speech vnto vs: In my iudgement you are both too suspicious and distrustfull of our noble Countrymen. For some particulars you must not taxe the generall. Although some rake to themselues, neglecting the fruits of their <hi>Christian Faith:</hi> yet many loue their Neighbours as themselues, and will straine the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of their powers to succour the poore members of <hi>Christ.</hi> There bee Heauenly bodies aswell as Earthly Bodies. Me thinkes, you beeing both iudicious and Publishers of Bookes might so combine and contriue your studies together, that the World, were it as blind as Beetles, might see with <hi>Lynceus eyes</hi> the certaintie of the Commodities, the conueniencie of the <hi>Trade,</hi> and the infinite benefits which may arise by these heroicall enterprizes, which you Sir <hi>William Alexander</hi> for your part haue alreadie chalked out, and delineated in <hi>Print.</hi> And I doubt not but this Gentleman euen by a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous emulation, may if he please, second you with some pleasing Motiues of substance and spirit able to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate into the minds of the dullest Creatures, the sweete fruition of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> and like another <hi>Iason</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:19655:19"/>
with a braue Companie of <hi>Argonauticks,</hi> stirre vp the most stonie-hearted to relent and relieue their distressed Brethren, which now grone, and in a manner saint vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their penurious state. What will not patheticall perswasions worke? <hi>Orpheus,</hi> as Poets faigned, with his harmonious Harpe, drew a farre more hard-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Nation</hi> to follow his tune, and to dance after his motions.</p>
            <p>To this Sir <hi>William Alexander</hi> replied, wee liue not now, Master <hi>Elueston,</hi> in such simplicitie and candour of mind, as those people of the Golden Age. Men for the most part are now become peruerse Pigmeyes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their generous Ancestours. They are <hi>better fed then taught,</hi> faire without, and foule within, if not rotten like that <hi>Spaniards apple:</hi>

An Ape will be an Ape though you clothe him in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and a Hog will wallow in mire, though you feed him neuer so daintily.

Yea, and these profound <hi>Teachers</hi> doe oftentimes curtall their sacred Lessons, or else their <hi>Auditours</hi> ouer-cloyed with graue Doctrine will either despise them, or fall asleepe during their Sermons.

            <p>At this discourse of Sir <hi>William Alexanders,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Elueston</hi> as a man rauished with admiration, went forward in the like Proposition. Now, quoth he, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you haue traced my meaning, and happily conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured at that, which renders grace to the wise and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall <hi>Muses.</hi> Whosoeuer will commit to Presse that mixture, which sauours of some trifling fragments and historicall figments enterlaced among waightie and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious matters shall please the <hi>Iudicious</hi> and the <hi>Simple.</hi> Now adayes it is wisdom for a <hi>Writer</hi> to produce wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vnder a disguised stile, and so to weane the nurce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of his braine, that the Common People may bee edified by a discreet kinde of Folly. Let vs follow the example of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who ministred milke only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Babes; and not meat of too solid and hard digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Bible</hi> comprehends pleasing Relations, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as profound mysteries, gellies for the Sicke, and venison for the strong; where likewise a Lamb may

wade and an Elephant swimme. To this end doe wee vse Oliues, Capers, Oranges, and Limonds for sauceto tender stomackes, when as men of abler Constitutions can feede on meat without such prouocations. Excellent in this Art of Cookerie were those <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which wrot the life of <hi>Guz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the Rogue,</hi> and the Aduentures of <hi>Don Quixot de la Mancha,</hi> the former seruing to withdraw a licentious young man from Prodigalitie, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Deceit; and the latter to reclaime a riotous running wit from taking delight in those prodigious, idle, and time-wasting <hi>Bookes,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Mirrour of Knighthood, the Knights of the Round Table, Palmerin de Oliua,</hi> and the like rabblement, deuised no doubt by the <hi>Deuill</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme soules in the knowledge of euill, Honest <hi>Mirth</hi> I like, but if it bee accompanied with Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilitie, Baudrie, notorious lyes, or with prophane and too friuolous fopperies, I vtterly dislike all such pretended recreations. As the former is necessarie for the prolonging of health and life: so likewise it is for the sale and approbation of a <hi>Booke,</hi> wherein triuiall toyes and tales shall bee intermixt among matters of importance, that they may breede a longing desire in the Hearers to haue such nouelties repeated againe and againe.

This Discourse of Master <hi>Elueston</hi> did highly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Sir <hi>William Alexander,</hi> and confirme him in his resolution of applauding <hi>Bookes</hi> of this stampe and miscellaneous humour: so that conuerting his speech to me who attentiuely listned to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, he said: Noble Friend, by our caue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats you may obserue what course you must take to winne the good will of our <hi>Ilanders;</hi> for except you season your <hi>Anisoes</hi> with some light passages with wits, fits, &amp; fancies, like ballads &amp; bables to refresh the capacities of your Auditours, as <hi>Aesop the Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> vnder Fables couched and shadowed Policies of great moment, they will hardly yeeld due at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to your Counsels, be they neuer so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and consequently neuer assist vs for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> so requisite for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of this <hi>Monarchie,</hi> that in all likelihood it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long subsist without this maine and speciall <hi>Trade,</hi> which rightly may be termed the Nurcerie of Mariners, the propagation of shipping, <hi>Great Brittaines Indies, Corn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To shut vp my Iesuits mouthes for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours superioritie ouer the Pope himselfe, let them consider of these following Examples.

These Commissioners examined the matter, and finding <hi>Caecilianus</hi> innocent, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Accuser <hi>Donatus</hi> and his Complices. Whereupon he and they appealed to the <hi>Emperour</hi> himselfe after the example of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to <hi>Caesar</hi> from <hi>Festus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> as his <note place="margin">Act.

Which Appeale the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Constantine</hi> accepted, and ordred the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. <hi>The Eight first Councels</hi> were appointed by the <hi>Emperours,</hi> which no learned Papists can deny.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19655:32"/>
had thus slighted his supplications, he with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops of his Iurisdiction and limitation subscribed to the Canons agreed vpon in that Councell, as himselfe records in these words: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>

               <p>The like obedience <hi>Gregory</hi> another famous <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> about fiue hundred yeeres after Christ shewed, as his Predecessours had done, and caused a Law, which himselfe much disliked to be published throughout his limits, returning this Certificate to the <hi>Emperour: I being subiect vnto your commandement haue caused the same Law to be sent into diuers parts.</hi>

               <p>In the <hi>English</hi> Chronicles, euen when the Pope was at the highest staire of worldly triumph, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred, that <hi>Anselmus Archbishop of Canterbury,</hi> in some difference betwixt him and King <hi>William Rufus,</hi> would haue appealed to the <hi>Pope:</hi> And that the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Bishops</hi> withstood it.</p>
               <p>In the Raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, a Law was made on paine of Treason, not to appeale out of the Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus from time to time, it is manifest that the <hi>Popes</hi> power hath beene inferiour and subiect to Earthly <hi>Princes.</hi> And therefore to broach out such damnable Paradoxes for the iustification of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the warranting of priuate men to conspire against their Soueraignes, is a Doctrine, which <hi>God</hi> hates. Somtimes men are plagued by the immediate hand of <hi>God,</hi> sometimes by mediate and secondary means for their sins. Sometimes men are forced to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19655:33"/>
endure extraordinary stormes, tempests, famine, warres, and also crosses at their very friends hands. Sometimes their women are deliuered of abortiues or mishapen Creatures. All which they must pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently brooke: Much more must they beare with the spots of Princes, who haue long Eares and long hands.</p>
               <p>It is not safe or vertuous to meddle with liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious wares, nor to trouble the braine with these kind of Problemes. For if men liue in a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which is <hi>hereditary,</hi> the Fault is the greater. If in other Kingdomes, the fundamentall Lawes must be regarded by the <hi>publike States,</hi> and not by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate persons; If the Kingdome be <hi>Electiue</hi> as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> let the <hi>Chancelor</hi> looke to it. If in <hi>Germanie</hi> it belongs to the <hi>Electors</hi> to decide the quarrell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Emperour and the Subiects.</p>
               <p>Wee doe therefore vtterly detest these <hi>Iesuites,</hi> for maintayning of these bloudy Tragedies; and from henceforth wee banish that pestilent Race of Sectaries out of our Iurisdiction of <hi>Parnassus.

About nine a clocke in the morning vpon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed day, both the <hi>Friers</hi> being brought before the <hi>Lords of the Connocations, Apollo</hi> spake in this wise to Saint <hi>Frances:</hi> The first time that you were ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated in morall Precepts, and sithence matricula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our Court, you vndertooke aswell for your <hi>Monasticall Order</hi> as your selfe to liue chast, and not to minister occasion of scandall to the married So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, to suspect the least token of incontinencie in your carriages. But we find that you are flesh and bloud, subiect to concupiscence as well as others. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> therefore aduiseth you rather to marrie then to burne. But you on the contrary doe forbid your Clergy to marry at all, although in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences you know it a most grieuous yoke, the which our <hi>Sauiour Christ</hi> said that no man can beare, vnlesse as a speciall Gift some few receiue it from <hi>Heauen.</hi> And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels you, <hi>It is the doctrine of deuils to forbid Marriage.</hi> Why then haue you imposed such a burthen, such a vow on these silly Nouices of your Fraternitie, which they can neuer keep without hinneying and lusting after the Female Sexe? Haue not you heard that a certaine <hi>Hermite</hi> cockolded the chiefest <hi>Nobles of a Princes Court,</hi> whose Wiues vsed to repaire to his Cell for Spirituall Physicke, as if he had beene ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Baptist?</hi> Endeauour yee neuer so violently to expell the affections of <hi>nature,</hi> they will breake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your thoughts and bodies doe what yee can, as

               <p>This sacred kisse did his louing <hi>Brother</hi> substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially engraue on the lips of his sweet <hi>Sister.</hi> And because the memoriall of his vertuous <hi>Loue</hi> might sticke there, he infused it with a long temporizing breath of halfe an houre together, as with a deepe Seale and Character not to bee forgotten by her, which <hi>kisse</hi> being so imprinted could not but argue an entire vnion in their Soules by a pleasing har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, and a honeyed participation of excellent Charitie. As for Doctor <hi>Wicliffe</hi> impeachment, hee hoped that an <hi>Hereticks</hi> supercilious taxation was not of force to condemne an act of Charitie, being a man euer reputed euen among his own Sect too rigorous &amp; austere, whose teeth might perhaps water at such a daintie obiect, because hee had not met with the like happinesse himselfe. And if the said Doctor <hi>Wicliffe</hi> did misconster their true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he retorted that embleme, which <hi>the Knights of the Noble Order of the Garter,</hi> by the Institution of <hi>Edward the third King of England,</hi> vsed for many yeeres to embellize: <hi>Honte soit qui maly pensoit.</hi> Shame to him that euill thinketh.

Kisse, iustifiable both at comming and parting. But more then two <hi>Kisses</hi> at one meeting, a seuere <hi>Lord President of Wales</hi> could not endure.</p>

               <p>The fourth degree of <hi>Kissing</hi> is called a <hi>Leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous kisse,</hi> vsed vnlawfully among them that shunne the light, or in the <hi>Stewes,</hi> to despite their Angell Guardians, and to call the Sunne as a witnesse of their obstinate standing out against their Great Creatour.</p>

               <p>The seuenth sort of <hi>Kissing</hi> is stiled the <hi>kisse of Grace,</hi> or Honour, which <hi>Potentates</hi> and great <hi>Princes</hi> haue vsed to conferre on inferiour Persons by reaching their hands or feet to be kissed by them</p>
               <p>This last of the <hi>Foot</hi> doth properly belong to my <hi>Lord the Pope,</hi> to countenance and fauour <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> like the <hi>Sunne,</hi> which lends the beautie of his rayes to the <hi>Moone</hi> and lesser <hi>Starres</hi> though in very deede they are no more worthy (being worldly-minded creatures) to kisse his holy and sanctified Foot, then Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach vnto Christ, whose shooe latchet hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that hee was no way worthy to vndoe. I know Doctor <hi>Raynolds</hi> in his workes <hi>de Romana I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dololatria</hi> mislikes this, as a marke of <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Pride not accepted by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> though a meaner man then an Emperour would haue done that vassalage vnto his <hi>Holinesse.</hi> But <hi>Heretickes</hi> know not the reason of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> refusall. Let them therefore vnderstand, that the <hi>Triple Crowne</hi> was not at that time settled on <hi>Peters</hi> head; and withall, that Saint <hi>Peters</hi> deniall, saying, <hi>My selfe am also a man,</hi> sauoured not so much of modestie, as of a <hi>Courtly</hi> putting by the vrgent presumption
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19655:37"/>
of such an inferiour Person, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> was. For perhaps if the <hi>Roman Emperour</hi> himselfe would haue sued for that Honour with teares and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, he might haue had the grace to kisse his <hi>Foot.</hi> When a subiect sues to a King for some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Gift, which he is not willing to bestow, hee will not daunt him with a rigorous repulse, but answeres him, that he will consider of it, <hi>Le Roy se auisera.</hi> Of these sixe last kisses I dare cleere my good <hi>Franciscan.</hi> He is as harmelesse as my selfe I can assure your Maiestie, being of my owne educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and like me in conditions.</p>
               <p>And a very Ideot then replied <hi>Apollo.</hi> But the young Fellow lookes as if he had more wit then his Tutour, more Knaue then Foole.

But if a Lay man had committed such a crime in the Church, it had beene exorbitant, worthy of fire and faggot. Old <hi>Couper</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> found no such fauor nor Aduocate to defend his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie for one poore <hi>kisse</hi> which hee vnwittingly gaue to a <hi>Lady Abbesse</hi> in <hi>Siuil.</hi> For when this honest man at the time when <hi>K.

                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:19655:38"/>
would buy some of his butter, hee went with his Broker and others to compound for the price with her. <hi>Couper,</hi> the chamber being somewhat darke, thinking after the manner of <hi>England,</hi> that the Broker and the rest that bare him company, &amp; he the hindermost, had saluted the <hi>Ladie Abbesse</hi> on the mouth, whereas they kissed but her vesture, he as his course came, popt a swinging kisse on her bare lips. Whereupon, as a woman rauished, not with ioy, but of her personall honestie, she exclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; <hi>O Vellaco, Lutherano, Perro.</hi> Villaine, <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> Dog. No excuses could serue his turne, but all the Merchants goods and ship vnder his charge were confiscated to the <hi>Holy House,</hi> together with his Person, where after much intreatie hee got the fauour at last, only with the forfeit of the ship and goods, to doe a yeeres penance there in the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition house with wearing a Iackanapes Coat of ma ny colours, which they call Saint <hi>Benets hood</hi> or <hi>Sanbenita,</hi> euery Holy-day during the time of Masse for one whole yeare.

After these Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were ended, hee called for the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and askt him why hee forsooke him so rudely, and staid not for the happinesse to kisse his <hi>Holinesse Foot?</hi> To whom he answered, that when hee saw so great a <hi>Prince</hi> stoope to receiue a <hi>kisse</hi> at that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy place, he verily thought, that in regard hee was but a priuate person, the <hi>Pope</hi> would not haue done him that Imperiall grace, but that hee would haue turned his back-side vnto him to bee kist.</p>

The lot arriuing to this Gentleman, it chanced that a great <hi>Countesse</hi> passed by, which somewhat amazed the Gentleman: yet loth to pay the wager and remembring the old say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Faint heart neuer kist faire Ladie,</hi> hee boldly

repaired to the <hi>Countesse,</hi> &amp; related the occurrence. The <hi>Noble Lady</hi> vnderstanding his demand, bid him thence forwards to take heede how he laid any such rash wagers.

The <hi>Countesse</hi> after that she well lookt on it, returned it backe saying, that because he had kept his knife so neat and cleane, he seemed to bee a spruce Gentleman, and therefore deserued a kisse, which she presently gaue him.

                  <hi>THomas Becket of Canterburie,</hi> that opposed himselfe so obstinatly against his <hi>anointed King</hi> heere in <hi>England,</hi> about some liuings which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to belong to the <hi>Sea of his Archbishoprick</hi> appealing to the <hi>Pope</hi> from his Countryes Censure, exhibited an Information before <hi>Apollo,</hi> against his antient Friend <hi>Walter de Mapes Arch-deacon of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> for withstanding the <hi>Popes Legat,</hi> that came to <hi>London</hi> with a strict Decree to command all the <hi>Clergie men in England</hi> to put away their wiues. <hi>Walter de Mapes</hi> was sent for, at whose comming <hi>Th.

they might follow their bookes the better, not caring for the vanities of this transitorie world as also lest like New <hi>Fues</hi> they might tempt vs to taste what God had forbidden, that is, Iealousie, Anger, Deceit, Simony, and Pride to compasse meanes for their haughtie minds. After much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie we executed his <hi>Holinesse</hi> good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Neuerthelesse, this Seditious Sectarie, not onely openly with opprobrious words, but with an infamous Libell hee presumed to taxe our <hi>Holy Father</hi> of Errour (or <hi>Heresie</hi> if hee durst) for this <hi>Diuine</hi> Ordinance. The Contents of his Libell are these: That it was a grieuous torment for a <hi>Priest</hi> to put away his wife, because shee was his darling, affirming that the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> made an il Decree, and wisht him to beware hee dyed not in so great a Sinne. That his <hi>Holinesse</hi> forbad that pleasure now in his old age, which he loued in his youth. That <hi>Mapes</hi> defended his Errour by the authoritie of the <hi>Old and New Testament,</hi> citing <hi>Zacharie</hi> the Priest to be the Father of Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and that S. <hi>Paul</hi> allowed a <hi>Clergie man to be the Husband of one Wife:</hi> That it became a <hi>Priest</hi> better to marrie then to borrow or deflowre his Neighbours daughter, Niece, or Wife. And in Conclusion, hee was so impudent as to require all <hi>Priests</hi> to bestow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Sweet Hearts a <hi>Pater noster</hi> a piece for this his goodly Apish Apologie.</p>
               <p>His Maiestie smiled to heare the Conceit. And thereupon caused the <hi>Pronotarie</hi> to reade the Libell as <hi>Walter de Mapes</hi> had framed it, who with an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible voice did recite as followeth</p>

               <p>AFter the <hi>Pronotarie</hi> had ended, <hi>Apollo</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Walter de Mapes</hi> to defend his cause who thus began: I am glad, <hi>Most Noble Emperour,</hi> that my Aduersarie hath cited mee to defend my Cause in this judicious Court; where Bribes, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Affection, and Passion cannot wrest the infallible reasons of Truth, as oftentimes wee see fall out in worldly Iudgements. Heere I need not feare the <hi>Popes</hi> Thunderbolt of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore with a resolued countenance and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19655:49"/>
a minde vndaunted, I will proue out of the Holy Scriptures, and by the authoritie of the Primitiue Church, that wee Clergie-men may and ought to marrie as well as others.</p>
               <p>By the Old Testament, it is euident, that the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uits,</hi> as <hi>Aaron, Phinehes, Eleazar, Zadock, Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> were married men. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as we reade in the New Testament was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise married, for our Sauiour Christ cured his Wiues Mother of an Ague. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> aduiseth a Bishop to be the Husband of one onely wife, and in another place auoucheth, that it is better to marrie then to burne. Yea and Christ himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth it to be a very hard matter for any man whatsoeuer to continue chast, except it were giuen him from heauen as a special gift (as rare a Miracle, as a blacke Swan or a white Crow.) And shall we expect such miraculous and rare sightes in these tempestuous times, when the Church it selfe hath much adoe to steale out of <hi>Babylon?</hi> When the purest of vs all doe feele tumultuous Hurliburlies in our members striuing and strugling to ouer-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the faculties of our Soules? As we are men we know our vnresistable frailties. We must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our naturall Infirmities; or else <hi>we are Liers, and the Truth dwels not in vs.</hi> How much better then were it for vs to ioyne in lawfull <hi>Marriage,</hi> then to stay as stale Batchelers, and hypocritically to take vpon vs that taske, which our weake Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles cannot support? Sometimes wee saue those Soules by <hi>Marriage,</hi> which perhaps might
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19655:50"/>
proue lost, were they not our wiues. By these wee beget children, whom we traine vp and graffe into Christ. We enioy this happinesse oftentimes in our wiues and children, that by our examples and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie they shine as Starres heere on Earth, giuing light to them that sit in darknesse, we encrease the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen;</hi> and heere in this World wee leaue no scandall behind vs, as the vnmarried <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> doe by their <hi>Stewes,</hi> and stolne pleasures. <hi>Haue not we power to lead about a Sister, aswell as the rest of</hi>

                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> confutes this Heresie, saying, that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiphan. in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi> 79.</note> this was meere madnes, &amp; a Sicknes of <hi>Eue</hi> now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine deceiued, nay, of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> which abused <hi>Eue.</hi> His Arguments are these. First, No women euer sacrificed in the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> Secondly, If any women, it had beene a regular Custome in the Church, that <hi>Mary</hi> her selfe did sacrifice in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which wee neuer read of. Thirdly, Nor was the Sacrament of Baptisme euer committed to <hi>Mary.</hi> Or else her <hi>Sonne</hi> would haue made choise of her and not of <hi>Iohn.</hi> The <hi>Gospell</hi> was committed to the care of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and not to any <hi>woman.</hi> Fourthly, The Daughters of <hi>Philip</hi> did prophecie, but neuer medled with those mysteries which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to men, who onely executed the Priestly office. Fistly, Women were forbidden to speake in the Church.</p>
               <p>Out of these Propositions he proues, that the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> is not to be worshipped. First, Because he is a <hi>Deuill,</hi> which making a <hi>God</hi> of a mortall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the eyes of men, doth expresse by the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Art any carued Images, which represent the shape of man. Secondly, Because the minde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits adulterie, which falls from the euer-liuing <hi>God</hi> to honour the Images of the Dead, like to a <hi>Whore,</hi> which forgoes the lawfull vse of a Husband to lye with others. Thirdly, Because <hi>Mary</hi> was not giuen vs to be worshipped, but that her selfe should wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship her <hi>Sonne.</hi> Fourthly, For that these words in the <hi>Gospel</hi> doth warne vs to take heed: <hi>Woman, what haue I to doe with thee?</hi> That by these words wee
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19655:54"/>
might note in calling her <hi>Woman,</hi> that others might not admire her, as a <hi>Virgin</hi> too holy and sacred. Fiftly, Because in the Scriptures wee doe not find, that any of the <hi>Prophets</hi> euer commanded vs to worship any man, much lesse a woman. Sixtly, <hi>God</hi> allowes vs not to worship <hi>Angels.</hi> Therefore hee will not haue vs to worship <hi>Mary.</hi> Shee may bee mentioned with honour. But Worship and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is a mysterie due onely vnto God. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Angels receiue not that Glorification. These bee the reasons which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> exhibited against the <hi>Collyridians.</hi>

And when the <hi>Churchwardens</hi> murmured,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19655:55"/>
saying, that seeing he had tore it, he ought to haue bought a new one, or not to haue rent it so much as he did; <hi>Epiphanius</hi> promised to send them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vaile to bee hanged vp in lieu thereof, which afterwards he performed, &amp; in a letter to that effect to <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> hee recommends the said vaile, charging him to beware how he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any such Idolatrous things to bee set vp in any place within his Iurisdiction.</p>
               <p>To conclude, let it suffice, that <hi>Christians</hi> honor the memorie of the blessed <hi>Saints</hi> vpon those Daies which the Church haue allotted for that purpose. Let them glorifie <hi>God</hi> for vouchsafing to send those Seruants of his as the chiefe Elders and Pillars vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their <hi>Sauiour Christ</hi> the Head of their corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

What a shamefull thing is it for the <hi>Pope</hi> to vsurpe a higher prerogatiue then our <hi>Sauiour</hi> himselfe euer affirmed that his <hi>Almightie Father</hi> left vnto him? Hee knew not the Day of Doome, nor did hee seeke to know more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the <hi>Sonne of Man</hi> to know. And yet the <hi>Pope</hi> in worldly craft to bring more sacks to his mill, and a concourse of trading to his <hi>Babilon,</hi> hath granted a Pardon of 6000. yeares to come, vnto all such as shall resort to the Church of Saint <hi>Iohn de Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane in Rome,</hi> and also an absolute Pardon of eight and twentie thousand yeares, with plenary remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Sinnes, to as many people as shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre thither vpon the Feast day of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangelist: when as the <hi>Elect of God</hi> doe surely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue that this world cannot last so long, but that the Sunne of Righteousnesse shall shine before that time, and descend from the Heauens to iudge all the Sonnes of <hi>Adam.</hi> Many of my poore Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen of late since the Conquest of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> haue beene forced to shift their Religion, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of these idle Pardons against their consciences.

                  <hi>Apollo</hi> at these speeches of <hi>Luther</hi> seemed much to bewaile the condition of the times. And to fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret out the better the Originall of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and of the <hi>Popish Pardons</hi> he asked <hi>Peter Lumbard</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Sentences, who flourished about fiue hundred yeeres agoe, whether in his time the world did belieue, there was any such place as <hi>Purgatory. Peter Lumbard</hi> answered, that there was not the least thought of such a place in his time. Nor doe the <hi>Greekes</hi> to this houre (said hee) credit any such matter. And shall I sleepe still, replied <hi>Apollo,</hi> while this <hi>Enchanter</hi> beguiles with his false lure the ares of simple Soules? The <hi>Poets</hi> had their <hi>Elisian</hi> fields, as this <hi>Fellow</hi> his Fable of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> They deuised theirs of pleasure.

               <p>After our <hi>Sauiours death</hi> for the space welnigh of three hundred yeeres, the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> was so persecuted by the <hi>Romane Emperours,</hi> specially, at <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe, and in the neerest places adioyning vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> that no Ecclesiasticall Policie could stand on foote, nor erect publicke Churches, and consequently no Mitred Bishops, to solemnize or order the affaires of that spiritual Common-wealth in any complete forme, no more then at this day we see in <hi>France,</hi> a few places onely by their Ciuill Warres tolerated: Specially in <hi>Paris</hi> the chiefe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> cannot haue any, but by permission about two leagues from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they are allowed their Diuine Seruice. The like, though not so openly, those ancient <hi>Christians</hi> were tolerated to enioy priuately in their Houses, as in hugger-mugger at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Capitall Seate of that Empire. In processe of time <hi>Constantine the Great</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:19655:67"/>
attained to the Empire, who for some causes, and principally because he would bee a neerer Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to the Northerne Nations, and also to the <hi>Persians,</hi> who infested his State with sundry inrodes and hostile inuasions, he was constrained to remoue the Imperiall Seate to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> leauing the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> some power at <hi>old Rome,</hi> whereby in his absence hee might, as a Reuerend Prelate with his graue and Christianly exhortations retaine the Citizens in their Alleageance. In this sort these good <hi>Bishops</hi> continued loyall to their <hi>Prince</hi> and subiect to their Command and to their Successours in the Empire, vntill the <hi>yeere of our Lord,</hi> 606. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which time after a great contention for the Primacie betwixt them and the <hi>Patriarch of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> which then was called <hi>New Rome, Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> by the murther of his Lord and Master <hi>Maurice the Emperour,</hi> hauing gotten the Soueraigntie made <hi>Boniface the Third</hi> Supreme Bishop aboue all other Bishops, and to that end sent forth a Decree, <hi>that all the Churches in his Empire should obey him as their Soueraigne Bishop,</hi> which Iurisdiction he held onely <note place="margin">Naucler.</note> in Spiritull matters. After this the <hi>Emperour Iustine Iustinians Sonne raigned;</hi> who sent <hi>Longinus</hi> as his Deputy into <hi>Italy,</hi> to settle the confused state there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of after the expulsion of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> who altered the forme of Gouernment in <hi>Rome,</hi> and abrogated the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>Consulary</hi> Dignities, which till that time continued and carried with it a glimpse of the ancient <hi>Maiestie of the Romane State,</hi> and in steed of them appointed one Principall Gouernour, whom
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19655:67"/>
he called an <hi>Exarch</hi> or Viceroy. This innouation ministred an occasion to the <hi>Lumbards</hi> to enter into <hi>Italie.</hi> And then the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> felt new trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.

               </argument>
               <p>AFter that the <hi>Pronotarie</hi> had read that Part of the <hi>Plowmans Tale,</hi> which Sir <hi>Geffrey Chaucer</hi> had published against the <hi>Pope</hi> &amp; the <hi>Romish Church</hi> hee was commanded by <hi>Apollo</hi> to defend his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Sir <hi>Geffrey Chaucer</hi> obeyed, and framed this extemporary Oration: <hi>Most high and redoubted Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> I am glad that <hi>Scotus</hi> hath prouoked mee this day to open that Secret; which by the craft of our <hi>Arch sorcerer</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> hath beene concealed from the vulgars knowledge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this fulnesse of Time, which the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> hath appointed for his Discouerie. The <hi>Waldenses, Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gienses,</hi> and many others long before my time haue done their endeauors in other Countryes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale him: but here in <hi>England Abbot Ioachim</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, who in K. <hi>Rich.</hi> the firsts dayes proclaymed the <hi>Pope Antichrist,</hi> no man durst for feare of his formidable Tyrannie disclose what they knew in their Consciences to bee apparantly true. This Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19655:76"/>
and Gift of <hi>discerning Spirits</hi> was indeed kept from the Common people, by that execrable Policie of with-holding the <hi>Bible</hi> from our <hi>English</hi> translation, so that these <hi>two Witnesses,</hi> which lay martyred and yet vnburied in the streets of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> could not performe their proper offices. Now that it hath pleased God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue that palpable Darknesse, they begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue and to stand vpon their feet to the amazement of the Carnall Beholders. By their sacred motion the eyes of my vnderstanding are likewise opened: and I doubt not but all your <hi>Maiesties Court</hi> shall know out of my mouth this day, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and none but he is that <hi>Antichrist,</hi> which was so long agoe prophesied to come and seduce the <hi>Christian Church</hi> with lyes, Equiuocations, and the wonders of <hi>Sathan.</hi> For the manifestation of which damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practices, inspire my heart, <hi>O fierie Comforter;</hi> Inflame my mind with true Zeale, the seale of thy sacred Spirit, that I may soare vp, like an Eagle, to the Sunne of thy Grace with feruencie founded on Diuine Discretion, for Feruencie is but foolish fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie without Diuine Discretion.</p>
               <p>The first marke of <hi>Antichrist</hi> I gather from our <hi>Sauiour</hi> himselfe, who prophefied, <hi>many shall come</hi>

                  <hi>Holinesse</hi> wardeth them with that saying of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Dauid, Touch not mine Anointed:</hi> Meddle not <note place="margin">Psalme 105.</note> with my <hi>Christs.</hi> Though they be taken fighting in the Field with Armour on their backs, hee termes them his Sons, the Conqueror must leaue them to depart in peace. Which made a <hi>Prince</hi> sometime to returne him this Answer: I haue sent your <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> your <hi>Sonnes Coat,</hi> the Armour, in which I found your <hi>Bishop</hi> fighting, when I tooke him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner. And if you be as quick-sighted as <hi>Iacob,</hi> let me know, whether this be your <hi>Iosephs Coat?</hi> vntill <hi>King Edward the first his time,</hi> Clergie men were the <hi>Lawyers</hi> in England, as an Ancient Writer testified: <hi>Nullus Clericus nisi Causidicus.</hi> They sate as supreme <hi>Iudges</hi> in Temporall Causes. But when their King should chastize them for their briberies and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then they shrowded themselues vnder the <hi>Spirituall keyes,</hi> and appealing to the <hi>Pope</hi> they freed themselues from all Accusations. Thus did Errors play vpon the preheminence of <hi>Kings,</hi> vntill they were beaten out from their <hi>Law,</hi> and at the last from their chiefest holds by the valour of <hi>King Henry the Eight;</hi> and well worthy, seeing that they presumed to make vse of the name of <hi>Christ</hi> to cloke their falsehoods and lewd tricks.</p>
               <p>The second Mark of <hi>Antichrist</hi> I collect out of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>in the last dayes men should bee high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,</hi>

                  <hi>louers of pleasures more then louers of God, hauing a shew of godlines, but denying the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> All these are verified in the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Clergie Hee exalteth himselfe aboue <hi>Emperours</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:19655:77"/>
comparing himselfe to the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and them to the <hi>Moone</hi> and lesser starres. Yea, he ranketh his Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Cardinals</hi> with <hi>Kings.</hi> Which ambition moued <hi>Cardinall Wolsey</hi> to place himselfe aboue his <hi>King: Ego &amp; Rex meus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What greater pleasure can worldly men enioy more then the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Hierarchie doe? They haue a large command of Cities, and huge Territories. Besides <hi>Rome, Romania, Bolonia, Ferrara, Auinion,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> is like to possesse very shortly the <hi>Dutchie of Vrbin.</hi> Nor doth his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition cease in these pleasant places, many other Episcopall Seates out of <hi>Italie</hi> doth hee dispose of. In Humilitie farre from <hi>Christs</hi> life, yet pretending sanctimonie, and a vertuous life, but denying the effects thereof, as his tolleration of the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Stewes,</hi> his seruing of Idols, his vnlawfull Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, and monstrous Pardons doe plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate.</p>
               <p>The third marke of <hi>Antichrist</hi> is deriued from another place of Saint <hi>Paul, Now the spirit speaketh euidently,</hi> that some should fall from the Faith, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heede to seducing Spirits, and Doctrines of Deuils, speaking lyes in hypocrifie, forbidding Marriage and Meates. <note place="margin">2. Tim, cap. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now what Church is the same which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth Marriage and the eating of flesh at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed times? Is it not the <hi>Romish?</hi> The <hi>Greeke Church,</hi> whom for Antiquitie none can deny but they stand parraleld and equall with the <hi>Romane,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:19655:77"/>
doe prohibit no such things. Their Clergie, as the <hi>Abissines in Aethiopia</hi> haue alwayes continued marriage. Therefore let this Marke serue for one to conuince the <hi>Pope</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine of Deuils,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it. And for their prohibition of meates, who doe insist more strongly then the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Clergie? To eate Flesh vpon some dayes is a mortall sinne, vnlesse it bee with their speciall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, as the <hi>Castilians</hi> haue bought out their freedome vpon some forbidden dayes.</p>
               <p>To abstaine from Flesh they account it meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, and yet to eat Fish, Caueare, Almonds, Figs, and other lustfull viands they professe it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Sauiour</hi> notwithstanding warrants vs to eate Flesh, saying, <hi>that which goeth into the mouth defileth not a man.</hi> And this hee proues by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible reason: <hi>because that whatsoeuer entreth into</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. cap. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I condemne not the true vse of Fasting with bread and water, in them, who finde their bodies carnally bent, or so full of grosse humours, that they breathe vp into their heads, like cloudie and foggie vapours, to ecclipse and darken their vnderstanding, wills, and memories, those noble Organs of the Soule, if they cannot otherwise without such mortification subdue their fleshly longing desires, and fall to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent Prayers. Likewise I commend <hi>Fasting</hi> to all the vnmarried and lazie Persons, who haue
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19655:78"/>
liued without much exercise, faring well and lying in downie beds. Such indeed haue reason aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to embrace <hi>Abstinence</hi> as a Iewell, least their Gluttonic with ease should fill their veines with too much blood, least their spleene grow to a bigger proportion then is fitting, least through oppilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and obstructions, feuers, the small poxe, the plurisie, the greene sicknesse, the consumption, and chefly the <hi>Scuruie,</hi> that vnsuspected Guest, and hardly discerned Traitouresse at the first approch to the wisest Physician, doe seize vpon them as their slaues, neuer to bee redeemed.</p>
               <p>But to make it a point of Religion, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men, that Fasting can satisfie <hi>Gods</hi> iustice, or appease his wrath iustly conceiued against vs for sinne, is the <hi>Doctrine of Diuels,</hi> and a marke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist. To the cleane all things are cleane,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> said. And the Elders of the Church ought <note place="margin">Tit. cap. 1.</note> not to clog and burthen the consciences of their yonger brethren, with such yokes of mens inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Traditions, as <hi>Touch not, taste not, handle not,</hi> which as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> againe saith, <hi>bee things of no value, sith they belong to the filling of the Flesh.</hi> For it is the soule and not the Flesh, which good <note place="margin">Colos. cap. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Christians</hi> ought to keep pure and vndefiled. Which moued that ancient Father <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who liued <note place="margin">

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19655:84"/>
scatter abroad for the offending of tender consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. <hi>Arminius</hi> answered, that the Opinion which hee maintayned, was not new, but grounded on the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And hee hoped that all Positions which did not diameter wise and flatly oppugne the <hi>Word of God,</hi> might still be held and questioned if for no other end, then for the triall and exercising of one anothers wits, which might like Iron, waxe rustie without some vse or furbushing. And what might your quaint Question bee, replyed <hi>Apollo,</hi> which tends now at this sacred time to refine wits, when men should ioyne together in commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords last <hi>Supper,</hi> to sanctifie and purifie their humane wills? <hi>Most dread Soueraigne,</hi> said <hi>Arminius,</hi> It is not vnknowne vnto your blessed Maiestie, how many Communicants doe yeerely resort vnto the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> more fit to bee whipt at a Carts tayle, or to be thrust into the <hi>Spanish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,</hi> then to keepe companie with regenerated persons at the celebration of the holy Sacrifice, which whosoeuer presumes to touch vnworthily being vnprepared, <hi>eates his owne Damnation,</hi> or in the mildest censure he deserues to be made an vgly <hi>Leper</hi> with King <hi>Vzziah.</hi> The zealous considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this imminent danger, which might ensue to my sicke Brethren, moued mee to take care for their Soules health, and to require them to try their Spirits, whether they were in the state of Grace or back-sliders? whether they feit an alternate moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not often subiect to alteration in the bottome of their hearts, pricking them forwards to doe

good workes. If they did, I told them that the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> cooperating with those sweet moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theirs, would frame an harmonious sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonie in their Soules, which so contuned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued would likewise sympathize with Heauenly Mysteries. But if they found their wills depraued, led with the least concupiscence, they should not aduenture like <hi>Iudas</hi> to come neere their <hi>Sauiour,</hi> or partake in the Eucharist at this <hi>Feast of Easter.</hi> Now because I catechized them in this manner, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding further for their greater terrour from sinne, and that they might repent in time, that though they were elected and iustified by Grace, according to the purpose of God, yet they might totally and finally fall, vnlesse their owne <hi>free will</hi> did worke with the will and <hi>Grace</hi> of the fierie <hi>Comforter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> hearing this protestation of <hi>Arminius</hi> told him, that hee was like a skittish Cow, which giues a good pailefull of milke, and afterwards flings it downe with her foot. And moreouer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned this paraneticall counsell, I liked very well of your whole narration, vntill you arriued at the period of your Apologie. If you did it <hi>in terrorem tant√∫m,</hi> to scare them from sinne, and to prepare their minds to Repentance, you shewed your selfe a cunning Merchant in the spirituall Trade, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a politicke Statesman; both which agree not with <hi>Christs</hi> candour, with the <hi>Holy Spirits</hi> ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie.

               <p>In alledging that mans <hi>free will</hi> must aide and cooperate with the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> you cannot but ascribe glorie vnto flesh and bloud, which is fraile and honour vnto Nature, which the <hi>Serpent</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a mortall sting.

                  <p>Florio <hi>in a briefe Oration declares the reasons, why hee inuented such a strange forme of</hi> Letany.</p>

In former times they neuer vsed to direct binding Processes, but against Fugitiues. They neuer sent Pursuiuants nor Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieants at Armes in matters of Debt betwixt Partie and Party, but onely in Criminall and high natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Causes, where the <hi>King</hi> was immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed. They seldome vsed to fine the <hi>Plaintiffe</hi> for charitable yeelding to an attonement at home, or if they did, it was but small in the nature of a mild amercement. They endeuoured by all meanes to establish Loue and Charity among Neighbours, and were glad to heare those good newes of their Conuersions, though their Gaine came in the lesse. They often vsed to repeate that Prouerbe of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> euen at their meales: <hi>Better it is to sup a messe of Pottage with quietnesse of minde, then to haue a whole Oxe with strife.</hi> They trembled and made a conscience to take money of any fellow Christian, though due vnto them for sentence or verdict, if the same came like so many drops of life-bloud from his heart. They cared more for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> then for the <hi>Plaintiffe,</hi> vnlesse the Cause were too abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>
               <p>Why then I see, said <hi>Apollo,</hi> if some of your <hi>Courts</hi> were abolished, you might quickly grow
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19655:107"/>
wealthy both by Sea and Land. For if the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of <hi>Suites</hi> were taken away, men would follow their Husbandry diligently at home, fall to enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, plant Orchards, marle their Lands, and not scratch the Earth with weake Heyfers or Steeres. They might then keepe strong Oxen to plough withall, which now they are enforced to sell for their <hi>Lawiers</hi> vse. The <hi>Sea</hi> might be aswell frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by you, as by the <hi>Deuonshire men.</hi> Surely, if the <hi>Noble King of great Britaine</hi> would release you from the <hi>Courts of London,</hi> or else discharge the <hi>Court in the Marches,</hi> I see no reason but you might fall to industrious courses, aswell as others. <hi>Dcuon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire and Cornwall</hi> are a great deale further from <hi>London,</hi> then the remotest Part of <hi>Wales</hi> and their <hi>Termes of Assizes</hi> shorter by halfe then yours. And yet they liue in good securitie one Neighbour with the other, and doe all ioyne in honest Trading both at home and in the <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> augmenting their fortunes, and breeding store of Mariners and ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Your <hi>Court at the Marches</hi> was first instituted to suppresse rebellious Attempts, and <hi>Traitours,</hi> specially <hi>Owen Glyndowrdie,</hi> who was so called for taking part with King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second. But now, me thinkes, it might very well be spared, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that those stormes bee long sithence, by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seuenth, comming to the <hi>English Crowne</hi> quite vanished, and that now-adayes a man may trauell in <hi>Wales,</hi> as safely as in any other Part of the <hi>Kingdome.</hi> The consideration of the Premisses we doe neuerthelesse referre to your <hi>Prudent and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:19655:108"/>
                  <hi>King.</hi> And I belieue, there is neuer a poore man worth fortie shillings but will contribute som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what with all his heart towards the Wars, or for a gratefull Beneuolence to his <hi>Prince,</hi> to be acquited of some of these Courts. For indeed I heard that a <hi>Knight of Staffordshire,</hi> who dwelt but three miles distant from the Iurisdiction of the <hi>Marches,</hi> should say, that he would not for a 1000.

At the time and place limited, Doctor <hi>Haddon</hi> fayled not to restore the Petition to his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> who instantly made a full demonstration of the effects, that it was high time to bridle the insolencies of those fellowes, which studied more to driue the Holy Ghost with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19655:109"/>
his Heauenly Gifts, of Loue, Charitie, and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie out of their owne and Neigbours hearts, then to informe their Clients of the truth of their cause. First, therefore he enacted, that euery man should lay downe his matter in the briefest manner. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that no <hi>Aduocate</hi> should defend a wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Cause. Thirdly, that the <hi>Aduocate</hi> must pay his Client all his money backe againe with arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie dammage by <hi>Apolloes</hi> prescription, if the Cause by his Counsell went forwards, and afterwards chanced to be ordred against him. Fourthly, that no <hi>Attourney</hi> nor <hi>Aduocate</hi> must delay or lose the benefit of one houre in aduancing to a hearing their Clients Suite. Fiftly, that the <hi>Iudges,</hi> as in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> follow the Reports and Iudgements for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly put downe in Bookes, without adding or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering any new Opinions out of their own, though more solid, heads. Sixtly, that no man presume to become a <hi>Iudge</hi> in the <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> which euer receiued a Bribe; or which tooke a Fee within the space of seuen yeeres, before he enter there; for that Countrey being as yet pure, wee will suffer no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure hands to touch her, nor impure lips to Court her. Seuenthly, that whosoeuer takes a Bribe in the <hi>Newfoundland</hi> directly or indirectly, or tolerates with any <hi>Gehezi</hi> to receiue it, hee shalbe conuicted of <hi>Rape,</hi> for polluting that blessed <hi>Nymph,</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous iniustice, &amp; to be punished <hi>more Maiorum,</hi> as the <hi>Senate of Rome</hi> had adiudged <hi>Nero;</hi> or to be vsed as a Blasphemer against Saint <hi>Marke</hi> at <hi>Venice.</hi> Eightly, That no Lawyer nor Officer should exact

No doubt, but some of our <hi>Lawyers</hi> doe happily thinke vpon this fatall stroke, but (alas) that weake thought for want of Zeale quickly perisheth, like those seedes, which were sowne by the Husbandman, and afterwards for want of care suffered to be ouergrowne with weeds and choaked with auarice. The want of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in some other Professions or Trades which might benefit them in their worldly thoughts and dreaming conceits of priuate lucre doe constraine many great Spirits to fall to this wrangling course of life, who otherwise would proue more notable members for their Countries Good. But seeing no other way then this to arriue without danger of a bloudie nose to a great estate, they forgoe those braue flames, which Nature had kindled in them, and in their steed doe harbour earthy and slimy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, like the <hi>Serpent,</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> cursed, and destinated to creepe vpon his belly, and to licke the dust of the earth.

About twenty yeeres past it was my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to bee present in a <hi>Counsellers</hi> Chamber at the <hi>Counsell of the Marches,</hi> where a Gentleman of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestershire</hi> bitterly complained, that the <hi>Counsell</hi> had ordred him to pay seuenscore pounds, which hee might haue compounded for fiftie pounds. And that this rigorous sentence proceeded by his rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether vpon his Opinion, that the <hi>Counsell</hi> would not deale in matters aboue fiftie pounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing limited by their Instructions from the <hi>King.</hi> To which the <hi>Lawyer</hi> answered, that he had hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure offered him, that the <hi>Counsell reduced</hi> his Cause from a Common Law businesse to bee a matter of Conscience, wherein the <hi>King</hi> had left vnto them

the determining at large without tying their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to a certaine Summe. That hee was sory to see such extreme seueritie. Yet notwithstanding some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what glad, that the matter hauing beene so charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and trouble some for a long time he might now enioy the continuall company of his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at home, which before he could not doe. That Peace was a blessed thing, and Patience an excellent vertue. Which the Gentleman hearing, and hauing no comfort else for his great expence, paines, and troubles, he brake forth into Passion, saying, what doe you tell me of Peace and Patience, and going home to haue the company of my wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? All this I had before I met with your vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Counsell, and but for you I might haue had more meanes to doe for them, then now I haue.

away. But the matter casually discouered, some of them were hanged, and the rest made Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-slaues, which comming to the eares of Captaine <hi>Eliot</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and hearing, that his Brother, whom he had left to ouer-see the Pinnasse, had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise tasted of this <hi>Spanish</hi> Courtesie, hee repayred in this male-content to <hi>Father Parsons,</hi> pittifully complayning of his cruell fortune, and this bloudie course extended toward his people, which hee brought of purpose to serue the <hi>King of Spaine,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of reward rather then to bee so inhumanely dealtwith. <hi>Father Parsons</hi> at that time being more in a moode of deuotion, then willing to shew himselfe a Statesman, began to reade a Lecture to Captaine <hi>Eliot</hi> of Patience, Humilitie, and of Mortification. The which hee for a while gaue eare vnto; but at last perceiuing that his speeches tended to defeate him of his Ship, and to get him into a Cloyster: he brake into these impatient termes: What doe you preach vnto mee of Patience and Mortification? Can flesh and bloud rest satisfied with this vsage? Can I be patient, when I see my brother and my friends executed, and the rest of my men condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Gallies?

The danger both emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and imminent which by this conniuence might happen, they submitted to his <hi>Maiesties</hi> good will and pleasure. <hi>Apollo</hi> nettled at this complaint cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for the <hi>Romish Physicians,</hi> and caused some Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents which had lately taken Physick at their hands
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19655:118"/>
to be brought before him to whom he said: <hi>O yee of little Faith,</hi> what a lunacie and distemper of the Braine hath peruerted your vnderstanding, as to moue you to abandon the medicinable waters of <hi>Silo</hi> and <hi>Bethesdae,</hi> and to haue recourse vnto mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Pooles not deriued from the <hi>Rocke of liuing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?

How much more had it beene, if he had relied on succour from the vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised?

whiles shee flaunts it, like an vntamed Gallant, and iadishly kicks vp her heeles with a knaue, making her Lord accessarie to capitall baudry? This were an argument of base stupiditie in the Husband. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such an occasion, or the like intollerable misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanure, as causelesse scolding, or for fooling her selfe and her Head before companie by nicknaming him, or wantonly detracting from his reuerend au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, with the abbreuiated words of <hi>Iack, Tom,</hi> or <hi>Dick,</hi> he must shew his manly prerogatiue, and rebuke her for such ridiculous carriage.

                  <hi>Orpheus Iunior</hi> here interrupted Master <hi>Whatley.</hi> You neede not cite <hi>Scripture</hi> for beating a woman for thats her hearts desire, to verifie the prophane Prouerbe, that an Asse, a Nut, and a Woman will neuer be good without beating. And at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> our Merchants report, that where a <hi>Turke</hi> hath three or foure wiues, that wife esteemes her selfe happy and best beloued of her husband, whom he most often graceth with correction. The <hi>Mosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites</hi> doe commonly practice this kinde of Bencuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on their wiues skinnes. But whether our wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens hides can brooke such fauours, I doe much doubt. For the truth is, their skinnes in <hi>Moscouie</hi> are thicker, tougher, and buffe leather in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our soft skind Creatures; as also in all such cold Countryes, Nature hath armed the very
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19655:123"/>
Fowle and Beasts with strong thick out sides, to weather out and endure the blustring blastes, and penetrable ioye cold the better. Whereas in our Climate, and from thence to the <hi>Tropickes</hi> the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens skinnes are tender, and silken, which makes mee somewhat to mislike that course, except her Husband bee well assured by some skilfull <hi>Tanner</hi> that his <hi>Wiues</hi> skinne is as hard as the <hi>Serpents</hi> both in the temper and the superficiall toughnesse. For then hee may beelabour her coat soundly without danger. But if hee feeles her more smoothe then <hi>Beuer,</hi> or softer then the <hi>Lambs,</hi> let him suspend his passion, and referre his lambs skin to his arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that other whiles is forced <hi>to hold the Wolfe by the eares.</hi> Neither yet am I so obsequious a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to the Femal Sex, nor care I to become an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list of a painted shrine (for whatsoeuer earthly thing a man doth too much magnifie, or to speake more significantly, what hee dotes vpon, is to commit Idolatrie with that thing) but that I wish the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to esteeme Discretion more then debate, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction more then Discipline, and to doe as hee would bee done vnto. Aboue all things I aduise him which lothes the brand of a Cuckold, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to looke into his wiues inward disposition with the warie eyes of Discretion, and to obserue what companie shee affecteth: but likewise that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe beware how hee glance and gad abroad after strange flesh.

               </argument>
               <p>VPon the tenth of Iune last, 1626. <hi>Cato</hi> the diligent Inquisitour and Censour of good
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19655:127"/>
manners hauing apprehended foure persons in a Wine-tauerne, which had drunke ten quarts of strong wine at a sitting, brought them before <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> to be censured, and humbly desired his <hi>Maiestie</hi> that he would shew some exemplarie punishment on those bestiall persons, who albeit they dranke more then a dozen, yet could they not performe the deeds of two able men, either in the bodies Actions, or in the Spirits functions. <hi>Apollo</hi> asked them what tempted them to lade their bodies with so much strong Liquor? They answered, that it was not the loue of the wine, but of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, which drew them to carowse so many pots. And further they alledged, that their natures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accustomed to drinke, they bare it out well without the least giddinesse in the head, reeling, or staggering, which as long as they could so doe, they hoped no man might taxe them of Drunkennesse. To this <hi>Apollo</hi> replied, that by the late <hi>Statutes of England</hi> no Trauellers might drinke aboue one q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But to exceed that quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie in a stronger kind of liquor, in <hi>Corsicke, Greeke</hi> or <hi>Falerne</hi> wines could not but redound to Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse in the superlatiue degree. And whereas (said he) yee would couer your Drunkennesse with the ablenesse of your braine, I must tell you, that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19655:127"/>
he is to bee termed a reall Drunkard which surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the set stint of his Countryes Lawes, or if hee enters after his bibbing into any vnseemely passion or borrowes the gesture of a raging Lion, of the toyish Ape, of the sensuall Hog, or of the lasciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Goat, pratling or acting any feates more then are decent, or more then he vsed at other times, he may be branded with the note of a Drunkard, then which nothing is more odious in the sight of our vertuous Societie. Bring a horse to the water, all the world cannot vrge him to drinke more then sufficeth nature at that time. And yet man a Creature enriched with free will in naturall things, wil proue himselfe worse then the Beasts which haue no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. Most honourable be those Masters of Families, which hate and curb this wanton excesse of Drinking in their Seruants. And worthy of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause in our <hi>Court</hi> is that <hi>Nobleman,</hi> who seeing no admonitions nor change of Butlers could restraine his vnruly Seruants from this Swinish vice, caused his seller to bee remoued, by building one within his Parlour, whereby shame, his Eye being vpon them, might bridle their inordinate affections, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly protesting, that hee would haue nothing spent which might be honestly spared, nor any thing spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red which might be honestly spent; that it was not the expence, but ciuill gouernment to settle sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in his house, which made him to take so strict a course. In this he imitated that Learned <hi>Emperour Antonius Pius,</hi> which banished all the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauernes in <hi>Rome,</hi> because hee saw his Subiects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19655:128"/>
to turne Drunkards, and that none but <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries</hi> should presume to sell any wine; and that, as Phy sick to the sick and weake. Heeretofore a <hi>King of England</hi> noting that by the Companie of the <hi>Daues</hi> all his Subiects were infected with this Sinne, he imposed a fit and limited measure for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to drinke by. Within these fiftie yeeres Drunkennesse was scarce knowne in <hi>England.</hi> At such time as the <hi>Low Countrey</hi> warres began, the souldiers at their returne by the <hi>Diuels</hi> temptations brought it thither to impouerish their natiue Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> at this relation demonstrated apparant tokens of sorrow, and commanded all the deuout Preachers of <hi>Parnassus</hi> to ioyne their heads toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to beate the inconueniences into their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours consciences, and vnder paine of the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt of Excommunication to will them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist from making that crooked, which <hi>God</hi> had made straight, from defiling the house where the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> ought to reside as a sanctified seate.

Whereto the sacred Ministers made answere, that they had employed the vttermost of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to clense that pure place, but by reason of sundry inuisible spirits, which the <hi>Deuill</hi> sent to tempt their Flockes, they contemned their whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some counsels. And for the other point of <hi>Excons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi> that wrought lesse effect, by reason that that spirituall power in these dayes degenerated from the proper vse, being too commonly wrested and fulminated against men, euen for not paying of some pettie Fees due to the Officers of the <hi>Court.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Apollo <hi>retires himselfe in discontent; but at length by the</hi> Fraternitie of the Rosie Crosse, <hi>he is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and walkes along with them in</hi> Procession.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>TRaiano Boccalini</hi> the late Publisher of the <hi>Newes of Parnassus,</hi> whether of Zeale, or of Ambition, or of enuie to see many of his equals promoted in <hi>Apolloes Court,</hi> informed his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> that the <hi>Seuen Wisemen of Greece</hi> and others, whom he had deputed to reforme the World of their late corruptions, had more theorically and scholastical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discoursed of remedies, then really found out any in substance to curbe or cure them. The Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Thales,</hi> hee said, would faine haue a Surgeon of the <hi>Fairy-land</hi> to open a little window in the heart of man, whereby all his deceitfulnesse might appeare to one anothers sight. But forsooth for feare of a greater perill in launcing a musckle or principall veine in this miraculous fabrick of mans body, this speculatiue window must bee let alone. <hi>Solon</hi> perswaded them to take away the inequality of <hi>Mine and Thine,</hi> and to diuide the whole world anew, whereby euery man the Begger aswell as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19655:132"/>
the King, might haue his iust share. <hi>Chilon</hi> aduised to banish the vse of those Mettals of <hi>Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</hi> as the pestiferous root of all Euill. <hi>Pittacus</hi> laid the fault of the moderne abuses vpon <hi>Rewards</hi> conferred on men of meane deserts, who entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sacred seats of Iustice peruerted all the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, which <hi>God</hi> bestowed on Mankind, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their Attendants and Officers to be nicknamed Leaches, Butchers, and Tyrants. <hi>Periander</hi> would haue the imaginary vertues of <hi>Fidelitie</hi> and <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> restored and stampt in mens mindes. <hi>Bias</hi> his Proiect was to hunt men into their ancient habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where their old Ancestors inhabited a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeeres past to giue elbow roome to the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Owners. <hi>Cleobulus</hi> pronounced his definitiue sentence, that all the scope of the worlds reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion consisted in <hi>Rewarding the Good,</hi> and in <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wicked. Cato</hi> would haue the Catarrattes and windowes of Heauen opened and the whole World drowned againe, excepting some few of the male Children, to whom hee wished an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendring and spreading power to bee giuen like Bees, to continue the race of men without being beholding vnto any more women, whose vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnluckinesse, pride, and vanitie, as he said, occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the villanies, which deformed the present World. In conclusion, <hi>Traiano Boccalini</hi> accused these <hi>Reformers</hi> for their Hypocriticall suggestions and conspiracies against the sacred honour of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> in setting out <hi>Proclamations</hi> onely to please Fooles, that no Hucksters should sell oaten meale,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19655:132"/>
or pease by a false dish, and such like trifling mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And these friuolous <hi>Proclamations</hi> they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged of purpose to blinde the eyes of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to seeme to doe somewhat, when as their Office and charge was to see a general <hi>Reformation</hi> of all the most notorious <hi>Vices,</hi> which infected the Generation of humane kinde, as <hi>Simony, sale of Iudges places, Bribery,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> knowing this to bee true, which <hi>Boccalini</hi> with his too too lauish tongue had blabbed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and ashamed, that euery common <hi>Citizen</hi> of <hi>Parnassus</hi> began now to smell out the drist of his <hi>Statesmen,</hi> and could readily descant of those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, which in ancient times as a <hi>diuine</hi> mysterie they concealed from vulgar minds, he retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe much discontented aswell in respect of this cause, as for that it lay not in his absolute will to root out the knowledge of Euill from the Christian World. The <hi>Lady Minerua</hi> and the <hi>nine Muses</hi> laboured to mitigate his <hi>Matesties</hi> griefe; telling him, that <hi>Sinne</hi> must raigne, as long as men beare sway in the World, <hi>vitia erunt donec homines.</hi> But no perswasions preuayled. No Company pleased his humour, saue sad <hi>Melpomenes,</hi> insomuch that many doubted lest some strange kinde of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, which the <hi>Physicians</hi> neuer heard of, would whirle about the braines of the <hi>vertuous,</hi> and at the last eclipse the glorious light of their vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if the chiefe <hi>Lord</hi> of wisdomes Society should continue long in his retired Lodge.</p>
               <p>While both the <hi>Head</hi> and members of this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19655:133"/>
Corporation suffered in this Labyrinth of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and shame, the <hi>Lady Mnemosyne</hi> brought his <hi>Maiestie</hi> word, that <hi>foure graue personages</hi> were newly arriued at his <hi>Court Gate,</hi> stiling themselues <hi>the Fraternitie of the Rosie Crosse.</hi> At the first hee seemed to slight the newes, thinking they might be some of those <hi>Cabalisticall Mountebankes,</hi> which went abroad selling of smoke, and making credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous persons to belieue, that they were of a <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall</hi> fry, and race of wise <hi>Philosophers,</hi> to whom <hi>Mercurius Trismegistius</hi> had transferred the neuer erring Art of discerning Truth from falshood, the meanes to vnite the variable will of man, and that which Worldlings doe most prize, to make the <hi>Philosophers Stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when hee better vnderstood, that this <hi>Fraternitie</hi> were attired in long white Robes, with Oliue branches in their hands, and that they were the <hi>foure famous Patrones of Great</hi> Brittaines <hi>Monarchie, Saint</hi> George, <hi>Saint</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, <hi>Saint</hi> Dauid, <hi>and Saint</hi> Patricke, and that they attended at his Pallace Gate for his comming forth to <hi>Procession,</hi> great was his Ioy; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently without intermission his <hi>Imperiall Maiestie</hi> came forth, and after hee had reuerently embraced and graced this <hi>Noble Fraternitie,</hi> hee told them the Causes of his late discontent, and that he tooke himselfe to bee much fauoured, that they resorted to visit him now in his griefes extremitie. Saint <hi>George</hi> answered, that the causes of his sadnesse conceiued for the vices and decayes of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:19655:133"/>
proceeded of a fellow-feeling of a vertuous Conscience, and to that end they came now to discouer their knowldge, and to lay open the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall faults of that <hi>Monarchie</hi> in a new kinde of tickling straine, not so much to content the Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for <hi>they that be whole need no Physicians,</hi> as to draw the carnall minds of the Common people to heare their <hi>vices</hi> blamed, and consequently to make them ashamed, which are not altogether past grace. And now, said hee, if it please your <hi>Maiestie</hi> and your Learned Traine to walke along with vs in <hi>Procession</hi> round about this eminent <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Parnassus,</hi> wee will consecrate the <hi>Churches</hi> anew, which perhaps will worke some remorse and contrition; and for the obstinate, wee will blesse our selues and the Godly from their conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Company.</p>

                  <p>Orpheus Iunior <hi>sheweth that one of the chiefest causes of the</hi> Decay of Trading <hi>in</hi> Great <hi>Brittaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by the rash Aduentures of the</hi> Westerne Merchants <hi>in passing the</hi> Straites of Gibraltar, <hi>and in</hi> fishing <hi>on the Coast of</hi> Newfoundland, <hi>without</hi> wafting ships <hi>to defend them from Pirats.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THe next day after this memorable <hi>Procession</hi> of the famous <hi>Fraternity. Apollo</hi> caused a publick <hi>Proclamation</hi> to bee set vp on the great Porch of <hi>Neptunes Royall Exchange,</hi> willing and requiring all such as wished well to <hi>Great Britaine</hi> to repaire with their grieuances before him into the Hall of the said <hi>Exchange,</hi> where hee had appointed a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meeting for the affaires of that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in the afternoone of the said day. <hi>Orpheus Iunior</hi> finding by experience, that one of the late causes of the <hi>Decay of Trade</hi> arose by the misgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned and stragling courses of the <hi>Westerne Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> which either of foole-hardinesse, carelesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or of a griping humour to saue a little charge, aduentured in their returne from <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> without Fleets, or Wafters to guard them, or any politicke Order to passe through the <hi>Straits of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar,</hi> to the Dominions of the <hi>King of Spaine,</hi> to <hi>Marseilles,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> where yeerly they met with the <hi>Moorish Pirats,</hi> who by the conniuance of the <hi>Great Turk,</hi> were suffered to prey vpon al Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s, which they encountred. With these inconueniences <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus Iunior</hi> being grieued to see his Countrie suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19655:141"/>
through these Merchants sides, he exhibited a Petition to his <hi>Imperiall Maiestie.</hi> Shewing these irregular courses, as also how that the <hi>Golden Fleece</hi> which now became rife in all mens mouthes might bee quickly surprized and anihilated, if his Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence did not becimes take some safe course to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the labours of those new <hi>Argonautickes,</hi> which spared no shipping to saile into those Coasts, where this precious <hi>Fleece</hi> flourished on the backes of <hi>Neptunes Sheepe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> vpon this Information examined the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the <hi>English,</hi> and comparing them with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> as also with those of other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies established with Priuiledges and Ciuill Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; found more confusion among the Fishermen of <hi>New foundland,</hi> then in any other. For where soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the <hi>Hollanders</hi> either fished or traded, they went strongly guarded with wasting Ships to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent all casualties. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> likewise being taught in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time by the <hi>English,</hi> &amp; sithence by the <hi>Moorish</hi> Pirats to go wel prouided with some ships of <hi>Defence.</hi> Yea, and all those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies in <hi>London,</hi> which the <hi>King of Great Britaine</hi> had graced with Charters and Freedomes prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and neuer went abroad without sufficient strength. Onely, those petty Merchants, which were led with desire of Gaine, not willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranke themselues into an orderly Societie, but as it were in despite of Gouernment singled and seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Fleets, these became continually a spoyle to the Pirats.</p>

His <hi>Maiesty</hi> viewed the <hi>East India</hi> Company, and found them Rich with many braue seruiceable Ships.</p>
               <p>He searched into the strength of the <hi>Turkie</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and saw them stored with warlike Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and abounding in wealth; yea, and by their painfull Trading getting the start of the <hi>Italians,</hi> which heretofore in <hi>Argosies</hi> gained and exported great treasure out of this Kingdome.</p>
               <p>He pryed into the state of the <hi>Moscouie</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and found them very able subsisting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and readie to supply their Countrey with many rich Commodities.</p>

might take surfet of one sort of <hi>Trading,</hi> and at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19655:144"/>
length fall to a loathing thereof. Whereto he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, that by many yeares experience, hee had learnt the skill of discerning spirits. And that hee found out this quality of the <hi>English,</hi> to delight in <hi>varieties;</hi> of <hi>Newes,</hi> though for the most part false; of <hi>Apparell,</hi> though they sold their lands for it; of <hi>multiplicities of Law suits,</hi> though oftentimes they knew themselues bought and sold by them which they most trusted; of <hi>meate and drinke,</hi> though they felt the euent in grieuous torments. And as in their natures they respected choise and change, so in their outward senses hee obserued first that their <hi>sight</hi> receiued more contentment in many colours, then in one alone; specially, those colours of Gold and Siluer, they preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pure and simple, which they held in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as fitter for Hob-lurkins, then for generous spirits. As for their <hi>smelling,</hi> they approued of sundry sorts, as Ciuet, Amber-Greece, Muske, Storax, and aboue all, of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> though some of them lost their wits and the vse of their senses in the taking of it; and though most of them were ready to choake for good fellowship. The like he said, he could discourse of the rest of their senses, outward and inward. But these instances would suffice, as he conceiued, to open the way to many kindes of <hi>Trading,</hi> as well to furnish that <hi>Nation</hi> with those seuerall Commodities, though super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, as to replenish the <hi>Kingdome</hi> with more supplies, lest in prouiding themselues barely on their Countries charge with all those wares which their newfangled imagination prouoketh them

               <p>Now to explaine what hee had spoken of the mysticall <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> hee onely at that time of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to declare the nature, vse, and place where it flourisheth, as how he came to the knowledge of it, if it pleased his Maiestie to affoord him audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Apollo</hi> bad him proceed, signifying vnto him, that the principall scope of the <hi>Meeting</hi> at that season, was to haue that beneficiall Trade communicated to all his <hi>vertuous</hi> Attendants in <hi>Great Britaine.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Orpheus Iunior</hi> then went forward in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: About ten yeares past, <hi>most mighty Prince,</hi> musing with my selfe what might be the <hi>Psalmists</hi> meaning of those words: <hi>Their sound is gone out into all Nations,</hi> I happily coniectured at the last, that the <hi>Word of God</hi> should not onely be spread abroad and planted by those which ought of zeale and charity to teach it; but by those, which like <hi>the frogs out of the Dragons mouth,</hi> might publish it for temporall ends. And when I had throughly <note place="margin">Apocalyp.</note> lookt into these ends, the one neglected by the Professors of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> the other begun and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with prosperous successe by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> where within these 120. yeares, many thousand Heathen people haue receiued the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> though not so purely, as wee could wish, I collected this memorable obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>our Sauiour makes vse of our worlaly desires to serue his diuine intentions.</hi> In this fashion deales
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19655:145"/>
an Earthly Father with an vntoward Daughter, for whose aduancement in mariage, he giues a large portion to counteruaile her imperfections. By which meditations of mine, I perceiued, that nothing but <hi>gaine</hi> could moue the carelesse minds of our <hi>Ilanders</hi> to seeke abroad for new habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I lookt into the <hi>Plantations</hi> at the <hi>Summer Iles, Virginia,</hi> yea into <hi>Affrick,</hi> as farre as the <hi>Cape of good hope,</hi> where for the ease of our <hi>East-Indian Fleetes,</hi> I conceiued at <hi>Sancta Helena,</hi> or <hi>Soldana,</hi> a fit <hi>Plantation</hi> might be erected. But after that I had considered the many difficulties by reason of the tediousnesse of the voyage, the charge, and aboue all, the malice of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who being like to the Dogge in the Manger, doe want people to plant, and yet they will not permit others to plant. I saw that <hi>God</hi> had reserued the <hi>Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for vs <hi>Britaines,</hi> as the next land beyond <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and not aboue nine or tenne dayes saile from thence. I saw that he had bestowed a large portion for this Countries mariage with our <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> euen this <hi>great Fishing,</hi> that by this meanes it might be frequented and inhabited the sooner by vs. And I verily thinke, that his <hi>Heauenly proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> ordained this <hi>Iland</hi> not without a Mystery for vs of <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> that Ilanders should dwel in Ilands; and that wee should ponder on this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Morall:</p>
               <p>Euen as our <hi>Sauiour Christ</hi> making <hi>Fishermen, Fishers of men,</hi> preferred, <hi>Peter, Andrew,</hi> &amp; others his <hi>Apostles,</hi> being plaine persons and simple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>great Lords</hi> of the earth, as also the <hi>Lillies</hi>

of the field, before the Royalties of <hi>Salomon:</hi> so in these latter daies, his vnsearchable wisedome preferring necessary maintenance, before need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse superfluity, hath allotted <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> the grand Port of <hi>Fishing,</hi> to the <hi>Professors</hi> of the <hi>Gospell.</hi> And because the depraued nature of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde delighteth in appetite and some appearance of profit; therefore <hi>his sacred Maiestie</hi> discouered that plentifull <hi>Fishing</hi> vnto vs, to allure vs from our home-bred idlenesse, to this necessary place of <hi>Plantation.</hi> It is not Gold, nor a Siluer mine, which can feed either body or soule; but the one requires nourishment to be gotten <hi>by the sweat of the browes,</hi> the other must haue spirituall repast by <hi>the Word of God.</hi> Before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> inhabited the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and had found those rich treasures in <hi>Peru; Sincerity</hi> raigned among the <hi>Nobles,</hi> and <hi>Simplicity</hi> among the <hi>Commons.</hi> But now <hi>money</hi> being growne in some places more rife then in times past, neighbourly <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> are fled backe into <hi>Heauen:</hi> so that we may well curse the time when these <hi>Mines</hi> were first seized on by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For, as the Author <hi>de la nouvelle Fraunce</hi> affirmeth: when I confider, saith hee, that by these <hi>Golden mines,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue kindled and entertained wars in all parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, and haue studied to ruinate their <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> and not the <hi>Turke;</hi> I cannot thinke, faith this <hi>French writer,</hi> that any other then the <hi>Deuill,</hi> hath beene the Author of their voyages. <hi>Ie ne puis penser qu' autre que le Diable ait est√© Autheur de leurs voyages.</hi> In this resolution being confirmed,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19655:146"/>
I transported two seuerall <hi>Colonies</hi> of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men into those parts with full intent to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to lead the remnant of my life in this new <hi>Plantation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It seemes strange vnto my vertuous followers in <hi>Parnassus,</hi> replied <hi>Apollo,</hi> that a man of your fashion, not driuen by <hi>need,</hi> which as the prouerbe saies, <hi>makes the old wife trot,</hi> but sufficiently proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for in your natiue Countrie, should now in the midst of your age, spend the best and rarest part of your life, which is yet to come, in building and tilling of new places.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Orpheus Iunior</hi> answered; I confesse, <hi>most Noble Prince,</hi> that sometimes I feele my Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low very vneuen, my head tossed and turmoyled with many a netled thought, and my minde playing loath to depart from my natiue soile. One while the conceit of my supposed worth, reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, kindred, acquaintance, ease, conuenience of meanes at home, and other symbolized ornaments of this present world, doe recall mee backe, like another <hi>Demas,</hi> from this charitable worke in the <hi>Newfoundland.</hi> But instantly I blush for shame, when I thinke on the magnanimity of <hi>Heathenish</hi> men, who may rise against vs at the <hi>iudgement day,</hi> and plead their good deserts before our fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen zeale; That a <hi>Citizen of Rome,</hi> for the safety of his <hi>City of Rome,</hi> sacrificed his life in that horrible <hi>gulfe;</hi> That <hi>Codrus of Athens,</hi> though a <hi>King,</hi> did disguise himselfe as a priuate Souldier, of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to dye for the sauing of his people; That the chiefest <hi>Nobility</hi> among the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandales,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:19655:147"/>
forsooke their owne habitations, to accompany the meaner sort of people, and to lead them into forraigne Countries, who without their personall presence, would haue staid at home like Drones, and pined for want of liuing.</p>
               <q>Patria magnanimis est vbicunque bene,</q>
               <p>That's my Countrie which giues me my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being. Euery place agrees with an honest minde, and that as naturally, as the Sea with the Fish, as the Ayre with the Fowle. Another while I me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on that saying of S. <hi>Paul: He which prouides not for them of his owne houshold, is worse then an Infidell:</hi> Whereby the care of my Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, kindling an indulgent loue within mee, reuokes my resolution from this enterprize. But presently after I see the same <hi>God</hi> ouerlooking <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> which ouerlookes <hi>Europe,</hi> and all the world ouer, sounding out this Proclamation: <hi>He that loues his Father and Mother aboue me, is not worthy of me:</hi> which the <hi>Iesuites</hi> imbracing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too meritoriously, doe to our shame, put in practice, abandoning all the pleasures of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Countrie, and betaking themselues to the vttermost parts of the earth, so that <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Iapan</hi> doe ring out the name of our <hi>Sauiour Christ</hi> by their meanes and trauels.</p>
               <p>Sometimes I suspect the Action, because I see men of my ranke so much giuen to lazinesse, and the loue of their dunghils at home, that they will indure any smart of oppression or cracke of credit, rather then they wil depart into a remoter place to liue in perpetuall plenty. But this cogitation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19655:147"/>
quickly vanisheth, when I consider the estates of our <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>poore,</hi> how the <hi>one will not, the other cannot.</hi> The one lies besotted with the lullabies of carnall ease, caring more for this worlds vanity, then for heauenly Blisse purchased by workes of <hi>charity,</hi> which as S. <hi>Iames</hi> wrote, will helpe to <hi>couer multitudes of sinnes.</hi> And the other for want of meanes, cannot get thither without some good peoples deuotions. In which latter discommodity I am sory to find so many helplesse in my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Wales.</hi> Wheras close by vs, I see our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of <hi>Deuonshire</hi> scorning to become Gossips to pouerty, yearely to send aboue 150 ships to salute the <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> transporting therehence those Commodities, without which, <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> can hardly liue.</p>
               <p>This is our <hi>Colchos,</hi> where the <hi>Golden Fleece</hi> flourisheth on the backes of <hi>Neptunes sheepe,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to be shorne.

But let men in cold blood lay aside their crotchets, and the sparkling flames of <hi>imagination,</hi> and iudiciously weigh the vtility of this businesse, comparing the dangers, the remotenesse, and charge of other voyages, and no doubt but <hi>God</hi> will giue them <hi>a new heart,</hi> to imbrace this <hi>proiect,</hi> which experience for these 80. <hi>yeares</hi> space hath confirmed vnto vs to bee more beneficiall, then any other whatsoeuer.</p>

Yea, I haue known in these last deare yeares, that 100. persons haue yearly died in a <hi>parish,</hi> where the <hi>Tithes</hi> amounted not to fourscore pounds a yeare, the most part for lacke of food, fire and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the which the poorer sort of that Country stand in greater need of, then the Inhabitants of the Champion Countreyes, by reason of their Mountaines and hills, which cause the winter there to be most bitter with stormy winds, raine, or snow, and that for the space of eight moneths. As also experience teacheth that Mountainous people require more store of nourishment for their bodies, then they which dwell in the plaines or vallies: which was the reason, that in the <hi>North</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:19655:149"/>
parts of <hi>England,</hi> Seruants vsed to couenant here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore with their Masters to feed them with bread made with <hi>Beanes,</hi> and not of <hi>Barly</hi> from <hi>Allhalontide</hi> vntill <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another point of <hi>Necessity</hi> to procure vs to set <note place="margin">2</note> forwards this most hopeful <hi>Plantation,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tly the <hi>Fishing,</hi> proceeds of the want of <hi>woods.</hi> For the <hi>Ironmongers</hi> vpon what warrant I cannot learne, haue lately consumed our <hi>woods,</hi> and those fit for timber, within lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

The decay of these <hi>woods</hi> also wil cause our breed of Cattle to decrease, which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stood as a shelter vnto them against tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blastes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this maine businesse is to be promoted <note place="margin">3</note> in regard of the <hi>Generall Populousnesse of Great Britaine,</hi> which is the cheife cause, that Charity waxeth cold. Euery man hath enough to doe, to shift for his owne maintenance, so that the greatest part are driuen to extremities, and many to get their liuing by other mens losses; witnes our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, Periurers, Pet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19655:150"/>
are oftentimes constrained to turne Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats, Papists, fugitiues, or to take some other violent course to the preiudice of the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For these important reasons arising out of meere <hi>necessity, Pantations</hi> ought suddenly to be erected. And where with lesser charge then in the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland?</hi> Where can they liue to helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and benefit their Country better, then in ioyning to encrease the reuenewes of the <hi>Crowne of Great Britaine</hi> by the rich <hi>trade of Fishing?</hi> The <hi>Commodities</hi> whereof, I will here cursorily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat.</p>
               <p>First, this <hi>Trade of Fishing</hi> multiplyeth <hi>shipping</hi> and Mariners, the principall props of this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1</note> It yearely maintaineth 8000 persons for 6. moneths in the <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> which were they at home would consume in <hi>Tobacco</hi> and the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house twice as much as they spend abroad. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues after their returne home with the labour of their hands yearely their wiues and children, and many thousand families within this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> besides, which aduentured with them, or were employed in preparing of nets, caskes, victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, &amp;c. or in repayring of ships for that voyage.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is neer vnto <hi>Great Britane,</hi> the next <hi>Land</hi> beyond <hi>Ireland,</hi> in a temperate Aire, the <note place="margin">2</note> south part thereof being of equall Climate with <hi>Little Britaine in France,</hi> where the Sunne shines almost halfe an houre longer in the shortest day in the yeare, then it doth in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it will be a meanes for vs to reape the rest of the commodities of that Countrey, which <note place="margin">3</note>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:19655:150"/>
now we cannot enioy for want of people to looke after them, and also for want of leasure, our men there being busied in the Summer about the <hi>fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or in preparing of their <hi>stages</hi> and boats, and afterward returning home against winter. The commodities of the Land are Furres of Beuer, Sables, Blacke Foxes, Marternes, Musk-rats, Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and such like skinnes, as also of greater beasts; as Deere, and other wild creatures. To this I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne the benefit, which may be made by woods, being pine, birch, spruce, Furre, &amp;c. fit for boords, Masts, barke for tanning, and dying, Charcoales for making of Iron. Out of these woods we may haue pitch, Tarre, Rosen, Turpentine, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence, and honey out of the hollow trees, as in Muscouy, and heretofore in our owne woods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were conuerted to the Iron Mills. There is great store of Mettals, if they be lookt after.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Plantations</hi> well and orderly there once erected, will helpe vs to settle our <hi>Fishing Trade</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4</note> farre more commodiously, then now it is. For whereas our Fisher-men set out at the end of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, they may choose to set out before the end March, if euery man hath his stages there ready against their comming, and not by the first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers destroyed most barbarously &amp; maliciously, because their country men which come next after them may be behind them a fortnight in building of others. And likewise the <hi>Planters</hi> themselues may fish for Cod there a moneth before our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish men</hi> can arriue thither, and also after they are gone they may fish almost all the yeare after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:19655:151"/>
They may fish there for other kindes of fish besides <hi>Cod,</hi> as Mackerels, Salmons, Herrings, and Eeles, salting them and barrelling them vp: <note place="margin">5</note> which will much aduantage this <hi>Kingdome</hi> being hither transported.</p>
               <p>They may erect salt houses there, hauing woods <note place="margin">6</note> sufficient for that purpose, which may saue this Kingdome much money, which now goes out to other Countreyes for the same.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Plantations</hi> may in a short time supply vs with Corne here in <hi>England,</hi> when the same <note place="margin">7</note> growes deare, as commonly it doth within the space of euery fiue yeares, whereby wee are faine to be beholding to <hi>Danzk,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> expending that way much of our Treasure. That <hi>Land</hi> hauing the vegetatiue salt and vertue of it vnwearied, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and fresh, cannot but beare a world of corne, considering also the gummes and liquors which from time to time since the <hi>Flood</hi> or the <hi>Creation</hi> haue with the heate of the <hi>Sunne</hi> distilled out of the trees into the earth, which renders it most fruitfull. The which may be likewise gathered by obseruing the commodities and fruits, which now the earth produceth without the industry of man.</p>
               <p>No place of the world brings naturally more store of Gooseburies, and those bigger then our Garden ones, R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>undance of Roses.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>Trading</hi> into <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie is caried out of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> as in other <note place="margin">8</note> voyages, which is a matter of great consequence.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19655:151"/>
But by the labour of their hands they bring home Fish wet and dry, and Traine Oile; Or else they bring home Salt, Wines, Spice, Sugar, &amp;c. in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of their Fish out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> a speciall enriching of this <hi>Realme,</hi> and an augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Kings Customes and Impostes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Plantations</hi> there will saue many a poore <note place="margin">9</note> mans life, who falling sicke, as among so great a number some may chance to be, may quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their healths by fresh victualls and good lodging.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Plantation</hi> will preuent other <hi>Nations</hi> from engrossing the Countrey and the <hi>Fishing</hi> to <note place="margin">10</note> themselues, as perhaps hereafter some may goe about such a Plot. It will reduce such as resort thither, to acknowledge our <hi>Kings soueraignty</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that <hi>Land.</hi> It will serue to bridle their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and also the abuses committed by our owne Countrymen about the taking away with strong hand one anothers stages and boates. It will serue to restraine their insolencies, who now bragging, that they are there <hi>West and by Law,</hi> doe wilfully set fire on the woods. It will bridle their thefts, which filch at their departure all the railes of other mens stages, together with their salt, which being full laden with fish, they are forced oftentimes to leaue behind them. It will serue likewise to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their barbarous casting of their <hi>ballast</hi> into the harbours, which in a short time will ouerthrow both the hauens and the <hi>Fishing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To these <hi>motiues</hi> I could ioyne others; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I thinke here are sufficient to lead men of

To the furtherance of which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy worke I inuite the <hi>Inhabitants of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> like true <hi>Christian Patriots,</hi> to put to their helping hands.

Next to these, many others out of <hi>Bristow</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, who had spent some few yeares in that Land. And particularly, one <hi>Captaine Winne a Cambro-Britan</hi> was much noted in this Assembly for his personall abode and painefull care in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Plantation at <hi>Feriland</hi> in the South part of this Coast, where for the space of 4 yeares hee did more good for my <hi>Lord Baltimore,</hi> then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had done in double the time.</p>

say for Fowle and Fish. I knew one Fowler in a winter, which killed aboue 700. Partridges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe at <hi>Renoos.</hi> But for the Fish, specially the Cod, which drawes all the chiefe Port townes in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome</hi> to send thither some ships euery yeare, either to fish, or to buy the same; it is most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, and almost incredible, vnlesse a man were there present to be hold it. Of these, three men at Sea in a Boat, with some on shoare to dresse and dry them, in thirty dayes will kill commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt fiue and twenty and thirty thousand, worth with the Traine oyle arising from them, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or sixe score pounds. I haue heard of some <hi>Countries,</hi> commended for their twofold haruest, which here we haue, although in a different kinde: yet both as profitable, I dare say, as theirs so much extolld. There is no such place againe in the world for a poore man to raise his fortunes, comparable to this <hi>Plantation;</hi> for in one moneths space, with reasonable paines, he may get as much as will pay both Land-lords Rent, Seruants wages, and all Houshold charges, for the whole yeare, and so the rest of his gaine to increase.</p>
               <p>As for the other <hi>question,</hi> whether the title of the <hi>Golden Fleece</hi> may bee conferred more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruedly vpon this <hi>Iland,</hi> then on any other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne place, where his <hi>Maiesties</hi> Subiects of <hi>Great Britaine</hi> doe vse to Trade? By the last part of my Discourse, it is plaine, that it goes farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other places of Trade whatsoeuer, and iustly to be preferred before <hi>New England, Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and other <hi>Plantations,</hi> for these foure reasons:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19655:155"/>
First, it lieth neerer to <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> by three or foure hundred leagues, then eyther of them. For wee may saile hither within twelue or fourteene daies, being not aboue sixe or seuen hundred leagues passage: whereas <hi>Virginia</hi> lieth as far again. Secondly, it is better in respect of <hi>Trade,</hi> and the concourse of people, which with 500. or 600. Ships, doe yearly resort thither. By which meanes they augment their <hi>Princes Customes,</hi> and doe maintaine many thousands of their fellow-sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, their wiues and children. Thirdly, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniency of transporting <hi>Planters</hi> thither at tenne shillings a man, and twenty shillings the Tunne of goods. And if the party be a Labourer, it will cost him nothing for his passage, but rather hee shall receiue foure or fiue pound for his hire to helpe the <hi>Fishermen</hi> on the Land for the drying of their <hi>Fish:</hi> whereas euery man which goeth to <hi>Virginia,</hi> must pay fiue pound for his passage.</p>
               <p>Lastly, wee are better secured from Enemies, for we haue no Sauages to annoy vs in the <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts:</hi> And if any warres should happen betwixt <hi>Great Britaine</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> we need not feare their insolent inuasions. For wee haue a Garrison of three or foure hundred Ships, of our owne Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which fish at our doores all the summer, and are able to withstand an <hi>Armada,</hi> if their <hi>King</hi> would but confirme that <hi>Commission,</hi> which his <hi>blessed Father,</hi> about three yeares already past granted, that two warlike Ships be yearely sent as waftors to defend the Coast, and to be authorized with power to leuy men &amp; Ships there, if occasion
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19655:156"/>
so require; and all vpon the charges of the <hi>Fishing fleete.</hi> This <hi>Commission</hi> I obtained, and sithence I left it with my friend <hi>Orpheus Iunior,</hi> to bring to perfection, who as I am informed, is at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the <hi>Court of Great Britaine,</hi> an earnest soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor to that effect. To conclude, after the <hi>Fishing Fleetes</hi> are returned homewards, we are safe, for the windes are commonly from August out <hi>Westerly,</hi> whereby none can come to vs. And if they should; we haue other places in the Country to goe to, till our Enemies bee gone. For there long they dare not stay for feare of the Frosts, which perhaps their tender complexions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not brooke as well as our <hi>Northerly Nations.</hi>

                  <hi>APollo</hi> hauing noted how important to <hi>Great Britaine</hi> the <hi>Plantations</hi> are like to succeed and fall out for the restoring of their State to worldly felicity, that it proue a paralleled <hi>Monarchy</hi> to the proudest of the borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>kingdomes,</hi> made choise of <hi>Iohn Guy, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

                  <hi>of Bristow,</hi> to shew in what manner the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> should order their <hi>Plantations</hi> in this <hi>Golden Iland,</hi> and secure their new habitations from the icie and cold foggy Aire, which in some seasons of the yeare were reported by the <hi>Fishermen,</hi> to molest and damnifie the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Master <hi>Guy</hi> earnestly sought to post ouer the handling of this serious determination to <hi>Captaine Mason,</hi> in respect hee had wintred there longer then he had. But <hi>Apollo</hi> by no meanes would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his imposition, saying, that in regard that Mr. <hi>Guy</hi> had oftentimes beene personally in the Land, and wintred there twise, being the first <hi>Christian,</hi> which made it apparent to the world that it was habitable &amp; commodious for the vse of mankinde, and also for that he had calculated the mutations of the seasons, keeping a Iournall of euery Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent during his abode in the Country; hee, and none but he should direct what might be conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the setling and prosperous propagation of these most hopefull <hi>Plantations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Guy</hi> seeing that by no entreaty or excuse, he could put the taske off from himselfe, with a lowly reuerence to his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> he said; If the <hi>Noble Emperour</hi> had askt my poore iudgement a dozen yeares past, concerning these secrets, it may be, I might haue giuen him more agreeable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, then at this time. For then the modell of the Country and Climat lay more fresh in my apprehension. Notwithstanding, seeing the lot is cast vpon me, I will produce the best remedies which I know for the correcting of the malignant
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19655:157"/>
ayre, if so I may without scandall call it. The Country I assure your <hi>Maiestie,</hi> is as tolerable as <hi>England, Caeteris paribus,</hi> comparing all the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons together.</p>
               <p>And if some nice persons feele one <hi>winter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many, more snowy and frosty then other, they seeme to forget their owne Country, where the like inconuenience hapneth. But to auoid the worst, if euery <hi>Householder</hi> digge vp the next ground to his habitation, and round about the same, and then burne it, those moyst foggy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours will not appeare, specially after the <hi>Sunne</hi> hath once warmed and pierced into the earth so dismantled and layd bare. Secondly, let them dig welles neere their houses against winter, that they may haue water in despite of the frost or snow. Thirdly, let them prouide them of fewell enough before winter, to haue the same more seare and dried. Fourthly, let them build their houses with a hill, or great store of trees interposed as a shelter betwixt them and the <hi>sea-windes,</hi> which there are <hi>Easterly</hi> and very nipping. There is no <hi>winter</hi> to speake of before the midst of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> And when the <hi>Easterly windes</hi> blow, the weather is no other, then it is in <hi>Holland.</hi> And I verily beleeue, that in the <hi>south part</hi> of the Land, where it trends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>west,</hi> and where the ground is eauen and plaine without hilles, it differs not much from the temperature of the south part of <hi>Germany.</hi> And for the further encouragement of our <hi>Planters,</hi> I can auow this for a certaine rule, that once being passed a mile or two into the Land, the weather
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19655:157"/>
is farre hotter. I found <hi>Filberds</hi> fixe miles distant from the <hi>Sea side,</hi> very ripe a moneth before they were fit to be eaten by the <hi>Seaside.</hi> So great an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration there is within sixe miles space, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that those raging <hi>Easterly</hi> windes are defended and asswaged by the hilles and woods which stand as walles to fence and breake their force.</p>
               <p>Aboue all things, I wish the <hi>Planters</hi> to sleepe in boorded roomes, and not to be too idle the first winter for feare of the <hi>Scuruy.</hi> For in all <hi>Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> this disease commonly seaseth vpon lazy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the first winter. Yea, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleighs</hi> Colony in <hi>Virginia,</hi> though a hotter Country, 1586. could not auoid this mortall sicknesse. These rules obserued, our <hi>Planters</hi> may liue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily. They may fish a moneth before others, which come out of <hi>England</hi> thither to <hi>fish,</hi> &amp; they may fish three moneths or more for <hi>Cod</hi> and <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> after they are departed, which will much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich them.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>VPon the Friday seuen night before Easter, in Lent last, 1626. there arriued here at <hi>Parnassus,</hi> certaine <hi>Westerne Merchants</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> iust about that time, as <hi>Apollo</hi> had decreed straight execution <hi>against some for the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Flesh</hi> on some prescribed dayes, for that weighty and <hi>politicall</hi> respect of maintaining <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation,</hi> wherein the workes of our <hi>Creator</hi> doe shew themselues no lesse admirable, then the land. Assoone as these <hi>Merchants</hi> had heard this neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary <hi>Law,</hi> with the execution, one of them, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of very discreet behauiour, desired liberty to speake on the behalfe of his poore Countrey men for some oppressions, which <hi>Ferdinando Gorge</hi> Gouernour of the Fort at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> whom they pointed at, present in the great Hall of the Court of Audience, had vnder colour of a <hi>Patent</hi> deriued from his Earthly <hi>Soueraigne of great Britains</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, most vncharitably &amp; vnlawfully commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against them, their Factors, and Mariners on the Coast of <hi>New England</hi> in <hi>America. Apollo</hi> willed them to declare their grieuances. First, they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19655:158"/>
particularly shewed that this place was an <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish Coast,</hi> vntilled, and voyd of <hi>Christian Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants:</hi> in regard whereof they tooke it to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them being <hi>Christians,</hi> who in such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote wild Countreyes were to passe for Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and equal for right with <hi>Alexander the great,</hi> that went into the <hi>East Indies,</hi> as they into the <hi>West,</hi> there to enioy the benefit of the <hi>Law of Nations,</hi> to discouer new Countries, to exchange wares for wares, Cloath for Furres, Ciuility for rudenesse, and likewise to transport Fish, which they laboured hardly for, Pitch, Tarre, Masts, and such like, which they could not haue in <hi>Europe,</hi> without a farre greater charge. All this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorge</hi> by his Lieutenant and Agents, opposed their Commerce, forced them to compound for their Stages, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Commodities of the Country to bee due to him, and his Associates, who first discouered the same, and afterwards had obtained a <hi>Patent</hi> thereof, of the Noble King <hi>Iames</hi> for their vse. Likewise, they intimated, that the Sea was free and common to all men, more common then <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> in the Schooles, or the word <hi>Homo;</hi> which the <hi>Grammarians,</hi> euen since <hi>Orbilius, Quintilian,</hi> and <hi>Priscians</hi> time, haue stoutly maintained to bee a common name to all men, ciuill and sauage; yea, and to all sorts of women, the chast, as the strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. In respect of which Community, warranted by the Lawes of the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> the statutes of <hi>Oleron,</hi> by the Constitutions of <hi>Holland,</hi> and lastly, by his transcendent authority which wrote the Booke
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19655:159"/>
called <hi>Mare liberum,</hi> they hoped to settle a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall Trading, as well for <hi>Fishing</hi> on these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Coasts, as for such Land-Commodities, which the <hi>Sauages</hi> would trucke with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> vnderstanding of these oppositions, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in appearance to be a publike grieuance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorge,</hi> wherefore hee sought to engrosse those merchandizes, and to make a monopoly of the Furres, which being bought of the <hi>Sauages,</hi> might in time by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of his fellow <hi>Christians,</hi> proue a meane to ciuilize those rude Nations; and specially his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie</hi> askt him why he went about to appropriate the Sea Coasts to some few of his adherents, which ought to be common, which serued to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise honest men in industrious courses, and to make good his <hi>Law</hi> against the <hi>eating of flesh</hi> vpon prefixed dayes?</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorge</hi> answered: <hi>Most dread Soueraigne,</hi> the honour of a <hi>King</hi> consisteth as well in aduancing the building vp his <hi>Sauiours</hi> Church, as the inlarging of his Territories, which may proue an addition to the strengthening of his Forces, and the inriching of his Crowne. For the perfection of which glorious worke, it pleased <hi>God</hi> to raise mee and others to aduenture our meanes for the discouery of this Country called <hi>New England,</hi> which before lay vnknowne. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing found it a habitable place, commodious for the vse of many distressed people, whom I saw to grone vnder the burthen of pouerty in my natiue Soile; I resolued to imitate the painefull Bees, to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19655:159"/>
build houses, like Hiues, and therein to transplant them. For which purpose to auoyd the confused state of an <hi>Anarchy,</hi> I prepared the <hi>Plantation</hi> intended with the support of the <hi>Regall</hi> counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and to that end got the <hi>Patent</hi> specified by my Aduersaries with large priuiledges, immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and power, whereby our <hi>Planters</hi> might rest assured, not onely of security against Drones, but also of the quiet fruition of their profitable ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours hazarded with their liues, and not to bee attained without labours and the sweat of their browes. Of what consequence not only this <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> is, but likewise all others of the like nature, who knowes better then your <hi>Maiestie,</hi> who once a yeare suruayes the vttermost parts of the earth, euen to the <hi>Southerne Pole?</hi> For what is it, which renders a <hi>Nation</hi> vnhappy? Next to the want of <hi>Gods knowledge,</hi> which the <hi>Scripture</hi> termes <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> it is the want of necessaries for the sustenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life, as meat, drinke, and apparell. And when through a long peace, and their ouerspent fields, their Country-men doe increase and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, so that the extent of their natiue Land is not capable nor sufficient to maintaine them, what (poore soules) shall they doe? If they rob or steale, they are hanged. If they looke for worke, perhaps they may meet with some couetous wretch that will retaine them during the haruest of Hay and Corne: but in the Winter, which in this <hi>Climat</hi> is longer then the Summer, they may starue for lacke of food, rayment and fyring. This inconuenience was foreseene aboue 100. yeares
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19655:160"/>
since by Sir <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> who grieuously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailes the ouer-sight of our Policies, for condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning men to be hanged, who robd of meere neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity; <note place="margin">In lib. de Eutopia.</note> whereas their Country, like a prouident Mother, ought rather to prouide them reliefe, whereby they might liue like men borne of a wise and politike mother. Some mothers haue loued their children, that they haue hazarded their own liues, to get heritages for their younger children: yea, and were content to suffer want themselues, rather then their ofspring should miscarry.</p>
               <p>Examples we can produce many. How came the world first to be planted? If the first <hi>Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons after Noahs Flood,</hi> had all abode in <hi>Armenia, Chaldea,</hi> and <hi>Assyria,</hi> the rest of the world had beene created in vaine. Therefore <hi>God</hi> sundred them by confounding their languages at <hi>Babell,</hi> that the glory of his power might be noised in all Regions, and the sound of his Name, throughout all Nations. This made <hi>Saturne</hi> to plant in <hi>Italy.</hi> This made <hi>Hercules</hi> to trauell to the <hi>Atlantique Iles,</hi> and to ingraue his name on those memorable Pillars at the <hi>Straights of Gibraltar.</hi> This made <hi>Iaso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> with his braue Fleete of <hi>Argonantickes</hi> to saile into <hi>Cholchos,</hi> in hope of a perpetuall Trade for the Gold of that place with his <hi>Grecian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. How came the Iles, the <hi>Iles of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> to be peopled, but by <hi>Plantations</hi> transported vpon the charge of able and substantiall persons. <hi>Marseiles</hi> was ciuilized and inhabited with a <hi>Greeke Colony.</hi> From whence are we all come into these parts? We are not Natiues, but after many hands
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19655:160"/>
led into this <hi>Kingdome.</hi> Wee came from <hi>Saxony</hi> our selues, as the most of <hi>Italy</hi> doe descend from the <hi>Northerly parts of Germany.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> deriue their pedegrees from the runnagate <hi>Gothes,</hi> or from the <hi>Moores,</hi> who likewise glory to bee a remnant of the fugitiue <hi>Arabes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O what a shame is it vnto vs at this day, to see whole numbers of our <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scottish</hi> disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed abroad in <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Moorish</hi> Countries, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Apostataes,</hi> and in time forgoing the memory of their naturall Mother-tongue, as of the tue <hi>Faith,</hi> wherein they were baptized! Now how easily might this monstrous and inhumane absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity be preuented by a timely <hi>Plantation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this end haue I and my <hi>Copartners</hi> labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But as we were laying the foundation, these <hi>Antiplanters</hi> enuying at those hopefull attempts like those which repined at the rebuilding of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> would needs inioy the fruits of our labours, despoyling vs of our Stages, and the plaine plats of ground bounding on the Sea; and not thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, they would cut downe a tree worth forty shillings, fit for a <hi>Mast,</hi> where a tree of two shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings might serue their turne. Sometimes they would either of despite to the <hi>Planters,</hi> or in a wanton vnbrideled humour, set fire on the woods two or three miles together. We neuer gaine-said them to <hi>fish</hi> vpon our Coast, but on the contrary, we were very glad of the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>. Only we sought to curbe their in solencies, which committed these outrages. We endeuoured to hinder their wilfull casting their <hi>ballast</hi> into the harbours, which in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19655:161"/>
small time will quickly decide this present contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, when the <hi>harbours</hi> shall by this outragious abuse, bee choakt and dammed vp without any hope of recouery.</p>
               <p>As for the Trade of <hi>Furs,</hi> how can this be a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance more then it is in <hi>England,</hi> where the petty Lords of Mannors clayme a farre greater Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction there, to enlarge their Forrests and games: yea and some haue obtained a <hi>Free Warren,</hi> that none whatsoeuer should hawke or hunt vpon their Lands, or within their Precincts. If this be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Old England,</hi> much more ought we to stand vpon out <hi>Royalties</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> in lieu of our infinite charge and paines taken in our voyages, and setling there our new inhabitants. What <hi>Gentlemen of fashion</hi> will forsake their Country, except they shall haue a larger extent of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and more hopes of benefit then at home? To suffer such barbarous insolencies to bee done on a mans <hi>Free-hold,</hi> cannot but trouble the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest man on the earth: yea, another <hi>Moses,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iob.</hi> To this I adde, how some of these <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplanters</hi> led by an vnheard-of greedinesse of gaine, haue sold vnto the <hi>Sauages,</hi> Muskets, Fowling-Peeces, Powder, Shot, Swords, Arrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, and other Armes, wherewith the <hi>Sauages</hi> slew some of those <hi>Fishermen,</hi> which had so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerately sold such dangerous wares to <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</hi> By which means they are now become dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous &amp; formidable to the <hi>Planters</hi> themselues. And farre more fearefull would they haue proued vnto vs, if the <hi>King of Great Britain our Soueraign,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:19655:161"/>
had not strictly made a <hi>Proclamation</hi> to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that no <hi>Subiect</hi> of his should presume to sel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> any such vnlawfull ware. Vp on the brute of which <hi>Proclamation,</hi> the <hi>Sauages</hi> being hopelesse euer to receiue of our <hi>Nation</hi> more <hi>Gunpowder;</hi> they very circumspectly sowed in the best cornefields they had all the <hi>Powder</hi> which remained, with full expectation to reape a goodly haruest thereof, as of Mastard or other seedes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> according to his wonted manner, hauing paused and meditated on the <hi>Plaintiffes</hi> and <hi>Defendants</hi> allegations about one quarter of an houre: at last pronounced this definitiue sentence. Forasmuch as wee conceiue both this <hi>Plantation,</hi> and the <hi>Fishing Trade</hi> to be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to <hi>Great Britaine:</hi> we order both of them, like <hi>Hippocrates Twinnes,</hi> to consociate together in brotherly amity, and to assist one another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out malicious emulation. That the <hi>Fishermen</hi> haue conuenient places for the drying of their <hi>Fish</hi> on the land, with as much woods as will serue for their fewell during their abode in that Country, and for their returne homewards by the way, and also as much woods as will build vp on repaire their Ships &amp; Stages; prouided that the common sort of Marriners shall not of their owne heads, without their Master of the Ship, and one of the chiefe of the Planters be present, cut or cast down any woods, but what by them shall be seene fit for those necessary vses. Secondly, that none of the <hi>Fishermen</hi> shall throw their <hi>Ballast</hi> into the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to deface the same. Thirdly, that for some
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19655:162"/>
few yeares, they shall not traffique with the <hi>Saua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> but shall leaue the same to the <hi>Planters,</hi> vntill the <hi>Plantations</hi> be compleately strengthened, and of sufficient power to liue of themselues, and bee conueniently armed against those barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Fourthly, that all such plats of plaine lands, neere to the Harbours, which the <hi>Planters</hi> shall from henceforth rid of woods, and make apt for Stages to dry fish vpon, shall belong to the <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> And that all such places which the <hi>Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> haue already rid, and built Stages vpon, shall appertaine to them for euer. As also al such <hi>Stages,</hi> which they shall hereafter build for that purpose. In lieu of which priuiledges, euery <hi>Ship</hi> shall transport a Tunne of such prouisions which the <hi>Plantations</hi> want, receiuing for the same, tenne shillings, towards the fraught, and the price of the goods by them disbursed in <hi>England.</hi> Fiftly, that both the <hi>Planters</hi> and the <hi>Fishermen</hi> shall ioyne and suddenly assemble all their forces together with their best endeuours to expell <hi>Pirates,</hi> and their Countries enemies; if any arriue on that <hi>Coast,</hi> with intent to prey vpon eyther of them. Sixtly, if any dissention happen betwixt the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shermen</hi> and the <hi>Planters,</hi> the matter shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promitted to twelue mens arbitrement, sixe of the one side, and sixe of the other, and if they misse to accord the parties difference, then the <hi>chiefe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Plantation,</hi> and the <hi>Master of the Ship,</hi> whereof the Fisherman is, to end the businesse as Vmpires and principall Iudges.</p>

               <p>VPon the <hi>Feast day of Saint Marke the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist last past,</hi> 1626. as <hi>Apollo</hi> was confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with certaine <hi>Cosmographers,</hi> for the aduancing of the <hi>East Indy Trade,</hi> the <hi>Lady Pallas</hi> whispered his <hi>Maiestie</hi> in the eare, to admit some into that conference, which had beene principall <hi>Nauigators</hi> imployed for discoueries towards those Coasts. For said she, though <hi>speculation</hi> bee the most noble Science in Philosophy, yet for the atchieuement of a reall and beneficiall <hi>Trade,</hi> it serues to no other vse, then as a <hi>Preparatiue</hi> in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke to make the humours pliable and tractable for the insuing Purgation: the which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing may proue erroneous and deceiueable, if it meetes with a malignant, stubborne, or peruerse matter. For who can by a coniecturall knowledge, pierce into more hidden occurrences? There is as much difference betwixt <hi>speculation</hi> and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,</hi> as is betwixt a <hi>clinicall scholler,</hi> discoursing

of Countries by his <hi>Map</hi> or <hi>Globe</hi> on a Table, as a <hi>Mariner</hi> trauersing the <hi>Ocean,</hi> where oftentimes he meetes with such difficulties, that hee is forced to returne home, and to wait for a more seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opportunity. Therefore if you meane to hold vp and continue this <hi>Company,</hi> it were good you sent for some choyse and well experienced <hi>Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators</hi> which may direct this businesse, associated with the Gentlemen aboue named.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> liked very well of this aduise, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently caused these foure famous Knights to bee sent for, Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> Sir <hi>Martin Furbisher,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Middleton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Button.</hi> As soone as they were come into his <hi>Maiesties</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, he related vnto them, that vpon a <hi>Petition</hi> exhibited vnto him by many poore Widowes of the <hi>City of London,</hi> and of other Cities &amp; Towns in <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> how their Husbands perished in their voyages to the <hi>East Indies,</hi> by the distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the <hi>climate,</hi> in passing so often vnder the <hi>Tropickes,</hi> and the <hi>burning Zones,</hi> they therfore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired eyther that he should dissolue the <hi>East Indie Company,</hi> or finde out a more conuenient passage to these Countries, where the Spices grew, which their Country men wanted. Otherwise they must of necessity continue still vnmaried; or liue in dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feares to lose their succeeding Husbands, who for their reliefe would hazard their liues, as the others had formerly done. For such was their ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitable Fate, they said, that none would aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on Sailers Widowes, but men of the same vocation. Vpon which clamors of these distressed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19655:163"/>
Creatures, his <hi>Maiestie</hi> being moued to pitty and commiseration, required them to yeeld their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall censures, by what passage the <hi>English Nation</hi> might traffique into those Lands of Spiceries with lesse perils and losses of Sailers. Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> first deliuered his opinion, that the moderne <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mographers</hi> agreed vpon foure waies to the <hi>East Indies:</hi> Two imaginary, by the <hi>Northeast,</hi> which <hi>Pliny</hi> mentioned, Sir <hi>Hugh Willowby</hi> attempted, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> prosecuted vpon the North of <hi>Muscouy</hi> to <hi>Noua Zembla, Waygate,</hi> and the <hi>Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The other two waies to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aile into the Lands and <hi>Ilands of Spices,</hi> were famous, which himselfe had past. The one through the <hi>Streights of Magellan,</hi> the other by the <hi>Cape of good Hope.</hi> Of these, he liked those of <hi>Magellan,</hi> and now the rather, for that <hi>Tierra del fuego,</hi> which is the South part of those <hi>Streights,</hi> is lately found out by certaine <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to be an Iland: And that himselfe had beene driuen by foule weather, as farre as 57. degrees of Southerly latitude, where he found some Ilands, and in all likelihood, an open passage about the 60. degree, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> tried to be true, now stiling the same, <hi>Lameers Streights.</hi> This way hee approued lesse dangerous then the other, specially to the <hi>Molucca</hi> Ilands: so that they would begin their voyage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of August from <hi>England:</hi> that they might arriue there by the end of December,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19655:164"/>
which falls out to be the first of Iune, or end of May, in these <hi>Streights.</hi> Sir <hi>Maurice Abbot</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and said, that the greatest comfort in such long voyages, was to be sure of fresh victuals, which they could not bee assured of, by those <hi>Southwest Streights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> answered: that for Wood, Water, Fish and Fowle, they might haue enough on this side, and neere the <hi>Streights;</hi> that they might be relieued in distresse at the <hi>Riuer of Amazous</hi> by their Countrymen, where <hi>Captaine North, Captaine Parker,</hi> and <hi>Captaine Christmas</hi> had planted, whereof the two last liued there of late, foure years in despite of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom they wearied out of the Country with the helpe of the <hi>Natiues,</hi> for all that they came with 1500. men to surprize them. Being past the <hi>Streights,</hi> they might haue fresh victuals in abundance at the <hi>Iland of Mocha</hi> in the height of 38. degree, which is subiect to the <hi>States of Arauco,</hi> deadly enemies to the <hi>Spamards,</hi> and but fiue or sixe leagues from that <hi>Centinent.</hi> Or else they may get some with ease at the Iland of Saint <hi>Maries,</hi> twenty or thirty leagues further. If the Trade be to the <hi>Moluccaes,</hi> they may spare two moneths voyage this way; and also they shall meet with <hi>Salomons Iles,</hi> and many rich places vpon the Coast of <hi>New Guinea,</hi> which affoord plenty of victuals, Gold, Pearles, and Spice. Sir <hi>Henry Middleton</hi> much misliked this <hi>Southwest</hi> way, because of the vncertainty of prouision, and the solitarinesse of the voyage; whereas hee was sure all the way by the <hi>Cape of</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:19655:164"/>
                  <hi>good Hope,</hi> at <hi>Sancta Helena, Soldana,</hi> at the <hi>Iland of Madagascar,</hi> to be stored with necessaries vntill he came to his iourneyes end. Further, hee said, as also the <hi>East India Company</hi> confirmed the very same to be true, that they had small doings now to the <hi>Moluccaes:</hi> For their Trade lay about <hi>laua maior,</hi> where they had a Factory at <hi>Bantam,</hi> and to <hi>Serrat in Cambaia,</hi> to <hi>Sumatra,</hi> and the <hi>Persian Gulfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After some altercation betwixt these last afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specified, <hi>Apollo</hi> commanded Sir <hi>Martin Furbisher</hi> to declare his opinion touching the <hi>Northwest passage,</hi> which hee accordingly did, prouing that the most part of <hi>Meta incognita,</hi> where hee had beene, seemed by all probability to bee broken lands and Ilands, and that if he had had sufficient store of prouision, hee would haue aduentured through in despite of the mountaines of Ice, which threatned to immure him in. And that hee much maruelled at their slownesse of late, which finding the passage cleere and open in a farre more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate climate, then where he had beene, did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding misse to finde it out.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Button</hi> much incensed to bee taxed for <hi>slownesse,</hi> who had busied himselfe all the daies of his life in warrelike actions, hauing beene at the sacking of <hi>Cales,</hi> and imployed in <hi>Ireland</hi> against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> at the voyage of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giere,</hi> and many other Sea voyages, for answere said, That if Sir <hi>Martin Furbisher</hi> had wintred in the 58. degree in <hi>America,</hi> which experience taught to be as the 63. degree of <hi>Europes</hi> coldnes,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19655:165"/>
hee would not haue beene so briefe to impute <hi>slownesse</hi> vnto him. As for the <hi>Passage,</hi> hee verily beleeued as Sir <hi>Martin</hi> did, it lay open. And that hee would haue done his endeuour to haue sailed through. For in <hi>Hudsons Bay,</hi> hee saw two very likely <hi>passages</hi> towards the Northwest, to enter in; but that hee was otherwise authorized and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to goe on <hi>Southwestwards</hi> to the bottome of <hi>Hudsons Bay,</hi> so that hee durst not but follow the tenor of his <hi>Commission.</hi> Yet notwithstanding he hoped, that he had not spent his time in vaine, during his voyage in those angry <hi>climates.</hi> For first he discouered, that those Seas could not bee sailed through, but in Iune, Iuly, and August, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwaies subiect to foggs, ice, stormes, and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den windes. The <hi>sunne</hi> seldome seene, so that the best <hi>Nauigator</hi> can hardly obserue the certaine height thereof. Onely his chiefest comfort during his abode there, was, that the dayes were very long, with very short nights: though otherwise the want of cleernesse to obserue either <hi>sunne</hi> or <hi>starre,</hi> were able vtterly to ouerthrow the whole voyage. Further, he noted, that Trumpets might not be spared, but most necessary to be had of such as passe in those Seas. For if two ships went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they would quickly lose one another by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the thicke mist, though they went so neere as they might hallow one to the other. Likewise, he said, that <hi>shirts of male</hi> might not be spared, for feare of the <hi>sauages</hi> arrowes out of some ambusca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do: Or else thicke leather Targets made of Buffe, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> vse. To this hee added, that by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19655:165"/>
experience hee found another necessary note, which hee wished all such as were imployed in these remote Enterprizes to beare in minde, to carry with them good tooles, as well for repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their Ships, as to dig on the land, if they suffer shipwracke: And withall, the fittest engines which can bee deuised for weighing of shipping vpon such occasions; and in any case a couple of <hi>Crabs</hi> to be brought along with them in these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne Discoueries, for the hoising and landing of their Ships, or other heauy necessaries, as Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, Timber, &amp;c. Also, that the Discouerer should marke the set of the <hi>Tide.</hi> For whensoeuer he loseth his strong <hi>Tide,</hi> or findes ground in 100 <hi>fathomes,</hi> let him rest assured, that he goes out of his direct course, for the finding of this hopefull passage. To conclude, Sir <hi>Thomas Button</hi> deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red two notes more of great consequence for the preseruation of the Discouerers healths and liues, which <hi>Apollo</hi> better liked then all the former Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses; whereof the one was, that hee obserued <hi>Aqua vita, Sacke,</hi> and such hot liquors, to become most hurtfull to his men in the cold Winter, and on the other side, small drinke and Barly water most soueraine to maintaine them in health. The other obseruation was, that the <hi>iuyce</hi> of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19655:166"/>
proceeded by seeing of the multitudes of <hi>Partrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> which fed and liued thereon all the Winter, to become fat and plumpe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>APollo</hi> seemed much delighted with these narrations of Sir <hi>Thomas Button;</hi> and to let the vertuous of <hi>Parnassus</hi> know some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more of these remarkeable euents, hee made this discourse: How many famous Captaines here haue I admitted into my <hi>Court,</hi> which neuer entred into these hidden and magisteriall secrets of nature? Nay, how many wise <hi>Philosophers</hi> bee there here graced with my fauours, which vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not these wonders of naturall effects?

Yet I could wish such as bee in authority in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19655:166"/>
assigning the like <hi>Commissions</hi> hereafter, to adde that Clause, which <hi>King Henry the eight of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> sometimes vsed to enable his <hi>Generals</hi> with, that if that seruice proued disastrous and vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, notwithstanding the former words of the <hi>Commission,</hi> they should preserue the Honour of their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> by some braue exploit of their owne proiecting. For many occurrences may, like rubbes, light in their way, which the cleerest <hi>Eyes of State</hi> could not possibly foresee. Sometimes the <hi>Enemy</hi> may haue a siluer bridge by slye intelligencers into his Neighbours Land. Sometimes a <hi>Commander</hi> may meet with a good booty at Sea, though he were beaten off from the Land. Or if one place be strongly barricadoed, hee may finde another most easily to be wonne. What ouerthrew and vtterly dispersed the <hi>inuincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada in</hi> 1588. but the precise relye, which the <hi>Spanish Admirall</hi> stood vpon in regard of his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> limited by the <hi>Councell of Spaine?</hi> Let this suffice to excuse Sir <hi>Thomas Button</hi> for his not entring into one of the two <hi>passages,</hi> which he suspected to crowne the Discouerers voyage with eternall fame. And now to enter into the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter points of those secrets, which he mentions to haue tried, so vsefull for his peoples health; know this, <hi>O ye that study Physicke,</hi> that as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> wrote, mens inward parts, specially the stomacke, is hotter in Winter then in Summer. Looke in an extreame frosty Winter, how all the sap and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Plants and Hearbs, shoote inwardly, and descend into the root, running thither as to their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19655:167"/>
sanctuary, refuge, and last helpe in nature. Euen so stands it with the body of man, which for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation and vigorous constitution, may in some sort be compared to a <hi>Plant.</hi> In Summer, the heat and radicall moysture is dispersed here and there, vp and downe, and through all the parts of the body, so that the heat in the stomacke is of a mild oily warmth, and at that time more truely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, then in the <hi>winter.</hi> For Experience teacheth, and <hi>Anatomists</hi> confirme it, that in the <hi>winter,</hi> chiefly in frosty weather, mans liueliest heate set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it selfe in the stomacke, neere the heart, the center and root of life, the other parts being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with cold. There likewise it will beginne quickly to inflame in frosty seasons. When the raw ayre gets into the body at the mouth, and at the pores, or at such time, when these pores of the skinne and outward superficies become thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whereby the spirits may not haue their free euaporation. Hence grow oppilations and obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and consequently the <hi>Scuruy,</hi> being aided on by the meseraicall veines, full of putrified dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish blood, or by the melancholike spleen, swolne with too much windy nourishment. For the aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of which infirmities, moyst opening medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of a biting nature, cooling and piercing liquors, somewhat of a milky mildnesse, and the iuyce of springing hearbs, must bee regarded by a wise <hi>Phisitian,</hi> and preferred before strong liquors and fiery Drinkes, which commonly are too too binding. I doe therefore much commend this <hi>Knight</hi> for this carefull obseruation, as for the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19655:167"/>
discouering of those tender Plants which <hi>Iaques Cartier</hi> applaudes to be so soueraigne against the <hi>Scuruy,</hi> and called <hi>Anneda,</hi> by the <hi>Sauages</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada.</hi> But now of late yeares, this precious Plant hath beene sought after by <hi>Champleine</hi> and other <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> albeit without successe; vntill this <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> renewed the memorie therof. And most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous had he yet been, if he had transported hither some Setsor Slips of these powerful <hi>Plants,</hi> which by this time might haue increased to succour many an honest mans life distressed by this hidden &amp; tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous <hi>Guest.</hi> I haue spoken the more largely of this <hi>sicknesse,</hi> because our moderne <hi>Practitioners in Phisicke</hi> should take this obseruation for a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, that most of the new diseases, Agues, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tride Feuers, and such sicknesses as spring in the winter or in the beginning of the Spring, they be but waiting-Maids to this traiterous Lady; &amp; for this cause, let them beginne their Cure with the <hi>Scuruy,</hi> and with the cleansing of the Bloud, and the rest will vanish away, as it were by miracle.</p>
               <p>As soone as <hi>Apollo</hi> had ended this speech, hee charged <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Aegineta,</hi> and other famous <hi>Phisicians,</hi> to take care ouer all the <hi>English Sailers,</hi> which from thenceforth, should hazard their liues to the <hi>Indies.</hi> He likewise commanded the <hi>East Indies Company</hi> to be more bountifull to the poore <hi>Widowes,</hi> whose Husbands chanced to miscarry in their seruice. Lastly, his <hi>Maiestie</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the <hi>London Merchants</hi> to ioyne together for the prosecuting further of the <hi>Northwest passage,</hi> and for the honour of those <hi>braue spirits,</hi> which

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19655:169"/>
inequality of reports, that wee cannot rightly be informed by any of these <hi>Currents</hi> concerning those passages, which happen in our neerest times. How much lesse then shall we credit Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of elder ages, which haue left vs the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of many memorable affaires, which ought to serue as mirrours to posterity? Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, most true it is, that the <hi>East Indy</hi> Cause was decided before the <hi>sunne</hi> entred into the <hi>Tropick of Cancer,</hi> in this Moneth of Iune last.

Society, answered, that indeed such a Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was treated of betwixt those <hi>Princes,</hi> and that iust, as the said Commissioners intended to diuide the whole world by certaine Lines and imaginary points in the Globe, they were quite put out of their agreements by a Knauish Boy, who at that time accidentally bathed himselfe in a riuer neere vnto them, as they debated of these Lines, and hearing the Commissioners varying and wrangling about the drawing of these new Lines, he turned his backe side vnto them, and wished them to forme the same equally, as if they should delineat from the Center of his <hi>Ano,</hi> and so taking the same for a patterne, the one halfe should appertaine to the one, and the other halfe to the other. Vpon which ridiculous interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Commissioners being abashed and asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that a Childe should touch so seriously vpon their Masters ambition, they departed, leauing the partition vnperfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> perceiuing that the <hi>Portingals</hi> drift was to ingrosse the whole Trade of Spiceties as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly preiudiciall to others of the <hi>Christian</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, vtterly misliked their a spiring and greedy purposes, and after some bitter exprobration of their Couetousnesse, hee framed this speech vnto them: In going about to appropriate the whole world to your selues, yee seeke to ecclipse the power of the <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> to forestall the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Art of Nauigation, and by keeping backe the <hi>Protestants,</hi> to let the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> still to ioyne with you in this beneficiall Trade. I confesse your

                  <hi>Nation</hi> deserues to be commended for your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coueries of the <hi>Cape of Good Hope</hi> vnder <hi>Vasco de Gama.</hi> But afterwards, for you to ingrosse into your hands more Coasts and Trades then yee are able to mannage, is meere auarice, and a wrong to your <hi>Creator,</hi> who happily by these your Neighbours aduentures, may in time to come discouer as yet more vnknowne Countries, and settle in those remote places the <hi>word of God,</hi> euen beyond <hi>New Guiny,</hi> where more Noble Nations doe yet reside then yee haue found out. What greater glory can arriue to this part of the world, then to search into the vttermost parts of those Southerne Regions? In all ciuill Countries, the Inhabitants must as well looke into the Artificiall waies of acquiring wealth, as into the naturall meanes abounding in the places of their abode. This consists in Corne, Cattell, Wooll, Lead, Tinne, or in the like Commodities, which are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily and without much Art deriued from their natiue Seates. The other depends on their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry and more curious skill to work vpon those materialls, as by their Wooll to Compose Stuffes of Serges, Perpetuanaes, Paropous, or the like; or else by Commerce and Traffique to exchange some of their superfluous wares with Forraigners, for some of their superfluities. Now in trading to these remote Countries, questionlesse some of these goods are exported to counteruaile those Wares, which Strangers might otherwise, to the preiudice of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> import and bring in.</p>
               <p>Before the <hi>Londoners</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> did set
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19655:170"/>
out Fleetes to the <hi>East Indies,</hi> the <hi>Turkes</hi> vsed to share with the <hi>Portingalls</hi> in those Commodities which now the <hi>Protestants</hi> trade for. Heretofore they paid at <hi>Lisbone, Aleppo,</hi> or <hi>Alexandria</hi> for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pound of Pepper, two shillings, whereas now they pay but three pence in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> for Mace foure shillings sixe pence, which now stands them but in nine pence. Cloues at <hi>Lisbone</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo,</hi> foure shillings sixe pence, and now but tenne pence. Nutmegs there two shillings, here but foure pence. Indico foure shillings, here twelue pence the pound. Likewise they paid for raw Silkes out of <hi>Persia,</hi> twelue shillings, but now they pay at the <hi>Persian Gulfe,</hi> not eight shillings the pound. Whereby a good Commonwealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may obserue, what Gaine there may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> if this rich Trade be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and followed. And if they transport no coine out of this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> but Spanish Reals, Dolers, or outlandish monyes, carying also some of their Tinne, Carzeyes, and Broad cloathes, to the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulfe, where they are best vendible; there is no question, but this <hi>Kingdome</hi> will become much inriched. For the <hi>sound of Denmarke,</hi> the <hi>Hans-townes,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> will returne vs more money, then they haue need to bring into the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But first I could wish <hi>Aesculapius</hi> to call a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation of his best experimented <hi>Physicians,</hi> and to lay downe a dietary for their healths, for a <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne</hi> man taken out of his naturall Element, and placed but for a small while in those fiery Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19655:171"/>
will quickly droope. And now in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim vntill this consultation bee concluded, out of the experience of such as trauelled into those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Countries, I wish them to ballast their ships with <hi>Turneps,</hi> as a Defensatiue against the <hi>Scuruy,</hi> to carry along with them the salt or iuyce of <hi>Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uygrasse</hi> well sodden, and stopt vp in glasses, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, the iuyce of Lemons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> to bring along with them, good store of White wine Vineger to mingle with water, a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor which preserued Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> in his long voyage round about the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> to vse <hi>Cider,</hi> and such cooling drinkes, more then Wines or <hi>Aqua vitae;</hi> sauing at times of excessiue heat, when the body becomes fainty, and the spirits are withdrawne into the outward parts. Then, a little draught of their hot waters, or a cup of Sacke, will refresh nature, although they sweat neuer so much. For it is found out by experience, that the moisture which lies within the body, is exhaled and forced into the exteriour parts, and that the inward part then forsaken of that moist comfortable humour, and being cold, gladly receiueth a sudden restoratiue to repaire those annoyances, which the violence of that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usuall heat hath extracted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> to feed betimes in the morning, and not at noone, when the Sunne is vehemently hot, or else late in the euenings, once or twise a day, as their stomackes serue them.</p>

of these <hi>wastes,</hi> and wearied all the youthfull graine of these grounds with bearing of Corne? Will they feed and sucke still on the blood of their decaied veines? The best grounds will grow out of heart in a short time, vnlesse they be holpen by Art. I confesse the subiect, which I intend now to commend, is sordide, rude, and more beseeming a Clownish <hi>Coridon,</hi> then one of my education in this magnifique <hi>Court;</hi> yet neuerthelesse, because the same serues to inrich his <hi>Maiesties</hi> Territories in these Westerne Coasts, which hee holds as deere as his <hi>Thessalian Tempe,</hi> I will disclose the secret meanes to renew the life of ouer-wearied Lands. There is no ground but hath <hi>Marle,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neere the superficies of it, or deeper in the wombe of the earth abounding. This <hi>Marle</hi> in some Countries, by the reuolution of time, is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to lime, or limestone, and this lime in some places is growne to a finer mould, euen to chalke, which is the perfection of all <hi>Marle.</hi> Where none of these abound, nature hauing not as yet wrought her selfe to her fulnesse; I wish euery Landed man with an Augur, boarer, or piercing worme, to search and try in the deepest part of his earth, where the same lieth hid; for surely shallow or thicke, he may finde <hi>Marle</hi> vpon his Land. If it be oily, vnctuous, and clammy, then it is fat and rich. It is of sundry colours, and different likewise in the goodnesse. For there is a yellow <hi>Marle,</hi> a Red, a Grey, and Blew; all which are good, if they be oily and slippery as Sope, and mixed with earth; as also weake, if it be incorporated with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19655:174"/>
stone or sand. The <hi>red Marle</hi> is the worst, vnlesse it be found to lye neere the <hi>blew.</hi> For the best is the <hi>blew</hi> in operation, and will last longest. Next vnto it is the <hi>yellow,</hi> and the <hi>grey</hi> better then the <hi>red.</hi> All which may bee searched after in the veines of the earth. Hauing met with it, let the Husband man glory, that hee hath met with trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, able to supply his owne and his Countries necessities. Onely let him take this for a <hi>Caueat,</hi> that at the <hi>first marling</hi> of his ground, hee must look he plow not with broad and deepe furrowes, but narrow, lest he throw his <hi>Marle</hi> into the dead mould. For the nature of <hi>Marle</hi> is to send all the goodnesse downewards, and for that cause it must not be buried too deepe, but still kept aloft on the vpper mould. And in this it differeth much from Dung and Mucke, which spend their vertue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and will ascend by their misty vapour springing vp to the face of the ground, though they be buried deeper then they ought to bee. I could admonish men oftener to hearten their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne grounds with other remedies, as with the soile of old Ditches, or with sand, or to transferre and temper fresh earth brought from lay grounds, with their ouerspent mould, as they vse in <hi>Deuon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi> Or to adde tough clay to the tender sandy, for the one is life to the other being so incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, specially moist with the dry.

                  <hi>Periander</hi> after this speech, produced his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Seeing we haue, like <hi>Moles,</hi> begunne to treat of earthly Commodities to inrich this decayed Countrie, let me exhort them to plant <hi>Orchards,</hi> the benefits I dare well say, will counteruaile the <hi>French Vineyards</hi> if they be rightly followed, and need but small pruning and looking to after the first planting. By this way they shall haue <hi>Cider,</hi> which with a little helpe of some Spice, will goe beyond most of their <hi>Wines,</hi> and consequently, saue aboue sixe hundred thousand pound a yeare, which now most lauishly are consumed by them, euen to the cutting and ending of their <hi>fatall threed.</hi> Already some discreet and circumspect Landlords haue couenanted &amp; conditioned with their Tenants, that they shall euery yeare during their Leases, plant fruit Trees: which if others will imitate, not onely <hi>wines</hi> will grow in lesse vse, but <hi>malt</hi> will be spared out of the superfluity of their store, to furnish the needy, and supply <hi>Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations</hi> and <hi>Plantations</hi> abroad.</p>
               <p>As soone as <hi>Periander</hi> had done, <hi>Thales</hi> the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesian</hi> tooke his turne and spake: <hi>Many small pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of meat put into the Pot, make fat pottage,</hi> and as the other Prouerbe implieth, <hi>many a small makes a great,</hi> and mountaines were made of small motes or atomes, which I alleadge in my defence at this present, for though I cannot promise Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Mountaines to augment the State of <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> yet I dare auow, that I shall reueale one <hi>Proiect</hi> which shall spare them sixty thousand

If they think it much to erect so many <hi>Salt houses,</hi> as will serue all the <hi>Ilanders,</hi> by reason of the deare rate of <hi>Coales</hi> to be conuerted for other vses, let them set vp some in <hi>Newfound land,</hi> some in <hi>New England,</hi> and others in <hi>New Scotland,</hi> where they may haue plenty of woods. And it is knowne, that Wood fire without conuerting Wood into Charcoale, wil serue to boile <hi>Salt</hi> as wel as <hi>Coal.</hi> There <hi>Salt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at hand to be had for the <hi>Fishermens</hi> vse, it will saue at the least twenty thousand pound, vnto the <hi>English,</hi> which now with the tunnage and the <hi>Salt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Discouery of Newfound Land.</note> they are forced to be at charge. <hi>Captain Whithorne</hi> in his book of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>modities of that Country, among other exceeding good notes by him there deliuered, writes, that one Panne will make aboue 20. bushels of good <hi>Salt</hi> in euery 24. houres, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with mans labour and the Salt water; and not,

It were fit that such creatures had <hi>Tutors,</hi> or as the <hi>Ciuilians</hi> say, <hi>Curators</hi> to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their Estates for them, seeing they haue not the benefit of reason to distinguish what is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for mortall men, which must suddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the dust of the earth, and then whose shall these Goods be, which these <hi>Fooles</hi> haue prepared with curses, &amp; disquietnes of mind? If Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners and Presenters were vpon their oathes, to sound &amp; search into euery mans ability; <hi>Subsidies</hi> might be trebled on some, and the needier sort eased.

               <p>Here <hi>Chilon</hi> ended. And <hi>Cleobulus</hi> framed his speech in this manner: So great is some mens Couetousnesse at this time, that they had rather hazard their soules to hell, rather then to imploy their money for the honour and weale of their Country. They will rather keepe it by them, then lend part to releeue their dearest friends. And I know not how to compell these wretches to bring it abroad, vnlesse the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> would order <hi>Tutors</hi> ouer them, as my Brother <hi>Chilon</hi> aduised, grounding the equity of this <hi>Order</hi> vpon the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>writ, de Lunatico inquirendo.</hi> For surely a <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> possesseth them worse then that, which mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Saul.</hi> There is no other way to draw money out of <hi>misers</hi> hands, but by hope of profit. Since the Statute enacted in <hi>King Iames</hi> time, for 8. in the 100. money is farre more scarce. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in my iudgement, if that <hi>Act</hi> were repealed, there might insue a twofold benefit. First, money would become more plentifull. And then if an <hi>Act</hi> were made, that <hi>Vsurers</hi> might be tolerated to take 9. pound in the 100. pound, for one yeares vse, &amp; that the party which borrowes, should pay 20. shillings more to make it vp 10. pound, as in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19655:177"/>
former time, and this last to be conuerted towards some meritorious work, mony would waxe more abundant, and no man would grudge to pay 20. shillings for a vertuous purpose. And perhaps the same would lessen the exaction of the rest in the mercie of God. To this furtherance of money I would haue those <hi>Brokers</hi> and extorting <hi>Iackes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue corporall punishment, who shall by indirect tricks and monthly bills exact vpon pawnes more interest, then euer the <hi>Iew of Malta</hi> tooke of his deadly enemies.</p>
               <p>After him the <hi>Lawmaker Solon</hi> discoursed, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: I haue heard this day sundry pretty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects pronounced by my Colleagues for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of <hi>Great Britaine.</hi> But if all these fall out happily, and the <hi>Deuill</hi> still continue to sow his seeds of dissention in mens hearts to goe to Law one with another for a <hi>Goats haire</hi> by the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Makebates, and the aduice of some coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous <hi>Lawiers,</hi> to what end shall his <hi>Maiestie</hi> spend his time to succour and supply them with money, and they presently after to bestow the same on others for the molesting of Innocents.</p>
               <p>This were to make our great <hi>Appollo</hi> accessary and priuie to iniurious dealings. First, let my good <hi>Ilanders</hi> weed out, or at least wise restraine the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies, deceits, and equiuocations of <hi>Lawiers,</hi> and then seeke for remedies to heale their indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions. Shall the mild <hi>Comforter</hi> of humane soules minister an occasion of scandall to reprobates, and fewell to their iniquities? If they get wealth, men, as I see, haue not the wit to keepe it. Therefore
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19655:178"/>
I thinke fit, and it is a treasure inualuable, to tame the <hi>Lawiers,</hi> before any more riches be giuen, as swords in mad mens hands, to offend the seruants of <hi>God.</hi> What intolerable knaueries haue beene exercised of late yeares by fellowes of this ranke against honest men, yea against whole Countries, whose blood, like that of <hi>Abell,</hi> doth cry for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance? I know one poore <hi>Lordship in Wales</hi> which was persecuted by them, and forced for foure thousand pounds to compound for their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue freehold, which by <hi>Records</hi> found in the <hi>Tower</hi> their Ancestors had enioyed 300. yeares, and all vpon that farre fetcht maxime, <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi,</hi> that no prescription of time might barre the Prince of his Right? And if the wise King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed memory had not set a period to their insinuations, by limiting 60 yeares to his titulary demand, <hi>God</hi> knowes to what euent their dangerous positions would haue issued vnto?

                  <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> as the most ancient, was elected first to certifie his censure, who with a free <hi>Romane</hi> candour framed this discourse: There is asmuch difference betwixt the face and state of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> at this day, and the fashion as it stood in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian;</hi> time, when I liued there with my victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous father in law <hi>Iulius Agricola,</hi> as we see betwixt it and the Countrey of the <hi>Crime Tartare.</hi> Then, there was elbow roome for the Inhabitants suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient without multiplicities of <hi>Law-suites,</hi> subtle shifts, conycatching, or contagious thronging and hudling together: But now,</p>

But in my iudgement next vnto <hi>suits</hi> at Law, which the wise <hi>Solon</hi> obserued to begger both Towne and Country, the populousnesse of some chiefe Cities, and specially of <hi>London,</hi> doth impouerish the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Chamber</hi> of that <hi>Empire,</hi> insomuch that it is in a manner impossible to inrich them, before the Drones, and yong hungry Bees bee remoued to some forraigne Places by an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> and so prest by transcendent authority. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which I would haue thus prest, are the Inmates, the Cottagers, the needy, and needlesse numbers. An honest <hi>Minister</hi> assured me, that in his Parish at <hi>London,</hi> there were many which perished of want, being ashamed to begge; and that he knew <hi>tenne persons</hi> hauing but a roome of twelue foot square to containe them, &amp; but one bed for them all.

For the verifying of this my allegation, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one example which may serue to confirme the same. I haue heard it reported by very credible persons, that about 4. yeares past in a house neere

Yea and that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe would admire at, they found their money in their purses to haue lost the colour, as if it had beene of purpose varnished with smoaky dung. If the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous regard of their healths moue them not, yet let the wisedome of <hi>Magistrates</hi> foresee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience which yearely accrues to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, by suffering vnnecessary people to hinder the gaines of the industrious, and withall to know this, that too many of the industrious Craftsmen themselues flocking together, doe so diuide the profit, which more politikely being fitter for a <hi>few,</hi> that both the one and the other, are often seene to faint vnder their owne waight. Better it is for a <hi>City</hi> to content themselues with a few sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall neighbours, then to be troubled with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rakers. If the <hi>City of London,</hi> which is thought to hold eight hundred thousand Soules within it, and the Suburbes were rid of 40000 of these, the rest would thriue the better, and saue at least two hundred thousand pounds a yeare, which now are spent in vain, &amp; hereafter wil be conuerted for the weale of the whole <hi>Iland.</hi> In one yeare there were suppressed 700.

of <hi>France,</hi> whom <hi>Katherine de Medicis</hi> Queen Mother, and somtimes <hi>Regent</hi> of that Kingdome, was wont to terme the Heretike of State, because he disclosed the secrets of <hi>Princes,</hi> vttered his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion next after <hi>Cornelius Tacitus.</hi> In the warres betwixt the <hi>House of Burgundy</hi> and my Soueraigne <hi>Lewis the eleuenth,</hi> I remember, that <hi>Money</hi> fell out very scarce, as it doth now in <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> for all that saying, which this wise <hi>King</hi> was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to repeat, that his <hi>France</hi> might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Meadow ready to bee mowne twise a yeare. And one of the principall meanes, which he inuented to be stored with money, was <hi>to raise his Coine.</hi> From the <hi>Saxons</hi> time vntill my time in the Raigne of <hi>King Henry the sixt,</hi> an ounce of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was diuided into 20. peeces, and so passed for 20. pence. <hi>King Henry</hi> by reason of his wars with vs, and afterwards with the <hi>House of Yorke,</hi> proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ounce at 30. pence. <hi>King Henry</hi> the 4. vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like necessity, enhansed it to 40. pence, which so lasted vntill <hi>King Henry the</hi> 8. daies, who raised the ounce to the value of 45. pence. <hi>King Edward the</hi> 6. proclaimed it at fiue shillings. If Money continues still scant, I see no reason, but that it might be raised higher, as in former times; which also would induce men to bring forth their Plate. In <hi>France, Venice,</hi> yea and in Golden <hi>Spaine,</hi> Brasse money goes current, two and thirty Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedis amounting to sixe pence; which they call a Reall. Of these Marauedis, I heard a Rhodomon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Castilian</hi> vaunt, that hee would bestow 600. thousand of them with his deare Daughter, to her
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19655:181"/>
mariage. In some Countries they vse Shelles, Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and lether peeces for money. In other places, gaddes of Steele or Iron. At the first troubles of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> they made stampes on Past-Boords, which they licensed to goe current for Money. In the last warres of <hi>Ireland,</hi> base Coine was ordained to supply the vse of the finest Siluer. As long as it will passe in estimation, and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by publike authority, either Money may bee raised, or the same of a mixt alloy, as the <hi>Venetian Liure,</hi> or the <hi>French Souls,</hi> or of such other met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall as the Prince liketh, may serue the Subiects turne in time of warres, as it serues those Nations both in Warre and Peace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lord Cromwell</hi> succeeded this <hi>Noble French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and said: that hee was one of the chiefest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments vnder <hi>King Henry the</hi> 8. to dissolue the Religious Houses in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; wished, that now some of those <hi>Farmes</hi> and <hi>impropriated Tithes,</hi> were for a few yeares lent by the State of <hi>England</hi> to support Ecclesiasticall persons in the new <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> meaning those, which the <hi>State</hi> could spare in their places. And he hoped by this meanes, the <hi>Clergy</hi> being prouided for in those New Lands, <hi>Churches</hi> would there be built the sooner, and the <hi>Plantations</hi> in a short time would helpe to inrich this <hi>Kingdome</hi> with many sorts of Commodities, specially if some of the Religious that went in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, &amp; others well beloued in their Country: that for their sakes, others of good account would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them, and so assist the Common-wealth by their power and example.</p>

                  <hi>Secretary Walsingham</hi> was of opinion, that letters of Mart or Reprizals would furnish the land with treasure, so that they went forth in Fleetes more strongly prepared then in <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> daies; For that now-a-dayes the <hi>Pyrates of Algiere</hi> had taught the <hi>Spaniards</hi> more wit not to go so weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mand and stor'd as in times past. In <hi>Drakes, Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> and other braue Aduenturers voyages, our <hi>English</hi> found a <hi>Golden age.</hi> But that now the case was otherwise. Therefore they must goe strong, if they meane to surprize any rich Carricks. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he wished them, whose powers extended not to supply themselues with many Copartners, to watch about the lesser Ilands in <hi>America,</hi> and not to draw too neere those Forts where the Gallies freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ted, nor to be aduenturous about the time when the <hi>Spanish Fleet</hi> repaired thither. About <hi>Brazill,</hi> and the riuer of <hi>Plate</hi> hee supposed they might intercept good booties &amp; with more safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: or if they entred into <hi>Lameeres straights,</hi> they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19655:182"/>
might in the <hi>South sea</hi> meet with rich prizes. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he animated the <hi>East Indy Company</hi> to ioyne with the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to driue the <hi>Portingals</hi> out of the wade of Spiceries. Further, he aduised the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> to prouide the like kinde entertainment for the <hi>Spanish</hi> prisoners, if not in their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, yet in the <hi>Summer Ilands,</hi> and other <hi>Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> where they might be put to labour as well as they employ them in their Gallies, vntil they paid sufficient ransomes. Lastly, he counselled them to erect a speciall <hi>society</hi> of men of war to ioyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Nauall expedition, and to lend vpon reasonable considerations some of those shippes, which they tooke, to waft our Fishermen, and to defend the <hi>Plantations.</hi>

               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> protested, that there must be strait <hi>Lawes</hi> enacted against superfluous commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities imported into the land out of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes, before the <hi>Golden Fleece</hi> could possibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Catholike Restoratiue.

He enueigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against the multitudes of <hi>wine tauernes,</hi> and <hi>Alehouses,</hi> saying that a great part of our <hi>Treasure</hi> were yearly wasted in these fiery houses; That halfe of them might well bee spared, and that in Cities and Townes, next to the contagion of the <hi>Aire</hi> formerly mentioned, they were the chiefe causes of the inflamation of mens blood, and so of

               </argument>
               <p>THe day before the summers <hi>Solftice</hi> in Iune last 1626. <hi>Apollo</hi> sent for the famous fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of the Rosie Crosse, St. <hi>George,</hi> St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> St. <hi>David,</hi> and St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> those care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Patrons of <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> and in the presence of the <hi>Lady Pallas,</hi> the <hi>Muses,</hi> the <hi>Graces,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertuous persons his Fauorites, he deliuered this short speech: The time now drawes on, that we must take our Progresse into the <hi>Tropicke of Cancer,</hi> where we must exhilarate with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence those rude subiects of ours, which inhabit neere the <hi>Northerne Pole,</hi> to gratifie their natures, which otherwise would proue more fullen, with some perpetuall Dayes without Nights, for their patience in tolerating so many long nights with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dayes at the winters <hi>Solstice,</hi> during w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> timeof our Progresse, I require you, my Gratious <hi>friends,</hi> to assist the planters of the <hi>Newfoundlle,</hi> which we haue lately styled <hi>Britanniol,</hi> and to treat on their behalfe with that magnanimous <hi>King Charles of</hi>

                  <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> that hee confirme the commission and orders, which his <hi>Father of blessed memory</hi> granted about three yeares past for the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Wafting ships</hi> for the defence of that hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Plantation, and of the fishing fleetes against the oppressions of Pyrats, assuring him from vs, that there lies the principall part of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> which <hi>Orpheus Iunior</hi> hath sounded out in his <hi>Cambrensium Caroleia,</hi> which he published at the celebration of his <hi>Mariage</hi> with the Paragon of <hi>France;</hi> which likewise he lately renewed here before vs at <hi>Parnassus:</hi> And not onely hee, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue intimated the benefit of this Proiect, namely, the Noble Sir <hi>William Alexander</hi> in his <hi>New Scotland,</hi> and Master <hi>Misselden</hi> in his <hi>Circle of Commerce,</hi> who in most liuely termes paints out the substance of this <hi>Fleece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A braue Dessigne it is, as Royall as Reall, as Honourable as Profitable. It promises renowne to the <hi>King,</hi> reuenew to the Crowne, Treasure to the Kingdome, a purchase for the Land, a prize for the Sea, Ships for nauigation, Nauigation for ships, Mariners for both: Entertainment for the rich, employment for the poore, aduantage for the Aduenturers, and encrease of Trade to all the subiects. A myne of Gold it is; The Myne is deepe, the veines are great, the Oare is rare, the gold is pure, the extent vnlimited, the wealth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, the worth inualuable. All this you shall signifie vnto that Noble <hi>King.</hi> And in the interim of our progresse, we command all the rest of my vertuous Corporation to obey the <hi>Lady Pallas,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:19655:184"/>
whom wee doe substitute in our stead as <hi>Queene Regent</hi> to see our State well and peaceably goner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

               <p>After whose departure the <hi>foure Patrons</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted how they might grace the mighty <hi>King of Great Britaine.</hi> St. <hi>George</hi> he deuised a triumphant shew to honour the <hi>Knights of the Noble Order of the Garter,</hi> the Portraiture whereof <hi>Menante</hi> meanes shortly to expresse. St. <hi>Andrew</hi> framed an eloquent Oration of <hi>Vnity</hi> vpon that Embleme: <hi>Henricus Rosas, Iacobus Regna.</hi> St. <hi>Patrick</hi> compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a briefe booke of the Military Science, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced with that late proiect of the double armed squadrons, wherein euery Bowman was taught to vse of the Pike as a Rest to his Bow; wherby his Country of <hi>Ireland</hi> might be secured from hostile inuasions. St. <hi>Dauid</hi> made choise to reioyce the <hi>Kings</hi> heart with a sonnet in memory of his hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Mariage and Coronation.</hi> The which when he had perfected and sung in the Amphitheater at <hi>Parnassus, Scogin</hi> and <hi>Skelton</hi> the chiefe Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for the Dogrel Rimers by the procurement of <hi>Zoilus, Momus,</hi> and others of the <hi>Popish Sect,</hi> very saucily interrupted him.

                     <hi>Vpon an Information preferred before the</hi> Lady Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, <hi>against</hi> Scoggin <hi>and</hi> Skelton <hi>for interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> S. Dauid <hi>in his Sonnet; she vtters some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations on the behalfe of the</hi> Learned, <hi>and thereby takes an occasion to banish all</hi> Scoffing Companions <hi>from</hi> Parnassus, <hi>and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming at any time after partakers of the</hi> Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fleece <hi>discouered in this Treatise.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe next day after this <hi>Sonnet</hi> was sung in the Amphitheater at <hi>Parnassus</hi> by S. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Spencer</hi> the <hi>Emperours Atturney</hi> for the <hi>English Poets,</hi> being moued with the vnman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly and rude interruptions of <hi>Scoggin</hi> and <hi>Skel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> informed against them as Libellers before the <hi>Lady Pallas,</hi> who sate as Queene Regent in <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes</hi> absence. These dogrell Rimers confessed their Errour, that they were seduced by the <hi>Spirit of Detraction,</hi> to disgrace this Reuerend <hi>Prelate</hi> as much as in them lay, because his Grauity had composed that <hi>Sonnet</hi> in such a homely straine, as seemed more conuenient for men of their ranke, then for a venerable <hi>Patriarch,</hi> whose veine ought rather to flow with Heroicall blood, then to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their plaine robes of Poetizing.</p>
               <p>Vpon this Confession of the <hi>Dogrell Rimers, ore tenus,</hi> the wise <hi>Regent</hi> proceeded, and vttered these notable resolutions; that <hi>Scoggin</hi> and <hi>Skelton</hi> well deserued to be punished as <hi>Libellers</hi> in that <hi>Starre-Chamber-Court.</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:19655:190"/>
First, because they had interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a person of that high worth, and that publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before they had heard the <hi>Sonnet</hi> throughly repeated, which argued, that they did it more out of spleene and pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>udicate iudgement, then out of the apprehension of their titulary liberties. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that a simple course Poeme inriched with liuely matter and iuyce, ought to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an heroicall swolne verse puft vp with the barme or froth of an inconsiderate wit. Thirdly, that no man should critickly quote downe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of any Booke or writing, except hee also would note the best and choisest conceits thereof, whereby it might appeare in the ballance of vnderstanding, that the one did downe-waigh the other. For it is easier to finde faults, then to mend them, to pull downe a house, then to build one vp. And whosoeuer would marke the worst things, leauing the sweetest and most worthy of commendation behinde; her <hi>Grace</hi> compared him to that Foole, which forsooke the Rose, and smelt to the pricking brier. Fourthly, that many men vsed to reprehend the works of the <hi>learned,</hi> which their owne muddy Pates could not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend nor comprehend, because they might seeme wiser to the standers by then the <hi>Muses</hi> had made them. Fiftly, that a iudicious <hi>Writer</hi> should not care what censure a malicious Sycophant gaue of his workes; For it were more honourable to bee praised of one <hi>Socrates,</hi> then of a hundred <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19655:190"/>
the most prudent <hi>Queen</hi> likened him to that hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braind Traueller, which in the scorching Moneth of Iune being troubled with the croaking noise of Frogs, would needs light downe from his horse to be reuenged on them for offending of his tender eares.</p>
               <p>All this, sayd the <hi>noble Queene,</hi> did our Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <hi>Patriarch</hi> know, when hee went forwards with his <hi>Sonnet</hi> notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ding the crosse-opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of these <hi>Buffones,</hi> scorning out of a braue <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> courage to reuenge himself on such contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible creatures. Neuertheles, because their floutes and taunts tended to the breach of Ciuill Orders, her <hi>Maiestie</hi> banished all <hi>scoffing companions,</hi> and base ballet Rimers quite out of the Iurisdiction of <hi>Parnassus</hi> and <hi>Colch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
