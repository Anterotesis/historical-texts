            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Two ends therefore did he propound to himselfe in working that miracle. The encrease of his owne glorie, and his disciples faith. Now here, neither of these two ends could be attained: For how should he not haue disgraced his glorie, if he had shewed any vaine glorie? If thou be the sonne of God, saies the tempte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, commaunde that these stones be made bread. So that his temptation tended onely to this ende, to make the sonne of God vain-glorious. Againe, how could we haue beene perswaded by him, if he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:5444:7"/>
had beene perswaded by the deuill? For he might haue seemed to haue done this miracle not only by the deuills ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, but by his power. The summe is this therefore, To conuert a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poore soule vnto God, or to make a sonne of God, he would haue done it, vaine-gloriously to shewe himselfe the sonne of God he would not doe it; but said, Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euerie word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
            <p>The word man is verie materiall: As if he should haue said, Any ordinarie man liueth not by the bread; but by the power, and strength, and as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet calleth it, the staffe of bread, which God giueth it. Now if he that is but a bare man liueth rather by the blessing of God, then by the bread; much lesse need I presume vpon vnlawful meanes, that am both man and God. Againe, we must obserue that by The word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God, we are not to vnderstand the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten will or word of God, but the secret counsell and decree of God, in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

and sustaining his creatures: For example, if the word haue gone out of Gods mouth, and if God haue set it downe, and saide it, that I shall liue as well without bread as with bread, so it shall be. Or if God in his prouidence haue prouided that a stone shal nourish me as well as bread, then I shall not neede to distrust his goodnesse, or to vse vnlawfull means for my releefe. For, Man liueth not by bread onely, but by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Thirdly, saith the preacher, Bread is not to the wise. One would thinke him but a simple wise man, that can not by

But what came all his wisdome to in the ende? Forsooth at length he was driuen to such shifts, that for want of bread he was faine to eate husks with the hogges.

Wherfore he that thoght himselfe of great vnderstanding before, is here declared to be a foole, and a poore foole also, hauing not so much as his soule left to helpe him.

            <p>Lastly, saith the preacher, Fauour is not to men of knowledge. It seemeth that a man of knowledge and learning should obtaine fauour and acceptance, wheresoeuer he becommeth.

            <p>This doctrine teacheth vs, that if we haue gotten the race, gotten the battel, gotten bread, gotten riches, gotten fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, we should not ascribe these things to our owne sacrifices, to our owne strength, to our owne wisdome, to our owne vnderstanding, to our owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but to the grace of god, and the blessed word proceeding out of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

O Lord, sai's he, I am not worthie of the least, or I am lesser then the least of all thy mercies. He makes no mention of his owne paines and trauailes, though they had beene verie great in that long seruice, but onely of the mercies of God. These were the only cause that his bagge was so full. Wherefore man fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not his bagge by earning wages onely, but by the mercies of God. Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
            <p>This teacheth vs, that whether we sow, or eate, or drinke, or cloath vs, or earne wages, we must do all to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God. And all we doe to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God, when we referre the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of all we doe to God.

And thus much for the second place of Scripture, which is a commentarie vpon this text; Man liueth not by br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ld satisfie fowre thousand, and much lesse, that fiue loaues fiue thousand. But Christ hauing giuen thanks and blessed the bread, did that by the might of the word procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of his mouth, which by the naturall power and condition of the bread could neuer haue beene done. Therefore also he repeateth it, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioneth with his disciples about it. That by their confession and report, all the Church afterwards might beleeue, that God can worke great matters with small meanes, and that Man liueth not by breade onely, but by euerie word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that God can work strong matters with weake meanes. What a strong violent matter is it, to pull the soule of any one sinner out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of hell, and out of the iawes of destruction? yet this God doth. But how doth he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>? This strong matter, howe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:5444:16"/>
doth he worke it? By the weakest means that may be. We haue this treasure, saith the Apostle, in earthen vessels,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 7.</note> that the excellency of that power might be of God, and not of vs. O marueilous words, That the excellencie of that power might be of God, and not of vs. For if Angels were sent to preach vnto vs, it might be thought, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of sinners consisted in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the Angels ministrie, not in the power of Gods word. Now simple and sinneful men, such as our selues are, no better then earthen vessels, bringing such a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>reasure vnto vs, the excellencie of this worke must needs be wholly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to God. And as it is in spirituall foode, so it is in corporall. It is not the teacher, but the doctrine taught: or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not the doctrine barely taught nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>her, but the diuine operation of Gods spirit working with the word which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth the soule. And so it is not the bread onely, but the blessing of Gods grace vpon the bread which sustaineth our li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e. Thus God can worke strong matters with weake meanes; and Man
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:5444:16"/>
liueth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> by breade onely, but by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that God can worke some matters with no meanes. When King Asa sawe himselfe ouerpressed with the<note place="margin">2. Chr. 14. 11.</note> multitude of his enemies, he praied thus to God: O Lord, it is all one with thee, to saue with many, or with no power. If he had said with many, or with a small power, it would haue beene plaine. But with many, or with no power, is verie wonderfull. Or rather it is no wonder a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> all, seeing it is spoken of God, with whome it is a verie ordinarie matter to saue, not onely as well with a small or a weak power, as with a great or a strong power, but also as well with no power, as with some power. It is a good car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, who ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ruert this. For out of that the Apostle saith, Affliction vvorketh glory; they endeauour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:5444:20"/>
that the patience of the Saints, and other their vertues, merit euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting life. But first the word, To worke, is verie generall and signifieth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly causes properly so named, but also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny antecedent, though it be but an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunct or an accident. Againe, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles words elsewhere are these. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wherefore they might haue done well, to chuse some indifferet construction which would haue recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled both these places together, rather then to imbrace such an exposition of the one, as doth iustle, nay quite thrust out the other. S. Bernard doth thus, saying, that good wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are no cause, neither haue any correspondence, or proportion in them in respect of the glorie to come, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle saith, The afflictions of this life are not worthie the glorie that shalbe reueiled. And yet againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the possessing of our soules in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:5444:20"/>
is a way directly tending to the saluation both of our soules and bodies, therefore he saith, The momentarie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

               </gap> surpassing exceeding eternall weight of glorie. To which our Sauiour sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth in these words, The gate is straight, and the way narrowe which leadeth vnto life. This straightnesse therfore and narrownesse of affliction, is not a cause which deserueth, but a gate or a way, which leadeth vnto life. So in an other place we haue, that by many tribulations we must enter into the kingdome of heauen. Not by many tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, no not by any tribulations, we must merit heauen, but by many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations as by a gate or way, we must enter into the kingdome of heauen. And in this sense S. Paul saies, The momentarie lightnesse of our affliction worketh vs a surpassing exceeding eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall waight of glorie.</p>
            <p>But now though this sentence doe not confirme any Popish error, yet it doth excellently comfort any distressed and afflicted. For it exhorteth vs to be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:5444:21"/>
patient in all afflictions, and that for foure reasons. The two first drawn from the nature of our affliction, the two last from the nature of that glory, which shalbe the reward of our affliction. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He saith not that affliction is, but that it seemeth to be. So that affliction see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be one thing, and is indeede an other. It seemeth to be grieuous, it is indeede ioyous: it seemeth to be tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, it is indeede comfortable: it seemeth to be long and tedious, it is indeede momentarie and short.

To teach vs, that affliction and persecution may perhaps tyranize ouer vs three dayes and an halfe, but they shal not fill vp the whole fowre dayes. For the elects sake those<note place="margin">Math. 24. 22.</note> dayes shall be shortened. Agreeably to that which Iohn Baptist begun his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching with, Repent; for the kingdome<note place="margin">Matth. 3. 2.</note> of heauen is at hand. Repent, that's a matter of mortification and affliction to the flesh. For the kindome of heauen is at hand, That's a matter of comfort and ioy. So our Sauiour, Behold I come<note place="margin">Reuel. 22. 12.</note> quickly, and my reward with me: if
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:5444:23"/>
Christ will come quickly, then afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be gone quickly. Thus momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie is our affliction: For our whole life is short, much more then the afflictions of this life: affliction is grieuous but for the present: heauinesse endureth but for a night: persecution lasteth but three dayes and an halfe: the kingdome of heauen is at hand, theresore deliuerance is at hand: Christ will come quickly, therefore affliction will be gone quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Wheresore seeing our affliction is so momentarie, let vs be patient in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: For the momentarie lightnesse of our affliction worketh vs a surpassing exceeding eternall waight of glorie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, our affliction is light. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God setting forth his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, saith, Who hath measured the<note place="margin">Es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Those he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth with his span, which is a longer measure: these with his fist, which is a shorter measure. So that the Lord is as I may say a rhetoritian, verie plentifull

For in the hand of the Lord there<note place="margin">Psal. 75. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Kings children in their minoritie, if they had committed a fault, were not corrected themselues, but onely saw some of meaner birth chastised before them: so God teacheth vs to take heed, rather by other mens, then by our owne harmes.

God laieth vpon vs wood without fire. Now wood without fire, is not greatly dangerous. Or say he lay vpon vs both wood and fire: yet the voice of the Lord deuideth the flame of fire.

All creatures: all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: all the good angels: God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: God the holy Ghost: God the Sonne, who saith, My yoake is easie, and my burden is light.

            <p>Thirdly, our glorie is eternall, yea surpassing eternall. The glorie we looke for, is called a kingdome. Of which the princely Prophet saith thus; Thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<note place="margin">Psal. 145. 13.</note> is an euerlasting kingdome, and thy dominion endureth throughout all ages.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:5444:26"/>
that which is not onely a holy, but also a holy of holies, is the holiest place of all; as that which is not onely a saboth, but also a saboth of saboths, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest rest of all; as that which is not onely a heauen, but also a heauen of heauens, is the highest heauen of all; as that which is not onely a song, but also a song of songs, is the excellentest song of all: so that which is not onely an age, but also an age of ages, and especially, as the Psalmist speaketh, an age of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, is the most infinite eternitie of all.

To both which, the stone and the flower, the Apostle, as I am verily perswaded, alludeth in this place.

Which, as Beda noteth, was insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the crowne round about the Arke of the Testament. For in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle there is neither beginning nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.

Therefore though he seeke to winnovv <hi>Peter</hi> as corne is sifted, yet no daunger; Christ hath praised for <hi>Peter,</hi> that his faith should not faile. Where by the vvay, vve may marke the difference betvveen Christ and the tempter.

            <p>OVr blessed Sauiour Iesus Christ hath his wounds yet to be seene in his bodie for foure causes. First, to approoue his resurrection: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to appease his father: thirdly, to confound his enemies: fourthly, to comfort his friends. After, said he to Thomas, Put thy finger here, and see my hands, and put forth thy hand, and put it into my side, and be not faithlesse,

to enter by him. He sawe a rainebowe round about the throne of God, to teach vs that the throne of God would be altogether a throne of iustice, a throne of wrath, a throne of anger and indignation, were it not that the blood of Christ, spinning out as I may say still liuely and freshly in the sight of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, maketh a rainebowe round about his throne, putteth him in mind of his couenant, appeaseth his displeasure, and<note place="margin">Gen. 30. 37.</note> so maketh his throne to all vs that loue him, a throne of grace, a throne of compassio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a throne of fauour and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in Christ.

One deepe calleth another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the noise of the water pipes. Christs wounds are the watering troughs and the water-pipes, by which all graces flowe vnto vs. So that one deepe calleth an other, because of the noise of the water pipes; because the wounds of Christ make a continuall noise in the eares of his father, and the depth of the extreame miserie which he was in vpon earth, calleth for the depth of Gods bottomlesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinite mercie in heauen. Thus these holy wounds of Christ pacisie and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease his father.

As if our Sauiour should say thus vnto his father, O my louing father, looke vpon the face of thine annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, looke vpon the hands, looke vpon the side of thine annointed. The hands of thine annointed, how cruelly they are mangled, the side of thine annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how wofully it is wounded. Behold and see if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow.

So that if Simeon holding the child in his armes, desired to die, how much more blessedly then might Elias haue departed now in peace, when as beeing wearied with the world, he was shadowed with the tree of life, and not onely held the child in his armes, but also was held himselfe as a child in the wounded and naken armes of Christ.

But yet we shall not alwaies drinke of this fruit of the vine. The time will come, when we shall drinke a new kinde of wine in Christs kingdome. Wherefore he saies, As often as ye shal eate this bread, and drinke this cup, you shall shew the Lords death til he come. Till he come. Declaring hereby, that when he is come, his death shall be shewed an other way. Namely by his wounds, which alwaies he sheweth to his Saints. Euen as vve sing in that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Hymne or Psalme, The humble suit of a sinner; Whose bloody wounds are yet to see, though not with mortall eye, yet doe thy Saints behold them all, and so I trust shall I.

               </gap> also shall we triumph! when we
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:5444:61"/>
shall see Christ in his kingdome, and behold those blessed wounds of his, whereby he hath purchased so many, and so great good things for vs? This is the new wine, which we shall drinke. This is the Eucharist of the Angels: the food of the Elect: the spirituall banket of the Saints. For wheresoeuer the dead bodie is, thither fhall the eagles resort. And we that with eagles wings flie vp by faith into heauen, shall euer resort to this dead bodie, and we shall vnsatiably desite to feede our eyes and our soules with the sight of Christ, who was once dead, and euen now hath in his bodie those skarres which continue the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of his death, that in all eternitie it may neuer be forgotten. Thus these heauenly wounds of Christ delight and comfort his friends. As the cities of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, which saue the sinner: as the holes of the rock, which defend the doue: as the shadow of the iuniper tree, which reuiueth the wearied: as the doore of the Arke, which preserueth the world: as the lure of the soule, which calleth home the Shulamite: as the pot of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,

which nourisheth the Israelite: as the well of Iacob, which refresheth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ealeth the sicke: as the armes of the shepheard, which gather his lambs: as the wings of the eagle, which beare vp her birds. So doe the hands and side of Christ comfort his friends. As if our Sauiour should say thus to euery one of his friends, Can a woman forget her child, and not haue compassion on the son of her wombe? though they should forget, yet would not I forget thee. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I haue grauen thee vpon the palmes of my hands. Here I haue still in my hands that price of thy redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I paid for thee, so that no man can take thee out of my hands. Yea I haue written and sealed thy saluation in my side. A speare is the penne: my blood is the inke: my bodie is the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Here thou maist see the bowels of my compassion, thorough the wounds of my passion. Assure thy selfe therfore, assure thy selse of my loue, of my good will, of my fauour for euer. Make no doubt of it. If thou doubt any thing,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:5444:62"/>
Put thy finger here, and see my hands, and put forth thy hand, and put it into my side, and be not faithlesse, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. So much for the fourth cause, which is to comfort his friends.</p>
            <p>You see then, blessed Christians, you see how these causes of Christs wounds differ one from an other. The first cause, to approoue his resurrection, was, but neither is, nor shall be. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cause, to appease his father, was, and is, but shall not be. The third cause, to confound his enemies, neither was, nor is, but shall be. The fourth cause, to comfort his friends, both was, and is, and shall be. So that Christs wounds, did serue, to approoue his resurrection, onely between his resurrection, and his ascension: doe serue, to appease his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, onely between his ascension, &amp; his second comming: shal serue, to confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his enemies, onely at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: did, doe, and shall serue, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his friends, for euer. Wherefore though we be neuer so great sinners, yet let vs neuer despaire of the grace and mercie of Christ. His hands are still
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:5444:63"/>
stretched out to embrace vs, his side is alwaies open to receiue vs. Therefore let vs creepe low, and come humbly to him, that we may with the woman in the Gospel, touch but the hemme of his garment, nay that we may with S. Iohn, leane vpon his blessed bosome, yea that we may with S. Thomas in this place, put our fingers into his hands, and our hands into his side. And euen as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine the great vsed to kisse that eye of Paphnutius which was boared out in Maximinus time, and the Iayler in the Acts washed S.

To the which we beseech thee, O good Lord to bring vs, not for our owne deserts or merits, but for the tender bowels of Christ Iesus loue and mercie toward vs, to whome with the Father, and the holy Ghost, be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and praise both now and for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Amen.</p>

And so saies our heauenly Captaine and conquerour Iesus Christ, not <hi>Ite,</hi> but <hi>Venite,</hi> Come vnto me all ye that labour, and learne of me, because I am meeke and humble in heart.

kind of instruction both by teaching and by doing, is that two-edged sword, which proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lambe. For tell me I pray you (if it be no trouble to you) tell me, what is the reason thinke you, why so many Preachers in their Churches, so many masters in their families, secke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse abuses, striue against sinnes, and yet preuaile so little, but onely because they fight not with this two-edged sword, but with a backsword. The sword which they fight with all is very sharpe, and cuts deepe on the teaching-side, but it is blunt and hath no edge at all on the doing-side. Wheras if we would fight against vngodlines with this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged sword, both by teaching and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we should soone cut downe sinne in such sort, as it should neuer be able to stand out against vs. Therefore Dauid beeing readie to reforme many things among his people, saies in one of the<note place="margin">Bonitatem &amp; sci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

A thousand hells could not haue more tormented him, then this desperate sorrowe and extreame shame wherewith his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was cloathed, tearing his bowells whilst he was aliue, and powring them out when he died.</p>
            <p>Now as for shame in the world, we reade <note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 4. 5.</note> that God did set a marke vpon Cain the murtherer of iust Habel; and so consequently the ring-leader of all Dauids enemies. Therefore as when men see a wolfe or a foxe, or any such hurtfull beast in the forest, they set all their dogges vpon him; so the enemies of the Lords anoynted, beeing burnt as it were and branded with the markes of shame, are howted and hunted wheresoeuer they goe. One example at this time shall suffice. Maxentius a wicked rebell against his owne Lord the famous Emperour Constantine the great, deuised to haue a bridge made with cock-boats chained together ouer a riuer neere Rome, thinking to traine the Emperour that vvay, and there to

But God so wrought for his chosen seruant, that the enemie himselfe beeing compelled to flie that way, was taken in that pit which he dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for others. And so as Pharaoh was cloathed with shame in the open view and sight of all the world, when he and all his host were drowned in the redde sea, after the same fashion Maxentius was drest.</p>
            <p>Lastly, touching shame in the day of iudgement, Dauids enemies at that day, shall stand before the tribunall seat of Christ, beeing naked in all respects else, but onely couered with their owne shame.

            <p>So that the thing God promiseth is this; that any crowne which king Dauid should get, either by conquest, or by succession, or by any other iust title, should still slourish more and more. Some there are in the world which to be sure of outward ornaments inough, will needes weare a triple crowne. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue beene vnwilling to weare that one which they might. <hi>Canutus,</hi> that was absolute king almost of fiue kingdomes somewhat before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, vpon a time in his progresse ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding neere the Thames, lighted and sat downe besides the shoare. Then, as it were to trie a conclusion, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the water beeing now readie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise againe and to slow, not to come any neerer him. But the water keeping his naturall course, came still vp higher and higher, till it beganne to wette him. Whereupon turning to his Nobles, which were about him, Ye call me (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>aies he) your king and Master, &amp; so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:5444:86"/>
I am; and yet loe yee, I cannot command so much as this little streame, but doe what I can, that will still doe as it list. Whereupon presently he posted to Westminster, and resigned his crown to the crucifixe there; neither could he euer after this be perswaded to weare it any more. Now as the pride of that man of sinne, which sits vnder the signe of the triple crowne, is too intolerable: so on the contrarie part this was too much nicenesse in Canutus. Seeing, it followeth not, because he could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the sea and the waters, as Christ did, that therefore he might not weare a crowne. For, neither doth Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in heauen weare such a crowne, as kings of the earth doe. But the truth is this, that royaltie and maiestie, which is essentiall to God, he is content to communicate to his holy ones, and to his anointed, by participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and grace. Therefore the Lords anointed, which is as it were his fauourite, may verie well doe all these three things at once; weare the crowne which God giueth; and yet detest the pride which God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:5444:86"/>
and still admire the Maiestie, which God enioyeth: So that the Lord promising his seruant Dauid a crowne, promiseth him wealth, wisedome, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, dignitie, prosperitie; in one word, all royalties belonging to a crowne. But vpon himselfe shall his crowne slourish.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he shall haue a flourishing crowne. Flourishing is metaphorically attributed to a crowne. As in the next verse before. There shall I make the horne of Dauid to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lourish. A meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor taken from those goodly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as stagges, and such like; whose chiefest beautie and strengh consisteth in their hornes, especially when they bud and branch abroad. So in these words, But vpon himselfe shall his crowne slourish. A plaine allusion to those slowres which either continually, or els a verie long time, keepe fresh and greene. Besids at the first, kings crowns were not made of gold and pearles, as I told you of Dauids crowne, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of greene oken leaues, as that of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters, or else of some other bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:5444:87"/>
or flowres, as others. The Lord then meaning that Dauids kingdome should be established for euer, and that his lasting glorie should still growe greene, he maketh this louing promise vnto him; But vpon himselfe shall his crowne flourish.

Wherefore you most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and blessed seruants of God, you that excell in vertue, if you haue some enemies, thinke not strange of it. For, if you had nothing in you: no feare of God, no reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce towards his word, no loue and loyaltie towards your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, no fortitude, no temperance, no good thing in you; you might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps walke on long enough, and no man enuie you, no man maligne you, or malice you.

For the holy Ghost saies not, They shall be clothed, or you shall cloth them: but I, euen I shal cloth them with shame. It is impossible, saies he, that you should alwaies be armed at all points, circumspect at all places, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant at all times, prouided at all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to preuent the mischieuous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of your deuillish enemies. No coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of man, no policie, no wisdome, no wit, can foresee all their barbarous vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings and complottes, to escape them. But in heauen, in heauen there is an eye, an hand there is in heauen: an eye to descrie them, and a hand to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secure and punish them: both an eye and an hand to deliuer you from daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and to cloath them with shame. Therefore, saith he, Cast your care vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me: let me alone with them, your perill is my perill, your case my case: Ile pay them that they haue deserued: He take the quarrell into mine owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

How odious? how execrable is their very name vnto vs? what true hearted loyall subiect, such as I am sure all are here, doth not detest them, hate them, loath them, as a toad, or as a viper, or as some hidious mishapen monster; and curse the very day wherein such a rebellious generation, and such a trayterous brood were borne? Certainly, my good brethren, if the mercie of God, which is incomprehensible, did not giue them grace, at the last gaspe to repent and crie to God for pardon: as they are

cloathed with shame in this world, so shall they be much more in the world to come.

            <p>Here are three properties of good ground set downe. All opposite to the three bad grounds mentioned before. First, they that are good ground, heare the word with a good h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rt; contrarie to the ground on the high waies side, which when they haue heard, let the deuill take the word out of their hearts, &amp; so they heare not with a good heart. Secondly, they keepe the word with a verie good heart; contrarie to the stony ground, which for a while receiue the word with ioy, but in time of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they fall away, and so they keepe not the word with a verie good heart. Thirdly, they bringe foorth fruit with patience; contrary to the thornie ground, which after their departure are choaked vvith cares,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:5444:96"/>
and bring no fruit, and so doe not (as it is said here that the good ground doth) bring forth fruit with patience. But that which fell in good ground are they, which with a good, and a very good heart, heare the word, and keepe it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</p>
            <p>The first propertie of the good ground is this, that they heare the word with a good heart. The two dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples going to Emans, when Christ<note place="margin">

O Beloued, nowe you are busied in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word, Christ talketh to you, and you are in the right way to heauen. Therefore that we may heare with a good heart, we must feele in our hearts that burning of which the disciples say; Did not our hearts burne within vs when he talked with vs by the way? For so the Spirituall spouse confesseth of her selfe, My beloued put his hand to the hole of the doore, and my heart was affectioned towards him. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ye honourable children of God, now Christ talketh with vs by the way, therefore let our hearts burne within vs: now Christ putteth his hand to the hole of the doore, therefore let our hearts be affectioned towards him: now our welbeloued speaketh, therefore let our soules melt: now the blessed virgin, yea a greater then the virgin, euen the virgins Sonne, saluteth vs, and wisheth vs all haile out of his word, therefore let the babe spring in our hearts for ioy: now the Almightie vttereth his voice, therefore let our wings fall downe, and let vs wholly submit our selues to be taught of God. Euen as Cornelius the Centurion thought when he heard Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preach, that he stood not before a man, but before the Lord: and Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine the Emperour could neuer satisfie himselfe with reuerent attention of his good heart to the word. Then indeede
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:5444:98"/>
shall we be good ground as all they are which with a good, and a very good heart heare the word, and keepe it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</p>
            <p>The second propertie of the good ground is this, that they keepe the word with a very good heart. In our English<note place="margin">Corde bono &amp; optimo. Vulga.</note> translation it is read thus, with a good and an honest heart. But I follow the vulgar Latin, which readeth thus; With a good and a very good heart. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the good heart to hearing, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good heart to keeping: As if the words stood thus; Which with a good heart, heare the word, and with a very good heart keepe it, and bring forth fruit with patience. To the matter then: It is to no purpose that the seede be sowne, except it be couered in the earth. Neither that the word be heard, except it be kept. Therefore saith the Prophet, In my heart haue I hidde thy<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> word, that I may not sinne against thee. So that to keepe the word with a very good heart, is to hide and couer this holy seede in the fallow grounds of our heart, beeing plowed vp by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </gap>h the heart: there's the light. And that this light goes not out at any time, appeareth by that which is written else-where: O<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> Lord, how doe I loue thy statutes, they are my meditation continually? In the old law those creatures onely were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted cleane, which did chew the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ud. No otherwise shall we be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted vncleane in the sight of God, if we chew not the cud as it were, and ruminate, and meditate of those things which we haue heard out of the word. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as it is not auaileable to eate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the meate be inwardly digested and diuided to all the parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: so hearing is vnprofitable, vnlesse the word heard be kept in minde and memorie, and shewed and set forth in all the parts of our life. Therefore they
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:5444:100"/>
of Berraea were esteemed more noble<note place="margin">Act. 17. 11.</note> then they of Thessalonica, because they after Paul had preached to them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred among themselues, and searched the Scriptures, not onely to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Apostles doctrine were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable by the word, but also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme their owne memorie, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise their meditation in the Law of God. Now then ye holy ones of God, if we would be good ground indeede, as the Patriarch Iacob noted his sonne Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs<note place="margin">Gen. 37. 11.</note> dreames; so let vs not onely heare, but also note the word. For this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the child of God, to haue the law of his God in his heart. Not noted in writing tables, or written in tables of stone, but noted &amp; written in the fleshie tables of the heart. And euen as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly virgin kept all those sayings, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered<note place="margin">Luk. 2. 19.</note> them in her heart, which were by the Shepheards reported and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed abroad concerning her sonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus: in like manner they that are wise vvill heare, nay they vvill ponder and keepe those things vvhich they haue heard, that so they may the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:5444:100"/>
the louing kindnesse of the Lord. Especially seeing those things vvhich vve heare are no dreames, but vnsearchable mysteries of our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: neither are vve that publish and preach them, such shepheards as the Angel spake vnto, but vve are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vvatch ouer the flocke vvhich Christ hath bought vvith his blood. Therefore if you vvould shevv your selues to be good ground, your very good heart must be as a field that hath a treasure hid in it: yea it must be as a treasure it selfe that hath old and nevv things hid in it: it must be as a candle that neuer goes out: and as a cleane creature that neuer leaues chevving the cudde: euen as Iacob noted his sonnes dreames, and the blessed virgin kept the shepheards sayings and pondered them in her heart. For they onely are good ground vvhich vvith a good, and a very good heart, heare the vvord, and keepe it, and bring forth fruit vvith patience.</p>
            <p>The third propertie of the good ground is this, that they bring forth fruit vvith patience. Good ground is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:5444:101"/>

The Prophet Isaiah is willed to lift<note place="margin">Esai. 58. 1.</note> vp his voice like a trumpet. Many things sound lowder then a trumpet, as the sea, the thunder, and such like. Yet he saies not; List vp thy voice as the sea, or lift vp thy voice as the thunder; but lift vp thy voice as a trumpet. Why so? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a trumpeter when he sounds his trumpet, he windes it with his mouth, and holds it vp with his hand. And so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery faithfull heart, which is as it were a spirituall trumpet to sound out the praises of God; must not onely report them with his mouth, but also support them with his hand. And then indeede holding vp the word of life with his hand, and bringing forth the fruit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with patience, he shall lift vp his voice like a trumpet.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:5444:103"/>
vpon this storie; but he that burieth his minde as well in the performance and practise of religion (which is all in all) as in the knowledge and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, he buries Sarah in a double sepulchre. And so must all we doe, which are the true children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. For then with Abraham burying our spirit in a double sepulchre, we shal with Elizeus haue a double spirit. A spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that heareth the word with a verie good heart, and with patience bringeth forth fruite. Neither is this addition (with patience) altogether to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For though a man cannot heare the word without patience, nor keepe the word without patience, yet pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is neuer so requisite, as in bringing forth fruit according to the word which we haue heard, and kept. Wherefore the holy Ghost saith; Ye haue neede of<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 36.</note> patience, that after ye haue done the will of God, ye may receiue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. He saies not, After ye haue heard it with your eare, or kept it with your memorie: but after ye haue done the will of God, and brought forth the fruit

thereof, yee may receiue the promise. For wherefore did not the stonie grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bring forth fruite, but onely for want of patience. They receiued the word with ioy, and seemed to haue verie good hearts for a time: but in time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for want of patience they fell away. Wherefore did not the thorny ground bring forth fruit, but onely for want of patience? After their departure wanting patience to digest their griefes they were choked with cares, and so brought forth no fruit. Therefore as a good field must endure many a cold frost &amp; snow, and hard vveather in the winter time; before it can yeeld a fruitfull croppe in Summer: semblably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For they onely are good ground which with a good, and a verie good heart heare the word, and keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</p>
            <p>To conclude then, It is not greatly needefull to exhort you with a good heart to heare the word. Neuer hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such diligent hearing in the Court, as now a dayes. I dare be bold to say it; All the preachers in England, in verie many yeares by all their exhortations, could neuer haue done halfe so much good in this kind, as the one onely, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and happy example hath done, which we see euery day before our eies.

To teach vs, that we must not labour so much to knowe the word, that we may subtilly dispute or discourse of it, as to practise it that we may shewe the fruite of it in the amendment of our liues. Therefore king Dauid beeing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to redresse diuers things among his people, saith in one of the Psalmes; O Lord, teach me goodnesse, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: knowledge, that I may keepe thy word; and goodnesse that I may shewe the fruit of it. For I am sure, saies he, that al my keeping without fructifying, all my knowledge without goodnesse, is to no purpose. Wherefore, ó Lord, giue me goodnesse and knowledge. But first goodnesse, and then knowledge. Because indeede a little goodnesse, though it be neuer so small, is better then all knowledge, though neuer so great. One handfull of goodnesse is worth an hundred headfulls of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For the feare of the Lord is the beginning of wisedome, a good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing haue all they that doe thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the praise of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

They that haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and doe not thereafter, that is, bring not forth fruit according to it, they haue an ill vnderstanding. But they that haue vnderstanding, and do therafter, &amp; lead their lise according to it, such haue a good vnderstanding. The praise of these shal endure for euer. O how highly shall Christ praise you, how richly shall he reward you, if you haue a conscionable care to expresse his vertues, &amp; to be transformed as it were into the obedience of his word? Then he shall say vnto you; Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdome of heauen. For ye haue not onely heard my word, and kept it as farre as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge goes, but also ye haue practised it, and fructified thereby. I was in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and ye visited me; I was harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and ye lodged me; I was hungry, and ye gaue me meate. These and such other haue beene the good fruites, which haue follovved your hearing and keeping of my word. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He principall scope os the Prophet in this place is to prooue, that the righteousnesse, and so the blessednesse of man, consisteth onely in the free forgiuenes of his sinnes, and gratious imputation of Christs merits. His argument may be framed thus; That which the whole Church and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery godly man therein hath euer espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially praied for in all afflictions and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:5444:108"/>
troubles, that is happinesse: But for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes euery godly man will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ray in time of tribulation: Therefore this is the felicitie of the faithfull. To confirme this reason more fully he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe, first, the circumstances go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the prayer; For this shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that is godly make his prayer vnto thee in a time when thou maist be found. Then, the forme of the prayer it selfe; Thou art a place to hide me in, thou shalt preserue me from trouble, thou shalt compasse me about with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ongs of deliuerance. Lastly, the effect following the prayer; Surely in the flood of many waters they shall not come neere him.</p>
            <p>Prayer is the true sacrifice of faith. The efficacie whereof is briefly, but pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily set downe to the Hebrewes. And I haue spoken els-where somewhat largely of this point. Now but a word onely to make a fit entrance into this sermon. Take it therefore thus. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focts of prayer heretofore haue beene wonderfull. Prayer hath fet down haile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones from heauen, to ouercome fiue
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:5444:109"/>
Kings with their armies. Prayer hath shut vp the windowes of heauen that it should not raine, and againe hath ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them that the earth might giue her encrease. Prayer hath staied the swist course of the sunne, and caused it to go backward fifteene degrees. Prayer hath held Gods hands that he could not strike when he was readie to plague his people. Prayer without any other helpe or meanes hath throwne downe the strong walls of Iericho. Prayer hath deuided the sea, that the floods thereof could not come neere the Israelites. In this place it deliuereth the faithful man from all the dangers of this world. Surely in the flood of many waters they shall not come neere him.</p>
            <p>The summe is this; That no calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this world, no troubles of this life, no terrours of death, no guiltines of sinne, can be so great, but that a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man by meanes of his faith and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie in Christ, shall wade out of them well inough. For howsoeuer other things goe, still he shall haue such a solace in his soule, such a comfort in his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:5444:109"/>
conscience, such a heauen in his heart, knowing himselfe reconciled to God, and iustified by faith, that Surely in the flood of many waters they shall not come neere him.</p>
            <p>Which, that it may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, I shall desire you to obserue two things. The danger: the deliuerance. The danger is in these words; In the flood of many waters. Where the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations that the godly man is subiect to in this life, are likened, First to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: then to many waters: thirdly, to a flood of many waters; In the flood of many waters. The deliuerance is in these words; Surely they shall not come neare him. Where the deliuerance of the godly man hath three degrees also. First they shall not come neare: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly him, they shall not come neare him: then Surely, surely they shall not come neere him. Surely in the flood of many waters, they shall not come neere him.</p>
            <p>First, the asflictions of the faithful are likened to waters. Fire and water haue no mercy we say. But of the two water is
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:5444:110"/>
the worst. For any fire may be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with water, but the force of water, if it begins to be violent, can not by any power of man be resisted. Canutus who was King of England, Scotland, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,<note place="margin">

thrice shipwracke, saies he: night and day haue I bin in the deepe sea. In iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying I was often, in perills of waters in perills of robbers, in perills of mine owne nation, in perills among the Gentiles, in perills in the citie, in perills in the wildernesse, in perills in the sea, in perills among false brethren. Thus we see how many waters the godly man is subiect to in this life. For one ioy he hath at the least two sorowes, if he haue no more: one deepe calleth an other: one wound bringeth another: he hath sorow vpon sorow: perills vpon perills, Many waters: many dangers.

Howbeit seeing many holy Christians, and euen Christ himselfe feared death, it remaineth that death simply and in it selfe considered, is a flood of many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

            <p>First, they shall not come neere. They, that is, The waters shal not come neere. The holy Church and euery member thereof is likened to a house built vpon a rocke.

Therefore faith which is wrackt is not by and by drowned. For it may happen to suffer shipwracke as S. Paul did, and swimme out safe to the shore. But this is but a touch by the way.

He is a house to which the floods may come neere to shake it, but neuer to throvve it downe, he is a ship, which the waues may come neere to tosse it, but neuer to turne it ouer: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as Saint Peter began to sinke, but still kept vp his head: and Saint Paul suffred shippewracke, but was not a haire the worse for it.

But the special thing to be noted in this sentence is, As dying, and Behold we liue. For they import, that death is no death, but As it were death, an image, or a shadowe of death: beeing indeede life, and Surely a better life and more immortall then we had here. Therefore he saies, Behold we liue, to shewe that by death the faithfull liue a life wherein there is some great specialty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency worthy indeed to be beholded &amp; regarded. As if he should say; Behold we liue, Behold we liue a more happy life, then euer we liued in our life. S.

He doth not say, Mine ovvne goodnesse puts me out of feare, but Gods goodnesse.

Wherefore Surely is fitly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For afflictions as vvaters doe not ouercome the faithfull. Nay they come not neere him. But contrariwise the faithfull conquereth afflictions. Yea Surely he is in them all more then a conquerour. In vvarre he is not afraid. Rather he greatly hopeth. And Surely euen in the verie vvarre he hopeth. The flood of vvaters commeth not neere to drovvne the Arke, but lift it vp. And so much the higher Surely the arke still riseth, as the flood riseth. The sea stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Israelites passage. It is a dry land for them to march on. As a vvall moreouer to backe them Surely against all their enemies. Tentation not onely is no matter of sorrovve, but also on the other side of ioy, &amp; Surely of great ioy. Death is no death, but a life, and Surely such a life, as onely of it vve may say, Behold vve liue. So happie both in life and death is the faithfull man; Surely in the flood of many waters, they shall not come neere him.</p>
            <p>To conclude then; No calamitie or aduersitie can possibly disseuer that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:5444:119"/>
coniunction vvhich faith maketh of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery godly man with Christ. For fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the remission of his sinnes assured and sealed vnto him, he contemneth not onely the works of the world, and dismaiments of his conscience, but euen the very feares and terrours of death.

(As his father in law D. Larkyn bad beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour of Phisick siue or sixe and thirty yeares.) Which tongue, howsoeuer some account of it, yet ought to bee preferred before all the rest. For it is the antienst, the shortest, the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:5444:120"/>
plainest of all. A great part of wisdome, as Plato sheweth, is in the knowledge<note place="margin">In Cratylo.</note> of true Etymologies. These in other tongues are vncertaine, in this taken out of the naturall qualities of euery thing that is named. In so much as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any man hath found the Hebrewe Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologie, then he neede seeke no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Besides, all the Scripture written before the birth of Christ, except a fewe chapters of Daniel and Ezra, were written in Hebrewe. And the Rabbins themselues, though they haue no small number of fables and lies in them, yet diuerse things they haue notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fit for the opening of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament. Therefore though a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reade the Rabbins, yet vnlesse he can vnderstand handsomely well the Hebrew text, he is compted but a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or as it were but halfe a Diuine, especially in this learned age. Lastly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse learned men are of opinion, to whome I very willingly assent, that the holy tongue which was spoken in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, shalbe eternally vsed in the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paradise, where the Saints shall euer

Nathan Cytraeus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that in Prage an Vniuersitie of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia, where Iohn Hus and Hicrome of Prage professed, that they that haue continued professours for the space of 20. yeares together, are created Earles and Dukes both together.

Our good brother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no such profit or dignitie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto him, but contenting himselfe with his stipend, spent halfe his life in this place. For he was vpon threescore yeares old when he died. He

wrote a book of Annotations vpon the first fiue small Prophets, dedicated to that great pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wherein diuers speeches and phrases of the Prophets are compared with the like in Poets and Oratours both Greek and Latin, and many notes neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant nor vnprofitable to be read, are set out of the Rabbins. But in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he took greatest pains in his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie, which he dedicated to Doctor Iohn Whitgift the reuerend late Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Canterbury. This booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is full of hidden learning, and sheweth infinite reading in stories. I asked him within this little while, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had written no more bookes.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in how excellently he was imploved, all they can witnes who were ioyned with him in that labour. For though they be
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:5444:121"/>
the very slower of the Vniuersitie for knowledge of the tongues, yet they will not be ashamed to confesse, that no one man of their companie, if not by other respects, yet at leastwise for long experience and exercise in this kind, was to be compared with him. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede he was so desirous that this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes begunne by the commandement of our most gratious Soueraigne King Iames, should be brought to a happie ende, that oftentimes in many mens hearings, he protested he had rather die, then be any way negligent herein. Which as some thinke by all likelihood came indeede so to passe. To wit, that too earnest studie and paines about the translation, hastened his death, and brought it on sooner. Now as he liued so, in his profession, in his writings, in his translating, as though all the floods of many waters had neuer comn' neare him: euen so also he died. During the short time of his sicknes, he caried himselfe, as alwaies before, humbly, mildly, quietly, constantly. One of his louing friends standing by his bed, and

saying; M. Liuely, I pray God you may haue patience, and hope, and especially faith vnto the ende. He lifting vp his hands said heartily and cheerefully, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Little he vsed to speake, and more he could not say, for the paine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment of his squinsey. Which though it made a speedie ende of him, as the apoplexie did of the good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Valentinian, yet how could any death be sodaine to him, whose whole life was nothing els but a meditation of death, and vvhome the Lord whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he came, might finde doing his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:5444:123"/>
vs. Wherefore let vs yet now at the length in the name of God, rowfe vp our selues, and awake out of our dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinnes. Let this that our holy brother did so sodainly in a manner, fall asleepe, be a loud O yes, as it were to awake vs all. Let euery one of vs, amend one, iudge one, accuse one, condemne one, that we be not all condemned of the Lord. Let euery one of vs I beseech you crie vp to heauen for mercie, and say with Dauid, I haue sinned and done wickedly. Or with Ionas; Take me, for I knowe that for my sake this great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest is vpon you. Then our most merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full father shall blesse vs all, as he hath done this holy Saint, both in our life and in our death, by the pardoning of our offences, &amp; couering all our sinnes, with the bowells and blood of Christ. And though in this world we be euer subiect to a flood of many waters, yet he shall drawe vs still out of many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as hee did Moses. Surely in the floode of many waters, no more then they did to Ionas, they shall not come neare vs. Neither
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:5444:124"/>
onely shall we be safe in the flood of death, but also in the flood of the day of iudgement. For that also is a flood, and a terrible fearefull one too. To wit, not of water, but of fire. As it was in the dayes of Noah: so shall it be at the comming of the sonne of man. In the first flood they which had not an arke, ranne vp to the toppes of houses, to the tops of trees, to the toppes of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; because they desired to hold vp their heads aboue the still rising raging water. In the second, they which are not found in Christ, shall say to the mountaines, Fall vpon vs: and to the caues, Couer vs, and hide vs from the wrath of the Lambe. Then they shall be glad to creepe into euery hold and corner, that they may auoide the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of fire. But we that confesse our sinnes, and forsake the fame, shall lift our heads to no other mountain, but tò Christ from whome commeth our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: we shall desire to be couered with no other rocke, but onely with that out of which came the blood and water of life. For neuer did Noahs flood
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:5444:124"/>
so cleane wash away all wicked men from the face of the earth, as the blood of Christ shall purge vs from all our sinnes, and present vs blamelesse before the face of our father, onely if we be faithfull vnto death. For then the next thing is felicitie, and the crowne of life. Which God for his mercie sake graunt vs all, that as we make no doubt, but this our holy brother now trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth with Christ, so all and euery one of vs, after we haue waded through this world as a flood of many waters, may inherit that kingdome of glorie, which our louing Lord Iesus hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased for vs with his deare blood: to whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glorie, now and euermore: Amen.</p>

            <p>The first difference is in these words, <hi>But all we.</hi> In the time of the old testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very fewe did behold the glorie of the Lord. When the law was giuen, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Moses might come vp to the top of the mount, all the people stood below. Which custome continued euen vntill the comming of Christ. For when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense was offred, <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 1. 10.</note> onely Zacharie went into the temple, all the multitude stood without. But suppose more men then Moyses or Zacharie did at that time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glorie of the Lord, yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more nations then the Iewes did not behold it. The Iewes onely were Gods peculiar people. As for the Gentiles they were suffred to walke in their own wayes. The Lord shewed his word vnto Iacob, his statutes and ordinances vnto Israel. He dealt not so with any other nation, neither had the heathen know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his lawe: which likewise conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued euen vntill the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Christ.

to our Sauiour, saying, Haue mercy on me; he answered her, I am not sent but to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel. Yea, not onely he himselfe denied mercie to the Gentils, but also he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his disciples for a time to shewe no mercie vnto them. Goe not into the way of the Gentiles, saies he, <note n="b" place="margin">Mart. 10. 5.</note> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cities of the Samaritans enter ye not. But go rather to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel. So that it was but one man onely among all the people, namely Moses, or Zacharie: or, to take it at the verie highest, it was but one people onely among all nations, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Iewes, or the Israelites, which did in the time of the old testament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glorie of the Lord.</p>

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:5444:141"/>
oyntment powred out. Then the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Saluation, was onely preached in secret places: but now, it is also prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vpon the tops of houses. Then, the old asse only, was brought vnto Christ: but now, the young foale also, is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient vnto him. Then, naturall bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches only, did prosper and slourish: but now, wild branches also, are grafted into the oliue tree. Then, the Queenes onely, did praise the Church: but now, the concubines also, do call her blessed. Then, Israelites only, did build the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle: but now, Sidonians also, doe helpe to build the Temple. Then, they pitched their tents onely in Marah, where was neither fountaine, nor palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree: but now, we pitch in Elim, where there are twelue fountains, and seauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie palme trees. Then, the two kine which carried the Arke, looked onely one way: but now, the twelue oxen which carrie the molten sea, looke eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, East, West, North, and South. Then, Christ was a flower, grovving onely in the little garden of Iudea: but novv, he is a flower, flourishing in the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:5444:141"/>
wide field of <hi>all</hi> the vvorld. Then, Christ was onely a little stone, cut without hands: but now, he is a great huge mountaine, which filleth <hi>all</hi> the earth. Then, the Church of Christ was, as it were, in prison, beeing tied and bound onely to one place: but now, it posteth ouer <hi>all</hi> places riding and triumphing in the chariots of Amminadab. Then, the Church of Christ was only a small graine of mustard-seede, which is lesser then any other seede: but now, it spreadeth abroad as a mightie bigge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ree, wherein <hi>all</hi> the birds of the aire do make their nests. So that, the Church of Christ, now in the time of the new Testament, is like the Samaritans i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ne, which lodgeth <hi>all</hi> passengers. It is like Salomons trou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of hourses, which commeth out of <hi>all</hi> countries. It is like Saint Peters sheete, which infouldeth, <hi>all</hi> sort of beasts. It is like Noahs arke, which receiueth <hi>all</hi> kind of creatures. It is like Saint Iames his net, which cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth <hi>all</hi> sort of fishes. All's fish, that comes to this net. It is like king Assue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus feast, which entertaineth <hi>all</hi> kind of

guests. To this feast <hi>all we,</hi> that wil come, are well-come. Not some fewe Iewes only, <hi>But all we:</hi> euen all we Brittaines, <hi>all we</hi> I say, with open face, behold as in a glasse the glorie of the Lord. This is the first difference, betweene the Law and the Gospel, in these words, <hi>But all we.</hi>
