         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

a Guard of 500. Horse, and according to
his summons, dated the 28. of <hi>Septem.</hi> Prince
<hi>Robert</hi> and the rest of the Nobles, met his
Majesty with their Forces, beeing a great
<pb facs="tcp:58957:3"/>
company of brave gallants, his Majesty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
had a view thereof, commanded them
to depart to their Quarters for that day, and
gave command to Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> and the
rest of the Nobles, that he expected their
attendance the Thursday following, with
all their Force of Horse and Foot, for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
muster, which was consented unto,
and so they departd for that day.</p>
            <p>Vpon Thursday following between 8. and
9. of the Clocke, Prince <hi>Robert</hi> and Prince
<hi>Maurice,</hi> with their Troops of Horse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
about 500. were the first that came
into the field, and Prince <hi>Robert</hi> himselfe
put the Horse in Battalia, and exercised
them at least an houre, before any came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, his Officers standing by all that
time.</p>
            <p>Then the Earle of <hi>Newcastle</hi> was bravely
mounted, and brought with him 300. Horse
and 1500. Foot.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Lindsey</hi> with two hundred
Horse, and one Thousand foot. The Earle

700. Horse, and 4000. foot, the Earle of
<hi>Cumberland</hi> came onely with 250. Horse, a
great number of Horse and foot he hath
more, which lyeth neere <hi>Barwick</hi> upon the
borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but by reason the Heath
beeing his Majesties place of Rendevouz, &amp;
so farre distant from the said Earles forces,
they were excused, the certainty of the Earls
forces we know not, but the report is he
hath two or 3. or 5000. foot besides 800.
Horse, but what number soever he hath, one
halfe whereof are in severall Goals in <hi>York</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,

divers of which were violently rescued

Letters on this day presented to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
the one from Marquesse <hi>Hartford,</hi>
the other from the Lord <hi>Mohone</hi> in <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi>
heereupon there was a great distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
so that they were full two houres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could ranke them in order.</p>

who presented the number of Horse and
Foot then in the Field to his Majesty, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
