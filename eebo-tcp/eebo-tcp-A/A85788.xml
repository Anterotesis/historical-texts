         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S no greater fidility can be preſented to me, then a Loyall Obedience to
your Maieſties Command, ſo no greater unhappineſſe can befall me, then
in conceiving my ſolicitous indeavours to imbecill and invailid, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to incline to myaffections; for my condiſcentious mind is ſo dubiouſly
ballanced, depending on a double Authority, that it is an unexpreſſible diffi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>culty
to my thoughts, how to weigh my reſolution with an unqueſtionable
action. If I ſhould not obey Your Maieſties command in an equitable cauſe,
I might meritoriouſly bee ſuſpended from that place of Honour conferred
on mee, undeſerving to be your Maieſties Subiect, muchleſſe Your Perſona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
Servant, and liable to Your Maieſties diſpleaſure and indignation; yet if
I ſhould obey Your Maieſties command without conſent of Parliament, I
ſhould bee nevertheleſſe liable to the cenſure of Parliament, ſo that in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and ſeverall commands a conformity of Obedience is very difficult. Whereas Your Maieſty hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
true information of great ſums of Money endeavoured to be borrowed of Your City of <hi>London,</hi> by directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
proceeding from both Houſes of Parliament, with additionall perſwaſions to your good ſubiects for the
raiſing of Horſe and furniſhing your Parliament with neceſſary Moneyes, (I Your Maieſties faithfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect)
doe conceive, and dare aſſeverate, that it is intended upon no other pretence then for the Honour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Your Maieſty, together with both Houſes of Parliament, and for the vniverſal ſecurity of Your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
And ſince Your Maieſties manifold Proteſtations taken in the preſence of Almighty God, and by
Your ſeverall Oathes taken by the Faith of a Prince, are ample teſtimonies of Your Maieſties iuſt deſires
for the publike peace, and ſufficient manifeſtations, of your reall intentions, not to levie war againſt your
Parliament, I cannot entertaine ſuch a ſiniſter conceit in my thoughts, that your Maieſtie will violate thoſe
ſeverall Oathes by raiſing any Forces, which conſequently would ruinate the proſperitie of your Maieſties
Kingdome by a Civill Diſcord</p>
            <p>And I am ſo confident on the other ſide, that whatſoever moneys ſhall be collected, or forces levied by your
<hi>Parliament,</hi> they will not derogate any thing from your Maieſties Prerogative, but to the preſervation of
the publike peace, and the advancement both of your Maiiſties Honour, and your Kingdomes happineſſe.</p>
            <p>So that whatſover Mony, Plate, Horſe, Arms ſhall be contributed dy your Maieſties willing and Leyall,
ſubiects of the City of London, being diſpoſed by the prudent diſpenſation of your Parliament,
chieſly to maintaine the Proteſtant Religion, your Maieſtis Authority, and perſon in Royall Dignity the
free courſe of Iuſtice, the Lawes of the Land, the peace of the Kingdome, and Priviledge of Parliament, and
partly to the neceſſary uſe of <hi>Ireland;</hi> as alſo the payment of the Scottiſh ſubiects.</p>
            <p>I hope your Maieſty will take it as an acceptable ſervice at their hands, and not looke upon it as the raiſing
forces againſt your Maieſty, or to be done either in malice, or contempt of your, or of your Authority.</p>
            <p>Thus I, and the ſeverall Companies having herein punctually, obſerved the direction of both Houſes of
<hi>Parliament,</hi> nothing contradictory to Your Maieſties Commands, We hope Your Maieſty ſhall have no
cauſe to proceed againſt the ſeverall Companies, in obeying the Truſt repoſed in them both by Your Maieſtys
Authority, and by both Houſes of <hi>Parliament:</hi> or againſt any particular perſons, either as Contemners or op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſers
of Your Maieſties Commands and Authoritys, or Her Law of the Land; doing nothing, but what Your
<hi>Parliament</hi> wiſdome, Truth, and Equitie have preſcribed unto them, as well for the intended ſafetie of your
Maieſtees perſon, as the ſecuritie of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And that Your Maieſtie ſhall hereby have no iuſt occaſion to be compelled to queſtion the Charter of this
Your City, which as Your Maieſtie is yet willing to believe, ſo You may be confident both in a high and low
degree will continue Loyall to Your Maieſties ſacred Perſon, and Authoritie.</p>
            <p>Theſe ample teſtimonies of my Loyaltie (SIR) I hope will give Your Maieſtie a ſatiſfactorie contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
