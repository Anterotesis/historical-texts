            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

plagues ſhewed on him, ſuffer the poore oppreſſed to depart: but this <hi>Pharao</hi> of Spaine notwithſtanding Gods many fearefull examples ſhewed, will not ſuffer our poore oppreſſed <hi>Belgians</hi> to liue in peace, but ſtill laies more taſkes and paiable duties to the maintaining of his vniuſt wars then <hi>Pharao</hi> did on the children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> for both their goods, wiues, maids, and liues are at the <hi>Spaniards</hi> command, or at leaſtwiſe control, god yet in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy mooue the heart of ſome man to be a <hi>Moſes</hi> to my countrey men, and either by miracles or by the ſworde releaſe them, their wiues, and children from the handes of thoſe wicked and bloudy minded Spaniardes: for their ſhoulders are almoſt broken with bearing the yoke of his oppreſſion.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt the many of Gods fearefull myracles, ſhewed on vs here in England, as ſliding of grounds, remoouing of highwaies, mightie floudes by great abundance of raine, fearefull lightnings and thunders, great fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ſodaine earthquakes, ſtrange and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med children borne, great dearth of corne, mighty plagues and peſtilence, death of many good and godly benefactors, as the late lord Maior for inſtance, much ſtrife in the church by ſectes and ſchiſmes, with fearefull threatnings of the foe of Spaine in his attempts of inuaſion, amongeſt (I ſay) all theſe fearefull warnings ſent vs by God to draw vs to amendment of life, and
<pb facs="tcp:14931:4"/>
to ceaſe from our former wickedneſſe, wherein how wiſſully we tranſgreſſe, let euery one examine their conſcience, and then no doubt but God will ſend the remorce of thoſe conſciences, to draw vs to a newneſſe of life, leſt like Ieruſalem, Sodome and Gomorrha, and many other countries yet freſh in memorie, we feele Gods iudgement when we would repent and amend: if we might ſind time amongſt al theſe tokens of Gods kindled anger beholde one token more, which might mooue vs vpon the knees of our hearts to aſke God forgiueneſſe for our ſinnes, though he had neuer ſent vs other token to affright vs, or mooue vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our ſwearing, drunkenneſſe, whoredome, couetouſnes, and rapes, and murders and ſuch like. For now behold the Lord hath ſent vs no example of nine dayes woonder, as the wicked account all tokens whatſoeuer, but he hath ſent vs a heauy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, an example of affliction, a grieuous and almoſt incredible diſeaſe of ſodaine lameneſſe, beginning, not at the hart nor head, but at the verie toe of the foote, and can by no meanes be cured, for from the toe it goes into the foote, from thence into the leg, and ſo vpwards ſtill, and ſtill as it aſcends higher, the place it leaueth, dieth, and if it once get to the thigh, then no way but death for the party infected, for there is no meanes to cure it but cutting off the legs and armes. Whereſoeuer it beginneth, it be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gins like a tingling, or paine like the gowt, and in foure and twentie houres it wil grow red, and in ſixe houres after, it will be as blacke as a ſhooe, and be ſtone dead, and dies alwaies vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, either in the legs or armes, inſomuch that ſome haue loſt both their legs, others both their armes, being cut off, and yet are liuing, a heauy conſideration, which the vngodly regard not.</p>
            <p>For proofe of what I ſay, becauſe many are incredulous, ther is a man in Weſtminſter named <hi>Hugh Alee,</hi> whoſe ſonne <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Alee</hi> was taken with the ſame diſeaſe, whoſe legge being cut off at the knee was found ſo dead, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re came not aboue two drops of bloud from it, and the diſeaſe is ſo ſtinking, that the ſurgeons are faine to fold mufflers three double about their noſes and mouthes, when they come to dreſſe them. And al this diſeaſe onely raignes within tenne miles of <hi>Worceſter</hi> round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout euery way, and in <hi>Worceſter</hi> it ſelfe, ſo that there are at this day aboue a hundred infected, and almoſt halfe as many are dead already of it, and ſome that looke to it in time, eſcape: it
<pb facs="tcp:14931:4"/>
ſpareth neither men nor women, inſomuch that manie do leaue to ride that way fearing the diſeaſe, whereby the poore countrey is like to be vndone, except that by the praiers of the faithful and godly the Lord be moued to ſtay his hands. But yet it ſeemeth that he doth not only ſhew vs wonders, but hath likewiſe aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned manie men to be hard harted and incredulous of Gods won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the proofe was ſeene in a man of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this ſtrange diſeaſe, ſaid he did not beleue that there could be ſuch a ſodaine diſeaſe: which one hearing, rebuked him, but notwithſtanding he continued in his obſtinat miſdoubt, til a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon carried him from houſe to houſe of the infected, and ſhewed him, in ſome places legs cut off, and in other places armes, and in many places men dead by this diſeaſe: which he ſeeing, as diſpairing, in that he had beene ſo doubtfull, went home vnto his houſe, and in very angui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> died, rauing &amp; crying for Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which many men may take for example, that doe diſtruſt in the omnipotent power of God, thinking their weake iudgement can comprehend Gods many threatning examples. But why do we wonder at his miſbeleefe, when almoſt in euery place men are miſbeleuing &amp; diſpairing, &amp; are giuen to violent ſlaughters? For proofe of which, a man about S. Katherines was found ſo wilful in his own wicked opinion, that he drowned himſelf, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a great weight of lead about his necke, thinking by that meanes neuer to haue bin found: but yet for al his wilful act god caſt him aland, only to ſhew vs that he wil not that man ſhal (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on his own policy) hide any thing from God, for he ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the reines &amp; hart, &amp; knows the very thoughts of al men how iuſt or vniuſt ſoeuer. But for al this we are careleſſe of his heauy plagues and feareful examples, til either in diſpaire or wilfulnes we feele his puniſhments: for now in this age men are only ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying howe to liue and carrie credite in this worlde, thorough worldly riches, which howſoeuer it be gotten they regarde not, be it by murther, oppreſſion, periury, ſlander &amp; vſury: the proofe whereof appeared in a man dwelling in Kent, who went about to build a faire houſe, telling a friend of his hee meant to let it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll when it was finiſhed, &amp; ſaid likewiſe, that he would let it to the poore, not to the rich, making euery chamber a tenement, and then he knew the poore wil take it at ſuch a rate, that of x. pound a yere, if it were all in one, he would make forty almoſt, being
<pb facs="tcp:14931:5"/>
thus in teneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts diuided, &amp; in this determination went forward with his building til it was halfe finiſhed. But ſee how God ſhe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wed his iudgement vpon him, bicauſe he meant to extort vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore: for when he had builded halfe the houſe, his mony grew ſo ſhort that he could proceed no further, whereat many in the coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>try made a great mocking, which at laſt came to his care, in ſo much that going thorow the ſtreets of the towne, many would vnderlook him &amp; ſay, Is this he that wil build houſes to begger the poore? but he lacks mony: Mary ſayes one, and Ile lend him a peny: wherfore anſwers another? mary to buy a rope to hang him in for his good mind. Thus many times he was mockt, til at laſt mooued with bitter anguiſh, and deepely vext in mind, he went greeuing that any ſhould ſee his face any more, and in that houſe which he was building went &amp; hanged himſelfe. And this may ſerue for a warning to many Landlords in theſe daies that do not build houſes as minding thereby to let them the better cheap, but rather to raiſe the rents, to the vtter vndoing of a com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon wealth, &amp; only impoueriſhing to the poore of England, for many nowadaies take in as much ground as to make a hog fly, and when their hog is dead, then they boord the ſtie, and that a poore man and his wife muſt pay viii. d. or xii. d. a week, hauing neither chimny nor chamber, ſuch a one, as when 2 or 3 are ſet togither by a fire made vpon the ground for want of a harth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (I ſay) the houſe is ſo ful that the dog muſt ſtand at the doore, as hauing no rowme in the houſe: which is a lamentable caſe, if it were lookt into, and no doubt makes a great many beggers in a yere, &amp; is beſides a couer of much miſchiefe: for whatſoeuer they be, or howſoeuer they liue, if they pay them their mony wel, they regard not. And in theſe places adulterets, theeues, conſoliers, and ſuch like are daily harboured, which I pray God wiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates may looke into, that it proue not a iuſt plague to this country of England, and bring not remedileſſe hurts to this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed commonwealth, which God in his great mercy defend vs from, and open our eyes to ſee his diſpleaſure kindled againſt vs, and euery man to repent him of his former wicked life, that wee may all with <hi>Abraham</hi> and the bleſſed ones liue in ioy with Chriſt euerlaſtingly.</p>
