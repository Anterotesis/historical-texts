            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Surely they might have underſtood what Scripture ſignifies by all this time of teaching, for writings is not living, nor doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever, but the thing written of doth, that is the Word. Surely by all this teaching they might not have been ſo ignorant of Scripture, which ſaith the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are the Words of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. and my Words ſaith Chriſt, and he that addes to theſe Words ſaith <hi>John,</hi> in the Revelation, or takes from theſe words, the plagues ſhall be added to him, and his name ſhall be deminiſhed out of the Book of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> the laſt. So mark, the Scriptures of truth, which cannot be broken, are the Words of God, and Chriſt his Name is called the Word of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. and they that had a perfect underſtanding from the very firſt, took in hand to ſet forth in order a declaration of thoſe things which they had ſeen and believed from the beginning, who were Miniſters of the Word, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. Surely <hi>Nottingham</hi> Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitioners had they not been mad in their blind zeal, they would not have perſecuted a man for ſpeaking truth according to ſcriptures, who neither regards the Scriptures nor the law of man, who hath contemptuouſly diſobeyed two Warrants; Surely you would be mighty cruel if you had power; Did you never read that the Scriptures ſaith Chriſt is the Word, and the Word is God? Is not he the living Word? and the Word is immortal; are writings immortal? what would ye have done to <hi>John</hi> if he had been under your power, who tels you Chriſts name is the word of God? and tels you, the Revelation is words? What would you have done to <hi>Peter?</hi> who tels you the Word is immortal, and all things are upheld by the Word of his power? And are all things upheld by the Scriptures, is that your Logick? Read <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. And is it not ſaid the Scriptures muſt be fulfilled? and is it not the Living Word, which fulfills the words? And what would you have done to <hi>Luke</hi> that tells you many of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Word took in hand to ſet forth in order a declaration of the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved among them from the very firſt? Nay, doth not ſome of your old Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions call the Scripture a Catologue? and ſome again calls it a ſtory, and yet you call it the Word? how many names have you given it here? it is called Scriptures of truth, holy writings which were learned of God, and given forth by the ſpirit of God, that is according to the ſcriptures which are the words of God; and wil you ſay writings are God, or writings are Chriſt who is called the word? will you ſet the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the room of God, and give them his name? as you may read, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. Have you not loſt your underſtanding? are you not blind that cannot diſtinguiſh writings, weh is Scriptures, from Chriſt, &amp; God, but put them in their place? Surely you are far off from ſpiritual things, while you do not underſtand natural things, have you not read that <hi>John</hi> ſaith in the beginning was the Word, and was writings in the beginning? you want the Word to give you an underſtanding to know a fulfiller, and that which is to be fulfilled; a fulfiller is the Word, and that which is to be fulfilled is the words and outward types and figures and changeable things: So who is in the Word, he is in the unchangable which was in the beginning, in whom the Scriptures end, Chriſt, and the juſt mens ſpirits both; ſo the Word is called the word of Reconciliation, but he doth not call the Scriptures ſo, but the ſcriptures are called a declaration, and in many places called words, which are to be fulfilled and cannot be broken, and this is the cauſe that all Chriſtendom is on heaps about ſcriptures, they wanting the Word that doth fulfill them, to reconcile unto them, and unto God, and unto them that gave them forth; So are not the babes born again by the immortal Seed, the Word of God; but you remain in the mortal, where the jars and ſtrifes are about words, the things of God not being known by natural men.</p>
