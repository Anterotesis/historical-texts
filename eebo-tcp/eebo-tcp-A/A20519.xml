            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>¶ How ſir Thomas Pentley adopted George Dobſon for his ſonne. Chap. 1.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Cittie of <hi>Durham</hi> was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time reſident, one ſir <hi>Thomas Pent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> a Prieſt, inſtituted after the olde order vſed in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, who for his exquiſite ſkil in muſicke, was admitted to be a Canoniſt in the Cathedrall church of <hi>Durham:</hi> and for he was alſo otherwiſe ſuppoſed learned, and a man of modeſt life, he was beneficed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides with the vicarage of Saint <hi>Giles</hi> in the ſame towne: by reaſon whereof he waxed very rich, and a great pennie father, liuing alwayes vnmarried, and kéeping no houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold or retinue about him, ſaue onely one of his ſiſters, whoſe huſband dying, he tooke home to be his huſwife: after that there was a diſſolution made of their Cloyſter, and that it was thought fit for men, rather to liue at their owne choice, than at others appoyntment, graunting all that would, liberty to take wiues, and they whoſe ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke ſtoode againſt that eſtate of matrimony, to diſpoſe
<pb facs="tcp:13960:5"/>
of themſelues as to them ſéemed good and moſt correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to their liking. This ſir <hi>Thomas,</hi> in time, ſéeing his money to increaſe, and his wealth to abound, reſolued with himſelfe, ſince hée was determined neuer to take wife, whereby to haue children, vnto whome he might leaue this his aboundaunce and riches (I ſay) reſolued with himſelfe, to diſpoſe of it in ſome good ſort during his life time, leſt otherwiſe his friends, after his death, ſhould goe together by the eares in diuiding the ſtake. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he beganne, by little and little, to play the good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, cauſing his ſiſter, who was both Cooke and Cater, to prouide him good and plenteous fare, inuiting alſo his neighbours and others his acquaintances to dine and to ſuppe with him: eſpecially vppon ſolempne feaſtes, as Chriſtmaſſe, and Eaſter, he kept open houſe, and gaue good and bounteous entertainement vnto all that would come. And ſo prodigally hée ſpent, as in the end his huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife beganne to repine at his large hoſpitality, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her ſelfe, that if he continued this courſe long, it would be but a very little that would fall in diuidence to his friendes after his death, and therefore ſhée thought euery way as good to take part with him, as to exſpect that which the cat leaueth in the mault. Whereupon ſhe ſent to her other ſiſter dwelling in the country, who was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to one <hi>Ieffrey Dobſon,</hi> certifying her of their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnthriftineſſe, withall, admoniſhing her to make a ſpéedy repaire vnto the cittie, and with her to bring her huſband, children, and family to make their abode, dwelling, and ſtay with ſir <hi>Thomas:</hi> For otherwiſe, if ſhée omitted that opportunitie, it was a very probable matter, that her ſhare of his goods would be very ſlender, and farre ſhort of her exſpectation, for our brother, ſaieth ſhe, is fallen into ſuch an humour of ſpending, that his yéerely reuenewes will ſcarcely diſchardge his yéerely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.
<pb facs="tcp:13960:5"/>
Hir ſiſter at this newes became as pale as aſhes, and ſore ſhe feared that all would be gone before ſhe could get her family remooued to the towne. And as though ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> had béene already dead, and the executors gone away with all the goodes, ſhée ranne to the fields, where her huſband was at the plow, to make knowne vnto him what meſſage her ſiſter had ſent her. The good man who had taken her to wife, more in regarde of that benefit hée hoped to reape by her after ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> his death, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other reſpect, made no leſſe haſte to be remoouing, than ſhe deſired: and ſo foorthwith looſing his oxen foorth of their teame, commaunding his men to goe home and threſh foorth all his corne preſently, and his wife to packe vp all her houſhold ſtuffe and napery againſt the next morning, himſelfe went forth preſently to a neighbours houſe néere by, and let to him the leaſe of his farme: and comming home that night, his wife hauing diſpatched euery thing according to his commandement, he conueyed his ſtuffe, ſo much as he thought néedefull, to the citie of <hi>Durham</hi> next morning, carrying with him his wife and children, whome he brought with him to the vicarage of S. <hi>Giles,</hi> at the very inſtant when ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> was ſet to dinner, but newly come home from the Minſter, where (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his cuſtome, hée had béene helping to ſing diuine Seruice. Whiles ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> was eagerly caruing ſuch meates as were ſet vpon the table, his appetite being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharpe, he ſodainely heard a great ruſhing and noyſe of cartes, rattling vpon the ſtones within the court, and maruelling whence ſuch noyſe ſhould come, if it were not there, and what occaſion any had to be there, he could not coniecture, ſith himſelfe had no vſe for any at all, neither did he know of any that had buſineſſe there to doe, more than halfe miſdoubting his hearing, he ſtarted foorthwith from the table, and looking foorth at his windowe, he did
<pb facs="tcp:13960:6"/>
beholde his court full of cartes, loaden with tables, cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bords, beddes, and ſuch like houſholde ſtuffe, at which ſight he was not alittle amazed, fearing that the Biſhop had endowed ſome other with the benefice of that vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rige, meaning to depriue him, and that the cartes and ſtuffe appeared to be the new parſons: yet he no leſſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled why the Biſhop ſhould ſo do, conſidering that hée no way ill deſerued, either committed any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to incurre the Biſhops diſpleaſure. Alſo, if this his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall were true, hée thought it ſtrange and vncharitable dealing, that hée ſhould in ſuch maner be excluded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either admoniſhment or notice giuen to prouide for himſelfe. But preſently, as he ſtoode there diuerſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, with theſe doubtfull thoughts, he was aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by his houſkéeper, who had inquired the matter of the Carters, that the ſtuffe was his ſiſter <hi>Dobſons,</hi> who with her huſband and children ſhe ſayd, was come to make her remaine and dwelling there with him, and who, as ſhée was making this report, came in at the gate, her huſband and children with her. But ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> not alitle eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at the newes, backened to the Carremen to ſtay the vnloading of their cartes, till he came foorth to méete his ſiſter at the doores, of whome demanding the cauſe of her comming after ſuch a ſort, hée was informed of his houſe kéepers embaſſage ſent to her, wherewith he was verie much offended, cauſing them all to come into the houſe and dine: with good and faire ſpéeches hée intreated her to returne to her owne home againe, with aſſured pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that hée would prouide ſufficiently for her, and the reſidue of his friendes: and for the better ſecurity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, becauſe that imprudently they had leaſed away their Farme, hée preſently gaue to her huſband the moytie of a tithe he held amounting to tenne poundes a yéere, vntil ſuch time as their owne Farme ſhould fall vnto them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
<pb facs="tcp:13960:6"/>
and alſo hée tooke from them their eldeſt ſonne, <hi>George Dobſon,</hi> whome hée adopted for his owne, and brought vppe at Schoole in <hi>Durham,</hi> to whoſe courſe of life and merry ieaſts, wée will direct the tract enſuing, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencing his mother well contented with her brothers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolence, to returne to the countrey againe with her huſband, and other children.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus is <hi>George Dobſon</hi> (as you haue heard) ſent againe to the Schoole, where hée had not long continued but that hée precéeded the moſt part of his fellowes, who long before him had béene ſent thither, to his vnckles great content and pleaſure, who at all times warned him to beware of playing the wagge, and of quarrelling with his fellowes, threatning him, that if hée ſo ill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelfe, hée would for euer eiect and turne him out of the doores, whereas otherwiſe, if as a duetifull boy he would apply his books, and would alſo conforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the diſpoſition of his fellowes, and with them would liue in vnitie and concord, hée ſhould not then want any manner of thing conuenient to his eſtate and calling, but that after his death hée would make him his ſole heire, and poſſeſſe him of all his landes, leaſes, farmes, and hereditaments.

euer ſtanding in doubt, that if hée ſhould committe any thing vnapproouable, that the ſame might come to his vnckles knowledge, and if ſo, he were then for euer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.

               </p>
               <p>Hée muſt néedes goe whome the diuell driueth: and whoſe fortune it is to be ſtrangled, certaine it is hée ſhall neuer drowne: So albeit <hi>George Dobſon</hi> ſtudied by all poſſible meanes to performe all his vnckles pleaſures and commaundements, yet for his life hée could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh them, ſo many blockes were ſet for him to ſtumble vpon, for naturally he was of a crabbed and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward diſpoſition, and ſo ruſtike like, that he could not couer his clowniſh and wayward manners with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite of ciuility, and in regard of his rude and ill fauoured geſtures, antique trickes, and apiſh toyes, his Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes many times tooke occaſion to deride, ſcorne, and laugh at him: whereof hée being very impatient, and not daring with clubbe and fiſt to reuenge it, leſt thereby hée ſhould procure his vnckles indignation, for exceſſiue griefe, anger and ſorrow, he would wrinckle his browes, whet his téeth, and pull the haires from his head, which hée would ſcatter and throw abroad in franticke manner. And if it had not béene more for the feare hée had to looſe his vnckles fauour, than the whipping hee aſſured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would enſue the combate, the moſt part of them had felt the weight of his fiſts. But the reſpect of his vnckles loue and affection mooued him to beare ſo long, vntill his heart was like to breake with diſcontent. The boyes of the Citty playing vppon this aduantage, eſpecially his Schoolefellowes, knowing him to be bred in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb facs="tcp:13960:9"/>
banded themſelues together, made no leſſe to doe about him, than the other birds doe of the Owle at noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, if they catch her abroade in the wooddes; they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no opportunitie to diſgrace him, eyther by rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or railing vpon him, and with euery other deſpite their waggiſh braines could deuiſe, they abuſed him: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times they would forge matters of diſorder, thereby to incenſe their maiſter againſt him, yea and moſt times when themſelues had committed the faultes woorthy of correction, they would thruſt the blame vppon him. And although hée had euer wit enough to diſcharge and cléere himſelfe of their accuſations, by the inference of diuerſe probabilities of the contrary: yet, becauſe they were a multitude, and hée onely one, their teſtimony was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and hée aſſuredly ſuſtained the puniſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fact doone, and their witneſſe improoued him, hée not being able in particular to conuict any of them of the offence. And in the winter éeuenings they enacted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a lewd ſtratageme about the ſhoppes in their way to the Schoole, as burſting glaſen wind<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

And whenſoeuer they were purſued by any of the perſons houſe or family to whome theſe iniuries were done, they hadde decréed that ſome ſhould betake themſelues to flight, as acceſſary and guilty of the treſpaſſe, and that ſome others ſhoulde abide, as nothing conſenting to the act, and willingly ſhould reueale and nominate the parties offending, which whoſoeuer they were, onely <hi>Dobſon</hi> was the man ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, though both innocent and ignorant, yet euer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the next morrowe, the lawe procéeded, the caſe was determined againſt him, and he was found guilty by the generall verdict of the Jury. And to conclude, hee vppon
<pb facs="tcp:13960:10"/>
euery ſuch occaſion ſuffered alwayes the puniſhment that others had deſerued: and theſe centriuings of his felows were ſo continuall, that they made him almoſt wearie of his life, and ſo deſperate in the end, that he became in reſpect thereof, that he reſolued rather than any further to tollerate this miſ-vſage, either to runne his countrey, or to forſake his friendes and their company, eyther to ſet at naught his vnckles iniunctions, and as he coulde catch any of them alone, whoſe malice hée perceiued to be endleſſe againſt him, to pay them their debts in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels name. Long hée reſted doubtfull whether courſe to make choice of, and after much diſcuſſe and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he conceiued, that to relinquiſh his vnckle and other his friendes in ſuch a ſort, were not his beſt booty, for one way hée ſhould thereby depriue himſelfe of all theyr kinde effection, and doe more domage and diſgrace to them all, and his owne good name, than all their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chéeuous deuiſes could be able to effect. Becauſe the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of his departure, ſpreading it ſelfe through all parts of the Towne, would make the people ſuſped him acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of ſome notorious treſpaſſe done againſt his vnckle, and for feare of puniſhment ſo to haue exiled himſelfe: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that his vnckle might be a ſhrewd and curious man, for ſtrictly handling him, and that to auoyde his auſterity and hard vſage, hée had thus put himſelfe to flight, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which conceits hée collected might be preiudiciall to them both. Againe, whither to runne or direct his courſe, he knew not, vnleſſe it were home to his mother, who he was perſwaded would returne him backe with a very vengeaunce. And then (ſaide hée) with what face can I looke vpon my vnckle, or any other perſon of my acquaintance? And to goe to any other place, alas who will entertaine or receiue me, euery ſtraunger will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the trueth, that I am runne from my friendes, and
<pb facs="tcp:13960:10"/>
that therefore I am the more apt to doe the ſame from them, If I ſhall taſte any aſperitie or eagre vſage, this wil be their imagination of me, and heereuppon euery man wil be afraide to admit me into his houſe, and what then will enſue of me? If not, either to ſtarue, begge, or ſteale: ſo that this courſe, vpon theſe conſiderations, hée reiected, as in no caſe to be proſecuted. And for the other, to fall to fiſty cuffes, to giue them as good as they broght, and to pay them home their loane, with vſurie, though his ſtomacke ſerued well thereto, and his deſire to deale his almes amongſt them in ſuch a ſort, was no leſſe than to his dinner, yet he apprehended diuers inconueniences imminent thereupon to enſue, to wit, his Maiſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, which could be no leſſe worth than twenty laſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, at euery time hée ſhould hazard for it, and the enmity of his fellowes, and the worſt that they could doe vnto him beſides he was to exſpect. But both theſe two were in his cut already, and as a man would ſay, predeſtinate vnto him before either coate or ſhert. And therefore ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was his deſtiny, and a thing ineuitable, it was as good to haue ſome play for his money, he thought, as to giue it away <hi>gratis.</hi> But then to curbe this reſolution came to his remembraunce, the loſſe of his vncles good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will and affection, if he ſhould ſo violate his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and doe againſt his owne promiſe: nay, at his vnckles handes hée looked for no better than either vtter eiection, or the ſeuereſt puniſhment he could inflict. What ſhall then poore <hi>Dobſon</hi> determine to doe in the middeſt of ſo many extreames, neuer a one whereof hath any <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium?</hi> Alas poore ſoule ſaith he to himſelfe, and is there no remedy, but either like a patient Aſſe I muſt applie my backe to ſupport all the burdens of my contumelious fellowes ſcornes, deriſions, abuſings, and forgeries, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with my maiſters mercileſſe and vniuſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

and the peoples vndeſerued exclamations, or elſe néedes muſt I take me to my héeles, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo runne away, making my féete woorth twoo paire of handes, and my ſelfe guilty of ſome filthy crime, neuer ſo much as once thought vppon by me: or ſhall I ſtand vnto the matter, and turne againe like a man, and purchaſe my libertie, although with the expence of the deareſt blood in my breath, and perhappes with the loſſe of my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles fauour, who if hée weigh well my cauſe, or could vnderſtand how I am forced thercunto, and that my reuenge is but equall and iuſt, hath no reaſon to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with me for ſuch action. And certainely, of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is my moſt honourable decrée, neyther is hee ſo auſtere, ſterne, or ſcarce of good nature, but that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will perſwade him, and for once I will attempt him: The other courſes are not onely euilles, but ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious, and where all are inconueniences, it is well allowed, that I make choice of the leaſt in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: and heerewith hée ſettled his purpoſe, that the next time they occaſioned him by any of their accuſtomd practiſes, or ſet any new ſnare wherein to catch him, he would hazard to hang ſome of them by the necke, if he could.</p>
               <p>Long it was not before they thus conſulted againſt him: in the Citty neare vnto the gate called Chappell Barre, was dwelling a Haverdaſher, who had a very faire wife, and as it was alſo reported, a merry diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wench, a good companion among Gallants, when ſhe could procure her huſbands abſence, eyther get a goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiping. All the crew of <hi>Venus</hi> attendants hearing tell of her beauty, witle, and good fellowſhip, repayred to hir company, ſupplicating for Loues trophées, and the ſpoyle of her honeſty, whereof (as the rumour went) ſhee was no great niggard, yet amongſt all the number,
<pb facs="tcp:13960:11"/>
ſhée moſt affected a Butcher of the Citty, and her next neighbour, who the more to content her humour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in a Batchellors eſtate, though a man, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage very proper, and much deſired of a multitude of Maides in the cittie, who ſpared not (ſo farre as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty permitted) to ſollicite his loue. But hée reſerued their exſpectations, therewithall to applaude the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of this gallant Dame, and ſhe (as it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally coniectured) vſed him with no leſſe kindeneſſe than her huſband, affoording to him all his deſires as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities ſerued her therevnto: and ſo often as her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had occaſions to abſent himſelfe, by reaſon of his going to Faires and Markets and other like neceſſarie buſineſſe in the Countrey, ſhée would giue intelligence thereof to the Butcher, who neuer failed to ſupply her defect in euery poynt, as if he had beene the Haberda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher: Their familiarity and acquaintance, at the length, grew ſo publike, that euery corner of the Citty was ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the report thereof, and moſt men eſteemed the Haberdaſher frée merchant in Cuckolds rowe: But ſhée ſtanding vpon the Pantophles of her honeſty, thought ſcorne to be tolde that Buckes had hornes, or that Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes were taken open Innes, and therefore, ſo often as ſhe was trodden vppon the toes, as diuers times in quarrels with her neighbours ſhe was let to vnderſtand how the verdite paſſed as concerning her honeſty, ſhee would forſooth perſwade her huſband that it was a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient action to call ſuch perſons before the Chancellor of the Spiritualties, and eyther in the publique Court to prooue what they had ſlaundered her withall, or they failing therein, ſhoulde foorthwith bee conſtrayned to make her lawfull ſatiſfaction for ſo iniurious coſtes and charges.</p>

But alas poore man, he had forgot that the more the durt is ſtirred, the greater ſtinch it yéeldes, and that whereas before he was but ſuſpected to be a cuckold, that now, if it were in their power to prooue it certaine, they would rather doe it, than hazard the penalty of the

               <p>When theſe braue wagges had perfourmed all theſe their deuiſes, for that inſtant they went euery man his way home to bed; on the next morrow, it being ſunday, the Haberdaſher and his family kept their beddes lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than on the wéeke dayes they had béene accuſtomed, not hauing any greater buſineſſe to goe about before fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice time, than onely to make their maiſters apparrell ready, and wearied with ouer-labouring themſelues the wéeke precedent, they ſlept it out till halfe houre paſt ſeauen, all which time the doores being ſhutt, the ſigne of the horne gaue a glorious ſhew to the paſſengers that came by, whereof there was good ſtore that morning, for it was at that inſtant the wéeke wherein the Aſſiſes were holden at <hi>Dunholme,</hi> and the Towne (in regard thereof) was full of ſtrangers: no man paſſed by but hée ſurueighed the ignominy of the poore Haberdaſher, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the verſes vnderſet ſo many as could, others that had no ſkill in letters, got them peruſed by ſuch as could, and as they vnderſtoode the contents, euery man bleſſed his forehead from the Haberdaſher and his hattes, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apace, and making good ſporte at the conceit of the ieaſt. After a while, the laſt come of his apprentices, whoſe cuſtome was to be firſt vp, and to make the fires,
<pb facs="tcp:13960:14"/>
hearing ſuch noiſe and concourſe of people about the ſhop, came haſtily ruſhing to the doores, and vnbolting the ſame, ſet them open, to ſée what the ſtirre might be: but as the doores fell open, hée might eaſily perceiue the cauſe of ſuch aſſembling of the people, and as one diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with this ſodaine aſpect, he ſtoode amongſt them as one who at the ſight of <hi>Gorgons</hi> head had thereby béene tranſformed into a pillar of ſtone: the people laughed a good deale the more at his aſtoniſhment, whereby the poore boyes amazement and ſhame increaſed: but recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting his ſpirits, he paced vp the ſtaires to his maiſters chamber, where he was in bed with his honeſt miſtris, by whoſe carefull indeuour hée was promoted to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the forked knights, whoſe ſcutchion and coate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is the bugle horne. The Haberdaſher nothing leſſe exſpecting, was by his apprentice informed of all what was to be ſéene: at the relation whereof he leaped foorth of his bed, reaching to his ſword, which hung be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him in the chamber, and caſting onely his gowne about him, without any other clothes, hée ranne downe the ſtaires, as a man newly bereft of his wittes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furious and moſt terrible manner aſſaulting the hornes, hée all to batterd and cut them from the doores, and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the ſcrowle, he rent it into péeces: at which ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle the people were ready to die with laughing. But the Haberdaſher hauing got the field, and giuen his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the ouerthrow, not ſo much as bidding his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours good morrow, he returned againe into his houſe, ſo afflicted with ſhame and griefe, as all that day he coulde not acquiet himſelfe, but fared vp and downe like a bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, exclaiming againſt his wife, and accurſing the time wherein he came firſt acquainted with her, thus (by her lewd and naughty carriage) to become the ſcorne of the worlde: but ſhée with gentle and calme ſpéeches
<pb facs="tcp:13960:14"/>
ſought to temper his paſſions, praying him to pardon what was paſt, and ſhee would vow and promiſe for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer héereafter, to liue ſo ſoberly and ſo modeſtly, as hée ſhould thinke himſelfe ſufficiently ſatiſfied for hir former miſdemeanour: and further alſo ſhe perſwaded him not to permitte ſo ſhamefull a diſgrace to paſſe vnreuenged, and therefore ſhée mooued him to charge ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> with the ſame before the Deane and Chapiter of the houſe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him, that they would enforce him vppon his conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience to diſcloſe ſo much as hée knew thereof, for (ſayde ſhe) albeit the boy be very waggiſh, and apt enough to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xecute ſo much knauery as he can bethinke, yet do I not perſwade my ſelfe that he could inuent this, and hang it vp in ſuch a ſort, without the aſſiſtance of ſome more ſuttle braine than his owne, and therefore ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> being accuſed thereof before his maiſters, will eyther confeſſe the ſame vpon their iniunction and commaund, (if he haue béene a factor therein:) or otherwiſe, if he be ignorant, yet ſhall he be vrged (for his owne diſcharge) to conſtraine his nephue to vnfold the truth of the whole matter.</p>
               <p>The poore foole not conſidering that this courſe was ſtill a meane to publiſh and divulge his further infamie, followed his wiues aduice, and waited his time without acquainting ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> of his intent, he repaired to the Deane at ſuch time, when hee and the reſidue of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends were aſſemblsd in their Chapter-houſe, to confer of certaine leaſes to be demiſed, and the reformation of ſome diſorders in the Church-men: hée being admitted into the Chapter houſe, requeſted M.

<pb facs="tcp:13960:15"/>
they would grant him iuſtice againſt ſir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> ſo farre as the equitie of his cauſe might ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, which they promiſed to doe; and ſending for ſir <hi>Thomas,</hi> who immediatly preſented himſelfe, they willed the Habberdaſher to procéed with what hee had to ſay who amply related at large the ſetting vp of the hornes, with the ſcrowles annexed, and the ſhame hee ſuſtained thereby, and adding, he ſayd; ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> this was either properly your own act, or otherwiſe it was done by your direction, for vnto the ſcrole was ſubſcribed the name of your nephew, <hi>George Dobſon:</hi> and therefore good maſter Deane (ſaid he) let ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> be inioyned to ſhewe his purpoſe therein, and to make me amends, or I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine vpon you all to higher powers, who I truſt wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie my caſe, and afford mee law and iuſtice againſt you all, for the neglect of my ſatiſfaction; for you ought to inſtruct ſuch ignorant people (as my ſelfe) not onely by good and wholeſome doctrine, but alſo by the example of a holy and godly life, and it hath not béen heard of in any mans age, that euer any ſuch abuſe hath béen deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by any of the Clergie, as this which hath béene pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized vpon me: and therefore I ſue to you M.

hearing of Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his reply, either M.

Deane) that I could wiſh, you would admit of ſome other ſatiſfaction more to your owne commoditie, and with more ſafe eſcape of your credit. For ſay that ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhould performe all that you deſire, yet if therebe any cauſe of probabilitie, that your wife hath faulted to you, though but in ſuſpect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt your neighbours, yet this action miniſtring oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſtrangers to make inquirie of the matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their acquaintances in the towne, and ſhall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by vnderſtand their cenſures and opinions, it will but make the infamie the more notorious, that he doth it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Iniunction, and feare leſt that if he ſhould refuſe ſo to doe, he ſhould be depriued of his Benefices and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded: others will coniecture, that he doth it the more to notifie your diſgrace, and your wifes ill demeanor, to the ende that ſhe perceiuing her ſhame to be publiſhed, may be forced to correct her carriage; for vnleſſe my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie do faile me, I vnderſtand by the Chancelor of our ſpiritnallties, that too much hath béene proued againſt her. And if ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> then ſhould firſt acknowledge the ſetting vp of the ſaid hornes which ſtuffeth this your ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make, and it can digeſt no better courſe but reuenge, and after that he hath made the ſame acknowledgement, ſhall reply and inferre, that hée hath done no more then
<pb facs="tcp:13960:16"/>
hath béene prooued in open Court, to bée due to ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt dealings, and ſhall alſo adduce the ſame Teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, that were witneſſes againſt her in the Chancery, where will then your amends be had, ſhall not then your matter be worſe then at the beginning?, yea certainely. But howſoeuer, I am very willing that you haue iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and whatſoeuer penaltie the law will impoſe for ſo indigne an action if he cannot cleare himſelfe hée ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide it, but tis conuenientt we put him to his purgation, and heare what anſwere he can make, and turning his face toward ſir <hi>Thomas,</hi> he thus framed his ſpeach.</p>
               <p>I doe not a little meruaile, that you ſir <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſhould ſhew yourſelfe ſo ſcarce of reaſon, or ciuilitie; nay, ſo void of the feare of God and the reſpect of your function, and the good eſtimate of vs all, whoſe credites muſt needs be blemiſhed, if you haue had a hand heerein, or meddled in ſuch irreligious complots, to the vtter defamation of any perſon, with ſuch hazzard of ther liues and ſoules. For if on the ſhame therof they had laid violent hands on them ſelues, deſperately kild ech other, what a horrible ſin had you béene guiltie of and attaint? I grant it is your office, <hi>Vitia improbare, turpitudinem, redarguere, &amp; fratrem peccan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tem admonere:</hi> but it is to be done <hi>Suauiter &amp; ſine amari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudine,</hi> and with <hi>Noahs</hi> bleſſed ſonne we muſt rather take the mantle from our owne backs, to couer therewith our brothers nakedneſſe, then with wicked <hi>Cham,</hi> lay open our fathers ſhame to the view of the world; which if we doe, we are to expect no better reward then was his, to wit, the malediction of our heauenly and celeſtiall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore without inference of many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, if you be giltie I doe charge you vpon your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Prieſt-hood, and the dutie you owe vnto God and our fellowſhip, in a word ſincerely to confeſſe it, and if you be ignorant thereof or not aſſenting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb facs="tcp:13960:16"/>
your oath ſhall ſuffice to ſatiſfie both vs and this honeſt man; and therewith he cauſed a booke to be cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſir <hi>Thomas,</hi> wherevppon he depoſed as followeth: By the contents of this holy Bible, by the loue I owe vnto Almightie God, and by my obedience vnto this place and ſocietie, vpon the integritie of my conſcience, and the honor of my Prieſt-hood: I am innocent of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paticular wherewith this man chargeth me, and this is the firſt time that euer I heard of it. And alſo I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, that if my Nephew haue beene an Agent herein, I ſhall firſt giue him ſuch puniſhment as he hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and after I ſhall exclude and renounce him for euer: and therewith he kiſſed the booke, and ſurrendred it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Whereat good-man Gooſe was cleane quatted, and not able to bring any further proofe, departed a more knowne cuckolde than before, and ſo continued all his life long.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> being alſo diſmiſſed from the Chapter houſe, could not be contented vntill he had further inquired of this matter, and ſo going to the ſchoole, he examined his nephew of the ſame, in the preſence of his maiſter, and the ſchollers, of whome there were diuerſe, which did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence againſt him, both falſely, and vpon malice, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they who were the principall offendors, as a Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Painters ſonnes, who faced him downe, that he beſpoke them to prouide him of the ſignes which were ſet vp, and which they (miſtruſting no ſuch matter) affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him. But hereunto he anſwered with an vndaunted courage, that they iniuriouſly belyed him, and alledged ſo many reaſons as his childiſh braine could propound to improoue their aſſertions, but no reaſon would excuſe him, their teſtimony was alowed, and he ſharpely bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which he not knowing how to auoyde, he tooke pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for the time, yet he proteſted that he was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="tcp:13960:17"/>
innocent, but ignorant of the matter, and reſolued, that ſéeing it was ſo, that it was all one with him, to be a thiefe, and to be but onely ſuſpected, he altered his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as <hi>Ployden</hi> did the Caſe, reuenged his owne iniuries, without reſpect of either his vncles pleaſures, or his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters puniſhments, and ſo that day in their going home to dinner, hée dealt his beneuolence, and payed ſo ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his falſe witneſſes, that he cauſed them to ſing <hi>miſerere,</hi> and before his vncle to confeſſe the trueth of the matter, and their principall intent. Whereof his vncle much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing, and vnderſtanding his innocencie, mooued them to declare the ſame before their maiſter, firſt taking his promiſe to pardon their offence: for (ſaieth hée) their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement ſhal frée them from puniſhment, which their maſter granting, they vnfolded euery circumſtance, which he particularly related againe to maiſter Deane and the prebends, who much commending his nephew, willed ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> to place him at the ſinging ſchoole, and promiſed, that ſo ſoone as he could kéepe any conſort, or beare a part, they would benefice him in the Cathedrall.

There was in the ſchoole one <hi>Raikebanes,</hi> whom <hi>Dobſon</hi> highly loued, and more eſtéemed of, than of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fellowes, both in regard hée was borne in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and alſo for that his manners and conditions were more correſpondent to his humour than any others in that place: This <hi>Raikebaines</hi> one day when hée ſuppoſed that they ſhold haue licence ſo paſtime themſelues in the fields, brought with him to the ſchoole his artillery, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to beſtow that after noone in ſhooting, but his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectations prooued fruſtrate, for their ſuperior Maiſter <hi>Bromeley</hi> was at the ſame inſtant by his acquaintaunce inuited into the towne to a banquet, where he conceiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be longer detained from ſchoole than he could haue wiſhed, referred to the vſher the whole charge thereof, taking with him onely <hi>Debſon,</hi> becauſe hée was a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly diſpoſed gueſt, and apt to incite laughing, as alſo hauing a tunable voyce to aſſiſt him, if his company cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

for a Song, the Vſher ſet in the top of his triumph, to manifeſt his authority, was ſo preciſe, that at no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of gentlemen he would condeſcend to let the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers goe abroad, notwithſtanding diuers of good reſpect made ſute for the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all of whom he ſhakd off with an abſolute deniall; but ſome of them ſcorning to be too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate, either to haue him thinke that they reſpected to reſt beholden to him for ſo ſimple a fauour, ſent to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bromeley</hi> himſelfe, who willingly aſſented to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and diſmiſſed the ſchollers, notwithſtanding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Vſher his repugnancie to the contrary, and albeit that the day was farre gone before they were ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yet <hi>Raikebaines</hi> procured ſome of his beſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances to ſpend ſo much thereof as remained in ſhooting.</p>
               <p>And returning home towards night, in a valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the riuer and the wood, which banketh the riuer all alongſt as it enuironeth the citty, he eſpied M. Vſher at his meditations, whoſe preſence his ſtomacke was not able to digeſt for that hée had ſo peremptorily abridged them of that dayes recreation. And ſo ſpeaking to his companions, by my trueth (ſaith he) I diſcouer a Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke by the water ſide, and I could find in heart to pick his head to the bones, and giue my dogges his fleſh, ſo doe I loue him, I would I were in <hi>France,</hi> vpon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his noſe were of equall ſiſe with a natural woodcocks bill, I ſhould make a commoditie of his picture, I am aſſured, if not of the reall ſubſtance: Well ſir <hi>William,</hi> though I bée not of ſtrength ſufficient to deale with you at handy ſtroakes, and beat wit into your wooden head, yet my heart is good enough to hazzard with you at the ſpeares point: and as <hi>Hercules,</hi> vnable with ſpéede of foot to ouertake the <hi>Centaure,</hi> running away with his faireſt <hi>Deinira,</hi> ſent a meſſenger to ſtay him till his comming; ſo my ſelfe acknowledging my imbecillitie and weakeneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:13960:19"/>
to diſ-inable me to cloſe with you in armes, will neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe fight afarre off, and diſpatch my poſte, by whoſe ſpéedy blaſt, you ſhall be let to vnderſtand how dearly I affect you: and therewithall pulling an arrow from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his girdle, he ſent it with a right good will, to bid ſir <hi>William</hi> good Euenſong, which lighting vppon the ſhirt of his gowne behinde, only feared him without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther harme. But hée turning about, and ſéeing from whence the flight was ſent, ſet himſelfe backe to méete them at the bridge foote, where making inquirie of the matter, the whole caſe was vnfolded and <hi>Rackebains</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted.</p>
               <p>The next morrow he complained to M. <hi>Bromley,</hi> and cauſed poore <hi>lames</hi> to be laſhed, at which <hi>Dobſon</hi> ſtorming made no great exterior ſhewe, yet purpoſed in heart to take a condigne reuenge vpon ſir <hi>William</hi> when opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie ſerued, which he performed within a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as you ſhall heare.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> had a chamber néere to M. Deanes own lodging, and the fore-doore opening into the great yard, (commonly called the Abbey garth, it had alſo a backe doore, by the which he might paſſe through M. Deanes kitchin garden into the Cathedrall, as alſo when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to take the benefite of the ſame, there hee might walke, or exerciſe any other recreation by M. Deanes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, who for that he eſtéemed him a very honeſt yong man, and a painefull in ſchoole matters, authoriſed him to vſe the eaſement thereof: in a corner of this Garden was built a houſe for M. Deane his Poultrie, where hée had alwayes great ſtore féeding for his prouiſion, both Turkies, Capons, Fezants, and other of like ſort. <hi>Dob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> therefore vppon this iniury done to his friend, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually troubled his braine for reuenge, and after aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he ſuppoſed he could no way ſo ſufficiently come
<pb facs="tcp:13960:19"/>
quit with him, as to deuiſe ſome meane whereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him M. Deanes alienation of good will, and loſſe of good liking; being therefore very intimate and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar with the Boy that attended him in his chamber, hée was particularly informed of ſir <hi>Williams</hi> whole courſe and demeanor, and of all the benefits of his lodging. <hi>Dohſon</hi> then thinking that in reſpect ſir <hi>William</hi> onely had acceſſe into this garden, that if he could drawe the boyes aſſent vnto the practiſe of any knauery, either in the gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den or about the Poultrie, that there might be occaſions good enough to ſet maſter Deanes ſtomacke againſt him became ſo entire with the boy as in ſhort ſpace he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to concurre with <hi>Dobſon</hi> for the making vppe of any ieaſt, that might not tend to his own extreame preiudice, and his maiſters vtter infamy. For which <hi>Dobſon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting to regratiate both him, and to haue care of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, lay ſtill in waite, when he might take ſir <hi>William</hi> napping, or fittely effect any thing whereby to worke him ſome notable ſhame; in the winter time when a ſnowe fell, he came to the Chamberlaine deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to affoord him a paire of ſir <hi>William</hi> ſhooes, and that the ſame night when ſir <hi>William</hi> ſhould be aſleepe, that he would ſuffer him to enter the wooddeyard, where (ſaith he) I wil be ſo hardy as to take away one of maſter Deanes fatteſt Turkies, wherewith we will make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and laugh in ſome conuenient place in the towne. O God forbid ſaid the Chamberer, for when the Turkie is wanting they will ſtraight ſuſpect me, becauſe I onely, and my maiſter the Deanes Poulterer excepted, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe into that place, and for my maiſter they know him honeſt enough, neither will they conceiue any iealouſie of him, but preſently they will accuſe and alſo cauſe mée to be puniſhed. Not ſo quoth <hi>Dobſon,</hi> for to preuent them therein I deſire to haue ſir <hi>Williams</hi> ſhooes, that they may
<pb facs="tcp:13960:20"/>
ſée that the print left in the ſnowe is of a mans foote, not of a boyes, which ſight will aſſuredly acquit thée: and knowing ſir <hi>Williams</hi> honeſtie in all former times, they will be brought to that exigent, that they ſhall not know what to doe or ſay: and héereupon they will be enforced to conceale it, leſt if accuſing thy maſter, the blame be thruſt vpon themſelues. The boy loath to diſpleaſe <hi>Dob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> or to hazard his goodwill, condiſcended to his deſires, lent him a paire of his maſters ſhooes, and at his time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed permitted him to haue frée paſſage through the houſe into the woodyard, from whence hée tooke away the fatteſt Turkie to his knowledge, and quietly conueying him by the ſame paſſage, leauing the ſhooes with the boy in the Chamber, hée carried the Turky to be dreſſed in the towne at a Cookes houſe of his acquaintance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hée feaſted ſuch of his friends as he made choice of, laughing to conſider how he intended to blonke ſir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am:</hi> ſo when the morning came he conueyed himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to his vncles chamber, which was alſo in the ſame court, and had one window lighting into the ſame wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, thither he ſecretly conueyed himſelfe to attend the Poulterers comming to ſerue his birdes, who about his ordinary time came to bring them meate, and to ſée if he had all his number, where he miſſed (by the head) the Turky that was ſtollen. This want being extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, amazed him: and hée could not deuiſe how it ſhould come to paſſe, if either ſome weaſell, ſtot, or poulecat had not deuoured her. But then againe he conſidered that ſo little a beaſt could not ſo diſpatch him, but that there would haue béene left ſome remainders; neither could he diſcerne which way any ſuch vermine could haue acceſſe vnto that place. To thinke that he was ſtollen, was but a méere imagination, as he ſuppoſed, ſince there was no way left to théeues, ſo that what to cenſure aright hée
<pb facs="tcp:13960:20"/>
was altogether ignorant.</p>
               <p>But while that he ſtood in this doubt and perplexitie, incertaine what to do or determine vpon, ſuddenly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelfe about, he obſerued in the ſnow the print of a mans foot, which he traced from thence to Sir <hi>Williams</hi> backe doore, where he perceiued the entry of the ſame, and the exit likewiſe, which put him into a greater exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie then before: ſometimes he thought without further queſtion this way hath my Maiſters Turky beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed: and yet I muſe who ſhould do it, for I may bée well aſſured that Sir <hi>William</hi> would not ſo tricke mée for a world of riches, neither hath it beene done by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent either knowledge: for he promiſed to my Maiſter on his credit, that no other but himſelfe only and his boy that euer ſhould come into that place, and then to charge him with ſo foule a fact were great folly, and to my ſelfe it might procure great diſpleaſure. For firſt, if I ſhould obiect this againſt him, neither will my Maſter giue any eare thereto, either beleeue it, ſo highly ſtandeth Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> in his fauour: neither will he for any time hereafter thinke well of me, for broaching ſuch a ſlaunder. And holding this no expedient courſe, before he proceeded any further in the matter, he returned into the kitchin, where he related to the Cookes what had chanced, requeſting them to aduiſe him what to do, who came all forth with him into the wood-yard to ſee how the caſe ſtood, &amp; could as little ſay to the matter as himſelfe: diuers were their verdicts, and they varied all in their opinions: ſome ſti-mulated him to charge Sir <hi>William</hi> with the ſtealth, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wiſhed him to beware what he did: ſome aduiſed him to informe their Maſter, but the moſt part gaue him counſell to let it quietly paſſe, without making further to do about it, and rather to giue diligent attendance to the reſt: alleadging that if it were a ſteaith, ſeeing no ſtirre
<pb facs="tcp:13960:21"/>
to be made concerning this, the théefe would hazard to haue another, when he might be apprehended, and hée onely blamed and puniſhed who had committed the treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe. But while they were thus diuided in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and as it were in mutinies among themſelues, <hi>Dobſon</hi> as though he had been ignorant of the whole caſe looking foorth at his Vnckles chamber window, deſired to know the cauſe of ſuch their debatings, whereof they made a briefe rehearſall. Alas, God helpe you, are you ſo ſimple as to thinke your Maiſters Turky gone by any other meane, then by him the print of whoſe foot you find in the ſnow: nay aſſure your ſelues, that whoſoeuers ſhooe that impreſſion doth fitte, hée is the perſon which hath committed the theft. And I would counſell you to take héed how you charge Sir <hi>William</hi> therewith: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there be probable ſignes that it hath beene conueied thorow his chamber, yet his honeſty and good carriage is of ſuch regard, both with your Maſter, and the whole, as you ſhall incurre great blame by ſuch complaint, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you were able to proue it againſt him, and therein I do ſuppoſe you will find difficulties, for he hath neuer yet béene conuicted of any miſdemeanor, and therefore take good aduiſe before you call him into queſtion. And in my opinion, to frée you of your iealoſie of him, it is the beſt courſe, to borrow one of his ſhooes, by which you may take a ſure trial whether it be he or not: and ſo may you deale with more ſecuritie, both in reſpect of him and your ſelues. This counſell was contenting to them all, and according to good reaſon. Knocking therefore at his chamber doore, he being yet in bed, they mooued his chamberer for one of his ſhooes, who ſuſpecting the cauſe of their requeſt, much againſt his ſtomacke brought to them one of the ſame which <hi>Dobſon</hi> had vſed in the ſtelth: which agreeing equally with the print, they were al both
<pb facs="tcp:13960:21"/>
very ſorrowfull and aſhamed in Sir <hi>Williams</hi> behalfe: but <hi>Dobſon</hi> was not a little ioyfull to ſée his deuiſe take ſuch fortunate effect. The Poulterer, as hee whom it more concerned then the reſt, called vp Sir <hi>William,</hi> and after ſome inuectiue ſpeeches, queſtioned him of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies ſtelth: but he much meruailing why they ſhould ſo ſtrictly taxe him, when they had opened vnto him the likelyhoods, inducing them to charge him, proteſted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the holy Bible, that himſelfe was cléere and innocent of ſuch fellony: and aſſured them further, that neither man nor child had entrance that way by his meanes, or vpon his knowledge: and as for my boy (ſaith he) I dare alſo giue to you my word, that hee neuer commeth in place, but when my ſelfe am preſent; that is, when wée goe and come from ſeruice. But all this would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to excuſe Sir <hi>William, Dobſon</hi> ſo vrged the Poulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to informe Maiſter Deane thereof: for (ſaith he) if you ſhall faile to do it, I will cauſe my vncle to complain of you: for otherwiſe Sir <hi>William</hi> clearing himſelfe in this manner, it may be ſuppoſed, that my vncle or I are acknowne thereof, becauſe our chamber window hath a proſpect into the wood-yard; but by your patience ſir, you ſhall not blocke vs ſo: and therefore as you will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere it when you ſhall heare thereof, it is your faireſt meane to tell firſt, leſt you bée let to vnderſtand the ſame to your diſpleaſure. And thus backed with <hi>Dobſons</hi> threatnings, he acquainted his Maiſter with all as you haue heard. Maiſter Deane inraged againſt Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> ſent for him, and in the preſence of the Prebends exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined him of the ſame, who proteſted as before, that he did not know thereof. Well, (ſaid Maiſter Deane) Sir <hi>William,</hi> we will take your word, and pardon the fault, but yet the probabilitie of the matter maketh vs to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt you; and from henceforth wee will interrupt you
<pb facs="tcp:13960:22"/>
of that walke, and intreat you to take a little more pains and goe about. At which ſentence paſſed, Sir <hi>William</hi> inwardly repined, that the peoples eares ſhould be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with theſe ſuſpitions, and to haue his doores ſhut vp. But howſoeuer it greeued him, he muſt inforce his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and ſo with ſolemne proteſtation of his innocency, for that time he departed home, both ſorrowfull and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dobſon</hi> well pleaſed to haue procured him this drie Bob at Maiſter Deanes hands, was yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not fully ſatiſfied with this reuenge of his friends wrong, but determined yet further, when time ſerued, to pay him all that he had promiſed, ſcorning to dye in his debt: and therefore continuing ſtil friendly with his Chamberlaine, he vnderſtood that Sir <hi>William</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a wife, a Marchants daughter in the Towne, a pretty fiſgig girle, and who to humor Sir <hi>William,</hi> would many times repaire to his chamber, eſpecially in the winter euenings, when the neighbours could not ſo wel obſerue her walkes as at other times when the dayes were longer, and the euenings more lightſome: Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe would kéepe him company all the night, vntill fiue of the clocke in the morning, at which houre ſhe commonly departed, that ſhe might be at home before her father was vp &amp; came abroad forth of his chamber, who knew nothing of her vagaries which her mother permitted, vpon the confident truſt ſhe had in Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> his honeſt vſage of her, who had moued her huſband and her ſelfe in the matter, crauing their fauourable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, of whom they conceiued a ſingular good liking, and deſired to accompliſh the match with him, conditionally that Maiſter Deane would aſſure him his place by pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent during his life, but thereof he was quite hopeleſſe in reſpect of his late accident, and dared not to make ſuit for
<pb facs="tcp:13960:22"/>
it; and thereuppon they deferred to giue their conſents, eſpecially the merchant himſelfe, but the maide being much affected toward him, and longing to be a miſtris in the Abbey, frequented his company as before is ſaid: whereof <hi>Dobſon</hi> being perfitely inſtructed by the chambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, laboured his wittes, without intermiſſion, how to gall ſir <hi>Williams</hi> delicates with ſome bitter ſirrope of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: and hauing a nimble head and working braine, he thus effected his drift, hée learned of the boy what night they had appointed for their next méeting at his maiſters chamber, which the boy diſcouered vnto him: but whie deſireſt thou to know, ſaid he, fearing ſome ſuch pretence as before he had drawne him vnto? O nothing ſaid <hi>Dob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> but if then thou couldſt be abſent, I ſhould be gladde to haue thy company at the ſigne of the Foare, where I haue ſet downe that night to meete certaine Gentlemen of the countrey, to whome I haue promiſed a ſong, and a ſet of muſicke, and I ſhall thinke my ſelfe much in thy debt if thou wilt be there to ſing the Meane amongſt vs, which if thou ſhalt doe, the leaſt parte of their liberalitie ſhall not be thine.</p>
               <p>Say no more (ſayd the boy) for if miſtris <hi>Iane</hi> hold her appoyntment, and lodge with my maiſter all the night, ſo ſoone as they are gone to bed, I will not faile to be one among you, but if they ſit vp all night, then I cannot be away, for that I muſt be ſent into the towne for wine, or ſome other conceit, as they ſhall thinke good. Why then ſaide <hi>Dobſon,</hi> this is all that we may reſolue, that if ſhe come according to promiſe, and occaſion ſerue that thou mayeſt preſent thy ſelfe with vs, then we ſhall haue thy company; and if otherwiſe, thou ſhalt certifie me, to the end that we may prouide another to ſupply thy want: Thereof be you aſſured ſaide the boy, and make no doubt: that ſufficeth, quoth <hi>Dobſon,</hi> and ſo farewell. The boy
<pb facs="tcp:13960:23"/>
tooke his direct courſe to his miſtris chamber, and <hi>Dobſon</hi> his to certaine of his déereſt friends, whom hée deſired to affoord him their aſſiſtance in the ſtealing of a Diere the next tueſday enſuing, for ſaith he, a kinſwoman of mine in the country who longeth for veniſon, hath ſent to mée to prouide her. I haue both intreated for her, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red money, but cannot procure her a ſimple fée, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſhe ſhall receiue harme for the want thereof, I will hazard to fetch one foorth of Beares parke, ſo I may intreate your good helpes. And if Fortune fauour our attempts, looke what ſhall be more than to ſtay her long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhall be at your owne diſpoſing, neither ſhall you feare any inconuenience to come thereof: for if that our chaunce ſhould be ſo euill as to be taken, I truſt well that my vnckle will worke our attonement with Maiſter Deane, and ſet vs frée from puniſhment, and in reſpect of that fauor I ſhall reſt wholy yours at all times to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you. <hi>Dobſons</hi> reputation was ſuch amongſt the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualieroes in the citty, that he could not ſo eaſily requeſt, as they aſſent to effect his deſires, aſſuring that to do him anie pleaſure, they were all at all times ready to abide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny penalty of the law, without exſpectation of fauour, or forbearaunce: for he ſaide, he who will ſtand foorth to help his friends neceſſity for any feare, is not worthy the name of a good fellow, and therefore make choice of your time, and we wil not be wanting to goe with you, which they performed according to his aſſignement. And by the helpe of their greyhounds, they quickely had killed their game, and truſſing her vpon a horſe, they brought her ſafely away, the Kéepers that night neglecting their watch. <hi>Dobſon</hi> directed them to an Inne in the towne, where he deſired them to attend his comming, which ſhould be within an houre after. And when he once ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them to be ſafe in the houſe, hée went to the Kéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb facs="tcp:13960:23"/>
Lodge in the Parke, willing them to riſe, for this night, ſaieth hée, one of your diere is ſlaine and carried hence, as I coniecture, for comming this éeuening to my vncle <hi>Pharaoes,</hi> I mette her vpon the ſhoulders of foure good fellowes, and (to my iudgement) ſhe is carried to ſir <hi>Williams</hi> chamber, the vſher of the ſinging ſchoole, ſo that if your ſelfe did not beſtow her vpon him, I beléeue that there you ſhal find both hir and the parties that haue committed the ſlaughter; for among them I could perfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerne ſir <hi>William,</hi> and his brother <hi>Robert:</hi> what the other were I could not ſo well obſerue, for they ſhunned my way a little, and my ſelfe was loath to be eſpied of them: and therefore now that I haue diſcharged my loue and duety to maiſter Deane, and my good will to you: deale you herein as reaſon and the cauſe requireth, and herewith he departed poſting after his companions as he could, vntill hée came to the Inne, where hée had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to ſtay, and ſir <hi>Williams</hi> boy to méete him, who had continued there the moſt parte of the night to attend his comming. <hi>Dobſon</hi> commaunding the cookes to make ready the veniſon, taking his companion aſide, aſked him if miſtris <hi>Iane</hi> were with ſir <hi>William</hi> or not: yea and by this aſléepe betwixt his armes: and ſo let her be, quoth <hi>Dobſon,</hi> we ſhall fare the better for their ſakes, God ſend them ioy at their ariſing, and ſo going into the company againe, they fell to ſporting vntill the veniſon was made ready.</p>
               <p>The kéeper of Beareſparke much mooued at <hi>Dobſons</hi> relation, without further delayes leapt from his bed, and hauing put vppon him his apparrell, away he paſed to <hi>Dunholme</hi> in haſte, neuer ſo much as breathing till hée came to the Deanes lodging, where knocking at the gates, hée commaunded the Porter to let him in, for he had ſerious matters to deliuer to his maiſter, and that
<pb facs="tcp:13960:24"/>

for I perceiue, that further to forbeare him, is but to ſtimulate and egge him forwards to all other fortes of diſorder.

yet a ſcholler: neither did at chiue any ſmall commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for his practiſe againſt Sir <hi>William.</hi> But before this he had plotted diuers others in the ſchools amongſt his fellowes, whereof one was this: <hi>Rakebaines</hi> (of whom before we haue ſpoken) was borne in the countrey ſixe miles diſtant from <hi>Dunhoime,</hi> whither he was ſent to the ſchoole, to be inſtructed in good letters, and ſundry good manners ſitting his eſtate and parentage. He was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a ſiſter of his mothers married to a Lawyer in the Citie, who had alſo a ſonne which daily did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him to the ſchoole, as very a wagge as the beſt, yet he alwaies more ſmoothly carried his knaueries then <hi>Rakebaines</hi> did; neuer putting his hand to any action, but when he was aſſured of another betwixt him &amp; the halter. This <hi>Raikebains</hi> father being a gentleman of good port and great hoſpitalitie, kept continually a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and bountifull houſe; and toward Chriſtmas time he killed euery yeare great ſtore of beaſts.

So it happened his coſin to be ſicke, <hi>Raikebaines</hi> was to goe to ſchoole alone; he thought it better to carry his breakefaſt with him, then to trouble himſelfe to come ſo farre for it.

They, ſo ſoone as they were within, begaune to lay agood amongſt the Apple trées, making a great ruſhing and noyſe, of purpoſe: the kéepers came to know their intents, and to bring them before ſir <hi>Thomas,</hi> but the conflict was vnequall, for they were fire againſt twoo: yet being ſturdy fellowes, of a good ſtomacke, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the iuſtneſſe of their quarrell, encountred them
<pb facs="tcp:13960:30"/>
all very luſtily, vntill the one of them was beaten downe to the ground, and the other being ouermatched, fledde into the Vicarage, and tolde ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> how the caſe did ſtand. At the hearing whereof, hée aroſe in great haſte, calling vp alſo his houſe-kéeper, willing her to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him with the broach, and to kill the firſt with whom ſhée incountred: for, ſaith he, this nights worke ſhall bée memorable in Dunholme, while there is one ſtone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſtanding. And fearing leſt he ſhould not be well hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with blowes, caſting his gowne looſely about his ſhoulders, foorth hée marched, and the olde beldame his ſiſter with a broach, and the kéeper of the Orchard with a portigan. But while ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> was making himſelfe ready for the fight within, the théeues had chained the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fellow whome before they had beaten downe, and alſo had gagged him ſo well, that he could not cry, and were exſpecting cloſe by the doores, when ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> wold ſally foorth, they tripped his héeles at vnawares, béeing néerer at hand than hée looked for, and muffled him in his gowne, vntill they had made him ready for the ſacke: Then taking his gowne they put it vppon his ſiſter, and tying her handes behinde her, they ſet her vpon the woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den horſe, as <hi>Dobſon</hi> had preſcribed, and bound her téete vnder his belly, which doone, they girde her about with the painted ſword and dagger, ſetting vpon hir head a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hatte with a buſh of peacocke feathers eaualiere like, ready to chalenge euery man to the combate, and in this gniſe they placed her vnder a peare ſrée. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> did they thruſt into a ſacke, and by his nephews aduiſe, who fearing that ſo long hanging by the héetes, as til the next morrow, might procure him ſome infirmity, they reared him into the ſame peare trée aboue his ſiſter, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him a chaire of eſtate of the boughes, they bound in the one haud the diſtaffe, and in his other, a ſkimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
<pb facs="tcp:13960:30"/>
ſpreading his armes, they faſtned him by the wreſts vnto the braunches that were next him. While ſome of them were thus in hand with ſir <hi>Thomas,</hi> and his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, the other tooke the twowarders, and bound and gagged them as is aforeſaide: they faſtned their handes about a appletrée, turning their hoſe down beneath their knées, ſo as their buttocks were ſet naked to the trée, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to the truncke below. Beſides the gagges, they putte into either of their mouthes, a bunch of Maie, and a pricking Thorne: and before them they heaped a bundle of bauine, and other drie wood in forme of a fire, and the broach hung full of apples as it were to be roſted. Then taking ſo much fruit as them liked, they departed home, leauing ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> and his ſeruitours to kéepe the watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dobſon</hi> very timely in the morning repaired to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carage, and knowing his vncles neceſſitie, hée paſſed thorow the houſe into the orchard, to take a view of his deuiſes: and when he came vnto the peare trée wherein his vncle was inthronized, he called vppe to him, in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull manner wringing his handes, and as it would be, wreſted foorth ſome ſmall number of teares. But his vncle ſate as a man who had periſht the vſe of his tong, for ſpeake he could not, in regarde of his gagge, neyther could he mooue, or make any ſigne, they had ſo ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all his ioynts.

The people vpon his outery flocked in heapes into the orchard, to ſée what the matter was, much lamenting ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> his euill chaunce, the rather, for that it was done ſo priuately, as that they had no intelligence, either to haue preuented, or to haue redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his wrongs.

His Awnt was ſicke for a tweluemoneth after: But the two yong fellowes whoſe ſpirites were more quicke and liuely, after they had bin ſet before the fire, and lapped well in warme clothes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to recouer themſelues. And as they perceiued their tongues able to mooue, they vnfolded all the caſe as if came to paſſe. The neighbours very penſiue for their Curates miſchaunce, diligently attended about him, till hée was able to doe for himſelfe. And <hi>Dobſon</hi> ſent for his mother, to take charge of the houſe, during the time of his infirmity. But ſir <hi>Thomas,</hi> whether that he merrily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,

No, (ſaid his ſiſter) did not you ſend our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to me yeſterday, with commandement to broach it, and to ſend you a tankard of the ſame to the Church? neuer I (quoth ſir <hi>Thomas</hi>) in all my life: why then (ſaid ſhe) he hath deceiued me, for ſuch meſſage hee brought, and I truſted him and let him to take what he would; for he aſſured me, that it was for your ſelfe, and your friends with you. <hi>Dobſon</hi> hearing this ſedule of his Aunt, ſtole foorth into a place where the Hens ſit vpon a fleake, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he aſcended, pulling vp the ladder after him, that no man could come to him but by his permiſſion: his Vncle vpon this relation of his ſiſter, called and ſought for <hi>Dob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in euery corner of the houſe, but hée would make no anſwere; vntill at the laſt ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> hearing a ruſhing vpon the fleake, eſpied his cock ſitting amongſt his hens: and after he had thundred foorth ſome threatning ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he commanded him to diſcend, not ſo (good Vncle, ſaith he) vnleſſe you will firſt ſweare that you will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, I telling you the truth of the matter, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, rather than I will ſuſtaine your rigorous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will throw my ſelfe head-long from hence, and will take it vpon my death, that the very feare of your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie hath vrged me ſo to doe, anſwere you the lawe as you can. The neighbors intreated ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> to remit to him that fault, and to be pacified, offering all to paſſe their words, that he ſhould neuer more in ſuch ſort offend him: he afraid that the violent fellow would do himſelfe ſome iniurie, at their important ſuites pardoned him, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that he would bewray the truth, which hée did, and came downe from the fleake, and to make his Vncle, ſome kind of ſatiſfaction, he went into the towne

But <hi>Dobſon</hi> to remedie this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, enrolled his vncles name in the Drapers booke, for a ſute and a cloake, which his vncle was conſtrained to diſcharge for his credite ſake. But to preuent him of that meane, he went thorow the Citty amongeſt all the Clothiers and Millioners, warning them no further to credite him, vnleſſe hee bought it with ready mony, the which he ſhall alwayes haue, if he be ſent from me: and whoſoeuer ſhall let him haue any vpon credite, muſt be glad to ſtand to his owne perill, for ile not be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for any halfe-penny thereof from hence forward.

The marchants thereupon would no more regiſter <hi>Dob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> name, not ſo much as for a paire of garters, which putte him (poore man) into great diſcontent, and what ſhift to make for garments, when theſe were gone, hée could not deuiſe: to aſke for any of his vncle hée dared not, and hée was debarred of his former proiect, by the which he ſuppoſed to haue euer, as he had néeded, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that indigence. He muſt then take ſome other courſe, and for once hée fell to ſtealing, taking away a ſong made by one of his fellowes, which for the exquiſite muſicke therein ſhewed, was highly commended of the whole Quéere. This he purloyning carried into the Country to his vncle <hi>Pharoes</hi> houle, who had diuers ſonnes and daughters that could ſing, of whoſe knowledge in that Arre his vncle was not a little prowd. <hi>Dobſon</hi> therefore to applaud his vncles humor, preſented him this Song, telling him how himſelfe had made the ſame: and he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was well liked of, and allowed for good conſort, that hée thought it no where better beſtowed than vppon my cooſins your daughters. Maiſter <hi>Pharoe</hi> thanked him, and promiſed to recompence his good will: But firſt hée called his daughters to ſing it ouer, who with their ſwéete and tuneable voyces much mooued their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers affection; themſelues alſo were ſo much in loue with the deſcant, that they requeſted onely to haue it ſet in their bookes: but <hi>Dobſon</hi> more liberall then they looked to haue found him, fréely beſtowed it among them, with this applauſe; Good cooſins, if this be pleaſing vnto you, I will affoord you héereafter more plenty of better ſtuffe, this is but the ſimple inuention of my owne rude braine, and not worthy of halfe this commendation: but ſuch as it is, yours it is with all my heart, and I thinke my ſelfe in your debt for your kinde acceptance thereof. His cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins thanked him againe, and beſéeched their father to

He to ſatiſfie <hi>Dobſons</hi> exſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, and to gratifie his daughters requeſt, clothed his kinſman <hi>Dobſon</hi> in a new ſuite, whereof hée being hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily glad, didde profeſſe to his vncle and cooſins to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at their commaund and ſeruice, and ſo returned to Dunholme in that caſe, where hée kept as much ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering as before.</p>
               <p>His vncle ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> maruelled whence he had ſuch a gallant ſute, and who had beene ſo liberall toward him, deſired to be informed. It is no matter, ſaide <hi>Dobſon,</hi> (good vncle) ſince that now I haue them, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture that I haue compaſſed them by my wittes, and if you thinke I haue not got them by begging, imagine they are ſtolne. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> thinking it fitte no further to vrge him, ſuffered the matter to paſſe without anie further queſtion.

and obſeruing a certaine order therein, it paſſed quite thorow the whole number of ſchollers euery halfe yeare.

When hée came into the towne, hée aſked where he might haue ſame victuals ſor himſelfe and his men: An Alehouſe was preſently ſhewed vnto him, into which he entred, called to the goodwife to make a breakefaſt ready for him and his men: ſhée demaunded what it would pleaſe his good Worſhippe to haue prepared: He anſwered, that he would haue ſome new cakes, creame, butter, and ſuch other things as ſhe could affoord: all which ſhe ſet vpon the table before him incontinent. Maſter Chauncellors ſonne and his men fell to their victuals afreſh, their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes were pretty good, and they quickly made rid of this prouiſion, and aſked their Hoſteſſe what they had to pay: two pence a man (ſaid ſhe) and your Worſhip is hartily welcome. Alas good woman, that is but ſixe pence in the whole: No more, and it pleaſe your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will I haue at this time for ſo ſlender fare (ſaid the good wife:) Why then (ſaid Maſter <hi>Dobſon</hi>) turne the cloath againe, we will make her amends: ſo hée called for more Ale, which ſhe brought of a nut browne colour, as good as needed to be drunke, with great ſtore of new cakes, creame, and cuſtard, chéeſe alſo with apples and nuts, ſhe placed on the table againe: of all which they tooke ſo much as they thought good, and willed her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the reſidue: then they deſired againe to know their ſhot for altogether: ſhe told them, that for the whole they muſt pay twenty pence. What, ſaid Maſter <hi>Dobſon,</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing but thrée pence to defray all) was it now but ſixe
<pb facs="tcp:13960:39"/>
pence, and wilt thou make this laſt, being much worſe, trebble the firſt? Nay gogs heart, I will teach thée a tricke for that. Good ſir (ſaid the woman) I cannot well haue leſſe, if I ſhould be a ſauer by you, and I truſt you do not wiſh my loſſe. No (ſaith Maiſter <hi>Dobſen</hi>) neither yet ſhalt thou make a foole of me and ſo couſin mée. But I pray tell me one thing, haue you a licence to keepe an alehouſe? Yea ſir that I haue, and vnder maſter chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours owne hand and ſeale: Why and he is my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaide M. <hi>Dobſon:</hi> but ſéeing thou haſt no better a conſcience than thus to extort men, I will haue it diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and therefore I doe charge thée, as thou wilt anſwer the contrary, at thy perill, that vppon Friday next thou make thy apparance before my father in the Chauncery, where I will ſée how thou canſt anſwer this irreligious dealing, and alſo haue thy licence ſurueyed, that if there can be any aduantage at all taken thereat, I will haue it defaced, and thy ſelfe puniſhed, as thou dooſt deſerue. The poore woman ſtarued with feare vppon this hard ſentence pronounced, fell proſtrate at his feete, beſéeching him to pardon her, for that ſhee had not vſed him as his worſhipfull calling required: but the fault was in her ignorance of his perſon and woorth. She al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo prayed him to be fauourable vnto her, and to take compaſſion of her miſerable eſtate, for ſhee was mother of fiue ſmall children, and had not where with all for to maintaine them, beſides that poore trade, and her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes handy labour, and for that ſhotte ſhée was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with all her very heart to remitte it, and that hée ſhould commaund, not onely then, but at all other times, whatſoeuer was within her poore houſe that in any reſpect might doe him pleaſure. Well (ſaicty hée) I ſcorne to offer iniurie, to either thée, or to any of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours: but, as I will not harme them, ſo they ſhall

not abuſe me. And as for the ſhot I will defray it euerie farthing: but faile not thou to come before my father, as I haue preſcribed, when I will haue you better inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted what appertaineth to your trade, than I coniecture you doe vnderſtand. And ſo goe fill your ſhotte pot, and you ſhall haue your money. The goodwife quaking eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bone, went to her caller for more ale, but in the meane time Maiſter Chauncellours ſonne leauing onely thrée pence vpon the Table for the whole diſcharge, conueyed himſelfe and his men forth of the houſe, and cloſely ſtole into the woods, where euery man loading himſelfe with burch, in the éeuening they returned to the citty by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and priuate paſſage. The goodwife, after they were gone, was forced to content her ſelfe with what they had left, not knowing how to recouer the reſidue: and carefull ſhée remained all the wéeke after, for her appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce to be made before Maſter Chauncellour. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to her huſband at night what accident ſhée had that morning, his feare was double hers, and hée chafed and chid her apace, and had wel-nie beaten her, for demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo much, and for that ſhée had no better reſpected him: for now (ſaith he) haſt thou, through thy couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vndone vs all for euer: for if thy licence be taken from thée, as by likelihoode it muſt néedes, we may all goe begge, and ſo daunted was hée with the newes that hée could not tell how to aduiſe her. But going to the Church the morrow after, he aſked Maiſter Vicar and all his neighbours counſell, deſiring them to direct him what was beſt to be done in this matter. They, to ſée their neighbour in ſuch a difficulty, laide their heades together, and concluded, that his wife ſhould goe and let her licence be ſéene, and that ſhée alſo ſhould make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſall of all that which had paſſed betwixt her and them, omitting no circumſtance. And wée (ſaide they) will all
<pb facs="tcp:13960:40"/>
ioyne in petition to Maiſter Chauncellour, to permit her to praſtiſe her trade, which petition Maiſter Vicar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently framed, and they confirmed, by ſubſcribing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their names, and deliuering it to their neighbor. And that they might bring into ſome comfort whome they ſée cleane out of heart with the feares he conceiued héerevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they chéered him with many faire ſpéeches, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that he ſhould not fall, if their helps could ſuſtaine or proppe him vppe. After dinner, the better to incorage him, they all came to drinke at his houſe, and to repaire the domage which ſhe his wife had receiued by Maiſter <hi>Dobſon.</hi> And ſo plentifully maiſter Vicar, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes of his pariſh tooke their cuppes, that not a man amongeſt them, but that hee receiued a wound in his head, and for Maiſter vicar, he was not able for that night reade his Seruice, but perceiuing himſelfe hurt, he requeſted his hoſteſſe to fit him of a bed, for that night, whereunto ſhée moſt willingly aſſented. But this reſted vntill friday morning, when vp aroſe the Ale-wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, put on her faireſt ſmocke, peticoate of good broad red, her gowne of grey, faced with buckeram, her ſquare thrumd hatte, and before her ſhée hung a cleane white apron, and putting her petition into the boxe, with her licence, ſhée takes her way to <hi>Dunholme,</hi> there to attend her calling in, to anſwer before Maiſter Chauncellour, but there ſhée ſtayed all the fore noone, exſpecting when Maiſter <hi>Dobſon</hi> would bring her to hir appearance, much maruelling that no man did acknowledge her, neyther queſtion with her as concerning her buſineſſe. Shée had ſpeciall care to eſpie Maiſter Chauncellours ſonne in the throng, and not able to fixe her eies vpon him, ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he was not accuſtomed to come abroad ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, albeit ſhe attended there before the Chauncery office doore, from halfe an houre paſt ſeauen in the morning,
<pb facs="tcp:13960:41"/>
vntill almoſt twelue, when the Court roſe and went to dinner: ſhée earneſtly deſired to haue a diſpatch, but how to effect her deſire ſhe could not deuiſe, for ſhe was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to all, and they in like ſort were all ſtraungers to her, and Maiſter <hi>Dobſon</hi> had forgotten the ſtrict charge he impoſed vpon her the ſatterday afore-going, neyther ſought he to exhibite any Bill of Complaint againſt her. She ſéeing no perſon to reſpect her, albeit ſhée was in a laborinth of conceits, ſometimes of retiring, otherwhile of ſtaying til ſhée might ſée the vttermoſt: ſhe alſo thoght it conuenient to take a little meate in the Towne at a kinſmans houſe of hers there dwelling, to whome ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed her whole caſe, and requeſted his counſell: Hée thought it fitte that ſhe ſhould attend alittle further, to ſee if ſhe were inquired after, which if you be not cooſin (ſaide he) I wil make meanes my ſelfe to Maiſter Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour that you may be diſpatched and ſo depart home. At one of the clocke when the Court was to ſit againe, he came along with her toward the Chauncery. Maiſter <hi>Dobſon</hi> ſitting in an olde fréeze gowne before the north gate of the Cathedrall, eſpied his Hoſteſſe, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring himſelfe, that it was friday, imagined, without further diſcourſe, the cauſe of her being there: and being aſhamed to preſent himſelfe into her ſight, he cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed him ſelfe from her view, yet thought hee good to ride her once againe like a countrey iade, and thereupon he went to one of the Clarkes of the Chancery, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the whole matter, deſiring him to take ſome courſe for the ending of her buſineſſe, and to ſet her packing: for during her abode in the Towne, I ſhal be conſtrained (ſaide he) like the Fore, to kéepe my hole. The Clearke promiſed to order the matter welle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but he either forgetting himſelfe, or troubled with ſo much other buſineſſe, that he could not regarde
<pb facs="tcp:13960:41"/>
it, ſuffered her to ſtay vntill thrée of the clocke vncalled for. Whereat her cooſin, grieued with her attendaunce, boldly ſtept into the Chauncery, tolde Maiſter Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour her caſe, and deſired his good worſhip, that foorth of his accuſtomed clemency he would let her come to her anſwer, that ſhée might know what ſhée were to truſt vnto. The Chauncellour hearing ſuch reportes to his ſonnes diſgrace, in publique court, was greatly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therewith, and cauſed her to be brought in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of her if ſhe would iuſtifie thoſe things, or not. Yea, quoth ſhe, I will be depoſed that all theſe reportes of my cooſin be moſt true, and in witneſſe thereof, héere are the handes and names of our Curate, and principall men of our pariſh. Well quoth Maſter Chauncollour, Thou naughty woman, I will haue thée made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all the world for ſlaundering my ſonne with ſo much vntrueth: for the very day before thou reporteſt this acte to be done, I ſent him to <hi>Yorke</hi> about important buſineſſe of mine owne, and the Churches, and as yet he is not returned, neither, if he had béene at home ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou make me to beléeue that he would haue ſo much abuſed himſelfe.

while their orders continued vndiſſolued: but when they were reformed and reduced to a Deane and Chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they leaſed, and let forth all ſuch places to Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Countrey. This houſe called the Hall-yerds, they farmed to one <hi>Monſieur du Pome,</hi> a merchant of the citty, who for his houſe prouiſion had alwayes there a houſe of Poultry. <hi>Dobſon</hi> promiſed his fellowes a feaſt, albeit he was not alwayes the beſt prouided of money, ſo about the Michaelmaſſe, when gooſe fleſh commeth into requeſt, he made an arrand to the Hallyerds, where ſuch ſhift he made, as away he brought a gooſe without note or ſuſpition, he ſhrowded it cloſely vnder his gowne, and leſt that either he might be purſued, or the gander ſhould cry and ſo indanger him of apprehenſion, he refuſed the ſtréetes, and tooke his paſſage alongſt the riuer ſide to a bridge called <hi>Pons Laurentiſ,</hi> which directly carried him into the Abbey. But in the way (as it fortuned) he was met by the owner of the ſame, who for his pleaſure came walking by the ſame paſſage to the Hall yerds, to take ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of his ſeruants labours, and to ſée his houſes and cattell. The merchant in their méeting eſpying a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanre of a white colour vnder his gowne, demaunded what hée had there: Nothing ſaid <hi>Dobſon,</hi> but my Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſſe, which I haue béene fetching from my Laundreſſe, for it is almoſt Euenſong time. That is well done (ſaid the merchant) and making no further queſtion with him, they ſundred, the one taking his courſe to his farme, and the other to the ſchoole, where hée left his gander vntill Euenſong was ended, when he conueyed him to his old hoaſt-houſe at the ſigne of the Bore, where they got him made fit for the broach. And vpon monday morning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to performe his promiſed banquet, he prouided a broach, and all other things requiſite, and cauſed a fire to be built in a ſellar vnder the Schoole, he ſet his fellows

But Maiſter <hi>Bromeley</hi> miſſing him and diuers others, inquired how they had beſtowed themſelues. Whereunto anſwer was made, that they were in the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer houſe.

And why aunſwered they, we haue heard of no ſuch feſtiual, and if it be any, tis more than we doe know. Why that may very well be ſo: but I dare warrant you, that it is holiday, and thereof I am moſt certaine, for otherwiſe <hi>Batte Midforths</hi> ſhoppe would haue beene open, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other working daies it is wont to be: or neuer ſince my comming to the towne haue I ſéene it ſhut, but vpon Sundayes and principall feaſts, ſo that I am well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that it is ſome ſpeciall ſolemmtie this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to be doubted, but that it hath beene proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Churches, or at leaſt in the pariſh of Sainct <hi>Nicholas,</hi> albeit wee haue not heard thereof, and that he knoweth welenough: for elſe (without all queſtion) his ſhoppe had not beene ſhutte in more this day than ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday.

               <p>This morning as it fortuned, he was gone into the Countrey, he and his wife, to viſit his wiues mother, who laboured of a quotidian feuer, and fearing death, had ſent for them to be at the making of her laſt will and teſtament, as alſo to ſee her interred according to her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and deſire. <hi>Dobſon</hi> then finding his ſhop windows ſhut vp, vrged it for a certaine teſtimonie to proue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a holyday, knowing that a more forcible inſtance

Euery man allowing this courſe, fet his artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and marched forth of the Abbey, with whom <hi>Dobſon</hi> went along, euen vntill they came almoſt to the place where he had aſſigned them to ſtay: then he returned to informe Maiſter <hi>Bromley</hi> as he promiſed of the feſtiuall: and making as much haſt as poſſibly he could, to preuent

his Maiſters comming, he tooke his ſeate cloſe at the Schoole doore, lapped in his gowne as he had been a cold. About the houre of eight of the clocke Maiſter <hi>Bromeley</hi> came and bid him good morrow, demaunding the cauſe of his ſitting there alone, and why he was not in the Schoole? Sir (ſaith he) the doore is ſhut, and I cannot tel how to enter, and all the reſidue of my fellowes be gone abroad to ſhoot, and would haue had me to accompanie them, affirming it to be holyday: But becauſe I could not tell what feſtiuall it ſhould be, neither haue heard that it was ſo publiſhed in any Church of the Towne, I dared not preſume to goe with them: partly, bicauſe I feared your offence, and partly, becauſe I could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what holyday it ſhould be, for I eſpy all ſorts of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens and Artizans in their ſhops, as vpon working dayes: yet notwithſtanding all the reaſons I produced to ouerthrow ſuch their opinion, I could not perſwade them to ſtay till your pleaſure therein were knowne. But laughing at my timors, away they went globating to the fields. Maiſter <hi>Bromeley</hi> firſt examining the day and time of the yeare, leſt haply it might be ſome Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles or other Saints day: that either by the preſcript of the Church, or the general cuſtome of the Country, was to be kept holy, could not call to his remembrance that it was any ſuch: and therefore he gaue <hi>Dobſon</hi> in commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to goe and commaund them all to repaire to the Schoole: with which his charge he departed, leauing his Maiſter to walke his ſtations before the portall. When he came to the place where they were earneſtly ſhooting: Gentles (ſaid he) I am come from our Maiſter, to intreat your helps a little. There are diuers Gentlemen of good ſort yeſternight come from <hi>London,</hi> who are trauelling toward <hi>Barwicke:</hi> and they haue ſought forth our Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter this morning betimes, deſiring to ſée our Schoole,
<pb facs="tcp:13960:46"/>
and the number of ſchollers, requeſting alſo that wée may giue them a ſong: and haue brought themſelues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of deſcant, lately ſet forth by Maiſter <hi>Bird</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of our Arte. Our Maiſter did know it to be holyday before I told him, and therefore was much ſolicited how to get vs aſſembled together becauſe of the ſame. That he might gratifie the ſtraungers deſires, and for ioy that I was ſo nigh at hand, he hath promiſed vs another day of recreation, when we ſhall think fit to call for the ſame. They taking all his ſentences for Oracles, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay, in hope of their Maiſters future fauour, and ſome reward of the Gentlemen, hurled homeward in heapes, beſtowing their artillery to the cuſtodie of their acquaintances in the way, ſtriuing who ſhould come firſt home. But when they came within the Cathedral, and did ſee their maſter kéeping his ward alone, their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies changde, and wiſhed with all their hearts they had béene away: but <hi>Dobſon</hi> ſéeing them to be ſo daunted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them to goe forward, implying to them, that the ſtrangers were but gone to take a viewe of ſome of the ancient monuments in the Chancellour ſhrine of S. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> till their comming: and to releaſe them of all feares, himſelfe ſtept formoſt into the Schoole. When e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man was ſeated in his place, diſputing what would be the iſſue of their calling home, M. <hi>Bromeley</hi> bolting the doore ſo faſt that none could eſcape forth, examined the cauſe, why they had neglected the ſchoole without his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and did not rather follow <hi>Dobſons</hi> aduiſe, which was, to haue acquainted him firſt, that it was a ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſome Saint, either kept of cuſtome, or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which if by their collections they could haue made plaine, then he would not haue detained them againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny auntient and approoued cuſtome of the Schoole. They by theſe propoſitions ſeating how the caſe ſtood, had no
<pb facs="tcp:13960:46"/>
better excuſe to cleare themſelues, then to blame the blame-worthy, and ſo at large related, how by him they were induced thereunto, ſtanding all to affirme it in his face, and their teſtimonies ſo ſtrongly charging him, could not deſcerne any fault in them worthy of chaſtiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but turned all his anger vpon this pregnant deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, who well merited the whip, and was commanded to prepare his bréech for the ſtrappado. But when hée perceiued that no reply of his againſt their aſſertion could be taken, neither any entreatie or promiſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement procure his pardon, he ſkipped into an olde Jakes in the Schoole, whereinto they vſed to throwe all their filthy duſt and ſwéepings, proteſting that foorth of that place he would neuer come, vnleſſe that his maſter would ſolemnly ſweare to remit and forgiue vnto him all offences paſt: and if that any diſaſter ſhall ouer-take me in this place (ſaith he) I will take it vpon my death, that the feare I conceiue of your barbarous vſage of me is the cauſe thereof, anſwere it as you can; you will finde that I haue parents will ſeeke for no leſſe ſatiſfaction then the lawe will allow them. M. <hi>Bromeley</hi> doubtfull that he had béen madde or lunaticke by his deſperate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior, intreated him to come foorth, ſwearing vpon the Bible, that he would not onely releaſe him, but pardon all the reſt: vpon which his depoſition made, <hi>Dobſon</hi> by the helpe of a rope which was caſt downe vnto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended foorth of the pit, and was reconciled to his Ma. and ſchoole fellowes.
