            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For as in the quiet times of states well gouerned, Souldiers trained with shewes of no danger, and exercised in pleasant marches, feruentlye couet the hazarde of battle: so returned those rare men, from their lighter labors, more resolute, to beare the heauy burden of their ancient studies. By imitation of whome maye the meaner sorte, being also wearied with other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents of the worlde, vndertake the like (as the poore help of cuntrey musicke for a plowemans dumpe) with no lesse warrantise, then the sheapheard may the vse of his Ofen pipe, Princes hauing the Cornet, &amp; other excellent Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

Thys equitie in nature hath moued mée, as a lenetiue of the mind (though beside my infirmities, I haue many things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with others) to enterprise the praise of Nothing:
<pb facs="tcp:12272:3"/>
which I confesse might haue had more ornament, if it had fallen in the handes of the learned, by whose labors the weaknesse of the subiect might haue béene holpen. Yet for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> betwéene the déepth of their skil, and the shallownés of this matter, there is small proportion: I thought the same more agreable for my selfe, whose iudgement hath néerest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie therewith.</p>
            <p>Whilest I endeuored to shun <hi>Agrippas</hi> vanities, and <hi>Erasmus</hi> follyes, as one that might haue béene a paterne of either, I cloathed with bare garments this treatise: for equity would not that Drones féede with the Muses birds, neither that <hi>Arachne</hi> weaue in the frames of <hi>Minerua.</hi> My purpose hath not béene to publishe any thing contrary to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie (which with many obseruances, I haue regarded) or in beguiling the time, in which I salue my owne sores, to wounde the wandering appetite of such as hunt nouelties, and ingorge themselues with euery poison, that hath either his outwarde forces alaide wyth swéete smelles, or sauorie tasts.</p>
            <p>But I who had rather bréede no delight, then betraie the sences, haue in consideration therof, put this Caueat, that those fictions which be without order scattered in this pamphlet, be for no other cause layde downe, then to péece with phantasticke artificers, the defects of their inuencion: none being so hardy to drawe <hi>Venus</hi> without hir Uaile, or <hi>Mars</hi> vnarmed.</p>
            <p>The weake helpe of these supposes, I submit to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned censure of the godly, who knowe them to be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise parte of any worke, then steyning coullers of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with the table or linnen hanging.</p>
            <p>I meane not to be iealous of the good report of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, as <hi>Appelles</hi> was of his picture: but giue leaue for all sorts to reprehende me for nothing, for whose sake I haue made apparance of some enmitie to all thinges, neither to impunge any ground of equitie, but to take such measure as I haue powred to others; of whome I entreate no other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,

then that they thinke it the labor of him, who win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth quils for the web of <hi>Penelope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The quarrel is not yet ended, which hath risen amongst the anciente Phylosophers, touching the originall of the worlde, which some will haue to concerne only the earth, &amp; hir contents: others the mighty frame of the vniuersall: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one setting downe his seuerall reason, as being loath to haue séemed ignorante of those great matters: when to things in which they had more interest, being of one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the heauens, and the earth, they were mere stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, for that light of which <hi>Zacharie</hi> and the Euangeliste spake, had not then shined to them, by which they mighte thorough the thicke clowdes of nature behold themselues, a knowledge discended from heauen. For whilst they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyled (Curiositie being their guid) to find out in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Pythagorus,</hi> the moets of epicure, and seperated for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of <hi>Democrates,</hi> the naturall cause of the worlde, they reuealed by chance, the true procreation of nothing: as men in séeking Mines doe first finde water, without which there is no store of Mettle congealed.</p>
            <p>This labor although it were not, in dangers equall to those of <hi>Hercul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The prophane antiquitie therefore, vnlesse by casuall meanes, entreated little hereof, as of that which by their rule, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
               <hi>Nihilex Nihilo fit,</hi> conteined not matter of profit, or commendation: for which those Phylosophers hunted, as ambicious men for dominion and empire. Leauing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as men impatient to abide without the vaine praises of the people) that difficult and lawdable enterprise to the
<pb facs="tcp:12272:4"/>
posteritie of the children of God, they gaue themselues to be authors of many parcialities and sectes: But these latter sort; vpon whose backs this charge was cast, after they had beheld the state of all thinges, perceiued the cause of their production, to consist of a nature more excellent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were of: which being without the compasse of their schole causes, must of necessytie be ascribed vnto the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull omnipotencie of God, who by his diuine wisdome, composed the vniuersall substance of nothing: which is by so much of greater dignitie, by howe much it hath rather pleased the creator to fram therof the worthyest creatures. And though it liked <hi>Tully,</hi> to name the reuealing of these misteries to the multitude, great impietie: yet thinke I it necessary, as a meane to attaine to the true knowledge of God, and our selues: of God, who making all thinges for man of nothing, is preched to vs by the architecture of this mightie engin of the world: of our selues, who being made of reasonable soules, &amp; bodyes, pertake both of the natures of Angells, and brute beasts: to that ende, we embase not with abiecte mindes the excellency of the first, or raise the second higher, then is agreable to our strength. For that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which we communicate with Angels, being created of nothing, draweth vs by a secreter property, to the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of heauenly things, then the Adament doth Iron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the other, being a natiue of the earth, inclineth vs by a naturall impultion, to fire our care theron, til we fall groueling from al duetie, and (being subiect to diuerse alterations, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, either increasing, or decreasing with the moone, are fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallye eclipsed with the graue. This is therfore a matter to be regarded of them, which be rockt in the pleasures of this worlde, that the bouye being one discent more from nothing then the soule, is by many degrées further from all vertue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same: &amp; that so long, as we reteined y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> simple of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, we were (as hauing our minds regolated by the good order of nature) the louers of vertue. But after that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundes
<pb facs="tcp:12272:4"/>
of the serpent, and our first parents, had rooted in vs these posessiues, <hi>Meum et tuum,</hi> (the elements of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion) we declined from that age, which in respect of this, &amp; the innocency of that time, was named golden: tasting in lieue of the pleasant fruits of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Orcharde of <hi>Eden,</hi> the sower leauen of the first error: which so corrupted the whole state of the worlde, that as by mo ages, it stoode further remoued from the time of his creation: tooke it also, being newly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from pietie, new names, with which, his honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble title was extinguished, as hauing no other effects then of iron, and therfore now named therof.</p>
            <p>In this proportion, is there to be obserued, the nature of both the mettles, if iron be to be named one, which maketh for this matter in hand. For as gold (being made of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, reteineth still his naturall propertie, and substance) neither yéelding to the moistnes of the water, or consuming by the extreame furie of the fire, is the tipe of those, who despysing all things, are afflicted for vertue: so iron being artificially made of stones, and shewing by his rust, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euen temperature of the elements, &amp; malitious influence of the planets in his composition, prefigureth the vngodly estate of man, wasted by the flame of concupisence, &amp; canc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of loose lyfe.</p>
            <p>The meane to attaine perfection, is eyther to returne to that of which al things were created, or to be stil endowed with the simple of the first creation: which neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lower heauens, that ouer spreade the worlde with their beautiful lights, or the earth which is conteined in the midst of them, are: it being pronounst by the Psalmist, that they shal waxe old as doth a garment: which proueth their vertue by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of times, to diminishe, and not to be of such efficacie in working, as when they were created of nothing: since which time, the one hath for our sinnes put on the nature of Brasse, and the other of Iron: as qualities hauing affinitie with our corruption, which were to be restored by those
<pb facs="tcp:12272:5"/>
things, in which it hath offended, but that the abundaunte mercie of God dispaireth, for the nurrishment of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with this rule of iustice.</p>
            <p>The heauenly politicke in reforming the disorders of his common weale, referreth vs to the beginning, in which was neither corruption of law, or nature: the like haue his disciples done, as to that where lieth no suspition of il mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But such as be croked followers of this company, &amp; iealious of the godly antiquitie, make all beginninges doubtfull, which are of more age then themselues: and as men vtterly ignorante of the gréeuous soers of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cuntrie, name nothing the cause. Our soueraign gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, applieth the easiest remedies of godly surgerie, for preseruation of the whole bodye: but in this, they be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise deceiued, then in those actions which be squared with the rule of error. For as these <hi>Mal Contents,</hi> of the <hi>vatiean Serraglio,</hi> vse (contrary to the sincere purity of the sacred word, and imitation of the holy Fathers) prophane and supersticious worshipping of God, in stead of adoring him in truth, and veritie: in like manner, haue many enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities béene perpetrated for nothing, with no lesse furie, then as though all the powers of nature, had consented to beate reason from the stearne, and to sincke the vessell of sound iudgement: to which notwithstanding, we ought not to attribute the cause of ill effects: The goodnes of wine being not impaired, though some take the Moone for a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or the Sunne vnprofitable, for that others are scorched with the heate: which hurt not in respect of their qualities, but by meane of the pacients indisposition: so nothing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the emptie mindes of diuers personages, with that motiue, which some schole men doubt to make either an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, or a substance, and therfore by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture nothing also: stirreth them (as the aire of the fire, moueth either lighte or dry things) by some power of the first nature: from which because they as now excluded: they followe their seuerall

               </gap>treme beneath them, or men séeking cudgels to beate dogges for waging their tailes. For proofe, let vs descend to a perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler example of the way warde qualities of olde age: which though it be reuerenced with many ceremonies, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned with no commodities of the world: yet remaineth it inpacient of either fortune, consuming for nothing in great frowardnes, the residue of their brittle yeares: or as fondly turning ouer the leaues of their last times, as hauing put of the sobrietie of ancient men, or the shamfastnes of young childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: bestow the remnant of their life in making Sonets, in smothing their wrinckled skin, coulloring their white haires, perfuming y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> venimus exhalations of their stomaks, &amp; carrolling w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ratling voyce their amorous <hi>Villanella</hi>: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though without hazarding the losse of some tooth, they open not their hanging chappes, more fearfull then the graue.</p>
            <p>Many other thinges vnséemely that time, are intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly passed by them, as though a doting libertie, gotten by some colloure of long experience, and imitation of lighte men, might more warrant their safetie, then a wilde Ape, deceiued by the hunters: with whome whilest they woulde séeme to be that which they are not, they pittifullye forgo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which they be: making that in which there is no vice, the shade of their ill doing, and with little children (being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the cause of their action) answer it is for nothing.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:12272:7"/>
for giuing iudgement, in this repugnancie in nature, vz: y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whilst euery one desireth a long and peaceable time, he yet hunteth after the vse of those things, which frowardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good course of life. It is therfore no maruel, though this supernaturall motiue, hath béene condemned of them, who estéeming al things by their weight &amp; fashion, haue for their purpose, this croked saying. <hi>Somewhat hath some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor,</hi> not weighing consideratly, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> as by those instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts by which we perceiue any pleasure common to man, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take also a thousand incomodities, which flocke without number to crosse the ioyes of life: which so withereth wyth any sorrow, as though we had dwelt in continuall calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and neuer felte other then the passions of extreame mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. Compaire the ioyes and sorrowes, which grow of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptable things, &amp; there wil be sufficient reason minstred, to confirme this argument. For beginning with the state of mariage, from whence the maides of <hi>Greece</hi> reckned their age: who are they, that after the death of their beautifull, &amp; chaste wiues: or contrary wise of their ritch and louing hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, that thinke not their time past vanished, the present perished, and their life following desolate? reckning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their olde ioyes, the mother of their newe sorrowes, and lamentable state. Or what naturall parent, being depriued of good children, doth not more lament their losse, then he reioyced of their liues? which being carefully feared, were by so much the lesse pleasant to him, who now sorroweth them with manye teares, as hauing lost the Image of his youth, the lantren of his sight, &amp; staffe of his olde age. Touching the powers of man (whose corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, windeth as a hop wier, as well about wéedes, as hearbs) they stand vs in so smale stead, that when we haue most néede of them, we are to séeke their help. For whylest one of them empeacheth the others function, the outwarde sences wanting by that meane a moderator, take one thing for an other: obseruing no order in quantitie or qualitie, but
<pb facs="tcp:12272:8"/>
filling all things with iarrs, verifie the saying of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: by hearing you shall heare, and not vnderstand, and seeing you shall sée, and not perceiue. If these two sences which haue a preheminence aboue the rest (as well for the necessary vse of life, as that by their means, we taste of the louing goodnes of God) be by the deuine Oracle vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs: what is to be said of the other partes of our body which make vs by diuers insolences iniurius to God, and man? but that we haue in each of them many deformities, as though the losenes of our life, were appointed the foile of vertue, or that honesty could not be expressed without hir contrary. The charitable looking vpon the torne leaues and poore afflicted members of Christ, greatly profiteth no doubt the dulnes of our bodily sight: which being séene and not relieued, argueth vs of incrudelitie towards the head, whose parts they are. Furthermore to behold in our sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, and not in the singlenes of the eye, the beautiful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the world, the wonderfull, and vnchangeable course of the heauenly bodyes, the marueilous motions of those huge heape of waters in the Sea, and dayly renuing of his other creatures, which preach to vs the infinit wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and power of God, in the composition of this mighty frame, be likewise testimonies of our darknes, and grosse ignoraunce.</p>
            <p>For better explayning this matter, in which with full consent the world hath willingly erred: let vs, although there is not any thing so agreable to nature, as the society of euery liuing thing in his kind, yet view the consequent effects of that felowship, and we shal for the most part find it so hurtfull to our selues, that in respect of our mutual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, we are (by our owne censures) iudged Wolues one to another. For whether it be for the desire of dominion, or to haue comendation for wit, strength, or comlines before others, seldome is there peace: and when it hapneth, it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gaineth vs opportunity to breake into greater violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb facs="tcp:12272:8"/>
then to set the good slips of vertue: which if we plant, they prosper as growing out of their naturall soyle. It is not therfore to be marueiled, if we regarde all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thoughe the other creatures of God be enimies to vs: when our powers and natural parts discent amongst them selues, &amp; one man with great hatred prosecuteth an other. For after the chain of our obedience (by which we were tyed to the fauour of God) was broken, all his other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures grew weary of our Empier, &amp; as our profest enimies opposed themselues, in the quarell of their creator against vs: either vtterly refusing our company, as that which is supposed da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous, or so rebelliously obeying, as they séem our Maisters, vnto whom we ow our seruice, for prouiding their foode, and other necessaries: for which they (being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to shake off the yoak of their bondage) yéelde no other recompence, then the stripe of horne, héele, or tooth: vnlesse by our tirranie, they be made the vnwilling seruitors of our appetits. For some resolucion of this matter, let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the naturall contradiction of the simple shéepe, who by a secret instinct, rather chooseth to go naked, by clothing the bryers with hir wooll, and to venture hir sielie body in company of hir rauening enimies, then hir natural owner should be posessed of either. Furthermore, there is not any liuing thing, being not ioyned to our fellowship by some necessitie, whether it be the smale vncleane Flie, or the hurtful and laborsome Cmot, that willingly draweth to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:12272:9"/>For setting aside how the water ouerfloweth our cattle, perisheth our fruits, &amp; drowneth our bodies, may we behold a malice greater then belongeth to lawfull enimies, in casting them vp to be deuoured of Foules and beasts, who are made honorable sepulchers to our miserable carcases: &amp; not yet satisfied with this triumphe of vs (whom she find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth beyond al hope, receiued of these common aduersaries) procéedeth with no lesse fury (by mean of the other eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts) against the remnant of them which perished by hir former crueltie, in yéelding fulsome vapors, which being drawne by some qualitie of the fire, are willingly receiued of the aire, to be suckt of them, who therby are made parents of mortal diseases, and long infirmities. Nether haue we any peace with the earth, a dayly and sullen enemie to man, which eyther by hir quaking, in bearing the heauie burden of our vncleannes, murdereth many: or being mindful how hir beauty faded in the deluge, for our iniquity, so opposeth hir selfe against our labors, that in gathering one ounce of things necessary, we bring in therwith two pound of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, powdring our meate with sighes, mingling our drink with teares, and slumbering in déepe care, as hauing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny calamities more attendant then our shadowes, which forsake not our payned bodies, til they haue deliuered them for a full satisfaction, to this gréedy creditor the earth.</p>
            <p>The ordinary of <hi>Tantulus</hi> were rather to be wished, then those things or their effects, which by a populer opinion, are named profitable: and therof durst I make some natiue of <hi>Platoes</hi> den, the Palemon: to whome, although <hi>Epicure</hi> had shewed the beautifull buildings of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the swéete perfumes of <hi>Thebes,</hi> the plentiful tables of <hi>Capua,</hi> or mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the Romaine Empire, would iudge them farre vnméete for the safe conuersation of man: who with this fraught, may as easily ariue in the heauenly port, as a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell may passe the eie of a Néedle. It is worthy of some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation to behold the enmitie which the other creatures

besides man, as well sencible as insencible, haue betwéene their seuerall kinds, as the Serpents &amp; Fire, being things sencible and insencible, Oyle and Cowcumbers, feathers of Doues and Eagles, being both insencible, the smale bird <hi>Egitus</hi> and the Asse, being both sencible, &amp;c. especiallye for that there is no hope left to gather profit by the vse of these things, which are so incomodious to themselues. It seemeth <hi>Byas,</hi> or as it pleaseth some <hi>Stilpo,</hi> disagréed not from this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who in flying naked the town of his byrth, which conteined both his friends &amp; substance, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> were at one insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in hazard of burning: answered them, who willed him more carefully to regard his losse. Al those things which be mine I take with me: inferring therby, that vertue is the onlye ornament and possession of a wise man: all other things being but snarles to intangle honestie, and to cast vs head-long inso much miserie.</p>
            <p>Of that opinion were many other, who beholding our states buffeted by prosperous or aduerse Fortune, vtterly condemned the life of man, as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which by the vse of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things was made the storehouse of many euils.</p>
            <p>The consideration hereof, ministred <hi>Heraclitus</hi> large floodes of teares, and clowdes of sighes, as vnfained wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of his continuall mourning, for those miseries wyth which he beheld our liues filled and made lamentable. The selfe same caused <hi>Democritus</hi> to laugh at them, and their madnes, that thought all other times then those, in which they pursued the causes of their short life, or infinite trouble, lost. They both agréeing, that our liues be so delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded wyth the world, as the vnwarye bird, by the Fowlers call, or the gréedy Trowt, by the sundry coulors of the fethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hooke.</p>
            <p>In all these matters may we behold the true portraits of sorrow, layde forth wyth the deceiuable coulors of <hi>Anagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> were we not such, which by custome, lyke as well the reflexions of light, as the natural brightnes of the Sun: or
<pb facs="tcp:12272:10"/>
as children ill learned to forgoe with <hi>Esau</hi> for Porrage, a land that floweth with heauenly foode.</p>
            <p>And although we deserue no better (if we respect our own worthynes) then a surplus of those euils: yet for that they may be seperated by an other trade of life, I condemn them as meanes, to drawe vs from pietie, or by which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to brute beasts, who are farre from those affections, with which we be burdened and throwne downe.</p>
            <p>I may appeale in these matters, from common opinion, to the Citezens of the worlde, whose experience knoweth we be no otherwise made of, then of <hi>Sirenes,</hi> or pittied, then of <hi>Crocodils</hi>: but each way assailed with flatteries, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed compassions, as a people il guided to discern of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries. This duely considered that all things be either naturally our enimies, or by our error in vsing them, made vnprofitable: let vs as men made wise by our owne perril, make much of their contrarie, by whose benifite we fynde some inclination to honesty, or by whose meane, we lose not our liues, credite, and peaceable state: but may haue in respect of our securitie therby, one countenance with <hi>Iuue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> passenger: when others hauing their harts heauier then their pursses, cursse with the wearie <hi>Spainard,</hi> the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Crosses, they being turning markes of high wayes, farre from the dwelling of men: honoring on the other side the wheele, and gibbet, as signes of rest, being placed neare to Townes, and Citties.</p>
            <p>The affinitie which hath béene euer betweene nothing, and the pouerty of men, maketh the one hardly to be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the other in the possession of their owners: the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes of both, being the cause of good arts, and inuention of some newe matter profitable to the world.

which had leasure to establishe this saying. <hi>Pouertie is an enimie to good manners,</hi> a prouerbe amongst vs: the same being necessary for the knowledge of our selues, that are by the contrary most insolent and intollerable. <hi>Dionisius</hi> whilst he had the pompe of a King, was estéemed of all men tirranius, &amp; being expelled his realme, named for his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and wisedome, a Phylosopher. <hi>Alexander of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> being (for his dominions) wounded wyth the holy flatteries of <hi>Iupiter Hamons</hi> Preists, of a sober Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came violent: as he terriblye expressed in the miserable fortune of his faythfull counceller <hi>Clitus,</hi> and the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble state of <hi>Persepolis</hi>: by which &amp; such like he brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in hatred of his people, by whose seruice he passed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hazards of battle, which then were had in admiration, &amp; nowe scarce beléeued of those, that haue not traueiled in the diuine Oracles of <hi>Daniell,</hi> and other wrighters (touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that matter) of good report. For such were the disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of affections in this Prince, that whilst he estéemed the contents of the worlde, he excéeded all the great men of his time in losenes of lyfe, and extreame crueltie: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie wise, when he feared nothing, and reuerenced the louers therof, as he confirmed by visiting <hi>Diogenes</hi> in hys Tun: there was none gained so easily the harts of all men as he: being by their whole consents iudged worthy, for his magnimitie and temperance, vnto whom the world ought only to yéeld his obedience. Notwithstanding this opinion receiued by all men of him, repaired he (as I saide) to the straight lodging of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> as vnto him with whom he had neare equalitie in nothing.</p>
            <p>The which this good Phylosopher had in such estimation, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he offered therfore dayly supplications, to those Images which were erected in the publicke places of <hi>Athens,</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> memorie of their good Citizens: although some hold, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued this custome to that ende he might more paciently beare the deniall of such necessaries, as he sought at the

            <p>But how vnprobable their opinion is, the conference betweene him being in his Tun, and <hi>Alexander</hi> standing betweene the sun and the mouth therof proueth. For after <hi>Alexander</hi> found that confirmed by his owne experience, which he heard reported by others, touching the excellency of <hi>Diogenes</hi> wit, and the rare quicknes of his spirite: and seeing him with a minde greater then belongeth to a man in aduersitie, to contemne both life, and other matters of the world, he studied according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worthines of himselfe, to nurrishe those vertues by somewhat, that might be agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the magnificence of a King: and therfore encorraged <hi>Diogenes</hi> (whom he found not stored with any thing in his Tun, which serued for all weathers) to aske possession, or other necessaries.

But <hi>Socrates,</hi> who at no time was vnlike himselfe, gladly confessed to dy willingly for nothing, for whose sake he had named him selfe ignoraunt of all things: and therfore blamed hir, that

               <hi>Caius Caesar,</hi> being of that magnanimitie, that the world difficultly conteyned his greatnes, to sound the disposition of the Senat, preferred diuers sutes to them for himselfe, &amp; fauorers: but they as men iealius of the Romaine state, and muffeled with the ouer sight of their fatall destinie, graunted (not knowing what) nothing: a matter taken of <hi>Caesar</hi> in better part, then if they had made him perpetuall Dictator: as by which being no way their debter, he tooke occasion to enter vpon them, and their liberties, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to cease the large domains of their Empire into his hands: wheras if they had in the beginning alaide the heate of his ambition, with the ordinarie hope of other su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, he had giuen place to some other, who had chastised their gormandise, that brought them in hatred of all men.</p>

            <p>Great is the excellencie therof, whose owners be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of charity, which (to cloath hir naked children) seeketh not those things which be hir owne: and no lesse expedient for our righteousnes, which is made perfit by possessing the same: an act to be regarded for our payment, which neyther the robber taketh, or is made corruptible by the rust, or moth. When contrariwise to entertaine them that tast the fat of the earth, is without hope of rewarde: vnlesse the casters of water into the Sea, are to be praised for their charitie.

Christs louing imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the little children (who cared for nothing) are not of least importance: for their simplicitie being the shadow of our fyrst innocency, is to be reentred, as the posterne of true godlynes: which lieth not open to them that haue the world in admiration, and be not resolute follow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>By these hurtfull effects &amp; dangerous impressions of all things, I finde great cause why nothing should be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: as wel for that it serueth al humors, though by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry meanes, as that also the same is enimie, or hauing soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie with things hurtfull to man: but a good helpe, to make him in true godlines like pacient Iob (so much commended of God) who more then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rest of men, stood beholding therto, as vnto his vnseperable friend, which only accompanied him into the world, remayned with him in his miserable pouerty, and sicknes, and lastly returned with him, to his

Sepulcher, the gate of his rest and felicitie, in which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no man hath in this world a perfection, yet draweth he nerest therto, either in the prime of life, or decreped age therof.

For in the latter time of man, when all things remaine vnpleasant to him, not for that he hateth them, but in respect of his want of power (which then wareth weake) to vse them, he maketh of hys necessity a vertue, and in lieu of his wonted violences, and ouer running the world, either restraineth himself to some monastical life, or teacheth at home the vse of true fortitude and militarie prudence: or if weakened by the dangerous assaults of loue, he highly praiseth chastitie, reading to hys wife the legend of good women, wherby she may more pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The contempt, or societie of the world, that hapneth by this necessitie, is no way worthy of praise in vs, though (as <hi>Vbi desinit Philosophus incipit medicus</hi>) it be an externall meane, where by we supernaturallye apprehende, the heauenly graces, that haue no societye with those things, for which we enuie, mislike, or imbrace one another: or for which we teare the bowels of the earth, or trust our selues to the vnconstant waues, or ruffe seas.</p>

            <p>To this are the testimonies of the scriptures answerable: which witnes the bountious liberality of God, to the needy, naked, miserable, and possessors of nothing, and his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the mighty, and rich, whom he pulleth from their seates, and sendeth emptie from his presence.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, where as the schole men haue this ground, that <hi>Natura abhorret vacuum,</hi> which is the natural element, or residence of nothing, it consequently followeth, that she also abhorreth nothing, which maketh nothing, by so much of greater dignity, by how much our nature being peruerse is prone to sinne, the only cause of Gods fearefull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and heauie displeasures.</p>
            <p>These are the effects of nature (an enimie to the Courte of nothing) to kindle on our backs, hir bundle of rotten sticks, with the consuming fire of Gods wrath.
