            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE OF THE Proceedings and Tryal of Mr. <hi>Francis Johnſon</hi> a Franciſcan, at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> laſt Summer-Aſſizes, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1679.</head>
            <head type="sub">Written with his own Hand as followeth.</head>
            <head type="sub">To which is annexed His SPEECH at his Execution, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 22. 1679.</head>
            <p>I Being at <hi>London</hi> on <hi>All-Saints-day,</hi> when the Proclamation came forth to command all <hi>Catholiques</hi> to depart from thence by the <hi>Friday</hi> following, I obeyed, and came to a Friends houſe in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> not intending to ſtay there; but the King's ſecond Proclamation being preſently publiſhed, That no <hi>Catholique</hi> ſhould walk above Five miles without being ſtopt, and carried before a Juſtice to have the Oaths tendred, I asked Counſel of the wiſeſt I could, both of Proteſtants (whereof one was a Lawyer) and another a Conſtable, as alſo of <hi>Catholiques,</hi> Whether that Proclamation did ſo ſtrongly oblige, that it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me no longer to go further? They all concluded it was not ſecure to go, ſo I reſolved to obey, and ſtay where I was, and with good reaſon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe all <hi>Catholiques</hi> are obliged to obey the King's Commands in all things that are not againſt our Religion and Conſcience, and His Commands in this nature are againſt neither.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Should I have diſobeyed, and have been taken, in Penalty I ſhould have ſuffered, which would not have been ſo directly for my Conſcience and Religion ſake, as for diſobeying the King's Command; becauſe in caſe I ſhould be taken by ſtaying there in obedience to the Proclamation, and be carried before the Juſtices to have the Oaths offered, whatever I was to ſuffer for refuſing them, I ſhould have this double comfort before God, and the King; before the King, becauſe I rather choſe to go to Priſon, than to remove from his Law, by taking the Oaths againſt my Conſcience—Therefore I was taken and put in Priſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The manner of my being taken was as followeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sheriff's Deputy came to the Houſe where I was with ſix or eight men, to Arrest a Gentleman in the Houſe for Debt: The Officers coming into the Houſe in the morning, and not finding the perſon they came for, broke down all the doors, and among the rest mine, before I was out of Bed, and by a miſtake Arreſted me,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:39761:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inſtead of the other Gentleman; and although the Deputy, coming into my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, looking on me, told them they were deceived, for I was not the man they came for; yet other Soldiers coming into my Chamber, one of them ſaid he knew me: It ſeems he had been a Servant in the Houſe ſeven Years before, therefore he ſaid he would have me to the Juſtices, and bid his Companions ſecure me, and ſo they did, and would not let me go out of their ſight, until they carried me before the Juſtice; And this they did, without either Conſtable, or Warrant, Law or Juſtice.</p>
            <p>When I came before the Juſtice of Peace, I told him the occaſion that had brought me to him; and if I would have taken the Oaths, I had been preſently freed: But I told them that perſuaded me to take the Oaths, That it was againſt the Faith and Religion I profeſſed, and againſt my Conſcience, and I would never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt either, by ſo complying, whatever I ſuffered for the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Justice's Wife was compaſſion ate towards me, and deſiring to ſpeak private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with me, ſhe uſed her beſt perſuaſions to me to comply with what was deſired of me concerning the taking the Oaths, for fear of further trouble or danger. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her with thanks, and told her, That I was ſorry ſhe had no better opinion of me, than to think I had proſeſt ſuch a Faith and Religion all my life-time, and now upon the trial could be moved with any fear or danger (which God ſorbid.) I told her it was ſuch a Faith, that in it I depoſed my Soul, my Confidence, Heaven and Eternal Life, and therefore I neve r did, nor (by God's grace) never would fear to ſuffer for it what pleaſed God; For who could fear even Death itſelf of the Body whoſe life is momentary, for Profeſſion of that Faith wherein he depoſeth the Eternal life of his Soul?</p>
            <p>This Anſwer ſatisfi'd both her and my ſelf, for I was reſolved to make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Profeſſion of my Faith and Religion; upon which I return'd to the Juſtice, who thought fit I ſhould go to another Juſtice, who was Sir <hi>John Packington,</hi> whither alſo he went with me.</p>
            <p>When I came to Sir <hi>John,</hi> he asked me who I was? I anſwered him, I was a Gentleman ſufficiently known for theſe <hi>20</hi> Years in <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> to all ſorts of People. He asked me of what Calling I was? I anſwered him, of none. He asked me what Eſtate I had? I anſwered, I was no Landed man. Then he asked me, If I would take the Oaths? I anſwered, I underſtood them not. He replied, Will you take them, or will you not? I told him if he pleaſed to let me ſee them, I ſhould return him my Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſon why I deſired to ſee the Oaths, was, becauſe I was reſolved to make a Publick Declaration of my Faith, that they were againſt my Conſcience, and therefore by declaring publickly the Reaſons why I could not take them, it ſhould be publickly known, that whatſoever I was to ſuffer for not taking them, was for no other cauſe but for my Faith and Religion, becauſe I would not ſwear againſt my Conſcience—For, would I have taken them, I had been there alſo freed.</p>
            <p>When the Oaths were brought to me, they told me I muſt read them out aloud, but I told them that becauſe it was a publick place, and many there preſent of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees, as well of the Houſholders, as Strangers, I feared leaſt reading them aloud, ſome that heard me might think I ſware what I read, and ſo might go and report they heard me take the Oaths before the Juſtices. But they declared they would not think ſo l ſo I read them over and over, which when I had done, I ſaid aloud, God ſave the King; and then declared to both the Juſtices, and all the reſt, in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am ready to ſwear as followeth:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I ever all my life-time have been, and now am, and ever will be to my last breath, as ſaithful a Subject to the King, as any Subject whatſoever, and as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as if I ſhould take the Oaths now offered by them to me an hundred times over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as for taking theſe Oaths offered me, I could not take them whatever I ſuffered, and the reaſon was, becauſe I underſtood what an Oath was, and the conditions which God has preſcribed to us, before any could call him to witneſs lawfully in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any ſuch Oaths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:39761:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>The Conditions which God has preſcribed I told them were theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou ſhalt ſwear the Lord liveth in truth, and in judgment, and in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo that in every Oath, the life of God, the truth of God, the judgment of God and his righteouſneſs, are included by all which we ſwear, and the Oath we take is to have all theſe Conditions, truth, judgment, and righteouſneſs, <hi>Jerem. 4.</hi>—Therefore if I ſhould take theſe Oaths which are concerning damnable Doctrines and Hereſies, I must call God to witneſs that I no more believe him to be a living God and true God, a just and righteous God, than I believe theſe things contained in the Oaths to be true, just and righteous, to ſwear to which Oaths I do not nor cannot in my Conſcience believe to be ſo. For, before I or any man elſe can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Contents of theſe Oaths to be true, as to call God to witneſs that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them to be as true, just and righteous, I must be able to deſine what is Faith or Hereſie in theſe Contents I ſwear to, and I must know the full extent of all caſes of this nature that God has left to all Temporal Princes and their Power; I must alſo underſtand the full extent of all caſes of this nature of power ſpiritual which God hath left in his Church in or over Chriſtian Kingdoms of Temporal Monarchs, which power in theſe Oaths I am to ſwear on the one ſide, and forſwearing the other.</p>
            <p>I told them I was not of capacity nor knowledge to ſet the Confines to each Power, or to determine or define the extent given by God to all in this nature, ſo as to ſwear and call God to witneſs I am as ſure of it, as I am ſure he is a living God, as I must do if I take theſe Oaths, the extent of which I did not underſtand in my Conſcience to be ſo as to believe them; Therefore I could not nor would not ſwear to them. I having ſpoken theſe things, no body ſaid any more to me, but the Juſtices going out of the Hall made my <hi>Mittimus</hi> and Sentence for <hi>Worceſter</hi> Priſon, becauſe I would not take the Oaths they tendred me.</p>
            <p>I have been ſince called to the Bar at the <hi>Seſſions,</hi> where I ſpake to the ſame effect before Judge <hi>Street,</hi> and the Juſtices, as I had ſpoken before to Sir <hi>John Packington,</hi> having firſt asked their leave to ſpeak, which they gave me for a little time, and then bid me return to the Priſon.—But firſt they were urgent with me to anſwer poſitively, <hi>Ay</hi> or <hi>No,</hi> was I a Jeſuitical Prieſt, or was I not? To which I anſwered, It was an eaſie thing for me to ſay <hi>No,</hi> but by ſaying <hi>No,</hi> I might prejudice others, who hereafter being asked the ſame queſtion, if they did not anſwer <hi>No,</hi> it might be an Argument that they were guilty, if they did not deny it as others before them had done.—Therefore I deſired that what proof could be brought againſt me, might be produced againſt me, and I would anſwer for my ſelf: But I deſired I might not be urged to anſwer <hi>Ay</hi> or <hi>No,</hi> to any thing, before ſome Witneſs or Argument came againſt me; for, I told them in ſuch Caſes, neither Law of God nor Man obliged any one (although he was guilty) to bear witneſs againſt himſelf without ſome proof were alledged againſt him, for, that was no leſs than to be his own Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner.</p>
            <p>The Judge anſwered there were Witneſſes would ſwear againſt me.</p>
            <p>I anſwered, if Witneſſes could make out what they ſware of me, then my life was at the King's mercy: But in the mean time I told them I remained guiltleſs, though I did not anſwer them to their queſtions <hi>Ay</hi> or <hi>No,</hi> becauſe I told them that being my ſaying <hi>No</hi> in my own behalf would not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient teſtimony to acquit me, therefore there was no reaſon why any man ſhould be urged to ſay <hi>Ay</hi> to accuſe ones ſelf though he was guilty.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Judge ſent me to Priſon again at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> where now I am, which Impriſonment, in theſe Times eſpecially, when none can ſend to their Friends, nor Friends come to them, is the beſt means to teach us how to put our confidence in God alone in all things; and then he will make his promiſe good, <hi>That all things ſhall be added to us,</hi> Luke 12. which <hi>Chapter,</hi> if every one would read, and make good uſe of, a Priſon would be better than a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; and a Confinement for Religion, and a good Conſcience-ſake, more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39761:3"/>
than all the liberties the World could afford. As for my own part, God give me his grace, and all faithful Chriſtians their prayers, I am Happy enough; And as for others, I beſeech God that the evil example of thoſe that ſwear againſt their Conſciences, may not be Guides for the reſt to follow, nor their Deeds a Rule to their Actions. We all ought to follow the narrow way, though there be many difficulties in it: It's an eaſie thing to run the blind way of liberty, but God deliver us all from broad, ſweet ways. We know what <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of <hi>Libertines, They lead their lives in the goods of this world, and in a moment they deſcend into Hell.</hi> But, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>What doth it profit a man to gain the world, and loſe his ſoul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God gave <hi>Job</hi> a goodly increaſe for all the riches he took from him, and bleſt his latter end more than his beginning, and gave him an Hundred and forty years of flouriſhing life for his ſhort affliction, in which, his conſtancy and faith in God was tried; and our Saviour promiſeth an Hundred-fold to all that leave Goods, and every thing willingly for his fake.—Who well conſiders this, will be content to leave both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Friends and Fortunes, and Freedom by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, for their Faith and Religion-ſake, till ſuch time as it ſhall pleaſe God and the King (in obedience to whoſe Command they ſuffer) to releaſe them. And in the mean time they will have this comfort, That they give a Teſtimony they fear God, and honour the King; They fear God, becauſe they chooſe rather to ſuffer Perſecution, than ſwear againſt their Conſciences; They honor the King, becauſe they are willing to ſuffer the Penalties He commands, and yet remain faithful Subjects to Him, whom God long preſerve, with His Parliament and People, in all happineſs.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday, <hi>April 15. 1679.</hi> I came before Judge <hi>Atkins</hi> at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> to have my Cauſe tryed at the <hi>Seſſions,</hi> having been Committed five Months before to <hi>Worceſter-Caſtle</hi> by two Juſtices of the Peace, Sir <hi>John Packinton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Townſon,</hi> becauſe I refuſed the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ſuſpected to be a Jeſuitical Prieſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The manner of my Tryal was as followeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Four Witneſſes were brought in againſt me; Three of them were forced by Warrant to come in, whether they would or no, from ſeveral Towns, and were fore'd to ſpeak all that they knew, had heard, or ſeen, concerning me; neither I, nor any of my Friends knowing, that any would be compelled ſo to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of my Tryal was come. The fourth Witneſs came of his own accord for Lucre ſake, who, the ſame day that I was firſt brought to <hi>Worceſter</hi> Priſon, offered himſelf to ſwear before the Mayor of the Town, that I was a Prieſt, before ever he came to ſee who I was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Teſtimony which he gave againſt me before the Judge, was this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſwore he had been at Confeſſion with me, and that he had received the Sacrament at my hands about two years before at his Fathers houſe, whil'ſt he was a Catholique; and after he became a Proteſtant he ſaid I told him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he ſhould turn back from whence he had fallen, elſe he would be damned.</p>
            <p>The other three Witneſſes that were forced to come in againſt me, when they came before the Grand Jury, and were urged to take their Oaths, to tell that which they never had known nor ſeen concerning my being a Prieſt, they all unanimouſly declared, That they had nothing to ſay againſt me, and that they were by violence forced to appear there, and therefore they ſaid they would never ſwear nor ſay any thing againſt me, for they knew nothing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me of: which when the Jury heard, they called for the Jaylor to take the Party that fitſt denied to ſwear to Priſon, thinking by this violent way of proceeding ſo to afright them, that they ſhould ſay ſomething, out of which advantage ſhould be taken againſt me; which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> better to effect, they made
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39761:3"/>
them firſt lay their hands on the Bible, and then kiſs it, which they did. Then the Jury told them, that now they were to tell all the truth according as they were asked.—Firſt they asked whether any of them had ever heard me read? One anſwered, yes, the Bible, and ſometimes any other Book. Then they asked, Whether they had ever ſeen me pray? It was anſwered, yes. Then they asked what Cloaths I had on when I prayed? And whether I uſed to change my Cloaths when I came to pray? In theſe and other like queſtions they ſifted them, to get out any thing that might do me hurt.</p>
            <p>But how Charitable or Chriſtian-like theſe Proceedings of the Jury were, let the World judge <hi>Now,</hi> as God will <hi>Hereafter;</hi> For, if this be a charitable way of proceeding among Chriſtians, that our Neighbors ſhould by ſuch ſtrange violence, as by Warrant and Oath be brought againſt their wills from any part of <hi>England,</hi> to ſwear whatever they have ſeen, heard, or known of their Neighbors, what horrid Confuſions and <hi>Odium's</hi> muſt this make among all ſorts of People both Friends and Foes?—But I do not blame thoſe three Witneſſes, after they had been inconſiderately induced to lay their hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bible, and kiſt it; I ſuppoſe they judged themſelves bound to ſay what they did.</p>
            <p>After this, when the Jury had got out of them what they could, the four Witneſſes and I were called before the Judge. The firſt Witneſs that came to ſwear againſt me, as the cuſtom is, repeated his teſtimony over again before the Judge, and ſo did the other three that were forced; which when I heard how abſurd and inſignificant ſome of their teſtimonies were, I inconſiderately ſmiled, at which the Judge being offended, I humbly begged his Pardon, and told him I was ſorry for it.—But foraſmuch as laughing or ſmiling were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Nature, over which no man had a free courſe or power, I hoped and beſeeched him not to impute it to me; he told me he would not be diſpleaſed at me for it. Then he asking me, whether I was guilty, or not guilty of my Accuſations? and I anſwering, Not guilty, he bad me ſhew it, by anſwering for my ſelf; I told him I was ready to do it; but told him firſt, I had an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Petition to his Lordſhip, which was, that I deſired a full and free liberty without hindrance to anſwer to every Objection, and plead for my ſelf; I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deſired he would reflect in my behalf, that as he was to be my Judge, ſo he was to be my Advocate. And foraſmuch as all earthly Judges were to imitate the heavenly Judge, who as Advocate ten thouſand times mitigates the ſeverity of a Judge, whil'ſt his hand of mercy is infinitely ſtretched forth beyond the hand of judgment. And therefore I begged of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that I might find the favor of an Advocate from him, rather than the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of a Judge, eſpecially in thoſe things which according to Law may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous or diſadvantageous to me, which I underſtanding not how to make the beſt uſe of them, deſired his Lordſhip would vouchſafe to do it for me; which that the better he might be moved to do, I deſired he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conſider that this my Life and Concerns were (in compariſon of others greater) not ſo much conſiderable, I being but a private perſon, yet my <hi>Little</hi> was to me <hi>Much,</hi> becauſe my <hi>Little</hi> was my <hi>All;</hi> and my Life to me were as much as <hi>Caeſars</hi> or <hi>Solomons</hi> were to them; and as great a gift from God to me, as theirs to them; and therefore God has laid as great an obligation on me to defend my ſelf and my life, as he had on them for theirs, and alſo had given to every one a ſtrict command not to impair or prejudice me in the leaſt, no more than the greateſt Potentate. Therefore being I was now brought before him in a Caſe, where the World as much as concerns me, lay at ſtake, and my Life, and my Credit, I did humbly beſeech his Lordſhip to proceed accordingly with me, as I preſumed according to his prudence and worth he would. He aſſented to what I petitioned, and did bid me ſpeak for my ſelf.</p>
            <p>In anſwer therefore to the firſt voluntary Witneſs againſt me, I told his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it was true, I had been at ſuch a night at his Fathers houſe, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I was deſired by him, I ſtaid all night.—But as for this Witneſs, I was a ſtranger to him, and he to me, as he confeſt himſelf. Then the Judge asked him, Whether he knew me before or no? For he declared publickly, That he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39761:4"/>
never knew me, nor ſaw me before or ſince, till he ſaw me at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and yet he ſaid the next morning he made his Confeſſion to me, and I gave him the Communion at Maſs as he ſuppoſed in my Chamber; but he ſaid that none of all the Family was preſent at that time, only he and I alone; whereupon I deſired the Judge to conſider what poſſible likelihood could be of the truth in this his affirmation, that I ſhould come to a houſe where I was acquainted with them all, Father, Mother, and Children, with all but this Witneſs, who as he declared knew me not, nor ever had ſeen me before, what likelihood is there I ſhould ſay Maſs before him alone, hear his Confeſſion, and give him the Sacrament, and ſo go away without any one of the Family (with whom I was ſo well acquainted) hearing, ſeeing, or knowing the leaſt of this that paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and me.—I therefore deſired my Lord to ask him, Whether I ſpake of Confeſſion or Communion? or what I ſaid to him when I gave it him? or whether I told him I would give him the Sacrament? which when the Judge had asked him, he anſwered, That indeed I never had ſpoken to him either about Confeſſion or Communion to come to either; neither did he know what I ſaid to him, when I gave him Bread like a Wafer; but he of his own accord did deſire me to hear his Confeſſion, and give him the Wafer which he took.—Whereupon the Judge asked how it came to paſs that he, never having known nor ſeen me before, nor I ſpoke with him about Confeſſion or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, how could he now tell who I was, or how could he deſire ſuch a thing of me who was a meer ſtranger to him, neither of us knowing any thing of one anothers condition; ſure, ſaid the Judge, we do not give the Communion on ſuch terms.—To which he anſwered, that his Father had told him, that if he would he might confeſs to me, and that I would give him the Communion.—So although he had ſworn before, that none in the houſe was witneſs, or ſaw him confeſs or receive, yet rather than be confounded, he would bring his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into confuſion, and accuſe him as guilty of being the cauſe of what he did, which might be the ruine of his Family.</p>
            <p>But the Judge taking no notice of what he had accuſed his Father, ſpake to me, and told me, by this it might appear, That I had taken upon me what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Prieſts Office, by hearing his Confeſſion, and giving him the Wafer. To which I replied, that with his leave, I would make it appear, that all which this Witneſs had ſaid againſt me, did not at all prove me to be a Prieſt, or to have taken the office of a Prieſt upon me; for all he ſaid I had done, I might do it lawfully though no Prieſt, ſo might other men that never were nor would be Prieſts do the ſame, as many thouſands had done and did do through the world. He asked me how I could prove that? I anſwered, as to his Confeſſion he ſpoke of, in the nature he declared it, it was only an act of charity for me to do as I did, and every Chriſtians duty obliges every man to do the ſame that he ſaid I had done for him, and the ſame was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by all Sects whatſoever, that never knew what belonged to Prieſthood; For, if our Neighbor have any thing that perplexed his mind, there is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way to eaſe it, than by ſpeaking of it to any whom he ſuppoſed might know how to take away or mitigate his Grievances by counſel or advice; And therefore this Witneſs having underſtood ſomething from his Father, that might move him to confide in me, came of his own accord, as he ſaid he did, to impart his mind to me, and therefore I ſhould not have fulfilled Chriſtian duty, if I ſhould have ſlighted his trouble, and not have given him leave to eaſe his mind to me, and, in the beſt way I could, endeavor to aſſiſt him, and divert his trouble, though I was a ſtranger, being that he of his own accord, as he ſaid, came to me for that intent, and therefore I deſired the Judge to ask him, if it were otherwiſe than what I had told his Lordſhip?</p>
            <p>The Judge replied that I went further; for, as he ſays, I gave him the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer or Communion. I anſwered, that ſuppoſe I had given him the Wafer or Communion (which whether I did or no I was not certain) yet according to his own word, this could no way prove that I gave him the Sacrament; for, let him ſpeak if I told him it was ſo; or let him declare if I ſaid any thing to him concerning the Communion, or what I ſaid; he could not ſay I did, only I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39761:4"/>
gave him ſomething; therefore I told the Judge, that if he pleaſed to give me leave, I would tell his Lordſhip what practice ever had been, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly uſed in the Catholick Church throughout the world, in giving hollowed bread or water, which is nothing belonging to the Communion or Sacrament; for, I told my Lord, as there was holy water kept in all private houſes, as well as in the Chapels, and places of Prayer, ſo there was alſo holy bread, and ſometimes of the ſame nature as the Wafer or the Communion, and of this as well as of the other ſort of bread, was on <hi>Sundays,</hi> and other certain daies, not conſecrated as the Communion, but only bleſſed as holy water by the word and prayer, and ſo diſtributed to men, women, and little children, of two or three years old; and ſuch like hallowed bread thouſands of men, women and children, take, and may carry about them, and keep in their houſes, and eat it at any time, and give it when, and to whom they would, to children, or others; and for my part, I have many times in my life taken it from others at any time; when I had it, or was in any private houſe where I found it, I have taken it to eat my ſelf, and given it to any man, woman, or child, ſometime they deſiring it, ſometime of my own accord I gave it, and ſo poſſibly I have given it to the man that witneſſeth here againſt me; and if he know the contrary, but that it was as I ſaid, I deſire that he would ſpeak: But he had nothing to ſay of me to the contrary.</p>
            <p>I appealed to my Lord to judge whether this teſtimony, or any other teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony this Witneſs brought againſt me, were of any force or value to make me guilty in this matter, which no waies could be made out againſt me.</p>
            <p>I proceeded therefore to anſwer his third Accuſation againſt me, which was, that I ſhould have told him, that if he did not return to the Faith from whence he had fallen, he would be damned. To this my Anſwer to my Lord was, That I had all my life time been ſo fearful of ſuch raſh Judgment, that I do declare it in the preſence of God, as I did before him, that I had rather dye, than preſume to pronounce the ſentence of damnation againſt any man; but I told his Lordſhip, that if he pleaſed to give me leave, I would relate what I had ſaid to him, and others, upon the like occaſion, which the Judge being willing to hear, I told him, that I being at this man's Mother-in-law's houſe, who was of no Religion, no more than this Witneſs, and the Mother deſiring to hear what Catholicks held, and the reaſons for which we believe ſuch points of Faith, I told her what we held, and ſhewed her the proofs for what we held in her own Bible, and when ſhe made any difficulty whether ſuch texts of Scripture were to be underſtood as we underſtood them, or in any other ſenſe, I ſhewed her out of the Proteſtant Practice of Piety, and out of the Proteſtant Common Prayer-Book, that not only Catholicks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all Proteſtants underſtood them in ſuch a ſenſe; and ſhe having thoſe Books by her, I turned thoſe places to her to read in her own Books, and ſo ſhe did, and yet neither the Bible, nor Common Prayer-Books, nor Practice of Piety, could ſatisfie, or make her believe; whereupon I told her, that if ſhe were a Chriſtian, ſhe muſt believe ſomething; for, as ſhe believed, ſo ſhe ſhould be ſaved:—I told her alſo what the Bible declared to her, That without Faith it was impoſſible to pleaſe God, and I bad her conſider the text that ſaith, Whatſoever is not of Faith is ſin; as alſo the text that ſaith, The juſt man liveth by Faith, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her to read thoſe words of our Saviour, where he ſaith, He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned; which ſhe did read; and this Witneſs being then preſent, and I ſaying the ſame then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, I ſuppoſe, from this text, he accuſed me that I ſhould ſay, he would be damned, becauſe I repeated, and ſhewed them our Saviour's words, as they appear in that place of Scripture.</p>
            <p>I having thus anſwered all the teſtimonies this Witneſs could bring in againſt me, I referred my ſelf to his Lordſhip, and all the Bench, to judge whether any thing this Witneſs had ſaid againſt me, would make me guilty: The judge ſaid but little to it, but called for the next witneſs (who was Father to this firſt) who was ſo much grieved at the proceedings of his ungracious Son, that he could not forbear to ſhed tears all the time that his Son produced ſuch <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccuſations againſt me; ſo that he appeared more witneſs againſt his Son's
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:39761:5"/>
ungodlineſs, than a Witneſs againſt me: Yet the Judge asked him many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, whether he had ever heard, ſeen, or known any ſuch or ſuch things of or from me: To all which queſtions he anſwered, No, he knew nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; ſo that the Judge ſeeing he ſhewed ſo much kidneſs, he asked him what he was? He anſwered, a Catholick; whereupon the Judge bade him go away, ſaying, He was too much my friend, and therefore he would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him as a witneſs, but called the third. This witneſs was an old man, and very deaf, who was forced to come againſt me by a warrant, ſwore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will: The Judge asked him ſeveral queſtions, whether he heard me ſay any prayers; he anſwered, yes, but he could not well underſtand or hear what they were, becauſe he was ſo deaf; he asked them whether they were Engliſh or Latin? he anſwered, he could not well tell, he thought it was both; and, I think, it might be neither, for ought he could hear, he was ſo very deaf: Then he asked him what cloaths I had on? he anſwered, he could not well tell; I had ſomething on that was white, a Surplice he thought; and the Judge was willing to ſuppoſe this to be a Prieſts habit at Maſs, or when he gave the Sacrament; but I told his Lordſhip, that this could be no proof of any ſuch matter, becauſe, all over the world, among Catholicks, ſuch Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were worn by thouſands in time of prayer, who never were, nor will be Prieſts, as is well known to thoſe that have been Travellers: And I told his Lordſhip, that if he pleaſed to call for them, there may be ſeveral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, of ſeveral Sects and Opinions preſent in the Hall, that would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient witneſſes as well of this, as of the holy bread and water, which the other witneſs as well as this old man ſaid I had given them, which they ſuppoſe to be the Sacrament; but the Judge would call for none, but called for the fourth witneſs.—This witneſs was a young woman, who was alſo by violence forc'd to come and ſwear what ſhe had heard, ſeen or known concerning me about the matter in queſtion. The Judge asked her whether I had taught her any thing, whether ſhe had been at Confeſſion or Communion, what I ſaid to her, what pennance I gave her; and he asked alſo the like queſtions of the old man, the former witneſs, to all which they were both very unwilling to anſwer; for which ſome of the rude people curſt the old man for an old doting fellow, and were as much vexed at the young woman, becauſe ſhe was ſo dejected, that ſhe could not ſpeak, but lookt like one that was half dead, as ſome of the people ſaid in anger ſhe was ſo. The Judge perceiving in what condition ſhe was, ſaid aloud, what men are theſe Prieſts that have ſuch power over people, that they are not able to ſpeak againſt them; he therefore bid them remember they were in the preſence of God, and were bound in conſcience to ſpeak the truth of what they had heard or ſeen; ſo at laſt they owned that I had read in the Bible, and other Books to them, and that they had confeſt what troubled them, and had received ſomething like a Wafer from me, and that they had believed what I read to them; yet they both declared pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, that I did not bid them come to Confeſſion, or take the Wafer or Bread; and when they took it, that I did not tell them it was the Sacrament, neither did they know whether it was or no: By all which it appeared according to the letter of the Law, and in conſcience, that none of theſe teſtimonies were of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient force to make me guilty. A mans life is not to be taken away upon ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, or poſſibilities, that this might be the Communion, as well as other holy Bread. For, the Law requires, that it muſt be proved that there was an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacrament by one that had taken Orders from a Foreign Power; of taking Orders there was not the leaſt Accuſation mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me by any of the witneſſes, much leſs could it be proved, no not ſo much that I pretended to give the Sacrament any more than it might be holy water, or holy bread, as I deſired my Lord to conſider; neither was it the wearing of a Surplice that could prove I ſaid Maſs; for Prieſts never wear Surplices at Maſs: And if a mans wearing a Surplice at prayer, prove him a Prieſt, then all the Singing-Boys in every Proteſtant Cathedral Church, and in all other Churches in Chriſtendom, all thoſe Boys, though but of ten or twelve years of age, muſt be by conſequence all Popiſh Prieſts; and all Jews who conſtantly in their Synagogues put on a white Garment like a Surplice, as I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39761:5"/>
and all Travellers have ſeen them do when we have gone to ſee them pray: At theſe Jews muſt be Romiſh Prieſts:—Out of all which it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that none of theſe teſtimonies the witneſſes brought againſt me, were any way concluding according to Juſtice to make me guilty of being a Prieſt.</p>
            <p>As for my reading the Bible to them, or in ſatisfying them in what they doubted, or bidding them ſay their prayers, and particularly the Lord's Prayer, which the laſt two witneſſes told the Judge I had done, and the like (he fearing to anſwer to all the queſtions he asked them) To theſe I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I own I had done ſo; whereupon the Judge ſaid, that out of this it appeared, that I had taken upon me the Prieſts Office. I told him, that with his leave I would ſhew how it did no ways follow; for, out of this it only followed, that I had done the duty of a good Chriſtian, and every man in the like circumſtances is bound as a Chriſtian to do the like that I had done: I told him, that they, doubting of ſuch things, and deſiring me to ſhew them if ſuch places were in the Bible, or not, and deſiring to know what I did believe of thoſe points, and the reaſons why I believed them, I turned to ſuch places in the Bible, and read it to them, and bid them read the ſame themſelves, which they did, and ſo were ſatisfied. And I told my Lord, for what I had done, I had the Scripture warrant, and Scripture command alſo to do it, and ſo had every Chriſtian command to do the like; for the Scripture commands all to be redy to give an anſwer to every man concerning the reaſon of the hope which is within us, and this I had done to them, or to any other that had asked me as they did. But I told my Lord withal, that I knowing the Statute of perſwaſion, had alwaies ſo much regard to that, when any would diſcourſe with me concerning my Faith, or theirs, I told them, that (being there was ſuch a Statute as the Statute of perſwaſion) though I was bound to give them an account of my Faith and Hope, if for conſcience ſake they asked me, yet I told them I would not incur the penalty of that Statute by uſing any force or perſwaſion againſt their conſciences; for violent forcing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences was againſt the Law of God; yet I told them what I did believe, and ſhewed them the places of Scripture on which my Faith was grounded, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they deſired me to do for them, and then I would leave it to God and their own conſciences; and if they did not believe thoſe texts, I had no more to ſay to them; and if they did believe them, they beſt knew before God and their conſciences what they had to do; ſo that it was not my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, but God and their ſouls ſalvation that was to determine them in the belief of what they read in the Bible: And I bade them bear witneſs that I told them thus, if in caſe we ſhould ever be called in queſtion before any Judge; and thus I have diſcourſed, as ſeveral would bear witneſs for me. I told his Lordſhip this was true, and ſo did thoſe witneſſes; for, they declared publickly what I ſaid was true, whereupon I did appeal to my Lord, if I was not innocent in this point; and as for my bidding them ſay their prayers, or when they deſired to eaſe their minds by declaring what troubled them, I deſired to clear my ſelf by asking my Lord, with his leave, what Nation or Sect in the world ought not, and did not counſel and wiſh their Neighbours in their troubles to eaſe themſelves by prayer to God; and much more every good Chriſtian ought, when he underſtood that his Brother had acted the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal Son, offended his Heavenly Father, and therefore was troubled in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ought, I ſay, to perſwade him to return by repentance, and beg mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our Father which is in Heaven: I having done no more but this, have only done a pious Chriſtian duty to my Neighbours, which any man, though no Prieſt, may and ought to do the ſame. I having pleaded theſe things for my ſelf, the Judge was pleaſed to tell me, I had a nimble tongue, and wit, and that by thoſe diſcourſes I ſtrove to make the Jury attend more to my plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for my ſelf, than to the witneſſes Arguments againſt me: To which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, I ſpoke nothing but truth, which I ought to do to defend my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my enemies, therefore I hoped his Lordſhip would not be offended: But if I have exceeded (as his Lordſhip ſaid I did) becauſe I hindered him from ſpeaking, I humbly craved his pardon, &amp; hoped I ſhould obtain it, being my
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39761:6"/>
Concerns and Reaſons to plead, as I did, were of no leſs conſequence than Life and Death.</p>
            <p>But for all this the Judge told the Jury, that they were to conſider the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of the Witneſſes againſt me, as having done ſuch and ſuch things which Prieſts uſe to do; neither was it neceſſary that the Witneſſes ſhould prove me to have taken Orders from Foreign Power, and ſo to prove me poſitively to be a Prieſt; For, that (they not having ſeen me take Orders) they could not do, but it was ſufficient they had ſeen me do ſuch things, by which it might be preſumed it was ſo. Whereupon I anſwered, That there was never a Proof yet alledged, that did or could make that appear, or be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to conclude me to be ſo, and therefore I was no more guilty than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands, of whom all theſe things alledged againſt me might be verifi'd, who never were nor would be Prieſts, as I had ſufficiently ſhewed, why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould they be thought ſufficient to conclude againſt me. I therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Judge, before he ſent out the Jury, he would give me leave to ſpeak a word or two to them. He anſwered <hi>No,</hi> he would not. I then deſired his Lordſhip would give me leave to ſpeak again to him before them, ere they went out; to which he aſſented: I therefore deſired his Lordſhip to give me leave to ask this queſtion of him, which the Jury might hear.—<hi>Suppoſe all the Proofs which had been by all the Witneſſes brought againſt me, were to be alledged againſt the Jury, or ſome of them, ſo that if the Arguments were judged by them to be of force or concluding, ſome of thoſe of the Jury ſhould loſe part of their Eſtates and Credit, and being in ſome danger of their lives, who of all the Jury on whom this peril were like to fall, would judge thoſe Arguments alledged against me, ſufficient to condemn them to the loſs of part of their Eſtates, or part of their Credit with ſome danger of their Lives? I therefore deſired it might be conſidered, that my</hi> All <hi>lay at ſtake, all my Concerns in the World; Credit and Life not only in ſome danger, but certainly to be Condemned, if thoſe Arguments brought in by them againſt me ſhould be judged to be of force. Therefore I deſired they would deal by me as if it were their own caſe, according as I had propoſed it to them, and ſo I ſhould give no further trouble in ſpeaking, being it was not judged fit I ſhould ſay any more</hi> (as I had deſired) <hi>to the Jury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had only one Favor more to beg of the Judge before they went out, which was, that his Lordſhip would read a Paper before them which I had ready, whereby I could prove, that the firſt and chiefeſt VVitneſs againſt me, which was <hi>Rogers,</hi> ought not in juſtice to be admitted as a competent VVitneſs againſt me, as the VVriting I offered the Judge would ſhew; which VVriting I gave to the Judge, and he read it over privately to himſelf, and ſeeing the hand of him that wrote it at the bottom, who offered to ſwear for me againſt <hi>Rogers,</hi> the Judge asked where this VVitneſs for me was, and why I had him not ready? I anſwered he was hard by in the Priſon for Debt, if he pleaſed to ſend for him; but the Judge would not ſend for him. I then deſired the Judge that at leaſt I, or any elſe here preſent, might read my Paper publickly, that all might know it was true, that I had ſuch a ſufficient VVitneſs for me againſt <hi>Rogers;</hi> but the Judge neither would let me, nor any elſe read it openly, but however I made bold to tell publickly all the Contents of the Paper, which were word for word as the VVitneſs wrote it with his own hand and name at the bottom; thus—

By this it may appear, that if the Judge would let my Witneſs appear to have ſworn, I might have caſt <hi>Rogers,</hi> the chief Witneſs againſt me; and why it was not granted, let all that hear it judge. However, I ſtill continued to plead, that all Proofs alledged againſt me were inſufficient, which I can make appear even in the Judge's own opinion, though I did not tell him ſo; For you muſt know, that before in his Circuit, though Witneſſes ſwore againſt a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (whom they would have proved a Prieſt) that they ſaw him marry People and Baptize, which are the Actions of a Prieſt, yet the Judge declared, that becauſe theſe Actions might be done by ſuch as were no Prieſts, as well as by Prieſts, as it appeared, becauſe Juſtices of the Peace married People in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time, and any Man or Woman might at ſome times Chriſten Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; therefore ſuch common Actions, as he declared, could not prove the accuſed Gentleman to be a Prieſt for doing them, and thereupon the Judge freed him.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I infer, That all the Actions the Witneſſes ſware they ſaw me do, as wearing a Surplice, giving the Wafer, exhorting to Prayer, ſhewing Points out of the Bible, hearing others Grievances, which they of themſelves declared to me, and the like, being theſe are things done as well by thoſe that were no Prieſts, as by Prieſts; according to the Judge's own opinion, theſe Actions ought not to have been judged ſufficient Proofs againſt me, no more than ſuch Actions were judged ſufficient againſt other Gentlemen; although I did not alledge this to the Judge, yet it was ſufficient he knew it, and might, if he had pleaſed, done with me accordingly, though he did not, but ſending the Jury out, ſent me from the Bar.</p>
            <p>I being afterward called again to the Bar, and it being declared unto me, that the Jury had found me guilty, the Bill was read againſt me; and then I was asked what I had to ſay for my ſelf, why I ſhould not dye, that I might ſpeak before the Sentence of Death paſt againſt me. To which I anſwered, I only deſired to know for what I was to dye; for I have ſhewed that all things alledged againſt me heretofore, were inſufficient to prove me a Prieſt, or take away my Life.</p>
            <p>The Judge anſwered, That the Jury had found me guilty, and that now there was no more to be ſaid concerning the Proof, but that I was to be Condemned as a Prieſt.</p>
            <p>To which I replied, That though the Jury had found me Guilty, yet I was ſtill Innocent from any guilt of Death, and with his Lordſhips permiſſion I would prove it. He asked me how? I anſwered, thus; I had not been out of <hi>England,</hi> to take any Orders from Foreign Power ſince the King's Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to His Crown, neither had I any opportunity to take any Orders in <hi>England;</hi> therefore if I were a Prieſt, I was ſo before His Majeſty came into <hi>England:</hi> But whatever I had done before the King came into <hi>England,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make me now Guilty, ſuppoſing I had tranſgreſſed the Law before becauſe His Majeſty before His Return, put out ſeveral Proclamations, that none ſhould ever be troubled for their Religion or Conſcience-ſake; and ſince His coming into <hi>England,</hi> He had done the ſame by ſeveral Proclamations: and what was yet more, not long ſince, had ſet forth His Declaration, that every one ſhould freely practiſe his own Religion of what Sect or Perſuaſion ſoever, which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, if I were a Prieſt, I might ſafely relie on, as well as all others. To which the Judge replied, Where had I the Seal to that Declaration? I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I never queſtioned but that a Subject might take his King's Word declared in His Publick Proclamation without His Seal. The Judge anſwered, However if I were a Prieſt now in <hi>England,</hi> I was guilty. I replied, That ſuppoſing I had formerly taken Orders before the King came to <hi>England,</hi> I could not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether degrade my ſelf, or be otherwiſe now, than what I was ordained then; therefore if I were a Prieſt, I cannot now be guilty for it, becauſe all that ever was done before the King's Reſtauration, in what reſpect ſoever, was all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given and blotted out by the King's General Pardon to all Subjects, even to thoſe who had a hand in the death of His Royal Father, and ſo the Catholicks for their Religion were not excluded out of the General Pardon, wherefore I told his Lordſhip I was not guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:39761:7"/>
Whereupon he told me I was guilty, and preſumed far to plead ſo reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with ſuch confidence before him and all the Bench.</p>
            <p>I craved his pardon for my Fault, but deſired his Lordſhip to conſider, that I was bid ſpeak if I had any thing to ſay for my ſelf, before the Sentence of Death paſt againſt me, and therefore I had reaſon to plead home, ſince this was the laſt time I was like to ſpeak for my life in this world, which I hope his Lordſhip and the Bench would conſider; but if notwithſtanding ſo many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, Grants for Liberty of Conſcience, and His Majeſty's General Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to all who had rely'd on them, if all this would not ſecure me, but my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving thoſe things had cauſed me to err, and my Error muſt cauſe me to loſe my Life, I had no more to ſay.</p>
            <p>So the Judge ſate down, and pronounced againſt me the ſentence of Death, That I ſhould be Drawn, Hanged, and Quartered, Disbowelled, my Intrals burnt, my Head cut off, my Body to be cut in four quarters, and my quarters to be at the King's diſpoſal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which Sentence being pronounced, I bowed, and ſaid aloud,</hi> Thanks be to God, God ſave the King; and I beſeech God to bleſs your Lordſhip, and all this Honourable Bench.</p>
            <p>The Judge replied, You have ſpoken very well, I do not intend you ſhall dye, at leaſt not for the preſent, until I know the King's further pleaſure.</p>
            <p>I was not, I thank God for it, troubled with any diſturbing thoughts either againſt the Judge for his Sentence, nor the Jury that gave in ſuch a Verdict, nor againſt any of the Witneſſes; For I was then of the ſame mind, as by God's grace I ever ſhall be, eſteeming them all the beſt Friends to me in all they did or ſaid that ever I had in my life, or ever ſhall have, except upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. And I was, I thank God, ſo preſent with my ſelf, whil'ſt the Judge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Sentence to deliver me to Death, that without any concern for any thing in this world, I did actually at the ſame time offer my ſelf and the world to God.</p>
            <p>After the Judge was gone from the Bench to the other end of the Hall, I ſtayed with the Keeper in the Hall, where ſeveral Proteſtant Gentlemen, and others, who had heard my Tryal, came to me, though Strangers, and told me how ſorry they were for me. To whom, with thanks, I replied that I was troubled they ſhould grieve for me, or my condition, who was joyful for it my ſelf; for I told them I had profeſſed this Faith and Religion all my life-time, which I was as ſure to be true, as I was ſure of the truth of God's Word on which it was grounded, and therefore in it I depoſed my Soul, and Eternal Life and Happineſs; and therefore ſhould I fear to loſe my temporal life for this Faith, whereon my Eternal life depends, I were worſe than an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel; and whoſoever ſhould prefer the life of their Bodies before their Faith, their Religion, or Conſcience, they were worſe than Heathens. For my own part I told them, I was as ready by God's grace to dye to morrow, as I had been to receive the Sentence of Death to day, and as willingly as if I had a Grant of the greateſt Dukedom: So we ſate talking half an hour, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Priſon, there to remain, as long as it pleaſed God and the King, whom God long preſerve in all happineſs.</p>
            <p>There was another Objection which I forgot to put in, until I had finiſhed the former Writing, and it was an Objection which the Judge was pleaſed to put againſt me himſelf, and it was that I had changed my name, and went in ſeveral places by ſeveral names.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwered, the reaſon was, Becauſe in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time, in the great Troubles, our Family ſuffered much, my Father was impriſoned, and a Fellow-Priſoner with Sir <hi>Thomas Aſhton,</hi> both confined together, which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> is now one of His Majeſties Admirals of the Fleet. And for my own part, I going Beyond Sea to Travel, I changed my name; and then coming into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> again, before the King's Reſtauration, I was glad to conceal my ſelf, and go by ſeveral names, as many others of the King's Loyal Subjects did, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39761:7"/>
to be able to do His Majeſty the beſt ſervice I could, which, according to my ſmall ability, I did endeavor both before and ſince the King came into <hi>England,</hi> like a dutiful Subject, and like the reſt of our Family, who all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to ſerve His Majeſty: For I have two Brothers ſerved Him, the one a Voluntier at Sea in Sir <hi>William Reeve</hi>'s Ship, which Sir <hi>William</hi> was killed in the laſt Engagement with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and the other Brother had a Command under his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York</hi> at Land: therefore I hope the changing of my name on ſuch an occaſion as I did, could not be imputed as a guilt upon me, nor ſpeak me other than a dutiful Subject; which I could have made further appear before the Bench, but I did not judge it convenient to ſay any more to the Judge there in publick. But before his Lordſhip went out of <hi>VVorceſter,</hi> I preſented him with a Petition, to acquaint his Lordſhip, that I having had the honour to kiſs His Majeſties Hand, before His Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> as alſo I have had the honour to be one of thoſe whom His Majeſty was pleaſed to grace with being entertained by us, His then beſt Subjects; His Majeſty was pleaſed to make us a Gracious Promiſe, that when it ſhould pleaſe God to reſtore Him to His Crown, we ſhould not live ſo in Baniſhment as then we did. Of this in my Petition I did acquaint the Judge, and beſeeched him that he would be pleaſed, by declaring this to the King, to endeavor to obtain ſome gracious Favor from His Majeſty for me, my condition now being ſuch, that I could never have greater need to be Partaker of His gracious Promiſe and Clemency.</p>
            <p>The Judge promiſed me he would make an Addreſs to His Majeſty for me in this behalf, which whether he hath done or no, I wiſh ſome body may put him in mind to do it for me. I do not here mention the place where in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, nor the other perſons to whom His Majeſty made that Promiſe, but if you remember, you know I did tell you, with ſeveral other particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which I need not here make any further mention of.</p>

            <head>THE Laſt SPEECH OF Mr. <hi>Francis Johnſon</hi> Prieſt, of the Order of <hi>St. Francis,</hi> who was Executed (as a PRIEST onely) at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> upon the 22d of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Anno Dom: 1679. Which he ſpake, for the moſt part, upon the Ladder, immediately before his Execution, (but being interrupted) and that which he did ſpeak, being taken by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Scribe, was Printed by the halves, and ſo imperfect, that it was in ſome places Nonſenſe. To correct that Abuſe, this which he left <hi>(written with his own Hand)</hi> is publiſh'd by a Friend.</head>
            <p>ALmighty God, out of his infinite Goodneſs to this World, through the merits of his Son Chriſt Jeſus, ordained or made choice of three Virtues whereby we muſt walk, which are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith, Hope, and Charity. Firſt, by virtue of Faith, we are to believe all things that are done in this World; Secondly, by virtue of Hope, we are to believe and hope for all things in another World. And the reaſon why Chriſtians do believe this Hope, is to bring and conduct them to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the other World. And if we hope in God, we cannot but believe God; for with the mouth Confeſſion is made, but with the heart (and through Faith) we muſt believe unto ſalvation; ſo that Faith is not to be trodden under foot, or to be hid under a buſhel, but to be ſet upon a candleſtick, <hi>Luke 12. Whoſoever doth confeſs me before men, him will I confeſs before the Angels of God;</hi> And therefore all are bound to believe that there is but one Faith; and if but one Faith, then but one Chriſtian Faith. There is but one Faith, one Lord, one Baptiſm; if it be ſo, how can this ſtand with ſo many Sectaries as there are? If there be but one Faith, how can this be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I believe the Creed of St.</hi> Athanaſius, (which is in your Common-Prayer Book) <hi>there it is ſaid,</hi> That whoſoever will be ſaved, 'tis neceſſary before all things that he hold the Catholick Faith; and that if he keep not that Faith whole and undefiled, he ſhall periſh everlaſtingly. <hi>And as St.</hi> James <hi>ſaith, Jam.</hi> 2. 10. He that keepeth the whole Law, and yet offendeth in one point, is guilty of all; <hi>ſo they that believe, muſt be all of the ſame Faith. And that this ought to be done, I appeal to all the Saints that are gone before, of whom it is ſaid,</hi> That their Faith was ſuch, as by it they ſtopt the mouths of Lyons, they turned the edge of the Sword, and cauſed the Fire to ceaſe that it ſhould not burn; ſo they were oppreſſed, they wandered about in Sheeps-cloathing and Goats-cloathing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Therefore I ſay there muſt be an unity of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I deſire all Catholiques to conſider this, That it is better to be reviled by man now in this World, than be reviled by God in the World to come.</hi> Mat. 16. <hi>it is ſaid,</hi> The Catholique Church is built upon a Rock. <hi>And</hi> Mat. 18. He who will not believe the Church, let him be as a Heathen and Publican.</p>
            <p>This Faith muſt be eſtabliſht ſo in every one, becauſe Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He would ſend the Holy Ghoſt, and he will ſhew us</hi> (or them) <hi>what to do.</hi> This is the Rule of Faith: This Faith was publiſht at <hi>Rome.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Chriſtians there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rejoyceth that their Faith was renowned in the whole World. <hi>Go
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39761:8"/>
ye therefore, Baptizing all Nations in the Name of the Father.</hi> And this is the Faith I confeſs and believe in, and which I dye for.</p>
            <p>I come now to ſpeak of the ſecond Virtue, which is Hope. I hope I ſhall have ſuch Reward, <hi>that neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive.</hi> Thoſe that have Hope, ſhall be as Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that ſhall not be removed; Thoſe that have firm Hope, there's nothing can diſturb them; as <hi>David</hi> faith, <hi>God is round about thoſe that do hope in him, as the Mountains are round about</hi> Hieruſalem.</p>
            <p>I come to the third Virtue, and that is Charity. It's true, now this Body of mine in this ſhipwrack is full of ſin, but when that ſhipwrack is over, I ſhall come to inherit that Rock that ſhall never fail. Now welcome ſhipwrack that makes the Body ſuffer, but brings the Soul to that Haven which is joyful.</p>
            <p>Now many there be that talk much of Charity, few underſtand it, and fewer that practiſe it. This is the greateſt Virtue, <hi>1 Cor. 13. Though ye ſpeak with tongues of Men and Angels, and have not Charity, it availeth nothing.</hi> So then we ought to have Love and Charity, or elſe it prevaileth nothing.</p>
            <p>'Tis expected I ſhould ſay ſomething of the Plot. As to this, I ſhall declare two Points of my Faith.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I believe that all are bound to obey the King's Laws.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I do declare, That thoſe that do break the Law in word, or any action, or that do act any thing againſt His Majeſties Life, that is a Sin unto damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as much as it was a Sin in <hi>Judas</hi> to betray Chriſt.</p>
            <p>An Oath is a taking God to witneſs, and is as much as if he took his Life and Juſtice to ſtake. So that he who takes a falſe Oath, is guilty of deſtroying the Life of God and his Juſtice, and of his own Damnation. And if I were but guilty of this, I do declare, That all the Sin of Damnation would fall upon me, becauſe I denied the Truth, and ſo ſtruck at God by my Sin, in denying the Truth; that's one Damnation.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Damnation is, That if any man know of an Evil againſt His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, His Kingdom and Nation, and to hide and not diſcover it, he ſhall anſwer for thoſe miſchiefs that come thereby; ſo that a man would have made and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as many Sins, as there be men in <hi>England</hi> that had ſuffered.</p>
            <p>A third Damnation, is to dye in this Lye and with this Perjury in his mouth; whereby he loſes Heaven, and all its enjoyments, and dies in greater Sins than the Devils themſelves.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I ſhould have been guilty of my own Death; For that Judge <hi>Atkins</hi> offered me my Life if I would confeſs what I knew of the Plot, which had I known, and not diſcovered, would have made me the cauſe of my own Death, which would have been a fourth Damnation.</p>
            <p>I would have ſaid more, but that I gave my Speech to a Friend to be Printed.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sheriff.</speaker>
               <p>I pray Sir ſpeak on what you have to ſay, and none ſhall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Johnſon.</speaker>
               <p>Now I have no more to do but to make my Addreſs to Almighty God, with all the powers of my Soul, that I may have his mercy and pardon of my Sins; And therefore I beg that all Catholiques who join in union of this ſame Faith, would make an addreſs unto God for me, that we may receive pardon for our Sins.-I have nothing now but wiſhes left.-I wiſh I may imitate <hi>David</hi> in his Repentance, and <hi>that my eyes may run down with tears, becauſe I have not kept God's Law.</hi> I wiſh with the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, That Rivers of waters may fall from my eyes, by reaſon of ſin,</hi> Lam. <hi>3. 48.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Tears will not be proper for me at this time; I have kept my ſelf from them, leſt by ſhedding Tears, ſome might ſay I was unwilling to dye, or feared Death: But inſtead of Tears, I offer all the Blood in my veins, and I wiſh every drop were an Ocean, and I would offer it up to God. I wiſh I might become a man like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> I wiſh I had <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> penitential Tears; I wiſh I had her arms to embrace the feet of mercy. I wiſh I had all the graces of Saints and Angels, I would offer them all to God for the remiſſion of my ſin. This is my deſire, and this I wiſh for as much as is in me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:39761:9"/>
I offer firſt my Life, and I beſeech and deſire of God to turn his Face from my Sins, but not from me. I offer up my Life in ſatisfaction for my Sins, and for the Catholick Cauſe. And I beg for thoſe that be mine Enemies in this my Death, and I deſire to have them forgiven, becauſe I go to that world of happineſs ſooner than I ſhould have gone. And I humbly beg Pardon from God and the world: And this I beg for the merits and mercy of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I beſeech God to bleſs His Majeſty, to give Him a long Life, a nd a happy Reign in this world, and in the world to come.</p>
               <p>I beſeech God to bleſs all my Benefactors, and all my Friends, and thoſe that have been any way under my charge.</p>
               <p>I beſeech God to bleſs all Catholicks, and this Nation, and His Majeſties Privy Council, and grant that they may Act no otherwiſe than what may be for the glory of God, who will bring to light and to judgment all both good and evil, <hi>Luke 12.</hi> So I beſeech God that he will give them grace to ſerve him.</p>
               <p>I beſeech God to bleſs the Parliament that is now in Election, that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine nothing, but what they themſelves do hope to be judged by at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>I beſeech God to bleſs all that ſuffer under this Perſecution, and to turn this our Captivity into Joy; that they who now ſowe in tears, may reap in joy.</p>
               <p>I beſeech God to accept the death of my Body, and to receive my Soul.</p>

            <p>And becauſe, where God beſtows ſuch a Faith and Hope, it is in order to bring all to a true charity and love of him; for who can have Faith to believe an Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in which he hopes, but he muſt love that Infinite Goodneſs in whom he hopes, which beſtows on him ſuch gifts? therefore all ought to honour God, and ſhew their love to him by a due profeſſion, and a due practice of this Faith, this Hope, and this<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.</note> Believers unto the worlds end, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you, and behold I am with you alwaies even to the end of the world.</hi> Thus much briefly concerning my Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith in which I truly believe in all points infallible, and in confirmation of which one only Faith and Catholick Church, I will and do lay down my life; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will as he ought conſider the Text that proves this Faith and Church of the Living God, to be the pillar and ground of Truth, as 'tis evident it is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. I queſtion not but who I ſay conſiders this, will believe the ſame, our Faith being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by our ſecond Divine Vertue, which is our Chriſtian Hope.</p>
            <p>This Hope is that Vertue which aſſures us, that for the reward of our Faith, and the profeſſion and due practice of it, as we ought, there are thoſe heavenly gifts laid up for the Chriſtian Believers, which neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear hath heard, nor the heart of man can conceive or comprehend, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares: This Hope gives ſuch confidence, that death cannot overcome it, becauſe, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſhall kill me, yet I will hope in him.</hi> Why then ſhall any ſear to die for his Faith, having this Hope? 'Tis for want of making due reflection and uſe of this Hope that cauſes ſo many to be fearful to ſuffer, and makes them fly the field of perſecution, and forſake the banners of their Chriſtian Faith, that all ought to fight under, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39761:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would ſtill fight under, would they make uſe of the divine hope of Gods promiſes, which are ſuch, that as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125. <hi>That he that hopes or truſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in our Lord, ſhall be as Mount Sion, which cannot be removed, but remain for ever. As the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> ſaith God by the mouth of <hi>David, are about</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſo the Lord is round about his people;</hi> that is, ſuch as will place their hope in him, as the Prophet did, and exhorts<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5, 6.</note> us to do the ſame, ſaying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 5, 6. <hi>My ſoul hath hoped in our Lord; from the morning watch, even until night, let</hi> Iſrael <hi>hope in our Lord;</hi> that is, from the beginning of the day of our life, till the night of death; as well in the morning of proſperity, as in the evening of adverſity: becauſe 'tis alſo writ, <hi>God is my Hope for ever;</hi> and whoſoever can truly ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 31. 1. <hi>In thee, O Lord, have I plac'd my Hope,</hi> ſhall be aſſured of what there follows, <hi>Not to be confounded for ever,</hi> becauſe, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hope conſoundeth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a contrary Vice to this Virtue, a worldly Fear that brings all things to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; it makes Worldlings ſwear, and forſwear, and perjure; For which Perjuries and Falſe Oaths, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Judgment ſprings up as Hemlock in the Furrows of the Field.</hi> And therefore Dr. <hi>Thorndick,</hi> in his Book <hi>of just Weights and Meaſures,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Coaction of Oaths is the crying Sin of this Nation, to call down the wrath of God upon the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What better remedy than to ſecure our ſelves againſt all worldly Fears, and theſe enſuing Dangers, but by relying on the hope of future bleſſings, which God, if we fight and ſuffer for his ſake, hath promiſed. God is the God of Hoſts, and we fight under him, and if we truſt in him we are happy, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 5. <hi>O Lord of Hoſts,</hi>

                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 5.</note> 
               <hi>bleſſed is the man that truſts in thee, in whom to hope is to be ſecured;</hi> and therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. <hi>He ſhall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wing ſhalt thou hope,</hi> eſpecially if we fight for our Faith; and therefore he adds in the ſame verſe, <hi>His truth ſhall be thy ſhield and buckler,</hi> if we will hope in him and his reward; For if we hope for our great wages, we ſhall eaſily undergo our little work: As for example, if we hope to drink of the torrent of pleaſure, as God hath promiſed we ſhall in his Kingdom, who will fear to taſte now of the Chalice of ſome ſmall Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? If we hope hereafter to be numbered amongſt the Sons of God, as he hath promiſed we ſhall, and have our lot among the Saints, why ſhould we now fear to be reviled of men, or be reputed ignominious, as our Saviour and his Apoſtles were? If they have, ſo will they do you alſo; the Scholar is not above the Maſter, nor the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant above his Lord. If they call'd the Maſter of the Family <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> ſo will they do his Servants; therefore we muſt with the Apoſtles rejoice, as you read in the <hi>Acts</hi> they did, <hi>becauſe they were accounted worthy to ſuffer contumely and reproaches.</hi> If con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely and reproach ſeem ſo hard for us to undergo now for a good Cauſe, as is our Conſcience before a few Enemies, what contumely muſt thoſe undergo who for now acting againſt their Conſcience, ſhall undergo at the great judgment before God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Saints, Devils, and all the Damn'd in Hell? if for our reproach now we hope that after a ſhort ſorrow, God will honour us ſo, as to wipe away with his own hand every tear from our eyes, as he promiſeth in the <hi>Revelations</hi> he will; and that henceforth <hi>there ſhall be neither grief, nor Labour, nor pain,</hi> or the like; why ſhould any now grieve either to ſee himſelf or others ſuffer? It will not laſt, this Tempeſt will ſoon be over, and if now in this Storm the ſmall veſſel of my Body ſuffer ſhipwrack, or ſome others the like veſſels, if our Souls can but carry off our goods of Faith, Hope and Charity, all is very well; For as ſoon as the veſſels of our Bodies ſink, our Souls will come to ſhore at the Land of Promiſe, and we ſhall be ſecured in the Rock which is Chriſt, and ever remain ſafe in the eternal Hills, where neither winds nor waves of Perſecution can ever reach to aſſault us: then welcome ſhipwrack, that ſinks the veſſel of the Body, to bring the Paſſengers and their Goods ſo happily to the Haven, the Heaven of Bliſs.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore weigh theſe things in a prudential Balance, and ſee which Scale is the heavieſt, of preſent Fears, or future Hopes; of preſent Sufferings, or future Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Let us remember our Saviours words to his Apoſtles, <hi>You are thoſe that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me in my temptations or tryals;</hi> for which, ſaid he, their reward was, he diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Kingdom of Heaven to them; Partners in Sufferings, Partners in Glovles: which if well conſidered, we ſhall ſay with St. <hi>Paul, The ſufferings of this preſent time are not condign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or of equality to the future glory which ſhall be revealed in us;</hi> and we ſhall with his joyful Spirit ſay, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 17. <hi>Our light affliction, which is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, worketh in us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> 'Tis a happy weight that lifts both Sufferings and Sufferers up as high as Heaven, to eternal Crowns, of which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39761:11"/>
we are all aſſured of as a reward for our Faith, if we will make good uſe of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hope; which that we may the better do, let us endeavor to help our ſelves by the third and greateſt Virtue that follows our Faith and Hope, which is Charity.</p>
            <p>This is that greateſt Virtue of which all ſorts of Chriſtians ſpeak much, underſtand<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> little, and practiſe leſs; though without the practice of it, 'tis in vain for any to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have a ſaving Faith, or Hope; for as <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Though he ſpeak with the tongues of Men and Angels, and have not Charity, he is but as ſounding braſs;</hi> and although he ſhould know all Myſteries, and have Faith to remove Mountains; and though he ſhould have ſuch hope, underſtand for reward, <hi>that he ſhould give all to the Poor, and deliver his body to burn, and yet not have charity, it profiteth nothing. Charity,</hi> as he ſaith, ver. 7. <hi>ſuffereth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, beareth all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do all that pretend to Charity do thus? If to ſpeak with the tongues of Angels without Charity be nothing but vanity, what Charity is there in thoſe that ſpeak with the tongues of Detraction, Scandal, Slander, Falſe-witneſs and Perjuries againſt their Neighbors? If thoſe that give all to the Poor may want Charity, ſo that all which they give profits them nothing, what Charity is there in thoſe that take all from their Neighbors, to force them to forſake their Faith? If Alms profit nothing without Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, can ſuch Injuries profit Perſecutors, that take all away-againſt Charity? If a man may give his own Body to burn, and yet be cold in Charity, what Charity is there to kill others Bodies, take away their Lives with ignominy and violence, becauſe they will not kill their own Souls, by acting againſt God and their Conſcience? If Charity conſiſts only in thoſe that ſuffer all things, believe all things, hope all things, what Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is there in thoſe who will make their Neighbor ſuffer all things of Perſecution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe and hope according to their Conſcience, and profeſs their Faith and Hope as they are bound before God upon their ſalvation ſo to do?</p>
            <p>'Tis certain, that though men may pretend perſecution of others for Gods ſake, to reduce others to him, yet 'tis evident that for any Kingdom to perſecute any, meerly for Conſcience-ſake, is againſt the Law of God; and therefore whil'ſt they would ſeem ſo zealouſly to keep the firſt Command, <hi>of loving God above all,</hi> and force others to conform to their opinions, they break the ſecond Command, becauſe <hi>they do not love their Neighbor as themſelves,</hi> becauſe they perſecute them, and ſo they daſh one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment againſt the other, and ſo crack both Commandments together: For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the ſecond Command is broke, by not loving our Neighbor as our ſelves, the firſt is broke with it, becauſe did they love God above all, they would do better by their Neighbor.</p>
            <p>But I do not come here to beat down others pretence to Charity, but endeavour to advance Charity in my ſelf and others; and the way to do this, is not to reckon what others have not done according to Charity, but to call to mind what others have done to raiſe Charity towards God and their Neighbors.</p>
            <p>We read in Holy Writ, that <hi>Moſes</hi> love was ſo to God and his Neighbor, that to repurchaſe a Peace and Charity 'twixt God and the People after they had offended, he deſired that his own name ſhould rather be blotted out of the Book of life, than that the Peoples names ſhould not be put in, by obtaining Forgiveneſs; and therefore he ſaith to God, <hi>Either ſpare the People, or blot me out of the Book which thou hast writ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How ſuperlative a Motive is this, to move Chriſtians to a perfect Charity towards their Neighbors; well may a Chriſtian be willing to lay down his temporal life for good example ſake, rather than offend God, and ſcandalize others by deſerting his Faith; ſince others could be willing to hazard their eternal lives, to reduce their Neighbors to God by Charity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The like examples of love to God and his Neighbors, we have in St.</hi> Paul, <hi>in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold expreſſions both towards God and men; firſt to God, as</hi> Rom. <hi>8. where he</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> 
               <hi>makes this Proclamation,</hi> Who ſhall, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> ſeparate us from the Charity of Chriſt? Shall Tribulation, or Diſtreſs, or Perſecution, or Famine, or Nakedneſs, or Peril, or Sword? As it is written, for thy ſake we are kill'd all the day long, we are accounted as ſheep to the ſlaughter. <hi>He adds,</hi> I am certain that neither Death nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor Powers, nor things preſent nor things to come, nor heigth, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</p>
            <p>And for this Charity in order to his Neighbor, let what he ſuffered to ſerve them teſtifie, as he relates, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. by being in Labors and Stripes, in Priſon, in Death, in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39761:11"/>
Scourgings, in Shipwracks, being day and night in the bottom of the Sea, in Perils, in<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> Wearineſs, in Painfulneſs, in Hunger, in Thirſt, in Faſting, in Cold and Wearineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what he ſuffered through his care of all Churches, <hi>ver.</hi> 28, 29. where he ſaith, <hi>Who is weak, and I am not weak?</hi> underſtand by compaſſion, as Fellow-ſufferer; <hi>Who is ſcandalized, and I burn not?</hi> underſtand by zeal. Let thoſe now conſider this, who never more rejoyce than now, when they ſee their paſſive Neighbors ſcandalized, and were never better content in their own apprehenſions than now, when they behold us ſuffering, though before God we are innocent. Were St. <hi>Paul</hi> on earth again, he would rather give himſelf for others, to eaſe them of their ſufferings, according to his wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15.</note> charity expreſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15. ſaying, <hi>I will very gladly ſpend and be ſpent for you:</hi> and he would rejoyce to ſuffer in charity for his Neighbor, as he abundantly declares,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Rom</hi> 9. 3.</note> 
               <hi>accurſed from Christ for my Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtians do not then henceforth ſo eaſily ruine your Neighbors, neither in their Lives, nor Eſtates, or Credits, by Perſecutions and Scandals, the Scripture holds forth no ſuch Doctrine, nor gives any ſuch examples, but, as you ſee, the contrary; but if our Perſecutors will not imitate theſe examples, let us that are perſecuted and ſuffer endeavor to imitate them, by chooſing rather to loſe all we can call our own in this World, and Life alſo, rather than to break Charity to God and our Neighbor, either by denying or diſſembling our Faith, and ſcandalizing the Church, or bearing falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt our ſelves, or our Neighbors, to ſave our Lives or Fortunes, or enrich our ſelves by falſe Witneſs.</p>
            <p>And if we will put in practice the Virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity I have ſpoke of, we ought to do it thus; what we profeſs by words, we muſt confirm by deeds and actions. Our profeſſion of Catholick Faith is this, I believe all Divine Revelations delivered to the Prophets and Apoſtles, propoſed by the Catholick Church in Her General Councils, or by Her Univerſal Practice to be believed as an Article of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, knowing this to be our Faith, the confirmation of this knowledge, or the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8.</note> practice of this by our deeds, is, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>To eſteem all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things as dirt, in reſpect of this eminent knowledge of Christ and his Faith;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for my own part, I now being ready to leave all in the World, and my Life in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of my Catholick Faith, which I profeſs I deſire and hope to manifeſt to all, I value my knowledge of Chriſts Faith, more than I value the univerſal World.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15.</note> And as for my Chriſtian Hope I profeſs to have, the confirmation of it, or the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical part is to be fulfilled thus, being that we muſt, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Be always ready to give an account to every one concerning the hope which is in us.</hi> I have already by words expreſſed it, and by deed I expreſs it thus; That whereas I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God, as the Scripture ſaith, kills, and brings to life again;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> carrieth down to the depth, and bringeth back again; ſo now I do by this my preſent Execution, which I am now to undergo, willingly give my Body to be mortified in death for my Faith, hoping in Gods infinite mercy he will reſtore my Body and Soul to eternal life; and I do willingly reſign my ſelf to be carried down to my Grave, hoping by my Saviours Croſs and Paſſion, Death and Burial, he will raiſe me up again to a glorious Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>And as for the confirmation of my Charity, to ſhew by deeds, the love I owe to God and my Neighbor, it hath pleaſed my Saviour by his own words to declare which is the beſt proof or practice of Charity, where he ſaith, <hi>No man hath a greater Charity, than he that lays down his life for his Friend.</hi> I therefore do willingly undergo this death I am to ſuffer now, to teſtifie I love my Friend, my Neighbor as my ſelf; whil'ſt I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo this death for my ſelf and them, that ſeeing it is for the profeſſion of my Faith I dye, they, whil'ſt they live, may the more happily ſerve God in the ſame belief; and I teſtifie I love God above all, becauſe I forſake the World and my ſelf in death, rather than offend him by doing any thing againſt my Conſcience.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as for theſe many years I have had occaſion by diſcourſing and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Scriptures with others who deſired to find out the true Faith, I have by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39761:12"/>
words declared what Faith I did believe, and what Faith they ought to believe; I now declare that for every Point of Faith that ever I believ'd my ſelf, or read to others, or told them that they might believe as a Point of Faith; for all and every ſuch Points of Faith, in confirmation of them, as well to my ſelf as others, I here lay down my Life; and omitting all other particular Points, I believe Obedience to our King to be a Divine Law, and that we are bound to obey His Commands in Temporal Laws; and I believe it too a ſin of Damnation, for any Subject of His to Rebel againſt Him, or His Kingdom; and I believe it as certain a ſin to Damnation, for any Subject to endeavor, either by thoughts, words or deeds, to take away His Life, or act any thing of that nature, either by himſelf, or any others, or other againſt His Sacred Majeſty, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was a ſin in <hi>Judas</hi> to Damnation to betray Chriſt. And I do declare upon my ſalvation that I never did, nor do know any Catholick, that ever was or is the leaſt guilty, either by thought, word or deed, by any Plot or otherwiſe, to have any deſign or concurrence to kill His Sacred Majeſty, or rebel againſt His Kingdom, whom God long preſerve with his Subjects in all happineſs in this World, and crown Him in the World to come with eternal glory.</p>
            <p>And now it remains, that with all the powers and forces of my Soul, I make my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to God for mercy ere I appear before him for Judgment; and you, dear Friends, here preſent, who believe in one Holy Catholick Church, and Communion of Saints, be pleaſed in charity to make the ſame addreſs to God with me, and for me, that we may obtain true ſorrow and repentance for all our ſins, and a merciful forgiveneſs; and<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 8.</note> firſt let us wiſh from the bottom of our hearts, that we could expreſs and make good our ſorrow, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Whil'ſt rivers of waters run down our eyes like his, becauſe we have not kept according to our ſaith Gods commands;</hi> for which had we that Fountain of tears which the Prophet wiſhed for, we ought ſpend it all; we ought with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Lam. 3. 48, 49. to weep till our eyes, as his, failed and as his eye with tears afflicted, as he ſaith his heart, ſo ought ours to do, becauſe we have made ſo ill uſe of that Faith, Hope and Charity, which God hath beſtowed upon us.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as Tears now at this preſent, and in theſe circumſtances of raſh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring times, Tears, I ſay, from me, might ſeem to ſome, either the off-ſpring of Fear to dye, which God forbid I ſhould have in ſo good a Cauſe as my Religion; or leſt others might judge my Tears might fall by reaſon of ſome other guilt, of which I am free and innocent, I have endeavoured to ſtop the courſe of Tears, and inſtead of drops of waters from my eyes, I'll ſpend the drops of blood from every ſorrowful vein of my heart, and my whole body, that God may pleaſe to waſh away the ſins of all my life paſt, and I wiſh each drop an Ocean for my ſelf and all the World, becauſe I have nothing now left more than wiſhes, which I beſeech thee, O gracious God, of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to accept of; and if you will vouchſafe to accept of wiſhes to ſupply the deeds, by wiſhes I offer up all that's good to you, that ever you gave to any ſince the Worlds Creation; I offer up <hi>David</hi>'s broken heart, together with my own, that ſo like him, after my repentance, I may become a man according to your own heart. I offer up the ſighs of <hi>Magdalen,</hi> and wiſh I could make ſuch uſe of them as ſhe did, to ſob out my ſins. I wiſh her repentant Arms, that I may lay faſt hold at the Feet of thee my gracious God.</p>
            <p>I wiſh I had the longanimity of all the Holy Confeſſors.</p>
            <p>I wiſh I had the ſufferings of all thy conſtant Martyrs.</p>
            <p>I wiſh I had the lamps of all thy ſacred Virgins, that I might offer all to thee that in them was pleaſant in thy ſight.</p>
            <p>I wiſh I could offer up to thee, O God, the Sacrifices of juſt <hi>Abel, Lot, Job,</hi> and all other Sacrifices that ever did gratefully aſcend up in thy ſight; that thou being pleaſed by the ſight of them, thou mightſt look no more upon my ſins: For if thou wilt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve iniquities, who ſhall endure? let therefore thy mercy hide thy face from my ſins, but let not the rigor of thy juſtice caſt me away from thy preſence; caſt me not away from thy Face, and thy holy Spirit take not from me, but turn away thy Face from ſin, and blot out all my iniquities, and I will offer my Body as a Sacrifice to thee by death to appeaſe thy juſt anger.</p>
            <p>I own my ſins, and I own your mercies. You gave me Faith to know and believe what was the Will of you my heavenly Maſter, but I acknowledge my fault, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I knew your Will, I did not fulfill it, and therefore I ought to be beaten with many ſtripes, becauſe you foretold me, that many are the ſtripes of a ſinner; but be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39761:12"/>
pleaſed, dear Lord, alſo to remember, that in the ſame place you promiſed, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, yet mercy ſhould encompaſs him that hopes; you have given your Divine Hope, vouchſafe to let this Hope defend me; and although I know I have not made good uſe of Hope, and Hope not well us'd, of which I am guilty, makes a Sinner defer Repentance, and ſo puts in danger to fall into Preſumption by long neglect, yet the laſt hour of calling being not yet paſt, and your mercy being above all your works, I hope and humbly beg to be Partaker with thoſe who were accepted at the laſt hour.</p>
            <p>I humbly acknowledge with thanks, O gracious God, that you gave me Charity as your Livery, in which I always ought to have appeared in your ſight, and never to have been diveſted of it; but how oft have I been ſpoiled, through my own fault, of this garment? how oft have I, by deſcending to <hi>Jericho,</hi> inſtead of going up to <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> how oft, I ſay, have I been rob'd of this garment of Charity? even as often as I have preferred any ſublunary object, and the love of that before the love of you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your goodneſs, which is above all goodneſs, and the object of all Beatitude.</p>
            <p>Vouchſafe again, O gracious Lord, to reſtore in mercy to me this Nuptial Veſtment, ere I dare appear at the Supper of the Lamb. Make me, O heavenly Father, a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Prodigal, and then I ſhall have put on me again this beſt Robe of Charity.</p>
            <p>This I beg from the bottom of my Soul for his dear ſake, who was deveſted of his garments out of Charity, that I might be inveſted in his Charity, who alſo ſuffered his garments to be divided, that he might purchaſe grace, that we might never be divided from the unity of his Faith and Church, but rather willingly ſuffer for his ſake the ſeparation of our lives from our bodies the ſeparation of our bodies from our ſouls, and the ſeparation of our bodies into its quarters, that we may the more perfectly by theſe ſufferings and ſeparations from our ſelves be united to him.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the faithful communion and perfect union of the ſufferings of all Saints that ever have been, or now are, or ever will be, in the union of the moſt ſacred merits of the life, paſſions and death of God and man, my dear Redeemer and Saviour Chriſt, I offer my ſelf willingly to what I am now to ſuffer, begging by all that's good in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth, remiſſions of ſins for my ſelf and all the world, particularly for all that may appear to have been my Enemies in the concern of my Life, as Witneſs, Jury, Judge, and others, whom I do not eſteem as Enemies, but as the beſt of Friends; I heartily forgive them, and beg the beſt of Bleſſings for them all, as being the cauſe of ſending me ſooner than otherwiſe I might have gone, to the happy ſtate of Hope for the other World. Whither, before I go I humbly beg pardon of all in this World, for whatever in thoughts, words or deeds I have committed to offend them, or omitted to do for them, by which any thing might have been mended in them, or my ſelf, I beſeech God to bleſs them all.</p>
            <p>I beſeech God to bleſs alſo all my Friends, ſpiritual and temporal; all Benefactors; and all by whom I have received good or evil, by words, deeds or deſires.</p>
            <p>I beſeech God to bleſs all thoſe of whom I ever had care or charge ſpiritually or temporally.</p>
            <p>I beſeech God bleſs his Holy Catholick Church, and our chief Biſhop thereof, with all other Biſhops, Prieſts and Clergy.</p>
            <p>I beſeech God bleſs this Nation, and unite all amongſt themſelves and to God, in true Faith, Hope and Charity.</p>
            <p>I beſeech God to bleſs His Majeſties Privy Council and make all the ſecrets of their hearts and their deſires ſuch, as that both <hi>Charles</hi> our King on earth, and God our great King in Heaven and Earth, may be ſerv'd, pleas'd and honour'd by them, that men and Angels may rejoyce at it now, and be publick witneſs of it at the laſt great day, at the great and laſt Council Table, where <hi>every ſecret ſhall be laid open,</hi> Luke 12. as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ. ult. when God will bring into judgment every ſecret thing, whether it be good or evil.</hi>

I beſeech God to bleſs the Parliament now Elect, and be ſo preſent with them when they ſit to judge and diſcuſs the Cauſes of this Nation, they may imitate the Aſſembly of thoſe that are to ſit upon the Twelve Thrones at the laſt great Aſſembly, that they may now judge or determinate of things no otherwiſe than they hope or fear then to be judged themſelves, and determined of to all eternity.</p>
            <p>I beſeech God to bleſs all that ſuffer in this Perſecution, and let the bleſſing expreſt in the 126th <hi>Pſalm</hi> light upon them ſpeedily, that God turning their Captivity, all mouths may be filled with joys, and tongues with ſingings. Convert, O Lord, our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, as ſtreams in the South, that thoſe who now ſowe in tears, may reap in joy; and for this temporal death, O bleſſed Trinity, give me eternal life; let my Body dye to the World for the love of thee, that my Soul may live for ever, and love in thee my God and dear Redeemer <hi>Amen.</hi> Sweet Jeſus <hi>Amen.</hi>
