            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
LETTER VVRIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TFN
BY A GENTLEMAN
OF GOOD WORTH, TO
the Author of this booke.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, I haue heard much of
your house, of your picturs,
of your walks, of your po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,
and of your two boats, that
came one by land, and the
other by sea, from Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don bridge, and met
both at Bath bridge: all which God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
(if I liue another sommer) I will come
of purpose to see; as also a swimming
place, where if one may beleeue your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fraunces, Diana did bath her, and
Acteon see her without hornes. But to
deale plainly with you, there be three spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
things that I haue heard much boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
of, and therefore would willingliest
see. The one a fountaine sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding on pillers,<note place="margin">43. Can.</note>
like that in Ariosto, vnder which you may
dine and suppe; the second a shooting
close with a xij score marke to euery point
<pb facs="tcp:4043:3"/>
of the card, in which I heare you haue hit
a marke that many shoote at, viz: to make
a barren stony la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fruitfull with a litle cost;
the third is a thing that I cannot name wel
without saue-reuerence, and yet it sounds
not vnlike the shooting place, but it is
in plaine English a shiting place. Though,
if it be so sweete and so cleanely as I
heare, it is a wrong to it to vse saue reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
for one told me, it is as sweet as my
parlor, and I would think discourtesie, one
should say, saue reuerence my parlor. But
if I might entreate you (as you partly
promist me at your last being here) to set
downe the maner of it in writing, so plaine
as our grosse wittes here may vnderstand
it, or to cause your man M. Combe (who
I vnderstand can paint prettilie) make a
draught, or plot thereof to be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued,
you should make many of your
friends much beholding to you, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you might cause reformation in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
houses that you wish well vnto, that
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ill thinke no scorne to follow your good
example. Nay to tell you my opinion se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouslie,
if you haue so easie, so cheape,
and so infallible a way for auoiding such
<pb facs="tcp:4043:3"/>
annoiances in great houses: you may not
onelie pleasure manie great persons, but
doe her Maiestie good seruice in her pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of Greenwitch and other stately hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that are oft annoyed with such sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
as where many mouthes be fed can
hardly be auoided. Also you might be a
great benefactor to the Citie of London,
and all other populous townes, who stand
in great need of such conuayances. But all
my feare is, that your pen hauing beene
inured to so high a discourse,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of Dames, of Knights, of armes, of loues delight,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>will now disdaine to take so base a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of vaults, of sinkes, priuies &amp; draughts to write.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But herein let a publicke benefit expell
a priuat bashfulnesse, and if you must now
and then breake the rules <hi>de slouilitate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
with some of these homelie wordes,
you see I haue broken the ise to you, and
you know the old saying, pens maie blot,
but they cannot blush. And as old Tarlton
was wont to saie, this same excellent
word saue-reuerence, makes it all maner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
Once this I dare assure you, if you can
but tell a homelie tale of this in prose as
<pb facs="tcp:4043:4"/>
cleanlie, as you haue told in verse a baudy
tale or two in Orlando mannerly, it may
passe among the sowrest censurers verie
currantly. And thus expecting your
aunswer hereto, at your conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
leysure, I commit
you to God this of
1596.</p>

            <head>THE ANSWER
TO THE LETTER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y good Cosin, if you haue heard
so well of my poore house with
the apurtenaunces, it were to be
wished for preseruation of your
better conceit thereof; that you
would not see them at all, they will seeme to
you so far short of the report: for I do compare
my buildings and my writings together, in
which though the common sort thinke there
is some worth and witte, yet the grauer Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers
do finde many faults and follies; And
no maruell for he that builds and hath gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
litle, and writes and hath read litle, must
needes be a bad builder, and a worse writer.
But wher as you are disposed either in the way
of praise, or of play, to extoll so much the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
roome of my house, as though you prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it afore the best; your commendation is
not much vnlike his curtesie, that being inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by a crabbed-fauourd host to a neat house,
did spit in his hostes face, because it was the
fowlest part of the house. But such as I haue
you shall be welcome to, and if I may know
<pb facs="tcp:4043:5"/>
when you will begin your progresse, I will pray
my brother to be your guide, who will direct
your iestes in such sort, as first you shall come
by a fine house that lackes a mistresse, then
to a faire house that mournes for a maister,
from whence, by a straight waie called the
<hi>force</hi> way, you shall come to a towne that is
more then a towne, where be the waters that
be more then waters. But from thence you
shall passe downe a streame that seemes to be
no streame by corn fields that seeme no fields,
downe a street no street, in at a gate no gate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
a bridge no bridge, into a court no court,
where if I be not at home, you sall finde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a foole no foole.</p>
            <p>But where as you praise my husbandry, you
make me remember an old schoole fellow of
mine in Cambridge, that hauing lost fiue shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
abroad at Cardes, would boast he had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
two candels at home by being out of his
chamber, for such be most of my sauings. Yet
this one point of husbandrie, though it maie
well be called beggerly: yet it is not for all that
contemptible, &amp; thus it was. Finding a faire
and flat field, though verie stonie, as all this
countrey is: I made some vagrant beggers (of
which by neighbourhood of the Bathes, here
<pb facs="tcp:4043:5"/>
comes great store) to gather all the stones that
might breake our arrowes, and finding an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
meane to water the ground with a fat wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I haue bettered my ground (as you say) and
quite rid me of my wandring guests, who will
rather walk seuen mile about, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come where
they shall be forst to worke one halfe houre.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, to come to the chiefe point of your
desire, which requires a more ample answer,
but for a preamble you must be content with
this. You tell me, belike to encourage me, that
my inuention maie be beneficiall, not onely to
my priuate friends, but to townes and Cities,
yea euen to her Maiesties seruice for some of
her houses: trust me I doe beleeue you write
seriouslie as you terme it herein, and for my
part I am so wholly addicted to her hignesse
seruice, as I would be glad, yea euen proud, if
the highest straine of my wit, could but reach,
to anie note of true harmonie in the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
of her Maiesties seruice, though it were
in the basest key that it could be tuned to.
And if I should fortune to effect so good a
reformation, in the Pallace of Richmond, or
Greenewich (to which Pallace, manie of vs
owe seruice for the tenure of our land) I doubt
not but some pleasa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t witted courtier of either
<pb facs="tcp:4043:6"/>
sex<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> would grace me so much at least; as to say,
that I were worthy for my rare inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, to be
made one of the Priuy (and after a good long
parenthesis) come out with chamber, or if they
be learned &amp; haue read <hi>Castalios Courtier,</hi>
they will say, I am a proper scholer, and well
seene in <hi>latrina lingua.</hi> But let them mocke
that list, <hi>qui moccat moccabitur.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>Who strike with sword, the scabbeted them may strike:</l>
            <l>And sure loue eraueth loue, like asketh like.</l>
            <p>If men of iudgement thinke it may breede
a publike benefite, the conceit thereof shall
expell all priuate bashfulnesse; and I will
herein follow the example of that noble La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that to saue the liberties of Couentry, rode
naked at noone through the streetes thereof,<note place="margin">Camden in his Brita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nia.</note>
and is now thought to be greatly honored, and
nothing shamed thereby.</p>
            <p>Further whereas you embolden my pen,
not to be abasht at the basenesse of the subiect
and as it were leading me on the way, you tell
me you haue broken the y<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e for me, to enter me
into such broad phrases, as you thinke must
be frequent herein: I will follow your steppes
and your counsell, neither will I disdaine to
vse the poore helpe of saue reuerence if neede
be, much like as a good friend of yours and
<pb facs="tcp:4043:6"/>
mine, that beginning to dispraise as honest
a man as him selfe, to a great Noble man,
said, he is the veryest knaue, sauing your
Lordship: But the noble man (ere the wordes
were fully out of his mouth,) said, saue thy self
knaue or be hangd, saue not me. Euen so I must
write in this discourse, sometime indeede as
homely (sauing your vvorship) as you shall
lightly see, and yet I will endeuour to keepe me
within the boundes of modestie, and vse no
wordes, but such as graue presidents in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
Law, Phisicke, or good Ciuilitie, will
sufficiently warrant me.</p>
            <p>Sure I am that many other country<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

&amp;c. so my discourse must needes be Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectonicall
to his, sith I treat of the house it
self, and he but of part of that is to be done in
the house, &amp; that no essentiall part of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse:
<q>for they say there be three things that
if one neglect to do them,<note place="margin">This may be omitted in reading.</note> they will do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
one is for a man to make euen his reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
for who so neglects it will be left euen
iust nothing; as other is to mary his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
for if the parents bestow them not, they
will bestow them selues; the third is that,
which the foresaide French man writes of:
which they that omit, their lawndresses shall
<pb facs="tcp:4043:7"/>
finde it done in their linnen. VVhich mishap
a faire Lady once hauing, a seruing ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
disposition of Mydas Barber, that could not
kepe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell had spyed it, &amp; wrate in the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
termes it could be exprest, vppon a wall,
what he had seen, but a certaine pleasant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
Gentleman, corrected the barbarisme,
adding rime to the reason in this sort.</q>

            <l>
               <q>My Ladie hath polluted her lineall vesture,</q>

            <p>But soft, I feare I giue you too great a tast
of my slouenly eloquence, in this sluttish argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
VVherefore to conclude, I dare vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
that though my discourse will not be so
wise as the first of those seuen I spake of, that
praises folly: yet it shall be ciuiller then the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
truer then the third, honester then the
fourth: chaster the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sift, modester then the
sixt, and clenlier then the seuenth. And that
you and other of my good friends may take the
lesse offence at it, I will cloth it (like an Ape
in purple,) that it may be admitted into the
better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany: and if all the art I haue cannot
make it mannerly enough, the worst punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
it can haue, is but to employ it in the house
it shall treat of, only crauing but that fauour,
that a noble man was wont to request of your
<pb facs="tcp:4043:8"/>
good father in law, to teare out my name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be so employed; and to him that would
deny me that kindnesse, I would the paper
were nettles, and the letters needles for his
better ease: or that it were like to the Friers
booke, dedicated as I take it to <hi>Pius quintus;</hi>
of which one writes merily, that his holinesse
finding it was good for nothing else, imployed
it (in steed of the goose necke) to a homely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation,
and forsooth the phrase was so rude,
the stile so rugged, and the Latin so barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
that therewith as he writes, <hi>scortigauit
sedem Apostolicam.</hi> He galled the seat A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicke:
and so I commend me to you, till
I send you the whole discourse.</p>

TO THE READER OF
the Metamorphω-sis of AIAX.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat Captaine AIAX, as is
well knowen to the learned,
and shall here be published
for the vnlearned, was a
warrier of Graecia; strong,
headdy, rash, boisterous, and a terrible
fighting fellow, but neither wise, learned,
staide, nor Polliticke. Wherefore falling
to bate with Vlisses, &amp; receiuing so fowle
a disgrace of him,<note place="margin">Ouid. Meta. lib. 12.</note> to be called foole afore
company, and being bound to the peace,
that he might not fight with so great a
Counseller; he could indure it no longer,
but became a perfit mal-content, viz. his
hat without a band, his hose without gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
his wast without a girdle, his bootes
without spurs, his purse without coine, his
head without wit, and thus swearing he
would kill &amp; slay; first he killed all the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
beasts he met, which made Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
and Menelaus now, more affraid then
Vlisses, whereupon he was banished the
townes presently, and then he went to the
<pb facs="tcp:4043:9"/>
woods and pastures, and imagining all the
fat sheepe he met, to be of kin to the cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
Vlisses, because they ran awaie from
him, he massacred a whole flocke of good
nott Ewes. Last of all hauing no bodie else
to kill, poore man killed him selfe; what
became of his body is vnknowen, some say
that wolues and beares did eate it, and that
makes them yet such enemies to sheepe
and cattell.<note place="margin">Lib. supra dicto.</note> But his bloud as testifieth <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidius</hi>
the excellent Historiographer, was
turnd into a Hiacint, which is a verie nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
kinde of grasse or flower.</p>
            <p>Now there are many miracles to be
marked in this Metamorphosis, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the credite of the same: for in the
grasse it selfe remaines such pride of this
noble bloud, that as the grasiers haue assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me of their credits, (and some of them
may be trusted for 100000 poundes) the
ruther beastes that eate too greedily here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
will swell til they burst, the poore sheep
still for an old grudge, would eate him
without salt (as they saie) but if they doe,<note place="margin">Salt reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers baned sheepe.</note>
they will soone after rot with it.</p>

not be perswaded: but in further contempt

on Pilgrimage in hope of remedy hereof
to Iapana, neare Chyna: where he met a
<pb facs="tcp:4043:10"/>
French Surgeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the vniuersity of Miaco

in his trauell, vpon the coast of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Aethiopia; and so he came back again
by <hi>Restinga des ladrones,</hi> through <hi>S. Lazaro,</hi>
and crossing both the Tropicks, <hi>Cancer</hi> &amp;
<hi>Capricorne,</hi> he came by <hi>Magellanes,</hi> swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
he found no straights there; but came
from thence straight home. And so in 24.
houres saile, and two or three od years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
he accomplished his voyage, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
to take fresh wine &amp; water at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
de bona speranza.</hi> Yet ere he could reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
his healthfully, he was faine to make
diuerse vowes (for now he was growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very
religious with his long trauell.) Among
which one was, that in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
of all meats, he would honor the Chine
of beefe most: an other was, that of all offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the house, he should doe honour to
that house of office, where he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that scorne to AIAX: and that there,
he should neuer vse any more such fine
grasse, but rather, teare a leafe out of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linsheds
Chronicles, or some of the books
<pb facs="tcp:4043:10"/>
that lie in the hall; then to commit such a
sin against AIAX. Wherefore immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
on his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming home, he built a sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
priuy, and in the most conspicuous
place thereof, namely iust ouer the doore;
he erected a statue of AIAX, with so grim
a countenance, that the aspect of it being
full of terror, was halfe as good as a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor:
and further to honour him, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the name of the house, &amp; called it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the name of this noble Captaine of the
greasie ones (the Grecians I should say) A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IAX:
though since, by ill pronunciation,
and by a figure called <hi>Cacophonia,</hi> the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

            <p>By all which you may see, that it is but
lacke of learning, that makes some fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
seeke out stale English Etymologies
of this renowmed name of AIAX. One
imagined, it was called so of blacke iacks;
because they looke so slouenly, that a mad
French man wrote, we did cary our drinke
in our bootes: but that is but a bald Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology,
and I will neuer agree, that Iacke,
though he were neuer so blacke, should be
thus slaundered. But if you stand so much
vpon your English, and will not admitte
our Greeke, and our Romane tongue, you
shall see I will cast about, to haue one in
English for you. First then, you haue heard
the old prouerbe (age breedes aches) now
you must imagine, that an old man, almost
<pb facs="tcp:4043:13"/>
pound with an vgly Mopsa, sayd, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a greatsigh; Oh, what a match were
this, were the woman away? But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
that shall be hereafter discouered, will
so confound this Gentleman with the
strong breath, that saue we cary about vs
some traytors, that are ready to take his
part, he should neuer be able so much as
to blow vpon you. Yet I would haue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
readers (of what sort soeuer) thus
farre satisfied, that I tooke not this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
vppon me voluntarily, but rather in
mine owne defence; and standing vpon
the <hi>puntilio</hi> of honour, hauing bene cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged,
as you may partly see in the letter
precedent, by one, as it seemes, of the
Captaines owne countrey-men: for his
name is <hi>Philostilpnos,</hi> which I thought at
first, was a word to coniure a spirite, till at
last, a fellow of mine of Cambridge, told
me the <hi>Philo</hi> was Greeke, and that he
would say in English, that he loueth clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.
Now I being bound by the Duello,
hauing accepted the challenge, to seeke
no aduantage, but euen to deale with him
at his owne weapon, entred the lists with
him, and fighting after the old English
<pb facs="tcp:4043:13"/>
maner without the stockados, (for to voine
or strike below the girdle, we counted it
base and too cowardly) after halfe a score
downright blowes, we grew to be friends,
and I was content to subscribe, Yours &amp;c.
And to the end I may aunswer him in the
same language, I am called <hi>Misacmos,</hi>
which is cosin and ally to his name, and it
signifies a hater of filthinesse, and to all
such as are of kin to either of our names or

               <p>I feare the homely title prefixed to this
Treatise (how warlicke a sound so euer it
hath) may breed a worse offence, in some
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4043:15"/>
of the finer sort of readers; who may vpon
much more iust occasion condemne it,
as a noysome and vnsauory discourse: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
without any error of equiuocation,
I meane indeede, to write of the same that
the word signifies. But if it might please
them a litle better to consider, how the
place we treate of (how homely soeuer) is
visited by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, once at least in foure

good, and their constitution sound; then I
hope they will do me that fauor, and them

teaching their own ease, and cleanlinesse,
for the homelinesse of the name; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
they will excuse all broad phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of speech, incident to such a matter,
with the old English prouerbe that endes
thus; <hi>For Lords and Ladies doe the same.</hi> I
know that the wiser sort of men will consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
&amp; I wish that the ignorant sort would
learn; how it is not the basenesse, or home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
either of wordes, or matters, that
make them foule and obscenous, but their
base mindes, filthy conceites, or lewd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents

               <p>Surely, if we would enter into a sober
and sad consideration of our estates, euen
of the happiest sort of vs, as men of the
world esteeme vs; whether we be noble, or
rich, or learned, or beautifull, or healthy,
or all these (which seldome happeneth)
ioyned together we shall obserue, that the
ioyes we enioy in this world, consist rather
<hi>in indolentia</hi> (as they call it) which is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding
of grieuances and inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
then in possessing any passing great
pleasures; so durable are the harmes, that
our first parentes fall hath layd on vs, and
so poore the helpes that we haue in our
selues: finally so short, and momentany
the contentments that we fish for, in this
Ocean of miseries, which either we misse,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4043:16"/>
(fishing before the net, as the prouerbe is)
or if we catch them they proue but like
Eeles, sleight and slipperie. The chiefest of
all our sensuall pleasures, I meane that
which some call the sweet sinne of letche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
though God knowes, it hath much
sowre sawce to it; for which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
many hazard both their fame, their
fortune, their friendes, yea their soules;
which makes them so oft breake the sixt
Commaundement, that when they heare
it read at Church, they leaue the wordes
of the Communion booke, and say, <hi>Lord
haue mercie vpon vs, it grieues our hearts
to keepe this Law.</hi> And when the Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

                  <hi>he hem;</hi> I

much in request, and counted such a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall

a most honorable person, by a man of
middle age, strong constitution, and well
practised in this occupation, to haue bred
no more delectation to him (after the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4043:16"/>
first heate of his youth was past) then to go
to a good easie close stoole, when he had a
lust thereto (for that was his very phrase.)
Which being confessed by him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by many; makes me take this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
thereof in the beginning of this
discourse,<note place="margin">Aiak's house preferred before a ba<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

frequent; neither let any disdaine the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.
For I remember, how not long
since, a graue &amp; godly Ladie, and grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
to all my wiues children, did in
their hearings, and for their better instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
tell them a story; which though I
will not sweare it was true, yet I did wish
the auditory wold beleeue it; namely, how
an Hermit being caried in an euening, by
the conduct of an Angell, through a great
citie, to contemplate the great wickednes
daily and hourely wrought therein; met
in the streete a gongfarmer with his cart
full laden, no man enuying his full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
The poore Hermit, as other men did,
stopt his nosthrils, and betooke him to the
other side of the street, hastening from the
sower carriage all he could; but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
kept on his way, seeming no whit of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4043:17"/>
with the sauor. At which while the
Hermit maruelled, there came not long
after by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a woman gorgeously attyred,
wel perfumed, wel attended with coaches,
&amp; torches, to conuey her perhaps to some
noble mans chamber. The good Hermit
somewhat reuiued with the faire sight, and
sweet sauour, began to stand at the gaze.
On the other side, the good Angell now
stopped his nose, and both hastened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
away, and beckened his companion
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place. At which the Hermit more
maruelling then before, he was told by the
Angell, that this fine courtesan laden
with sinne, was a more stinking sauour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God and his holy Angels, then that
beastly cart, laden with excrements. I
will not spend time to allegorize this sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
onely I will wish all the readers may
find as sure a way to cleanse, and keepe
sweete the noblest part of them selues,
that is, their soules; as I shall shew them
a plaine and easie way, to keepe sweete the
basest part of their houses, that is, their
sinkes. But to the intent I may binde my
selfe to some certaine method, I will first
awhile continue as I haue partly begun, to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4043:17"/>
defend by most autenticall authorities and
examples, the vse of these homely words
in so necessary matters. Secondly, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the matter it selfe, I will shewe how
great, and extraordinary care hath beene
had in all ages, for the good ordering of
the same. Lastly, for the forme, I will set
downe the cheapest, perfectest, and most
infallible, for auoyding all the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
the matter is subiect to; that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
(if I and many more be not much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
was euer found out.</p>
               <p>When I was a truantly scholer in the
noble Vniuersitie of Cambridge (though
I hope I had as good a conscience as other
of my pew-fellowes, to take but a litle lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for my money) yet I can remember,
how a very learned and reuerent Deuine
help this question in the schooles. <hi>Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae
stylus no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est barbarus.</hi> The stile, or phrase
of the Scripture is not barbarous. Against
whom one replyed with this argument.
<q>
                     <l>That which is obscenous, may be called bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous:</l>
                     <l>But the Scripture is in many places obscenous:</l>
                     <l>Therefore the Scripture may be called bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:4043:18"/>
To which syllogisme was truely answered
(as I now reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber denying the <hi>minor</hi>) that
though such phrases to vs seeme obsce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
and are so when they are vsed to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauldrie,
or lasciuiousnes, yet in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
they are not onely voyd of inciuilitie,
but full of sanctitie; that the Prophets do
in no place more effectually, more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
nor more properly beat downe our
pride and vanitie, and open to our eyes the
filthinesse, and horror of our sinnes, then
by such kind of phrases, of which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited

of the people were,<note place="margin">

of the Indians, set in gold; &amp; so they shall
still take it for me, for that ignorance, may
perhaps do them lesse hurt in this matter,
then further knowledge; but yet what a
speciall Scripture that is to Gods glory &amp;
their shame, appeares by Dauids prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in the 77. Psalme, where he saith; <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussit
inimicos suos in posteriora, opprobrium
sempiternum dedit illis.</hi> He smote his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in the hinder parts, and put them to
a perpetuall shame; in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in some solemne lyturgies, vntill this
day the same Chap. of <hi>Aureos anos</hi> is read.</p>
               <p>What shold I speake of the great league
betwene God and man, made in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision?
impressing a painefull <hi>stigma,</hi> or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in Gods peculiar people, though
now, most happily taken away in the holy
Sacrament of Baptisme. What the word
signified, I haue knowen reuerent &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men haue bene ignorant; and we call
it very well Circumcision, and vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
though the Remists (of purpose be
like to varie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Geneua) will needs bring
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4043:19"/>
in Prepuse; which word was after admitted
into the Theater with great applause, by
the mouth of Maister Tarlton the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Comedian; when many of the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that were neuer circumcised, had as
great cause as Tarlton, to complaine of
their Prepuse. But to come soberly, &amp; more
nearely to our present purpose; In the old
Testament, the phrase is much vsed of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
the feet, and in the new Testament,
he that healeth &amp; helpeth all our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
vsed the word <hi>draught;</hi> that that goeth
into the man, is digested in the stomacke,
and cast out into the draught. Lastly, the
blessed Apostle S. Paule, being rapt in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of diuine blisfulnesse, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pares
all the chiefe felicities of the earth, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
them (to vse his owne word) as <hi>ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cora,</hi>
most filthy doung, in regard of the
ioyes he hoped for. In imitation of which
zealous vehemencie, some other writers
haue affected to vse such phrase of speech,
but with as il successe, as the asse that leapt
on his maister at his comming home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he saw a litle spaniel, that had so don,
much made of: for in deed, these be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted
but foule mouthd beasts for their labors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:4043:19"/>But to conclude these holy authorities,
worthy to be alledged in most reuerent
and serious manner; and yet here also I
hope without offence: let vs come now to
the ridiculous, rather then religious cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
of the Pagans, and see, if this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
matter I treat of, were despised
among them; nay rather obserue, if it were
not respected with a reuerence, with an
honor, with a religion, with a dutie, yea
with a deitie, &amp; no maruell. For they that

ouersight, to omit such a necessarie, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in all languages, hath the name of
necessitie, or ease: wherfore they had both
a God and a Goddesse, that had the charge
of the whole businesse; the God was called
<hi>Stercutius,</hi> as they write, because he found
so good an employment for all manner of
doung, as to lay it vpon the land: or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it was he, that first fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the excellent
mysterie of the kind setting of a Parsnippe
(which I will not here discouer, because I
heard of a truth, that a great Lady that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
Parsnips very well, after she had heard
how they grew, could neuer abide them)
and I would be loath, to cause any to fall
out of loue with so good a dish. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
(except they will haue better bread
then is made of wheate) they must (how
fine so euer they be) giue <hi>M. Stercutius</hi>
leaue, to make the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d able to beare wheat.
But the Goddesse was much more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and properly assigned for this busines,
whose name was <hi>Dea Cloacina,</hi> her statue
was erected by <hi>Titus Tacius,</hi> he that raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Of all which S. Augustine writes most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely,
to ouerthrow their diuinitie; and
therefore I referre the learned and studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reader, to his fourth and sixt booke <hi>de
Ciuitate Dei,</hi> where the originall, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of all these Gods and Goddesses, is
more largely discoursed: with a pretty quip
to <hi>Seneca</hi> the great Philosopher, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in hart half a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as was thought;
yet because he was a Senator of Rome,<note place="margin">S. Augustine 6. booke 10. chap. L.</note>
was faine (as S. Augustine saith) to follow
that he found fault with, to doe that hee
disliked, to adore that he detested. But
come we to my stately Dame <hi>Cloacina,</hi> and
her Lorde <hi>Stercutius,</hi> though these were
not of the higher house, called <hi>Consentes;</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:4043:21"/>
yet I hope for their antiquitie, they may
make great comparison: for he is saide to
haue bene old <hi>Saturne,</hi> father to <hi>Pycus</hi> that
was called <hi>Iuppiter;</hi> and <hi>Cloacina</hi> was long
before <hi>Priapus,</hi> and so long before <hi>Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>
that S. Augustine writes merrily, that
he thinkes verily, <hi>Felicitie</hi> forsooke the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
for disdaine that <hi>Cloacina</hi> and <hi>Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>
were deified so long before her; adding
<hi>Imperium Romanorum propterea grandius,
quam felicius fuit.</hi> The Romane Empire
therefore was rather great, then happie.
But how so euer Ladie <hi>Felicitie</hi> disdaines
her, no question but Madame <hi>Cloacina</hi> was
alwayes a very good fellow: for it is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of speciall kindnesse, to this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the best men in France, to reduce a
Syllogisme <hi>in Bocardo</hi> togither. Insomuch
as I haue heard it seriously tolde, that a
great Magnifico of Venice, being Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
in France, and hearing a Noble
person was come to speak with him, made
him stay till he had vntyed his points; and
when he was new set on his stoole, sent for
the Noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come to him at that time;
as a very speciall fauour. And for other
good fellowships I doubt not, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4043:21"/>
beginning it hath often happened, that
some of the Nymphes of this gentle god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse,
haue met so luckily with some of her
deuout chaplens, in her chappels of ease,
and paid their priuie tithes so duely, and
done their seruice togither with such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion;
that for reward, she hath preferred
them within fortie weeks after to <hi>Iuno Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina,</hi>
and so to <hi>Vagitana, Lacturtia,</hi> and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nina:</hi>
for euen to this day, such places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
very fortunate. And wheras I named
deuotion, I would not haue you thinke,
how homely soeuer the place is, that all
deuotion is excluded from it. For I happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to demand of a deare friend of mine,
concerning a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion of his, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were religious or no, and namely
if he vsed to pray; he tolde me, that to his
remembrance he neuer heard him aske a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing of God, nor thanke God for any
thing; except it were at a Iakes, he heard
him say, he tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ked God, he had had a good
stoole. Thus you see, a good stoole might
moue as great deuotion in some man, as a
bad sermon; &amp; sure it sutes very well, that
<hi>Quoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Deus est venter, eoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> templu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sit cloaca.</hi>
he that maks his belly his god, I wold haue

him make a Iakes his chappell. But he that
would in deede call to minde, how <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
that notable and famous, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
heretike, came to his miserable
end vppon a Iakes; might take iust occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
euen at that homely businesse, to haue
godly thoughts; rather then as some haue,
wanton, or most haue, idle. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
I remember in my riming dayes, I
wrote a short Elegie vpon a homely Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme;
which both verse and Embleme,
they haue set vp in <hi>Cloacinas</hi> chappell, at
my house very solemnely. And I am the
willinger to impart it to my friends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I protest to you truely, a sober Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
protested to me seriously; that the
conceit of the picture &amp; the verse, was an
occasion to put honest and good thoughts
into his mind. And Plutarke defends with

Which Embleme had almost hindred me
the writing of this present discourse, saue
that a good friend of mine told me, that
this is a fansie and not a fight, and that if
it should grow to a fight; he assured me
I had found so excellent a warde against
his chiefe dart, which is his strong breath,
that I were like to quit my handes in the
fray, as well as any man. But to proceede
in these rare Emblemes; who hath not
read or heard, of the Picture made in
Germanie, at the first rising of Luther?
where to shew as it were by an Embleme,
with what drosse, and draffe, the Pope and
his partners fed the people; they caused
him to be purtraied in his Pontificalibus
riding on a great sow, and holding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4043:24"/>
her taster, a dirty pudding: which
dirtie deuise, Sleidan the Historian verie
iustly and grauely, both reports and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues;
yet it serued a turne for the time,
and made great sport to the people. But
when this May-game was done, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand of them came home by
weeping crosse; so as the poore sow was
not onely sold by the eares, but sould by
a drumme, or slaine by the sword. Yet the
Flaunders cow, had more wit then the
Germane sow: for she was made after an
other sort, viz. the Mirror of Princes fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her, the Terror of Princes spurring
her, the Prince of Orange milking her, or
after some such fashion, for I may faile in
the particulars; but the conclusion was,
that Monsieur d' Allanson (who indeede
with most noble endeuour, though not
with so happie successe, attempted them)
would haue pulled her backe by the taile,
and she filed his fingers. And thus much
for Emblemes. Now for poesie (though
Emblemes also are a kind of poesie) I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doubt, that the often vsage of such
words, wil make the Poets be condemned;
then that the Poets authorities, will make
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4043:24"/>
the wordes be allowed: but if their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
can giue any countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to them, they
shall want none. It is certaine, that of all
poems, the Epigram is the wittiest, &amp; of al
that writes Epigrams, Martiall is counted
the pleasantest. He in his 38. ep. of his first
booke, hath a distichon, that is very plya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to my purpose; of one that was so
stately, that her close stoole was of gold,
but her drinking cup of glasse.

And when she had made it in this sorie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,

as he spake, of which the last
seemes to fall fit into our text. The first
was, when the King sent to him to know if
he had chaunged his minde; he answered,
yea: the King sent straight a counseller to
him, to take his subscription to the fix Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.
Oh said he, I haue not chaunged my

thought to haue sent for a Barber, to haue
bene shauen ere I had died, but now if it
please the King, he shall cut off head; and
beard, and all together. But the other was
milder, and pretier; for after this, one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to him as of good will, to tell him he
must prepare him to dye, for he could not
liue: he called for his vrinall, and hauing
made water in it, he cast it, &amp; viewed it (as
Physicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do) a prety while; at last he sware
soberly, that he saw nothing in that mans

But to step backe to my teshe (though

I beat my braynes about it, the
space that one may go with the tyde from
London bridge, downe where the Priest
fell in vpon the mayd, and from thence
almost to Wapping, and yet I could not
couch it into a cleanely distichon. But
yet because I know Mistresse <hi>Philostilpnos</hi>
will haue a great minde to know what it
meanes, I will tell her by some handsome
circumlocution. His meaning is, that a

He aduises him to take somewhat to make

were asking, who should be M. Mayor the

of Vespasianus foole, or else the
foole borrowed it of him: but the iest is
worthy to be receiued into this discourse.
This foole had iested somewhat at all the

he thought, it was ill playing with
edge tooles, and Emperours; but Vespasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

him. Well Sir (then said the foole) I will

Lastly the best, and best written part of

by that worthy, and vncorrupt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
Sir Thomas More, sometime Lord
Chancelor of England, where it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
how the king was deuising with Teril, how
to haue his nephews priuily murdred, and
it is added, he was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sitting on a draught

these tragicall matters, and come to comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4043:29"/>
looke into your sports of hauking and
hunting, of which noble recreations, the
noble Sir Philip Sidney was wont to say,
that next hunting, he liked hauking worst,
but the faulconers and hunters would be
euen with him, and say, that these bookish
fellowes, such as he, could iudge of no
sports, but within the verge of the faire
fields of Helicon, <hi>Pindus,</hi> and <hi>Pernasus.</hi>
Now I would aske you Sir, lest you should
thinke I neuer read Sir Tristram. Doe you

rather Metaphor, of inewing a woodcock)
talke, both of putting a heron to the

                  </gap>ell of spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a pheasant and a partridge, and finde
them out by their dropping? Doe you not
further, to iudge of your haulkes health;
looke on her casting? if it be blacke at one
end, and the rest yellow, you feare she hath
the phillanders, if it be all blacke, you shall
see and smell, she is not sound. Lastly, you
haue a speciall regard to obserue, if she
make a cleane mute. Moreouer for hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting,
when you haue harbourd a stag, or lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
a buck, doth not the keeper, before he
comes to rouse him from his lodging,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4043:30"/>
(not without some ceremony) shew you
his femishing, that thereby you may iudge
if he be a seasonable deare? And soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
followes the melodious cry of the
hounds, which the good Lady could not
heare, because the dogs kept such a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
And when all this is done, and you
are rehearsing at dinner what great sport
you haue had: in the middest of your sweet
meates, in comes Melampus, or Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
that sang the base that morning, and
in the returne home, lighted vppon some
powderd vermin, and layes a chase vnder
the table, that makes all as sweet as any su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-carrion;
&amp; all this you willingly beare
with, because it is your pastime. Thus you
must needes confesse, it is more then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that without reproofe of ribaldry,
or scurrility, writings both holy, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
Emblemes, Epigrams, Histories,
and ordinary and familiar communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
admits the vse of the words, with all
their apurtenaunces; in citing examples
whereof, I haue bene the more copious,
because of this captious time, so ready to
backebite euery mans worke, and I would
forewarne men not to bite here, lest they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4043:30"/>
bite an vnsauory morsell. But here me
thinke it were good to make a pause, &amp; (as
it were at a long dinner) to take away the

obiect, that it was neuer of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
but that it was left to each mans own
care to prouide, for that which concerned
his owne peculiar necessitie. It is not so,
for I can bring very aut<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nticall proofs out
of auncient records, and histories; that the
greatest magistrates that euer were, haue
employed their wits, their care, and their
cost, about these places; as also haue
made diuerse good lawes, proclamations,
and decrees about the same: &amp; all thereto
belonging; as by this that ensues shall
more plainely appeare. In the handling
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4043:31"/>
whereof. I will vse a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary method to the
former: for I wil begin now with prophane
stories, and end with deuine. First there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
most certaine it is, that mischiefes
make vs seeke remedies, diseases make vs
find medicines, &amp; euill maners make good
lawes. And as in all other things, so by all
likelyhood in this we now treate of, when
companies of men began first to increase,
and make of families townes, and of towns
cities, they quickly found not onely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
but infection, to grow out of great
concourse of people, if speciall care were
not had to auoyd it. And because they
could not remoue houses, as they do tents,
from place to place, they were driuen to
finde the best meanes that their wits did
then serue them, to couer, rather then to
auoyd these annoiances: either by digging
pits in the earth, or placing the common
houses ouer riuers: but as Tully saith of
Metaphors, that they were like our appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell:
first deuised to hide nakednesse, then
applied for comelinesse, and lastly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for pride: so I may say of these home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
places, that first they were prouided for
b<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e necessitie, for indeede till Romulus
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4043:32"/>
time I finde little mention of them; then
they came to be matters of some more
cost, as shall appeare in examples follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and I thinke I might also lay pride to
their charge: for I haue seene them in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of fugerd sattin, and veluet (which is flat
against the statute of apparell) but for
sweetnesse or cleanlines,<note place="margin">33. Henry 8. For it is no reason M. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IAX should haue a better gowne then his Mistresse.</note> I neuer knew yet
any of them guilty of it; but that if they
had but waited on a Lady in her chamber a
day, or a night, they would haue made a
man (at his next entrance into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
haue sayd, fo, good speedye. Now, as
scholers do daily seeke out new phrases, &amp;
metaphors; and Tailors do oft inuent new
vardingales, and breeches: so I see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but Magistrates may as well now as
heretofore, deuise new orders for cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and wholsomnesse. But now to the
stories, I alledged before, as it were at the
second hand, out of Lactantius; how <hi>Titus
Tacius</hi> that was king with <hi>Romulus,</hi> erected
the Statue of the Goddesse <hi>Cloacina,</hi> in a
great Priuy, made for that purpose. I finde
after this in the story of Liuy, how Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinius
Pryscus, a man of excellent good
spirit, but husband to awife of a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4043:32"/>
spirit; a man that wan a kingdome
with making a learned oration, and lost it
with hearing a rude one; a king, that was
first crowned by an Eagle, counselled by
an Augure, and killed by a traytor; whose
raigne &amp; his ruine, were both most stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
foretold. This worthy Prince is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by that excellent historian, to haue
made two prouisions for his city, one for
warre, the other for peace, both very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable:
for warre a stone wall about
the towne, to defend them from outward
inuasions; and for peace, a goodly Iakes
within the towne, with a vault to conuey
all the filth into Tiber, to preserue them
from inward infection.</p>
               <p>Not long after him raigned Tarquini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
surnamed the Proud, a tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t I confesse,
and an vsurper, and husband to a dragon
rather then a woman: but himselfe surely,
a man valiant in war, prouident in peace,
and in that yong world, a notable politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:
of whom Liuy takes this speciall note,
that comming to the crown without law,
and fearing others might follow his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
to do that to him, he had done to
another<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he was the first that appointed a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4043:33"/>
a guard for his person, the first that drew
publike matters to priuate hearings, the
first that made priuate wars, priuat peace,
priuate confederacies; the first that lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the number of the Senators; the first,
that when any of them died, kept their
roomes voyde, with many excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiauillen
lessons; which, who so wold be
better instructed of, let him read but his
accusing of Turnus, his stratagem against
the Gabians, &amp;c. But the matter I would
praise him for, is none of all these, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because he built a stately temple, and a
costly Iakes, the words be, <hi>Cloacámque ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximam
receptaculum omnium purgamento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
vrbis,</hi> a mighty great vault to receiue
all the filth of the city. Of which two
works, ioyning them both together, Liuy
saith thus, <hi>Quibus duobus operibus, vix no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua
haec magnificentia quicquam adequauit.</hi>
Which two great works, the new magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
of this our age, can hardly match.
Now though Brutus, after in a popular &amp;
seditious oration, to incite the multitude
to rebellion, debased this worthy worke of
his, saying he wasted the treasure of the
realme, and tyred &amp; toyled out the people,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4043:33"/>
                  <hi>in exhaurie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dis cloacis,</hi> in emptying of Iaxes
(for that was his word) yet it appeares by
the history, that if his son had not deflou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the chast <hi>Lucrece</hi> (the mirrour of her
sex) Brutus with his fained folly, true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
and great eloquence, could neuer haue
displaced him. For euen with all his faults
you see, that Brutus his owne sons would
haue had him againe; who laying their
heads together, with many yong gallants,
that thought them selues much wiser then
their fathers; concluded among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues,
that a king was better then a Consull, a
Court better then a Senate; that to liue
onely by lawes, was too strict and rigorous
a life, and better for pesantly then prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dispositions: that Kings could fauour, as
well as frowne, reward, as well as reuenge,
pardon, as well as punish, whereas the law
was mercilesse, mute, and immutable, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
they concluded it was ill liuing for
them, where nothing but innocency
could protect a man. Lo Brutus, how elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
thy sons can plead against their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but thou hast a Iury of sure free-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that gaue a verdite against them,
and thy selfe wast both iudge and shiriffe,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4043:34"/>
and hastenedst execution.</p>
               <p>O braue minded Brutus! I will not call
thee <hi>primus Romanorum,</hi> because one was
shent for calling one of thy posterity, <hi>vlti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
Romanorum,</hi> but this I must truly say,
they were two Brutish parts both of him,
and you; one to kil his sons for treason, the
other to kill his father in treason;<note place="margin">Caesar called Brutus son, and sayd to him when he stabd at him, <gap reason="foreign">

you would both make vs beleeue you had
reason, and why so? forsooth because

That is to say in English, You had great

yet neither died in bed, but both in battell,
onely his death was his enemies aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and thy death was thy enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
But to omit these trifles, and to
returne to my tesh; whereas thou railest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
so great a Prince, for making of so

thy hands: &amp; if thou hadst played me such
a sawcy part here in my countrey, first of
mine owne authority,<note place="margin">It seems the writer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would fain be thought a Iustice of peace.</note> I would haue gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

a bill should haue bene framed against

you in the Star chamber, vpon the statute
of vnlawfull assemblies: &amp; then you would
haue wisht you had kept your eloquence
to your selfe, and not when a man hath
done but two good workes in all his life,
you to stand rayling at one of them. For
suppose that Tarquin had giuen me but a
fee, thus would I pleade for him. Maister
Brutus you haue made vs beleeue all this
while, you were but a foole; but I see now,
if one had begged you, he should haue
found you a Bygamus. And whereas you
seeme to disgrace my honorable client, for
making of A IAX, I dare vndertake to
proue it, that your owne lawes, your religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
your customes, yea your conscience,
is against you, and shews, it is but a meere
calumniation. For to omit Dame <hi>Cloacina,</hi>

therefore to go forward with the story.</p>
               <p>When this valiant Brutus had thus
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4043:35"/>
discharged the Kings and Queenes out of
the packe, and shewed himselfe indeede a
sworne and vowed enemy to all the coate
cardes, there crept in many new formes
of gouernment, and euery one worse then
other, namely, <hi>Consuls, Dictators, Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiri,
Tribunes, Triumuiri,</hi> till at last after oft
enterchanges, it came to the gouernment
of Emperours. In all which times, there
were not onely lawes, and speciall caueats
giuen to the great officers in time of war
and danger, <hi>Ne quid respab detrimentica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peret,</hi>
to looke to the safety of the maine
chance (the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth) but also there
were officers of good account, as <hi>Aediles,
Praetores vrbis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that made inquiries <hi>de stilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cijis,

of watercourses, or common sewers,
of which I could recite out of the 43. booke
of the <hi>Digest. tit. 23. de cloacis.</hi> where you
shall finde: It was lawfull for any man <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare
&amp; reficere cloacam:</hi> What officers
were to licence him that would <hi>priuatam

cura sit.</hi> That is, that no man might make a
new Iakes, but he that had licence of the
wardens of high wayes. With much more
which I would cite, if it were not to auoid
prolixity. And from them no doubt was
deriued our commission of sewers, of
which, the best of vs all I hope, will take no
scorne: which commission, though in our
countrey it is chiefly intended to keepe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the chanels of riuers in the deepe
countrey, that the water may haue free
passage. Yet the very name imports, that
therin is comprised the subiect of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Discourse, which in populous townes
had as much neede to be looked to, as the
other, infection being fit to be auoided as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
as innundation. But now I hasten to
imperiall examples: for though I haue
shewed already some authorities for my
text, out of the practise of the lawes, the
prouident care of Magistrates, the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
cost of kings, the religion (though
false) of pagans. Yet vntill I haue added to
all these, the maiesty of Emperours, and
the verity of Scriptures, I suppose some
carping mouths will not be stopped.</p>
               <p>The first example I meete with among

the Emperours,<note place="margin">Some of our rude coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish this <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torto collo,</hi> ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

that I draw this into my Treatise, as it were

metamorphized into AIAX, rather then
poore <hi>Hecuba,</hi> for barking at him that kild
her son, into a bitch. This Claudius I say,
though not for cost (as Tarquin) yet for his
curtesie was greatly to be commended: for
a Gentleman one day being talking with
him, and falling suddenly into a grieuous
fit of the cholicke, the poore Gentleman
would not for good manners sake breake
wind, which might presently haue eased
him, &amp; after the disease increased so sore on

him that he died. The Emperour enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of his death, was much grieued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
specially hearing of the cause, &amp; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
thereupon made it be solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
that if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereafter should be
troubled with the cholick, it should not be
taken for ill maners to break wind, though
it were in the Emperours owne company.
Now it may be, some man in disgrace of

was but a cuckold and a foole. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,

you beg him for a foole, for I haue heard
of one that was begged in the Court of

he proued a wiser man by much, then he
that begged him. And though I haue small
skill in the law, specially in these preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue

in sadnesse (if I were to make thy funerall
Sermon) I would say for thee, that howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer

the name of a foole,<note place="margin">He is called foole to his face.</note> in one of thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I may liken thy wisedome to Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,<note place="margin">But hereby hangs a tale. Claudius his iudgement like that of Salomon.</note>
and in one of thy iests, I can compare
thy wit with Diogenes. Asse for example,
a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on a time disclaiming her sonne,
&amp; pretending that for conscience sake she
must needes confesse a truth, viz. how her
owne child died, &amp; this was a <hi>Supposititius,</hi>
a substitute in his place, for auoyding of
her husbands displeasure, no euidence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to the contrary, &amp; the next heire
following the matter very hard, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plot
with the mother, who remained obstinate
in the tale, Claudius then sitting in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
seemes to beleeue it, and seeing the
man a comely young man, and she no old
woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and oft protesting she maliced him
not: he commanded her immediatly in his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4043:39"/>
presence to marrie him. The malicious
mother driuen to that vnlookt for pinch,
openly confessed her vnnaturall malice, to
auoyde so vnnaturall a mariage; and thus
much for his iustice; now let vs here what
his iest is. A certaine Gentleman that had
his fingers made of lime twigges, stole a
peece of plate from Claudius one day at a
banket; the conueyaunce was not so clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but one had spied it, and told the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
&amp; offered to accuse him of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
his goods might haue bene all confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate:
but this good Prince would neither
head him nor hang him, no nor so much
as once suffer him to be troubled; onely
the next time he came, he caused him to
be serued in an earthen dish. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
being abashed at it, for the dish gaue
him his dinner. Claudius was so far from
laying his crime in his dish, that he sayd,
be of good cheare man, and fall to thy
meate, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou hast dined put vp that
dish too: for I will spare thee that with a
better will then the last, for perhaps thou
hast a minde to poke vp thy dish when
thou likest thy meate well. And so farewell
good Claudius, &amp; when any of my friends
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4043:40"/>
are troubled with the collicke. I hope I
shall make them remember thee.</p>
               <p>The next Emperour that is fit to bring
into this discourse, is Vespasian, though
his predecessour Vitellius, who is noted
to haue bin a passing greater eater, would
(I thinke) haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it in good part, to haue
bin offred a cleanly &amp; easie place for ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
after his good digestion. But to the
purpose. Vespasian before he was Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
had borne some other offices, among
the which, one was <hi>Aedilis</hi> and it is written
of him, that he incurred great displeasure
with Otho the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Emperour, because he had
not seene better to the keeping sweet of
the streets, and caused the filth of them
(according to his office) to be caried to
the places appointed for the same. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
himselfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to be Emperour
(though the Citie of Rome was before his
time sufficiently furnished of Iaxes) yet it
seemed there wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted other places of neare
affinitie to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which he found belike whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he was Aedile by experience) I meane cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
pissing conduites: and therefore he
caused diuerse to be erected in the most
populous and frequented places of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4043:40"/>
Citie, and saued all the vrine in cesternes,
and sold it for a good summe of money to
the Dyers. But though I tell you the tale
thus plainely, you must imagine the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was much more formally and sinely
handled, and namely, that there was an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
set out in this sort.</p>

               <p>Thus could I haue penned the Edict,
if I had bene secretarie. For it had not
bene worth a figge, if they had not artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
couered the true intent (which was
the profite) and gloriously set foorth the
goodly and godly pretence (that was least
thought on) viz. the health of the people,
and cleane keeping of the temples. But I
doubt, notwithstanding this goodly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
it will be obiected, that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for a base part, by a iudge whose
sentence is aboue all appeale: I meane
that noble <hi>Titus, deliciae humani generis,</hi>
he that thought the day lost in which he
had done no man good: to answer which,
I would but say as was sayd to him, when
the pissing money was put into the perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
purse, <hi>suauis odor lucri,</hi> the smell of
gaine is sweet. And I dare vndertake, this
answer will satisfie my Lord Maior of Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and many of the worshipfull of the
Citie, that make sweet gaines of stinking
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4043:41"/>
wares,<note place="margin">Oyles, oad, tarre, &amp;c.</note> and will laugh and be fat, and say:
<q>
                     <l>So we get the chinkes,</l>
                     <l>We will beare with the stinkes.</l>
                  </q>
But I must find out a better aunswere for
courtly wits, and therefore I say to them,
that according to the discipline &amp; custom
of the Romanes (in my opinion, vnder re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of their better iudgements) this
was so honorable a part of Vespasian, that
he was therefore worthy to haue bene dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
For if Saturnus were allowed as a
God, by the name of <hi>Stercutius,</hi> as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alleaged, for finding a profitable vse of
all manner soyle, I see a good reason <hi>(àpae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus)</hi>
that Vespasian should aswell be dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
for finding a meanes to make money
of vrine, and accordingly to be named <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinatius,</hi>
of <hi>Vrina,</hi> as the other is, of <hi>Stercus,
Stercutius.</hi> Further Vespasian was famous
for two true miracles done by him, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then all their gods beside euer did.
Now if any take exceptions to his face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the foole told him, he looked as if it
went hard with him: trust me it shall goe
hard with me too, but I will find somewhat
to say, for him; and first I will get some of
the painting that comes from the riuer of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4043:42"/>
Orenoque, which will wonderfully mend
his complexion. Secondly, I will say this,
how bad soeuer his face was, he had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so good, that a handsome woman
gaue him a thousand crownes, for putting
his seale with his labell to her pattent, and
yet she exhibited the petition (as I take it)
<hi>in forma paper,</hi> for she was starke naked.
Once this I am sure Suetonius writes, that
when his steward asked him, how he shold

he b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now for his wit, though I could tell
you two excellent tales, how he deceiued
a groome of his chamber, of his brother,
and how he would needs be halfe with his

horse that lacked none: yet I omit them
both, because many will be too apt to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

strictly to my tesh, and specially because I
hasten to a most royall example. I meane
of Traian. There is no man (I thinke) that

hath either trauelled farre countreys, or
read forraine stories, but hath either heard
of the famous exploits and victories that
he had, or seene some of the stately and
sumptuous monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that he made. This
Traian was Emperor of Rome, and then
Emperor when Rome stood at her highest
pitch of greatnes, a man whose conquests
were most glorious, whose buildings were
most gorgeous, whose iustice was most
gracious, he that stayed his whole armie,
to right the cause of one widdow, he that
created a Magistrate, and deliuering him
the sword for iustice, said to him, vse this
for me as long as I gouerne iustly, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

no poore man was seene begge, hee that
would boast of Nerua his predecessor, of
Plotina his wife, of Plutarke his councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler:
finally, this Traian was so well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
a Prince in all princely vertues, as
no storie, no time, no memorie, in all
points can match him. This most renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

troubled with the euill sauour, that was
much annoyed for lacke of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance

himselfe bound (as a father to all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects)
to prouide a remedie for such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience,

tooke order for making a vault of great

you will presume to trouble his diuine

that your father being held a wise man,

matters of greater import, concerning

much I was commaunded to write. Now
for mine owne part, let me say thus much

iust or indifferent peace. For that same
sweet sinne of lecherie, I would say as the
Frier sayd, a young man and a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

if God do not forgiue it, I would. For as sir

he was subiect to a sin, from which, health
of bodie in great prosperitie of fortune,
without a speciall grace, hardly refrayneth.
And to speake vprightly of him, his lusts
were not furious, but friendly, able with
his goodly person, his sweete behauiour,
and his bountifull gifts, to haue won <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia.</hi>
Besides, no doubt his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> was the
lesse, in that he euer loued his wife most
dearely, and vsed her most respectiuely: for
I haue euer maintained this paradox, it is
better to loue two too many, then one
too few. Lastly, for the persecution of thy
time, though I dare not defend it, yet there
is a maxime, <hi>inuincibilis ignorantia recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sat,</hi>
and sure thou didst not know the truth,
and thy persecution was very gentle, and
halfe against thy will, as appeareth by
the 98. Epistle of the tenth booke of Plin.
Epistles, where thou doest vtterly reiect
all secret promoeters, and dost pronounce
against the strict inquisition, <hi>Conquirendi
non sunt, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore I doubt not to
pronounce, that I hope thy soule is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
both because those thou didst per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
prayed for thee, wishing to thee, as

A long life, a happy raigne, a safe dwelling,
strong armies, a faithfull Senate, honest

written by authors of some credite, that
thy soule was deliuered out of hell, at the

by great clerkes, but I thinke it is
in the Epistle of S. Paule to the Laodice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
or in Nicodemus Gospell: for I neuer
yet could find it in the Bible. Wherefore
this I will frankely say for Traian, that
whersoeuer I find a Prince or a Peere with
so great vertues, and so few vices, I will
honour him, loue him, extoll him, admire
him, and pronounce this of him; that the

               <p>In the aforesaid 23.<note place="margin">Authorities of Sripture.</note> Chapter of Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomie,
in the 12. verse, I find this text:</p>

no filthinesse in them, lest he forsake thee.</p>
               <p>But me thinke some may say vpon hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this text, What is it possible there
should he such a Scripture, that handleth
so homely matters? I can hardly beleeue
it; I haue alwaies had a bible in my parlour
these many yeares, and oft time when the
weather hath bene foule, and that I haue
had no other booke to reade on, and haue
wanted company to play at cards or tables
with me, I haue read in those bookes of the
old Testament, at least halfe an houre by
the clocke, &amp; yet I remember not anie
such matter. Nay further, I haue heard a
Preacher, that hath kept an exercise a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4043:48"/>
ye are togither vpon the bookes of Moses,
&amp; hath told vs of Genesis, &amp; genealogies,
of the arke &amp; the propitiatorie, of polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of washings, of leprosies, but I neuer
heard him talke of such a homely matter
as this. I answere, It may be so very well.
And therfore now I pray you, sith the text
is so strange to you, giue me leaue to put
you in mind of two vertuous &amp; honest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations
out of this (how homly so euer)
yet wholly Scripture. One, to be thankfull
to our Sauiour for his mercies; th'other to
be faithfull to our Soueraigne for her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
We may thanke God that al these ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
ceremonies, which S. Paul calleth the
workes of the Law, as Circumcision, New
moones, Sabbaths, washings, cleansings,
with touch not, handle not, eate not, &amp;c.
are now taken away &amp; quite abolished by
the Gospell, which hath now made <hi>Omnia

intollerable, vnpossible, hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,

                     </gap>es,</hi> to say now to him, <hi>DaDomine quod

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4043:48"/>
neuer heard this text preached on, you
may blesse in your soule, and pray for her
Maiesties so peaceable and prosperous
raigne, this text being not fit for peace &amp; a
pulpit, but only for warre and a camp. And
therfore though I hope we shal neuer haue
cause to heare such a Scripture preached
of in England, yet those that serue in other
countreys, both haue &amp; shall heare it thus
applyed (and that oft not without neede)
viz. that though now to the cleane all
things are cleane, yet still we must haue a
speciall care of cleanlines, and wholsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
euen for the things here spoken of,
and if for such things, how much more for
rapes, the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts, murthers, blasphemies,
things (as God knowes) too common in al
our campes. <hi>Ne Dominus Deus noster, qui
ambulat in medio castrorum derelinquat nos.</hi>
Least the Lord our God, that walketh in
the midst of our te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, shold forsake vs. And
euen in the time of the sweetest peace, me
thinkes I could also say, here at home, that
it is an vnreuerent thing, for Churches or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for prayer, and church-yardes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for burial, to be polluted and filed
as if they were kennels and dunghils.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:4043:49"/>And I haue thought sometime with
my selfe, that if I were but halfe so great
an officer vnder our most gracious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peresse,

though in the English Grammer, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine

may hold. Yet lest old Priscian should say

of Nehemias, which some call the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

built the doung gate.<note place="margin">There is a noble and learned La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, dowager to the Lord Iohn Russell, that will not name loue without saue reuerence.</note> I would haue saide,

               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:4043:51"/>But now to the purpose, perhaps you
will saie, that this makes nothing to the
present argument, that the gate is called
Doungate, for we haue a gate in London
called Dougate, that with a little dash with
a pen will seeme to be the same gate, &amp; yet
hath no great affinitie with the matter, &amp;
on the other side, there is a place hath a
glorious title of Queene Hiue, and yet it
was ordained for my lady <hi>Cloacina.</hi> I grant
it might be so, for so there is a parish by
London called Hornsey, which is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratious
crooked name, and yet I verilie
perswade me, that the most glorious or
gratious street in Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath more horns
in it sometime either visible or inuisible
then all the other parish. But concerning
the gate in Ieruselagim called <hi>Porta Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coris,</hi>
I finde it was so called bicause it laie
on the East side of the Citie, toward the
brooke Cedron, whither all the raine wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Citie, and all other conueiances
ran, as they do out of the Citie of London
into the Thames: and that being so, and
the city so populous, the gate might wel be
called <hi>Porta Stercoris.</hi> Now without the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
I finde mentioned another place ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4043:51"/>
for the like purpose, to carrie out all
such filth as the rain could not wash away,
and had no common passage, &amp; that was
the valley of Hinnon, which seemes by the
map to lie Southeast and by South to the
Temple, and thither, I say, the Scauengers
caried their loding,<note place="margin">The Brickils.</note> as they do at London
beyond Golding lane. And therfore in the
new Testament it is called <hi>gehenna,</hi> and
taken for hell, and if you haue a minde to
know how I come by this diuinitie, trust
me if you will, I come by it as true men
come by their goods. For so it is, that not
long since there dwelt in Bath a schoole-master,
a man whom I fauored much, for
his sake that sent him thither. But he had
not beene there long, but a controuersie
arose betwixt him &amp; some preachers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
among whom we haue too manie
that studie nothing but the controuersies,
and it came after many disputes on both
sides, at last to writing and publishing of
Books. And the schoole-master (though
being no Preacher) wrote a booke with
this title, <hi>that Christ descended not into hell:</hi>
the very sight of which title, being flat co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorie
to an article of the Creede, I
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4043:52"/>
remember I said of the man as Heywood
saith in his prouerbes, that heerafter
<q>
                     <l>He might be of my Pater noster indeed,</l>
                     <l>But sure he should neuer come in my Creed.</l>
                  </q>
And therefore I might repute him as a
good humanist, but I should euer doubt
him for a good deuine. Now as I say, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in these disputes and sermons, diuerse
names of hell throughly sifted. As <hi>Ades,
Tartaros, Infernum, Stagnum ardens,</hi> and
last of all <hi>Gehenna,</hi> which last I was most
vsed to, as hauing an old verse when I was
at Eaton, of a Peacocke.
<q>
                     <l>Angelus in penna, pede latro, voce gehenna.</l>
                     <l>A bird that hath an Angels plume,</l>
                     <l>A theeuish pace, a hellish tune.</l>
                  </q>
Consequentlie, I obserued, that our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

first prooued hel to be a local place (if not

impression in their harts, of the paines
of hell indeed, which they know not, vsed
the name of this hellish place, which they
knew that had in it these hatefull hellish
properties, smoke, stinke, horrible cries, &amp;
torment. But least you shuld think I speake
as a parrot, nothing but what I haue heard
an other say, let me adde somwhat of mine
own poore reading, and that shall be this,
that this valley of Hinnon was once for
the sweete aire, fine groues, faire walks, &amp;
greene and pleasant fields, comparable
with any place about Ierusalem, but when
the abhominable Idoll of Moloch was
erected in it, whose purtraiture was like a
king hauing the head of a calfe, al of bras,
&amp; hollow within: vnto which (most inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely)
they sacrificed humane flesh, yea
their owne children, &amp; to the end that the
wicked parents might not feele remorse
of the wofull cries of the wretched chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
they daunced a straunge medley
about the fire, hauing musicke sutable to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4043:53"/>
such mirth, of drums and Iewes harpes
(for I thinke hornepipes and bag-pipes
were not then found out) I say these abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
being there committed, the
good Iosias, driuen to vse an extreme me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
to so extreme a maladie, first bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and brake all too peeces the horrible
Idoll, and then in detestation of the abuses
there committed, cut downe the fine
groues, tare vp the sweete pastures, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the pleasant walks; and to the end that
all passengers should flie from it, that were
woont to frequent it, he caused all filthie
carrion, dead dogs and horses, all the filth
of the streetes, &amp; whatsoeuer hatefull and
vgly things could be imagined, to be cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thither. And this ô Iosias was thy zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
reformation: but alas how little do
some that pretend thy name, participate
thy nature. They pull downe Moloch, but
set vp Baal Peor &amp; Beelsebub, their leane
deuotion thinks the hill of the Lord is too
fat, their enuious eie serues them like Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinoes
spectacles, to make all seeme big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
then it should be, they learne the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians
song in the Psalmes.

They care neither for good letters nor
good liues, but onely out of the spoiles to
get good liuings, our good Lord Bishops
must be made poore superintendents, that
they might superintend the goodly Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
of rich Bishopricks, &amp; then we that
be simple fellowes must beleeue, that they
offer vs Iosias reformation, wheras indeed
it sauors not of that in any thing but the
ill sauor: for as Iosias defaced a faire field,
and made it <hi>spurcitiarum latrinam,</hi> so they
would ruinate our cathedrall churches, &amp;
make them <hi>Spelunca latronum,</hi> as my good
friend Hary-Osto, or mine Host Hary saith
of the Pagan Rodomont, after his host
had ended his knauish tale.

                     <l>Serue him for his prophane vngodly vse.</l>
                  </q>
Wherefore let them cal themselues what
they list, but if they learn no better lessons
of Iosias, but to turne sweete fields to stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
dunghils, they shall make no newe
Iaxes in England by my consent, &amp; I hope
my deuise shall serue to mende many that

where the sport will be torment, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
clamors, the prospect smoke, and
the perfume stinke. Which two last, I
meane smoke and stinke, I haue verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
me, are two of those paines of hel,
which they call <hi>poena sensus:</hi>

S. Augustine affirmes may also torment

in the storie of Tobias, where a wicked
spirit was driuen away with the smoke of
a broyled liuer; and therefore I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuored
in my poore buildings to auoide
those two inconueniences as much as I
may. As for the two other annoiances, that
the old prouerbe ioineth to one of these,
saying, there are three things that make a
man weary of his house, a smoking chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
a dropping eues, and a brauling wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

which I can not reforme with choler, and

learne of the good Socrates, who when

am not only groundedly studied in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of AIAX, which I haue chosen
for the proiect of this discourse, but that I
am also superficially seene in these three
other matters of shrewd importance to all
good house-keepers, I will not be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of my cunning, but I will venture my
pen and my paines, if you will lend but
your eies or your eares, though I perhaps
shall haue more fists about my eares then
mine owne for it. First therefore for the
house, I will teach you a verse for it, that I
thinke M. Tusser taught me, or else now I
may teach it his sonne.
<q>

For the shrewd wife, read the booke of
taming a shrew, which hath made a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4043:55"/>
of vs so perfect, that now euery one
can rule a shrew in our countrey, saue he
that hath hir. But indeed there are but two
good rules. One is, let them neuer haue
their wils; the other differs but a letter,
let them euer haue their wils, the first
is the wise, but the seconde is more in
request, and therefore I make choise
of it.</p>
               <p>Lastly for smoking chimneys, many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
haue been studied,<note place="margin">One taught an excellent rule to keepe a chimney from smoking, &amp; a priuie from stinking, viz. to make your fire in your priuy, and to set the close stoole in the chimney.</note> but one excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and infallible waie is founde out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
some of the great Architectes of
this age, namely to make no fire in them,
and by the same rule they may haue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
sweete Iaxes too. But the best waie I
haue found, is out of Cardan partly, but
as I think mended by practise of some of
my neighbors of Bath: who make things
like halfe a cloke about the toppes of
the chimneys, with a fane to turne
rounde with the winde, which bicause
they make of wood is dangerous for fire,
but being made thinne of copper plates
or of old kettels will be as light and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  <figure/>
daunger, but this is supererogation,
and more then I promised you. But nowe
to come home againe, though home be
neuer so homely, the fourth annoiance
though it be left out of the prouerbe, may
compare with two of the other three,
which is a stinking priuie, which makes a
man wish somtime, saue for an ornament
of the face (as Heywood saith) to haue no
nose.

                  </q>
And for reformation of this, many I doubt
not, haue ere this beaten their braines and
strained very hard, to haue found out some
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4043:56"/>
remedy; but yet still I find all my good
friendes houses greatly annoyed with it.</p>
               <p>But yet ere I come to discouer this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
&amp; exquisite forme that I haue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
let me adde a word or two out of the
good and wholsome rules of phisick, both
for authorising the homely words so oft v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
as for prouing that the matter in their
faculty is specially regarded; for diuers,
that are otherwise very daintie and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
yet for their healths sake, will endure
both to heare homely language, to see
sluttish sights, to taste dirtie drugs, and to
shew secret sores; according to the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
prouerbe,
<q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>All confessore medico &amp; aduocato,</l>

                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>From your confessor, lawyer, and phisition,</l>
                        <l>Hide not your case on no condition.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
No man therefore is either so ignorant, or
so impudent, as either not to know or not
to confesse, that the honorable science of
phisick, embaseth it selfe ofttimes about
the care of this busines. For whereto ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
I pray you, <hi>fiant clysteria, fiant pillulae,
fiant potiones, fiant pessi.</hi> But fie on't, it
makes me almost sicke to talke of them,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4043:56"/>
sure I am the house I treat of, is as it were
the center to which they must all fall first
or last, and many times I thinke first were
wholsomer of the two. But to inforce my
proofes, though shortly yet soundly, I will
not bring any peculiar prescripts out of
Galen and Hipocrates, least you should
oppose against them Asclepiades or Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus,
nor stand long to dilate of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricall
phisick, or the dogmaticall and the
methodicall. Of all which if I should say
all I could, I feare me not so much, that
phisitions would take me for a foole, as
that fooles will take me for a Phisition. I
will therefore set downe as it were certain
autenticall rules, out of a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Phisitions, &amp; that sent by common
consent to a great K. of England, against
which if any Doctor should except, he
must <hi>ipso facto</hi> be counted an hereticke.
This therefore I finde of my text in that
booke that begins
<q>Anglorum regi scribit schola tota Salerni.</q>
For when he hath beene aduised to make
choice of three Phisitions,
<q>Haec tria mens laeta, requies, moderata diet.</q>
Doctor Diet, Doctor Quiet, and Doctor
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4043:57"/>
Meryman. Then they admonish him of
many particulars, for his health, for his
foode, for his house, &amp;c. Which if they
might with good maners write to a king,
then I may without inciuilitie recite to a
kinseman.

                  </q>
Which as a principal lesson, to be learned
by builders, I will set downe in verse.
<q>
                     <l>A builder that will follow wise direction,</l>
                     <l>Must first foresee before his house he makes,</l>

For indeed let your house be neuer so well
apparaled, neuer so wel plaistered &amp; pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

                  </q>
And thus I take it, I ende this part of my
discourse, with a well chosen verse to the
purpose: yet ere you go, take this with you
in prose, that many Physitions doe hold,
that the plague, the measeals, the hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoids,

there be few houses that may not haue the

the courts, which being cleanly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the eie, yet bicause they must of
force haue many vents, they are oft noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
in regard of the smell. Specially in
houses of office, that stand high from the
ground, the tuns of them drawing vp the
aire as a chimney doth smoke. By which it
comes to passe manie times (specially if
the wind stand at the mouth of the vaults)
that what with fish-water comming from
the kitchins, bloud and garbage of fowle,
washing of dishes and the excrements of

whither we must) therfore as I said before,
many haue deuised remedies for this in
times past, some not many yeeres since,
and I this last yeere, of all which I will
make choice only of two beside mine own
to speake off, bicause men of good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
haue allowed them for good, but
yet (as the ape doth his yoong ones) I
thinke mine the properest of them all.</p>
               <p>The first and the ancientest, is to make a
close vault in the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, widest in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
&amp; narrower vpward, &amp; to floore the
same with hot lime &amp; tarris, or some such
dry pauing as may keep out al water &amp; aire
also: for if it be so close as no aire can come
in, it doth as it were smother the sauor, like
to the snuffes or extinguishers wherewith
we put out a candle, and this standes with
good reason, that seeing it is his nature to
make the woorse sauor the more he is stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and nothing makes him keepe a more
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:4043:60"/>
stinking stir, then a litle wind &amp; water, sure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
there can be litle or no annoia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of him
in this kinde of house, where he shall lie so
quietly. But against this is to be obiected,
that if there be a little cranny in the wall
as big as a straw, or if the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d stand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
winter springs or be subiect as most places
vnder ground are, to giue with moist wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at such times it must needs offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</p>
               <p>Besides in a Princes house where so
many mouths be fed, a close vault wil fill
quickly; and that obiection did my Lord
of Leicester make to Sir Iohn Young, at
his last being at Bristow, who commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to my Lord that fashion, and shewed
him his owne of a worse fashion, and told
him that at a friends house of his at Peter
hill in London, there was a very sweet pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
of that making.</p>
               <p>Another waie, is either vpon close or
open vaults, so to place the sieges or seats
as behinde them may rise tunnes of chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
to draw all the ill aires vpwards: of
which kinde I may be bold to say, that our
house of Lincolnes Inne, putteth downe
all that haue beene made afore it, and is
indeed both in reason and experience, a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:4043:61"/>
meanes to auoid much of the annoyance
that is wont to come of them, &amp; keepeth
the place all about much the sweeter. But
yet to speake truly, this is not sate from all
infection or annoiance while one is there,
as my sense hath told me, for
<q>Sensus non fallitur in proprio obiecto.</q>
Or perhaps by the strict wordes of the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
it ought to be so, &amp; that but two parts
may be deuised away, and a third must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
to the heire, for I dare vndertake,
go thither when you will, your next heire
at the common house, whatsoeuer charge
he is at in the sute, I am sure he may bee
made a sauor, at the least for the <hi>

                     </gap>ertiam
partem</hi> aboue al reprises, if the fault be not
his owne. And further, when the weather
is not calme, the winde is so vnruly, that it
will force the ill aires down the chimneys,
and not draw them vp, as we see it doth in
chimneys where fire is made, force downe
the smoke, notwithstanding that the verie
nature of fire helpeth to inforce it vpward,
whereas these moist vapours are apt (euen
of their owne nature) to spreade abroade,
and hang like a deaw about euery thing.
Wherefore though I am but a punie of

by some to haue recommended this

very like to haue done, saue that we are of
no great acquaintance, and beside I haue
a little ambitions humor of mine owne to
be counted a deuiser, though to cleare me
of pride, you see my first practice is vpon
so base a subiect, as I hope no body will
enuy me, or seeke to take it from me: as
the sweet Zerbino said to Marfysa, of the

so I suppose, that some may play in like

But if they do, let them take heed, that in
one place or other of this pamphlet, they
do not pull themselues by the nose, as the

I haue studied your booke with some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation:

barley (though I feareme both
the meanes will smell a little of kin to M.
AIAX) I assure you I would take it verie
kindly: and we two might haue a sute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
for a monapolie, you of your cole,
as you mention in your booke, and I of M.
reformed AIAX: and if you will trust me
to draw the petitions, you shall see I will
get some of the presidents of the starch
and the vineger, and make it carrie as
good a shew of reason, and good to the
common wealth as theirs doth. As first
for yours I would frame these reasons: I
would shew the excellent commodity of
iron-milles (for if you speake against them
your sute will be dasht straight.) I would
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4043:63"/>
proue how they reduce wilde and sauage
woods, to ciuill and fruitefull pastures. I
would alledge, they are good for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of nauigation, in respect that euery
ship, what with his cast peeces, ankers,
bolts and nailes, hath halfe as many <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>un
of iron as timber to it. I would say, it is a
commodity to the subiect, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering they
sell it for twelue or fourteene pounde the
tun, and when it came out of Spaine or
Holland, it was sold but for eight pound.
The like also I would say for glasse: and so
concluding, that the woods must needs be
spent vpon these two (as doubtlesse they
wil in a short time) then your deuise for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall
cole, of how homely stuffe soeuer
you make it, will be both regarded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.
And thus perhaps making some
great man your half, you may haue an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of a tenth or a fift of euery chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of your fewell. And though it should
poison al the towne with the ill sauour (as
the brew-house by White hall doth hir
Highnes own house, &amp; all Channon row)
yet what for necessitie, &amp; what for fauour,
it should be suffered. And neuer feare that
the price of your cole wil fal by cherishing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4043:63"/>
of woods, for now Sir Walter Mildmay is
dead, you shall haue few men will busie

But to leaue Master Plats cole, which
kindled this fantasie in me, and to turne

yet I assure you, this deuise of mine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
not a sea of water, but a cesterne;

as it is rather a pleasure then a

doth auoid at once all the annoya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces that
can be imagined, the sight, the sauour, the

You shal make a false bottome to that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie

which if it be close plaistered all about it,

wil keepe your priuie as sweet as your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,

ere we part, will first for the ennobling of
this rare inuention, tell you somewhat of
the place, of the companie, of the meanes,
and of the circumstances, that first put so
necessarie a conceit in my head. For I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I haue read that Archymedes
the excellent enginer, (a man in his time
fully as famous in Syracusa, as out M. Plat
is here in England,) was sayd to haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced
him selfe by an vntemperate or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vntempestiue ioy that he tooke of a
very worthy and memorable inuention of
his. The storie is thus. Archimedes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
long beaten his braynes to find some
way by art how to discouer, what quantity
of counterfaite mixture was put into a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4043:66"/>
crowne of massie gold, not dissoluing the
mettals, and finding no meanes in long
studie, at last washing him selfe naked in
a bathing tubbe, he obserued still that the
deeper he sunke the higher the water rose,
&amp; forthwith he conceiued (which after he
performed indeed) that by such a meanes
the true quantitie of each mettall might
be found, and the fraud discouered: with
ioy whereof he was so rauished, that starke
naked as he was, he ran out into the streets
crying, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> I haue found it, I haue
found it. At which for the time all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were amazed, and thought him mad,
till his inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion after proued him, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sober, but also suttle. What if some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
conceited fellow should giue out by
way of suppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that possibly the deuiser
of this rare conueyance, was at the time
of deuising thereof, sitting on some such
place, as the godly father sate on at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout
prayers, or the godlesse king sate on
at his deuilish practise? as put the case on
the stately stinking priuy in the Inner Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(where many graue apprentices of the

vses) and that with ioy of so excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencion
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4043:67"/>
he ran out with his hose about
his heels, and cried, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: so might
I be likened to Archimedes, and there be
some perhaps would be so verie fooles to
beleeue it. But lest any idle headed felow
should deuise, or any shalow braind peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
beleeue such a tale, I doe before hand
giue the word of disgrace to any that shall
so say, &amp; wil make it good on their persons
with all weapons from the pin to the pike,
that whether it were by my good guiding,
or my good fortune, in the inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
nor in the execution I neuer receaued
such a disgrace as that of Archimedes. For
I assure you the deuise was first both
thought of &amp; discoursed of, with as broad
termes as any belongs to it, in presence of
sixe persons, who were (all saue one) enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutors
in the Dialogue, of which I was
so much the meanest, that the other fiue,
for beautie, for birth, for vallue, for wit, &amp;
for wealth, are not in many places of the
Realme to be matched. Neither was the
place inferiour to the persons, being a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
that I call, the wonder of the West, so
seated without, as England in few places,
affoords more pleasures: so furnished with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4043:67"/>
as China nor the West Indies scant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
more plentie. Briefly, at the very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in, you would thinke you were come
to the <hi>Eldorado</hi> in <hi>Guiana.</hi> And by this I
hope both the inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion &amp; execution here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may be sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly freed from basenesse.</p>
               <p>Yet there remaines one easie obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the merite of my good seruice here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
I meane easie to make, but it will not
seeme so easie to answer, and that is, that
some may say, this may fortune to do well
in many places, but yet there is no depth in
the inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion: for it is nothing but to keepe
down the ayre with a stopple, &amp; let out the
filth with a scrue, which some will mislike,
&amp; will not endure to haue such a businesse
euery time they come to that house. To
which I answer, that for depth in the inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
I affect it not (for I wold not haue it in
all aboue two foot deep.) And though the
prouerbe is, the deeper the sweeter, that is
to be inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in some sweeter matters, for
the deeper you wade in this, you shall find
it the sowrer. And if it seeme too busie, he
that hath so great hast of his businesse, may
take it as he finds it, which cannot be very
ill at any time. But the old saying was, <hi>Look
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4043:68"/>
ere you leape,</hi> and the old custome was, that
if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had no light to looke, yet he would
feele, to seeke that he would not finde, for
feare least they should finde that they did
not seeke. Further the paines being so litle
as it is, I should thinke him a slouen that
would not by him selfe or his man leaue it
as cleanly as he found it: specially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that in Deuteronomie you are told,
God mislikes sluttishnesse, and euery cat
giues vs an example (as houswiues tell
vs) to couer all our filthinesse, &amp; if you will
not disdaine to vse that which commeth
from the Muske Cat, to make your selfe,
your gloues, and your clothes the more
sweet, refuse not to follow the example of
the Cat of the house, to make your entries,
your staires, your chambers, and your
whole house, the lesse sowre. Indeede for
the deuise I grant it is as plaine as Dunsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
high way, &amp; perhaps it will be as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to, b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall be any disgrace
to it. For I heard an Italian tell, that in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,
after they had had the great losse by
fire in Maximilians time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
was burnt with gunpowder, they had
long consultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how to keepe their store
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4043:68"/>
powder from da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of fire, for feare of like
mischances; at last a plaine fellow (like my
selfe) came and told, that he had deuised a
way, and prayed to haue audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Then he
told them a long tale, but all to this short
purpose, that gunpowder was made of iij.
simples, viz. saltpeeter, brimstone, &amp; coale,
that each of these seuerall, would be easily
kept from fire, and be quencht if they were
kindled, but being compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, it blew vp all
in a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if the least sparke did but meet
with it; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shewd that the causes could
not be so sudden of vsing powder, but that
the simples being ready, it might soone
be made; lastly that saltpeeter did grow
rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wast with lying, whereas being
made into powder, it doth consume, &amp;c.
All which though euery man there knew
before, yet because they had not offered
to put it in practise, they gaue him a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for his deuise, and followed therein
his aduise, placing these simples in seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
houses, which are so dangerous when
they are compounded, and since that time
they haue bene more annoyd with water
then with fire. Wherefore I assure me the
Magnificoes of Venice would allow of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4043:69"/>
deuise, &amp; if I had some idle money, I might
hap be so idly disposed, to put out more

water, in wordes seemely for his high state
and her fine eares, that had neuer heard
so fowle a word as that in her life, till his
man tooke on him the matter, and found
a phrase, by circumlocution to signifie
pissing, and neuer once to name it, in this
sort; <hi>Chara signora viprego fate quello che

againe in our dirtie common place; well
Ile goe with you yet a coits cast farder,
and then vpon the next greene we will bid
farewel, and turne taile, as they say: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now I will make you onely a briefe
repetition of that I haue sayd. You see first
how I haue iustified the homely wordes &amp;
phrases with authorities aboue all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I haue proued the care euer had of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4043:69"/>
the matter with examples aboue all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.
Lastly, I haue expressed to you
a cleane forme of it aboue all expectation.
Neither doe I praise it as Marchants doe
their wares, to rid their handes of them,
for I promise you, how high so euer I
praise it, I meane not to part with it: for
were I to praise it vpon mine oth, as we
do houshold stuffe in an inuentary, I wold
prayse it in my house, to bee worth 100
pounds, in yours 300 poundes, in Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerton
500 pounds: in Tibals, Burley, and
Holmbie 1000 pounds, in Greenwitch,
Richmond and Hampton Court 10000.
And by my good sooth, so I would thinke
my selfe well payd for it. Not that I am so
base minded to thinke, that wit and art
can be rated at any price, but that I would
accept it as a gratuity fit for such houses
and their owners.</p>
               <p>For I tell you, though I will not take it
vpon me, that I am in <hi>dialecticorum dume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
doctus,</hi> or <hi>in rhetorum pompa potens,</hi> or
<hi>coeteris scientijs saginatus,</hi> as doth our <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantius</hi>
of Cambridge, yet I take it, that in
this inuention I shal shew a great practise
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4043:70"/>
vpon the grammar, and vpon this point I
will chalenge all the grammarians, viz. I
say, and I wil make it good, that by my rare
deuise I shall make <hi>Stercutius</hi> a nowne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectiue.
Now I know you will set your son
William to aunswere me, and he shall say
no no, and come vpon me with his gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
rule <hi>vt sunt divorum Mars Bacchus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,
virorum, &amp;c.</hi> and hereby conclude,
that he is both a substantiue, and that a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
one too, and a Masculine.</p>
               <p>But all this will not serue, for I haue
learned the grammer too, and therefore
<hi>Come grammer rules, come now, your power
show,</hi> as saith the noble Astrophill. First
therefore I say, his no no is an affirmatiue.</p>
               <q>For in one speech two negatiues affirme.</q>
               <p>Secondly tell me pretty Will, what is a
nown substantiue? That that may be seene,
felt, heard, or vnderstood. Very well, now
I will ioyne issue with you on this point,
where shall we try it? Not in Cambridge
you will say, for I thinke they will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
on my side. Well then in Oxford be
it, and no better Iudge then M. <hi>Poeta,</hi> who
was cheefe Captaine of all the nownes in

For without all peraduenture, when
he shall here that one of his band, and so
neare about him, is brought to that state,
that he is neither to be seene, smelt, heard,
nor vnderstood, he wil sweare gogs nowns
he will thrust him out of his selected band
of the most substantial substantiues, &amp; sort
him with the rascal rablement of the most
abiect adiectiues. But now Sir that I haue
brought you to so faire a town as Oxford,
&amp; so sweet a companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as your son Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
I will leaue you to him that made you.</p>
               <p>Now (gentle Reader) you haue taken

in reading our Metamorpo-sis of A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>IAX:
and you supposed by this time to
haue done with me: but now with your
fauour I haue not done with you. For I
found by your countenance, in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and hearing hereof, that your conceit
oft-times had censured mee hardly, and
that somewhat diuersly, &amp; namely in these
three kindes.<note place="margin">Three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of this pamphlet.</note> First you thought me fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall;
secondly, you blamed my scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and thirdly, you found me satyricall.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4043:71"/>
To which three reproofes, being neither
causlesse nor vniust, doe me but the iustice
to heare my three answers.</p>
               <p>I must needes acknowledge it fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

thus much, yet I would not haue you

I would but aske you this question, and

haue asked after such a booke? would these
graue and sober titles haue wonne you to
the view of three or four tittles? much lesse
three or foure score periodes. But when
you heard, there was one had written of

A IAX, straight you had a great mind to
see what stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge discourse it would proue,
you made enquiry who wrote it, where it
might be had, when it would come forth.
You prayed your friend to buy it, beg it,
borrow it, that you might see what good
stuffe was in it. And why had you such a
minde to it? I can tell you; you hoped for
some meriments, some toyes, some scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility,
or to speake plaine English, some
knauery. And if you did so, I hope now
your expectation is not altogether fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.

a due praise without flattery, to one that

of the matter in question, so it toucheth in

too much in custome. All which the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that is honourable, wise, vertuous, and
a true louer of his countrey, must needes
take in good part. Now gentle reader, if
you will still say this is fantasticall, then I

it except it had bene fantasticall, and if
you will confesse the one, sure I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

that they were made like du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blets

they will serue: so if any man finde in these
my lines any raiment that sutes him so fit,
as if it were made for him, let him weare
it and spare not, and for my part I would
he could weare it out. But if he will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie

at it, then (as the old saying is) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shrew

him thus much (as his poore friend) that
the workeman that could with a glaunce

come and take a precise measure of

what sheere soeuer he dwelleth, he may
be knowne by such a coate as long as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.
Well, to conclude, let both the

our selues, and so we shall the easier amend
others, and then I shall thinke my labour
