         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the observation of one day of seauen, albeit it be positiue divine,
yet it is not ceremoniall nor for a time, but unchangable, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
perpetually, as is manifest by the time when it was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before the fall, when there was no type of redemption by
Christ, and by numbring it amongst the tenne precepts of the
morall law, written by the finger, and proclaymed by the voyce
of God, which cannot be said of any changable law. Neyther can
it be called perpetuall and morall in this sence, that a certaine
time is to be allotted to divine worship, for then the building of
the Tabernacle and temple, the new moones, and other legall
festivities conteyning in them a generall equitie, might aswell
be accounted morall. Secondly, the change of the Sabbath from
the last to the first day of the weeke, is by divine authoritie from
Christ himselfe, from whom it is called, the Lords day, who is
Lord of the Sabbath, who did institute the worship of the day,
and rested from his labours that day, whereon all things were


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7813:9"/>
made new by his resurrection, and sanctified it, euen as in the
beginning God rested from all his works on the seauenth day, &amp;
blessed it. He thinketh it no more contrarie to Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
then it was to Adam in his innocencie to keepe one of the
seauen, and therefore he laboureth to make the Sabbath his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
observeth it himselfe, and by his doctrine, example and
discipline teacheth others to doe the like, and to cease uot one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from all servill workes, which require greate labour of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
but from all our owne works whatsoever, drawing our minds
from the exercises of religion, and serving for our owne gaine
and commoditie, except in the case of necessitie, caused by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
providence. He would haue it well considered, wherein
the Jewes were more strictly obliged then Christians, and what
libertie we haue, that they had not. Beside the Sabbath he can
admitte no ordinary holy dayes appointed by man, whether in
respect of any mysterie, or of difference of one day from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as being warranted by meere tradition, against the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christ and his Apostles, but accounteth the solemne

3. The primitiue Bishops knew not such a creature, as was
designed afterward by the proude name of an Archbishop, who
should be a Bishop of bishops, having power over Comprovin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
bishops his suffraganes.</p>
                  <p>Our Prelate prydeth himselfe in this proude title, and will haue one &amp;
the same creature to be Metropolitane Archbishop and primate, that what
he may not doe as Metrapolitane he may doe as Archbishop, and what he
may not as Archbishop, he may as Primate and as another Pope.</p>
                  <p>4. The primitiue Bishop was in the presbyterie like the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull
in the Senat, as first amongst the presbyters he moderated in
their meetings, reported matters done before, asked the voters,
and what they concluded, he did see it executed upon others, and
was subject to it himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Our Prelate in the Presbyterie will be like a king in his Counsell, and
thinketh his authoritie no lesse without the presbyterie then with it, and
what the Synode may doe with the Arch-bishop, that he may doe without
the Synode.</p>
                  <p>5. The primitiue bishops dwelled so neare together, that sixe
of them convened in a cause that concerned an Elder, and three
for a deacon. In a Synode they convened in great numbers.
Privatus was condemned by 90 Bishops. Against Novatus were
convened 84 bishops. In some Synods 217, in some 270.</p>
                  <p>Our Prelate spreadeth his wings over some hundreds of Kirks, lying in
divers provinces also wide as Mers, Louthian, Fyffe, Angus, Mernes &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As therefore our Prelate was shewed before, not to be the
Lords bishop, authorised by Scripture, so is he not mans bishop
made up in the primitiue times of the Kirk, but the same that we
had before the reformation, the same with the Italian, Spanish,
or French Prelate under the Pope, and the same with the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Prelates, in the most corrupt times of the Kirk, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the last 500 yeares, excepting his subordination to the pope,
by which exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our princely prelate is made greater then the
popish. And what was written of the popish prelate in those
times, is of new againe reverified of ours, as of their civill offices

things indifferent.<note place="margin">1. In the Apostles times.</note> First in the infancie of the Christian
Kirk the heate and the contention was greate betwixt the
converted Jewes and Gentiles, aboute the keeping of the
Ceremonies of the lavv, which before vvere commanded,
afterwards were forbidden, but in that tract of time were
in a manner indifferent. Concerning vvhich we finde, that
the Apostles never imposed them upon any people or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that judged them unlavvfull, that they thought that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man should be persuaded in his ovvne mind, and should
doe nothing against, or vvithout the vvarrant of his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
that by all meanes scandall should be avoyded, as
vvhich bringeth vvoe upon him by vvhom it commeth, and
destruction upon him upon vvhom it commeth, and
many such rules of conscience and Christian prudence,
vvhich serue to the Kirk for direction in matters indifferent
to the comming of Christ.<note place="margin">2. At the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, among three sorts of men.</note> Secondly, there vvas greate bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
aboute ceremonies, and things called indifferent, in
the infancie of the Reformed kirks, in the time of the <hi>Interim,</hi>


                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:7813:16"/>
vvhen vvith so greate povver and persecution the Romish
corruptions vvere forced againe upon them, under the name
of indifferencie: at that time politicks and vvorldly men,
more carefull of their ovvn vvealth then of Gods trueth,
gaue themselues to serue the time, and received all that vvas
obtruded under the saide cloake of indifferencie. These
vvere accounted friends to Augustus. Others of greate gifts
and esteeme in the Kirk vvished from their hearts, that these
ceremonies had never been urged, yet thought it a lesse evill
to admit some thing in the externall part of Gods vvorship,
and thereby uniformitie in religion vvith the enemies, then
by a stoicall stifnes (as they call it) and an obstinacie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
authoritie, and thereby to bring upon themselues ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and upon Kirk and common vvealth desolarion.
Such men looking more to unitie, then to veritie, &amp; more to
the event, then to their ovvn duetie, vvere called ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie, vvise
and peaceable men. A third sorte setting aside all sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and collusion vvith the enemie, taught plainly by
vvord and vvrit from Scripture, and not from the grounds
of policie: that vvhen any part of Gods vvorship is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
that then for the honour of God, confirmation of the

                  </gap>eth, and edification of the Kirk, Confession is necessarie.
<hi>He that confesseth not me, he that is ashamed of me before men, &amp;c.</hi>
They taught, that it vvas not lavvfull to symbolize vvith the
enemie; that in the case of confession the smallest ceremonies
are not indifferent: that at such times the Kirk should stand
fast to her libertie, against such as vvould bring her into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage:
that yielding to such ceremonies vvas a great scandall,
it being a returning to the vomite, the patching of an old
cloute upon a nevv garment, &amp; making the vveake to thinke
that the reformation of the Kirk vvas not a vvorke of God,
but of man: that the untimely change of ceremonies vvas a
shevve of defection from the vvhole reformation: that vvhen
the enemie urgeth uniformitie, his intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should be looked
to, because he never rests, but proceeds from the corruption
of outvvard vvorship to corrupt the doctrine, and to leaue
nothing sound. Men that taught after this manner vvere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7813:17"/>
by the former politicks, and peaceable Formalists,
to be contentious spirits, and troublers of the peace of the
Kirk.<note place="margin">3. Among Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Kirks this day</note> Thirdly, albeit the reformed Kirks agree novv for the
most part in the generall, about the nature and use of things
indifferent, yet they goe far asunder in the application of the
generall to their particular practises. The Lutheran <hi>Kirks</hi>
hold some things for indifferent, vvhich the <hi>Kirk</hi> of England
receiveth not, and England holdeth a multitude of ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
aboute discipline and ceremonies for indifferent, vvhich
vve tabe to be unlavvfull, and beside the vvord. Everie Kirk
judging, or at least practising, according to theyr ovvne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of reformation: all crept not forth of that Roman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
equally accomplished. No marvell that some of them
should smell of the vvine of fornication, vvherevvith they
all for so many yeeres vvere drunke. But obstinacie against
the ingyring light, and the refusing of a further degree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
is fearefull, vvhat is it then to drawe others back
from their reformation, and to binde them up againe into
their old chaine of darknes. These manifold contentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
things called indifferent, and ceremonies haue proved
so pernitious by defacing the kingdome of Christ, setting up
the tyrannie of Antichrist, dividing Pastors, offending peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
dismembring the Kirk, and almost putting out the life of
true pietie, that vve may truly say, nothing hath proved lesse
indifferent to the Kirk, then the contentions about things
indifferent, and many haue been more hote for them, then
for the hart of religion, because they concerne the face of the
Kirk, and as Erasmus sayd in another cause, the crownes &amp;
bellies of Kirkmen. Whether our old Pastor, or nevv prelate

THE PASTOR,<note place="margin">The pastor resteth not in the estate of a Kirk; that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differentgood, but would be at fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reformation: the prelate incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to defection.</note> ever feareth defection, and stil
urgeth Reformation, till every thing be done in the
house of God, according to the will of God. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
the constitution of a Kirk, that is but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
good, or midway betwixt idolatrie and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
to be but like the lukewarmnesse of Laodicea.</p>
               <p>The PRELATE pleaseth himselfe in this, that there be many
Kirks in worse case, resteth in his indifferencie, and lukewarmnesse, and
rather inclyneth downward to further defection, then aymeth at any higher
Reformation, like the Priests of Samaria, that were al so earnest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the true worship at Ierusalem, as they were against Baal and his ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</p>
               <p>2. The PASTOR looketh not to the world but to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in matters of Religion,<note place="margin">The past thinketh not that indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which doth good or evil to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples soules: the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>late accounteth that indifferent, which doeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor evil to his worldly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</note> and therefore thinketh not that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
in Religion, which bringeth good or evill spirituall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Kirk, and the soules of the people, albeit in their worldly
estate immediately it doe them neyther good nor evill.</p>
               <p>The PRELATE esteemeth many things indifferent in Religion,
because they neyther bring good nor evill to his worldly estate, albeit they do
good or evill to the Kirk, and to the soules of the people, and looketh more
to the world then to religion in matters of religion.</p>
               <p>3. The PASTOR acknowledgeth three degrees of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of fayth,<note place="margin">The past, thinketh nothing indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that is warranted by the word: the prelate everything that is not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall.</note> some to be of the foundation and first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the doctrine of fayth, some to be neare the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
as the conclusions clearly following upon the former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the third to be of all other matters warranted by the
word, and what is of this third ranck, were it never so
farre from the foundation, and never so small in our eyes, not
to be a matter indifferent, but to binde the conscience, and to be
a matter of fayth.</p>
               <p>The PRELATE professeth the first and second to be matters of
fayth; but when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the third he esteemeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be no matters of
fayth, but indifferent and wondereth that a wiseman should be so precise
and puritanicall, as to stand upon matters that are not fundamentall, but
indifferent. For so he distinguisheth, making every thing eyther funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
or indifferent.</p>
               <p>4. The PAST.<note place="margin">The pastor findeth the direction for ceremonies to be as perfect under the gospel, as it was under the law but the prelate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth unto it, as if it were unperfect.</note> comparing the worship of God under the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell

Deu. 12. 32. <hi>Every word that I command you, that ye shall obserue
to doe, thou shalt not add unto it, neyther shall ye deminish from it, doeth
equally concerne both. That the mynd of man permitted to it selfe
would proue as vayne and foolish under the Gospell, as under the law,
and that Iesus Christ was faythfull as a Sonne in all the house of God,


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7813:18"/>
aboue Moses who was but a servant,</hi> and therefore albeit the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
observations under the Law were many, which was the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of the Kirk under the old Testament, and ours be few, which
is our benefit, yet the determination from God in all the matters
of his worship he findeth to be all particular, the direction of all
the parts of our obedience to be as cleare to us, that now liue
under the Gospell, as it was to them that lived under the Law.</p>
               <p>The PREL. as if eyther it were lawfull now to adde to the word, or
mans minde were in a better frame, or the Sonne of God were not so
faythfull as Moses the servant, or as if direction in few ceremonies could
not be as plaine as in many, would bring into the Kirk a new ceremoniall
law, made up of translations of divine worship, of imitations of false wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and of inventions of willworship, to succede to the abolished ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
under the Law, which he interpreteth to be the libertie and power of
the Christian Kirk in matters indifferent, aboue the Kirk of the old testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but is indeede the greate doore, whereby himselfe &amp; others, strange
office-bearers, whereby dayes, altars, vestures, crosse, kneeling, and all that
Romish rable his shaddow, haue entred into the Kirk of Christ, and which
will never be shut againe till himselfe be shut out, who while he is within
holdeth it wide open.</p>
               <p>5. The PASTOR giveth no power to the Kirk to appoint
other things in the worship of God,<note place="margin">The past. appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no new thing in the worship of God: but the prel. is a new lawgiver.</note> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are appointed already by

and constitutions about things before appointed, and to dispose
the circumstances of order &amp; decencie, that are equally necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in civill and religious actions, and therefore resolveth first,
that nothing positiue, or that floweth meerely from institution,
can be indifferent, or can be appointed by the Kirk. Secondly,
that reason may be giuen from Christian prudence, why things
are appointed by the Kirk thus and no other waies. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the constitutions of the Kirk about things indifferent can
not be universall for all times and Kirks, and therefore can not
be concluded upon any morall or unalterable ground, which
made the ancients to obserue, that albeit Christs coate had no
seame, yet the Kirks vesture was of divers colours, and that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is one thing, and uniformitie another.</p>
               <p>The PRELATE as a new Lawgiver will appoint new rites, and
mysticall signes in the Kirk, that depend upon meere institution, and are
not concluded upon any reason of Christian prudence for such a time and
place, but upon grounds unchangable, and therefore obliging at all times
and places, as is evident by the reason that he bringeth for festivall dayes,
kneeling in the sacrament &amp;c.</p>
               <p>6. The PASTOR distinguisheth betwixt the nature and
use of things indifferent,<note place="margin">The pastor is so far limited, that he thinketh nothing to be in use indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: but the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>late accounteth that to be precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; puritanisme</note> and confesseth with all the learned, that


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7813:18"/>
albeit many actions be in their nature indifferent, yet that all our
actions in particular (at least such as proceede of deliberation,
which is the exception of some of the Schoolmen) are eyther
good or evill, and not one of them all indifferent in matters most
indifferent, which obligeth him to seeke a warrant from God, for
that which he doeth, that he may doe it in fayth, to walke cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly,
to take heede to his words, gestures, &amp;c. and to do
all that he doeth to the glorie of God.</p>
               <p>The PREL. abhorreth this doctrine as the foundation of Puritanisme,
the restraint of his licentiousnes, and the ruine of his monarchie, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

to sinne, some with erring, some with doubting, and some with a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting

               <p>7. The PASTOR giveth eare to the H. Ghost,<note place="margin">The pastor feareth to giue offence in things indifferent: but the prelate is bold and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</note> charging

charge and threatning of the H. Ghost, whether he intend to giue scandall

were abolished, giveth offence to all sorts: as the boldnes and increase of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,

precisian. He calleth our pastors and our professors Puritanes,

it essentiall to the Puritane to walke preciesly, and not to be

there would be no puritane: for the profane and the puritane
are opposed. He then is the new Puritane that standeth for

Annah who for multiplying to pray, and povvring out

of Prelates was full of usurpation, and of all sorts of
corruption, whereof many did complaine,<note n="i" place="margin">Edenburgh anno 1575.</note> that it had no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and was never like to haue any blessing from God, resolue
at last to strike at the roote, &amp; therefore after many disputations
in private and publick, consultations with the greatest divines
of other reformed Kirks, and after long and mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
the second Booke of Discipline, pronuoncing the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
and office of the Prelate to be unlawfull, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
by consent of the whole Kirk, an ordinance made
that Bishops betake them to the charge of one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they exercise no civill Iurisdiction. The Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Fayth sworne and subscribed, wherein they oblige
themselues to continew in the doctrine &amp; discipline of this Kirk.


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7813:23"/>
The same yeere<note n="k" place="margin">Dundie. an. 1580</note> it was declared in the generall assemblie, that
the office of the Prelate was unlawfull in it selfe, and had no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in the Word of God, thereafter renued in covenant.</p>
                  <p>The PRELATE and men of that disposition, having in the ende
nothing to oppone, professed that they agreed in their consciences, consented
to the Acts of the Kirk, swore and subscribed the Confession of fayth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
the covenant with the Kirk, and helped to put on the coap-stone of
the Kirk of God with their owne hands,<note n="l" place="margin">Trenent. anno 1604.</note> Like as the same Confession of
fayth was subscribed by those that are now in the proudest places of prelacie,

Kirk and nation, &amp; to employ the benefite of the discipline now
established for the libertie of the kingdome of Christ, and against
the tyrannie of sinne and Sathan, addressed themselues all as one
man with greate fidelitie &amp; courage for the work of God, urged
residence and diligence in ministers, kept with successe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
their publike and solemne humiliations, made the pulpits to
sounde against papistrie and profanenesse, &amp; set all men on work,
as they had grace or place, for purging the countrie of all corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
and defending the Kirk against her profest enemies, who
never ceased by negociating with the Pope &amp; Spanish King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally
to labour for their owne and her ruyne, whereof the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
providence had disappointed them in 88.</p>
                  <p>The PRELATES authoritie at this time lay deade, and men of that
disposition made no greate Dinne. But the Kirk then (unlike that which
she is now) comely as Ierusalem, terrible, as an armie with banners, against
all her enemies did stand whole and sound in unitie and concord of her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
authoritie of her assemblies, divine order of her ministerie, &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of externall worship, with greate power and presence of the Spirit of
God in many congregations of the land, till at last, for unitie division en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the Kirk, prelacie that had slepte before, as wakened againe, and
this mysterie beginneth to worke of new, neyther by any cause offered by the
pastors of the Kirk at the 17 of December (as the enemie calumniates) for
after long tryall they were founde faultlesse, and faythfull by his Majesties
owne testimonie. Nor yet upon that occasion,<note n="m" place="margin">Perth. 1596.</note> for the meeting of the
Kirk for making that charge was indicted before that 17 day. But the
cause was a plot contryved before, for procuring peace to the popish Lords,
to make warre amongst the ministerie, and to divide them amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
For this effect 55 Problems were framed, to call the established

discipline of the Kirk in question, and as one and the same time way was
made for reconciliation of the Popish Lords, and for restitution of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
prelates. And the Schisme of our Kirk so well compacted before, began
at that time, not upon their parte who stande for the discipline, but by some
of the Prelates disposition, that is, of flattering and worldly mynded Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
who gaue other answers to thirteene of the fiftie fiue articles concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

that they might not be present in assemblies, to espye their proceedings, and
to reason against them, to abolish the true libertie and authoritie of assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
to protest that they were seeking no prelacie, neyther of the Popish

to oppose her enemies, Iesuites and Papists,, to falsifie the acts of the Kirk,
to promise to keepe all the cautions and conditions, made to hold them in

the height of his dignitie, they could not, comparing the first
temple with the second, but declare the griefe of their hearts for
the change, and their greate feare of alteration to be made in the
worship of God, when now the hedge of the Kirk was broken

                  <p>The PRELATE is of the Clergie, that seldome is seene penitent,

of impietie and iniquitie, that he hath seene in this land.</p>
                  <p>The PRELATE hath forgotten what himselfe and the
kirk was once, he hath wrought a greater defection in this kirk in the
shorte tyme of his Episcopacie, then was in the primitiue kirk for some
hundreths of yeares, and is so farre yet blinded with the loue of his place
in the world, that he maketh his worldly credite the Canon, and his prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
the touchstone of the tryall of all Religion. The Pope shall no more be
Antichrist, Papistrie may be borne with, Arminianisme may be brought
in, because they can keepe company with Prelacie. The Reformation is
Puritanisme, precisenesse, Separation and intollerable, because it can
not cohabitate with prelacie. The Gods of the Nations were sociall, and
could liue togither, but the God of Israel is a jealous God.</p>

prospers or decayes. This judgment of the Pastor is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon verie good reasons. For upon this estate of the
Kirk necessarily depends the glory of God, and salvation of

that all the riches of the earth, &amp; all the glorie of all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the vvorld are not to be put in ballance vvith the
glory of God, and the salvation of soules, that vvhich God

made against them: whereby it came to passe that contrarie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and vayn and curious teaching either entred not into our
Kirk, or was suddainly repressed and put to the doore, and Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie
that had place before, was well nigh put out of the land.</p>
               <p>The PRELATE hath neyther leasure nor liking to looke to such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
and accounts no heresie so worthy his animadversion, as the alleaged
heresie of <hi>Aerius</hi> and his followers. It is manifest in historie from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
that the heresies that haue most endangered the Kirk, haue either
beene forged by the ingines,<note place="margin">k As Christs reall descent into hell, many Lutherane, Arminian and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish errors.</note> or favoured and borne out by the authoritie and
credit of Prelates: <hi>b</hi> and this day, diverse false and dangerous doctrines are
partly vented, and partly wincked at by them: neyther thinketh he papists
greate enemies to the Kirk: but as the Iewish priests entertayned the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,
albeit enemies to true religion, and hated Christians as their deadly
foes, and as the Papist can agree with the formall Protestant, but thinks the

unconformable Calvenist his irreconcileable enemie, so the Prelate could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with the common Papist for all his blaspheamous doctrine and professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because he is a friend to his Hierarchie. But the Reformed Christian,
whom he calleth the Calvinist, and Puritane he can by no meanes beare,
because he is professed unfriend to his Hierarchie. A Prelate as a Prelate
is not opposite to the Papist, but to the Protestant.</p>

soules to borrowe eyther substance or ceremonie of religion

that it be not broken, and to the consciences of the weake, that

ministerie in singular regarde, as the most honourable and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
worke that he can be employed aboute, whereof the best
man is not worthy, and unto which the wole man is not sufficient,
and therefore is resident among the people, serveth not by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties

taken up with the Pastors dueties, of preaching, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
catechising, visiting, exhorting, rebuking, comforting, &amp;c.
but labours most diligently in the word and doctrine, because
fayth commeth by the Word preached.</p>
               <p>The PRELATE intending nothing, but to feede himselfe, at

his entrie to his prelacie, he regards not so much the number of soules he
should feede, as the number of chalders, the large revenues, and the great
dignities he is to feede upon, and the larger his Diocie, the better for him:
Hence is it, that he ascends from a Diocesan to an Archbishop, and a
Primate. After he is entred he disdayneth the worke of the Ministerie, as
base, and unworthy of bis grace and great Lordship, he serveth by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
and Suffraganes, and thinks it a more honourable and necessarie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
to attend and reside at Court, or at the places of civill judgment,
as Councell, Session, Exchequor, and howsoever he appropriates to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the reward of double honour due to them who labour in the word &amp;
doctrine, yet he thinkes, that he is not bounde to take the paines of that
worke, unto which the double honour is annexed. So the Pastor must
labour in the worke, and the Prelate must reape the reward, and which is
more prejudiciall to the peoples soules, he maintayneth that learned &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
preachers are not so necessarie in congregations, as Curats and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that there is too much preaching, and too litle reading and praying,
meaning nothing els but their confused Leitourgie.</p>
               <p>4. The PASTOR dare not do harme to the peoples soules,<note place="margin">The past. subject to the sdiscipline of the Kirk himselfe, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

because he is subject both in calling and conversation to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
of the Kirk, which stryketh upon the Pastor, as well as
upon the people, and to bring the transgressers to repentance, he
sitteth with his brethren in session, presbyterie &amp; assembly, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring
the holy discipline holily, that is, in sinceritie &amp; faythful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
without prejudice or partiality, and never ceasing, till the
scandall be removed, the Kirk be purged, and the offender (if it
be possible) be wonne unto God, and all this, as being Christs
owne worke, he doeth with Christs owne weapons, that is with
the spirituall sword of the word, which is mightie through God
to subdue every thing exalting it selfe against God, and to bring
sinners to repentance.</p>
               <p>The PRELATE may doe what harme he will for his owne tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
custome and prastise, but not by any law eyther of Kirk or state,
he exempteth himselfe in respect of his Episcopall administration, and
as he is a Prelate from all censure, and scorneth to submitte him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to any Ecclesiasticall judicature, albeit the chiefe Apostles sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
themselues unto the Kirk, and albeit there be no subject in a
Kingdome of whatsoever qualitie or condition, but in every respect he is
under the controulement of some judicature in the Land where he liveth.
And as he is thus singularly lawlesse of himselfe, so pretending the sole
power of proceeding to belong to him by vertue of his place and office, he
sweyeth the course of discipline, as best pleaseth his Lordship, processes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Hereby it commeth to passe, that where prelates rule, sinne reigneth, and
the nearer the Bishops wings, the greater libertie for sinne, as is seene in
their owne houses and traynes. And for this reason is it, that both Atheists
and Papists like the Episcopall discipline, better then the pastorall, which
they call straytelaced, because it troubleth their corruption, whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
layeth the reynes upon their neck. And if the Prelate happen to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
against offenders, his discipline consists not so much in spirituall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
as in worldly power and civill punishment, as fining, confining, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoning
&amp;c. which haue no power to worke upon the consciences of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to bring them to repentance, which is most proper for the preachers of
the Gospell, and the chiefe ende of Kirk discipline.</p>
               <p>5. The PASTOR for the good of the Kirk,<note place="margin">The pastor would haue all things be done for the good of the Kirk, by the free assemblies of the Kirk: the prel. will rule all by him selfe, whether in assembly, or out of assembly.</note> is desirous,
that the assemblies of the Kirk, provinciall and nationall, be often
holden and well kept, knowing how necessarie they are for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
things amisse, for fulfilling things omitted, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
evils that are like to ensue: and when the assemblie is
convened he carrieth himselfe toward his brethren, as toward the
servants of Christ, and collegues of equall authoritie, none presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to any place or preheminence, though of order onely, and
not of power, without the calling and consent of his fellow bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
There every one hath libertie to utter his minde, &amp; every
one is ready with the gift that God hath giuen him, as the diverse
members of one body, for the good of the whole Kirk: meeke
Moses and burning Elias, Esay with his trumpet, and Aaron with
his belles, Bonaerges and Barionah, the sonne of thunder, and the
sonne of the doue, all moved by one spirit, with mutuall respect,
reverence, and brotherly loue, joyne together in one conclusion,
and if at any time they be of different judgements, they are not
suddaine and summar in concluding things of importance, that
concerne the whole, but that all may be done with uniforme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
after the example of the Apostles Acts 15, the conclusion
is delayed, till all objections be satisfyed, and God giue greater
light to such as are otherwise minded, and so to the greate good
of the Kirk, both peace and trueth are preserved.</p>
               <p>The PRELATE is as averse from a free assembly, as the Pope is
from a free Generall councall, and therefore will eyther haue none at all,
or will haue them so slavish, as if they were but his ecclesiasticall courts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
under him, and in his name. When this Assemblie is convened, at
his owne hand, without calling or election, he taketh upon him to preside &amp;
moderate. There no man hath libertie to utter his mynd before him, who
hath power to raise up and cast downe, to inlarge and restreyne, to preferre
and postpone, or put in and put out at his pleasure, and therefore no mans
gift in such meetings doeth good to the Kirk. And if it happen that his
courses be crossed, and the best sort oppose, then he rageth, and by his proude


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7813:28"/>
boastings, and unreasonable raylings, he playeth the Prelate indeede, using
Christs ministers &amp; the Kirks Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners no better, then if they were his
slaues or lackeys, convened to say Amen to all his intentions, and to waite
upon Oracles falling from his mouth. In ende the pluralitie of voyces of
the weaker sorte, and for the most part either emendicate or extorted, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth

that he giveth not the Kirk to the Minister, but the Minister to
the Kirk, and in the act of ordination at the place where he shall
serue, and in presence of the whole Congregation, he requireth
of the Intrant neither oath nor promise, but what is appointed
by the assemblies of the whole Kirk, as constancie in the fayth,
obedience to the King, and fidelitie in his calling, and after he is

he be worthy of double honour farre aboue the Prelate himselfe, yet
the prelate contemneth him and his brethren, as poore presbyters, with

double contempt. Whereupon we see that the Prelates and others by their
example &amp; doing esteeme not of Ministers for their worth &amp; their works
sake, but as they are in places of preferment, and as they are clothed with

following after things which make for peace, Rom. 14. for by
the discipline and assemblies of the Kirk he preserveth veritie,
without which there is eyther no unitie, or such unitie, as is but a

so long as our assemblies had their libertie, there could arise
no heresie among us, if it had broken up in a parish, a consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
or presbyterie would haue borne it downe: or if it had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
further, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Synodall, or if it had not been able, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
assembly would haue suppressed it: for the same reason the
Kirk of France, which was nearest to ours, hath ben free of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie:
In the Low Countreysif the Kirks had enjoyed the libertie of
theyr assemblies, which they wanted for a long time, Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme
had neyther troubled them, nor their neighbours. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
can find in his heart to urge or inforce unprofitable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
Ceremonies upon the Kirk, if it were for no other cause,
but that they haue beene the apples of contention, and the cause
of many Schismes, and will choose rather with Ionah to redeeme

to be affected with Diotrephes his ambitious humour, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spyring
aboue his brethren, which is a speciall preservatiue of
peace. He studieth to preserue holynes, without which there can
be no sounde nor wholesome peace, he is ever at warre with that
which is contrarie to holynes, and sendeth away all scandalous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

               <p>The PRELATE is accounted a peaceeble man, and pretends alwaies
the peace of the Kirk, but indeede seeketh his owne peace and prosperitie,
and opposeth the things that make for peace: for if it serue for his owne

suffer numbers of soules, for whom Christ hath dyed, to perish,
and the Kirk of Christ tossed with troubles, by occasion of that noysome
baggage, to sinke at last under the burden. Contention also commeth
by his pride and ambition: for first, great places make great emulation, &amp;

               <p>The PRELATE hath a Lords rent out of the revenewes of the

porte in himselfe, his Ladie, their children and followers. He uniteth
Kirks farre distant, to maki the morsell the greater for his wide gorge: he
alloweth and defendeth pluralities, and Nonresidencies, by setting long
taks without knowledge or consent of the Kirk, and by setting of fewe
formes and taxwardes he raketh up all, and stinteth the Minister to a

                  <p>THE gouvernment and order appoynted by Christ can haue
no danger, discommoditie nor inconvenience, but such as
men bring upon it, and which through the neglect or contempte
thereof they bring upon themselues. That therefore must be the
best, which is best warranted by Christ, and approacheth nearest
to the simplicitie of the Apostles and the discipline of their times.
Malignant wits haue ever beene readie to lay imputations upon
Gods ordinances, as that his inward worship according to the
Gospell of Christ hath no wisedome, that the outward hath no
majestie, that his order of the Kirk is but Anarchie, because it is
not a monarchie: but as the naturall philosopher sayth, the order
of nature to be full of beautie, and the wise Statesman seeth the
beautie of the order of a wise policie: so the Christian, when he
seeth the order of the house of God, shall with the Apostle Col. 2.
rejoyce to see it, and will preferre the beautie thereof to the wise
government of the house &amp; Court of Salomon, as being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

when his eyes are opened to behold this wise order and marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

<list>
                        <item>1. Confusion hath no subordination for disposing of things, and setting
every thing in it owne place.
<p>The paritie mainteyned by the Pastor hath a lawfull sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
of Elders to Pastors, of Deacons to Elders, of
a Kirk Session to a presbyterie, of a presbyterie to a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node,

<p>Paritie of pastors so shunneth ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it mainteyneth
a prioritie of precedencie<note n="f" place="margin">Distinguendum inter autoritatem meriti, &amp; potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> and respect, for age, for zeale,
for gifts &amp;c. and a prioritie of order, whereby one is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator

                        </item>
                        <item>3. Confusion admitteth no commandement nor subjection:
<p>Paritie of Pastor, admitteth both: for every Pastor conducteth
his owne flock, &amp; every pastor is subject to a joynt fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

                        </item>
                        <item>4. Confusion is abhorred, both by nature and all Societies, as their greatest
enemie, which overturneth all, where it hath place.
<p>Paritie of Pastors hath the like paritie both in nature, and all
sorts of societie: for in nature one eye hath not power over
another, nor one hand over another, nor one foote over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
onely the head hath power over all. In the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
and kingdome there is a paritie without a prioritie
of power of jurisdiction betwixt one Baron and another, &amp;
betwixt one Nobleman and another, and in all the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giall
jurisdictions in the Land under the King himselfe. In
the worlde paritie betwixt one King and another, In the
Roman Kirk equalitie betwixt one Lord Bishop and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and betwixt two Archbishops, Patriarks &amp;c. and in

               <p>The PRELATE is unprofitable to the Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate

his government hath place, preaching hath more demonstration of
Arte for the praise of the speaker, then of the Spirit for the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
of sinne, and conversion of the sinner: He passeth small offences
without any censure, &amp; thereby openeth the way to the greatest sins of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
adulterie &amp;c. and giveth the Magistrate his hands full. He ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates
to his court and jurisdiction some crimes, as proper for his censure,


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7813:34"/>
which yet he passeth lightly. The censures of the Kirk and sword of
excommunication in his hand serue for small use against greater sins.
For eyther they are not used at all, or so partially, that the greatest sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
escape uncensured, or so superficially, that they are rather a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of mocking and boldnesse in sinne, then of repentance to the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

               <p>9. The PASTOR maketh the Kingdome fitte for

labouring to make the people truly religious, he maketh

and passiue, for doing valiantly, and suffering constantly.

               <p>The PRELATE maketh the Kingdome unfitte for warre: for by
his government the people loose true fortitude, with the loue of Religion,
that if they haue any kinde of Courage for battayle, it is not so much the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
courage of Christian Religion, as the carnall and bastard Fortitude
of Paganisme, which in comparison of the former hath ever been but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillanimitie.
By his oversight of ryoting and idlenes, their bodies become
weake and effeminate, and by his owne large rents, and his example of
prodigalitie, which to them is a law, he enervates the estate, and cutts
asunder the sinewes of warre.</p>

For such may neyther abide to be cured of their spirituall evils
by the Counsell of God, nor to heare of the evils that will come,
if they refuse to be cured, nor to exhorted to repentance,
when the calamities are turned upon them, that they may be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
away: but all are not such, and from which, while they are
in their pleasures, we make appellation to themselues, while they
are in the paines or terrors of death, &amp; to be presented before the
judge, whether the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pastor or prelate pleaseth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> better? The
other part of the objection, the wisdome of the King and of the
honourable Estates of Parliament can answer, who know how a
Parliament may be perfect without eyther Pastor or Prelate.
If, by the name of a parliament, we understand a generall &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
meeting of the whole Kingdome and Kirk by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7813:36"/>
with their supreame Magistrate, and King, every one
to giue his advise and judgment respectiue, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the societie civil, or ecclesiasticall, which he presents: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
of the Kirk, to giue resolution from the word of God,
if neede be, concerning matters civill, but not to meddle with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
causes civilly, and to propone petitions to the King &amp; estates
for the good of the Kirk, to require their civill sanction, &amp; to see
that nothing be concluded in things civill, that may be a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to the worship of God. The Nobilitie with Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of Barons, and Burrowes for civill matters, &amp; to add the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
sanction in the matters of Gods worship, Kirkmen chosen &amp;
instructed by the Kirk, may sit in Parliament after this sense, and
are bound to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tribute their best help for the honour of the King
&amp; good both of Kirk and Countrey. But if by a Parliament we
understand the highest Court &amp; supreame judicature civill, med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
onely with civill matters, or with matters of religion civilly,
as to adde the civill sanction, and to ratifie by civill authoritie,
what hath been put in Cannon by the Kirk before, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the Kirk or their Commissioners may, or should attend the
High Court of parliament, as the Convocation house doth in our
neighbour Kingdome, but can haue no place nor vote in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
neither in making lawes aboute things civill, nor in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
authorising in matters of Religion: for Ministers should not
judge of the right of inheritance, nor pronounce sentence aboute
forfeyture, nor make lawes about weights, and measures &amp;c. but
should exhort the people to obey the civill powers. Without bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
or ministers lawes haue been made by Parliament, &amp; may
be made now no lesse then without Abbots, Priors &amp;c. who had
once vote in Parliament no lesse then they. Their benefices are
Baronies, in respect whereof they claime vote in parliament; but
they are not Barons or proprietars, &amp; heretable possessors thereof
to transmit them to their heirs, or to alienate them, but onely are
usufructuaries to haue the use of the fruits of them for their time.
Neither doth it suite with the ministers calling, to haue such Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies,
nor are they to be reckoned for ecclesiasticall persons, but
for civill, when they haue place in parliament in respect of these
Baronies, and therefore cannot vote there in name of the Kirk.</p>
                  <p>TO conclude then,<note place="margin">Conclusion.</note> whether we looke to the word of God, or
to the more pure and primitiue times of the Kirk, or to the
nature &amp; use of things indifferent, or to the Reformation and
proceeding of our owne Kirk, or the good of the Kirk, and of
the peoples soules, or to the happinesse of the Commonwealth,
and the good of every one, from the King that sitteth upon the


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7813:36"/>
Throne, to him that heweth the woode, and draweth the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we may see, whether the Pastor, or the Prelate, whether
Reformation or Conformitie is to be followed by the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and Countreyman. And that there is as greate difference
betwixt the Bishops of our times, and the faythfull Pastors of
the Reformed Kirks, as is from the light that commeth from
the starres of heauen, and the thick darkenesse that ariseth from
the bottomlesse pitte. And it may be made manifest, that since
Bishops were cast in the moulde of the man of sinne, wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they haue ruled, whether amongst the Papisticall and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
(some fewe excepted, who when they ventured upon
these places, wente out of their owne element) they haue been
the greatest plagues both to Kirks, and Kingdomes, that ever had
authoritie in the Christian world. Neither needeth any man to
object,<note place="margin">A generall objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on answered.</note> that the Comparison that we haue made, runneth
all the way betwixt the good Pastor, and the evill Prelate, and
therefore may be answered by the like unequall comparison, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the good Prelate and the evill Pastor, as if the most part of
the episcopall evils aboue mentioned were onely the personall
faults of the men, &amp; not the corruptions necessarily acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panying
the estate and order of Prelates, and that if good men fill these
places, there is no danger but the Kirk may be aswell, or better
governed by prelates, then by Pastors: for the comparison is
not so much betwixt the Pastor and Prelate, as betwixt the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a Pastor and the office of a Prelate or Bishop.<note n="s" place="margin">Aliud est injusta potestate justè velle uti, &amp; aliud est ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta potestate injustè velle uti. August. de bono conjug. cap. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>It is one
thing</hi> (as Augustine sayth) <hi>to use an unlawfull power lawfully, and an
other thing to use a lawfull power unrighteously and unjustly.</hi> Pastors
may haue their owne personal infirmities, and never so many
as under the Prelates gouvernment: and Prelates may haue their
owne good parts, and never so many as by the occasion of the
Pastors opposition: but neyther the one nor the other are to be
ascribed to their offices, nor is the lawfulnesse and unlawfulnesse
of their offices to be judged by their persons. It is true, when
an unlawful power and a lawlesse man meete together the case of
those that are under his authoritie must be the worse, as we may
see in the Papacie, which being alwaies evill for the Kirk, yet
haue proved worse, when monsters in steade of men haue sitte in
that seate. But it is evident, that the evils which Prelates and
their Lordly government bring upon the Kirk, doe flowe from
their sole jurisdiction, exorbitant power, medling in civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the curse of God upon that unlawfull estate, all
which are common to the whole order, and not peculiar to some
persons. And the corruptions which are common to all in these
places, although greater in some then in others, of necessitie


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7813:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
must flowe from the unlawfulnesse of the state and office it selfe.
It is so farre, that good men put in the places of Prelacie, can
make the government good, that the places of prelacie haue ever
corrupted the men, and made them worse. So it was with Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas
Sylvius, who before his Popedome seemed sound and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
mainteyning many points against the tyrannie of the seate,
but being made Pope Pius the II, retreated all, and proved as
impious and Antichristian as the rest: So many that haue beene
of good account in the Ministerie, and giuen hope of great good
by them to the Kirk, when they entred to be Bishops, yet whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
degenerated from their first works, and learned betime <hi>ulu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare
