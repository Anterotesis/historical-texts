         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE following Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
having been
much taken notice
of, and many Coppies of it
handed about, it's hop'd that
the rendring of it publick may
be very acceptable. The
Prince whoſe Character it
is, was generally belov'd
by the People; yet his faults
both as a King and a Man,
<pb facs="tcp:48279:4"/>
were Univerſally obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſo that it can be
no ſurprize to any one to
find him both well and ill
ſpoken of; for his Greateſt
Enemies will allow that he
was endowed with many
Princely Vertues; and the
Greateſt of his Friends
muſt likewiſe confeſs that
he had his Remarkable Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
It cannot be denyed,
but that in both thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
the different Factions
have been guilty of Exceſs,
and have exceeded the Rules
of Modeſty, both in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding
and condemning
<pb facs="tcp:48279:4"/>
him; for every one ſpeaks
of him according as they
were advantag'd or endama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by him; or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the Humour or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Party which
they eſpouſe inclines them.</p>
            <p>The Roman-Catholicks,
tho they cannot deny his
many good offices to them,
and their Church; yet they
accusſe him of Cowardice
and Diſſimulation, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
plaid faſt and looſe with
them, and were therefore
impatient to have his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on his Throne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48279:5"/>
The high flown Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
did mightily admire
him, becauſe he reſtor'd
them to their ancient Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and made them Lords
paramount to all other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
ſo that they would
neither ſee any of his faults
when he was Alive, nor will
they hear of 'em now
he's Dead.</p>
            <p>The Cavaliers were ſome
of them very well pleas'd,
and others of 'em as highly
diſguſted with his Conduct,
according as he anſwered or
diſappointed their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
And it was very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
<pb facs="tcp:48279:5"/>
that his Couſin
Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> the Cavalier-General,
with many of thoſe
who had fought for his
Father, did at laſt grow
diſſatisfied with his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tories</hi> ador'd him for
advancing the Prerogative,
and giving them the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
over the <hi>Whiggs,</hi> whom
they proſecuted for their
Lives, Reputations and
Eſtates.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Whiggs,</hi> tho many
of them had a perſonal eſteem
for him, were never conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his Adminiſtration;
<pb facs="tcp:48279:6"/>
and Generally entertained
this Character of him, That
he gave himſelf up to all
ſenſual Pleaſures without
Controul: And was irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
to any who interrupted
his Luſts; that he debaucht
the Nation more in its
Manners than ever any other
King did before him; that
he ſquandred away the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Revenues of the Crown,
which were eſteemed ſacred;
and left ſuch a Debt upon
it as was never before heard
of. That he proſtituted his
Majeſty, by being a Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to <hi>France:</hi> And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb facs="tcp:48279:6"/>
the Power of that
Monarch, to the endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Liberties of
<hi>Europe.</hi> That he imbroil'd
his own Subjects in Inteſtine
Feuds; and did ſo vitiate
all publick Offices, both
Sacred, Civil and Military,
with Bribery and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as it will be hard to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them. That he was
ungrateful to the Nation
for their Loyalty, and the
incredible Sums which they
powr'd upon him. That
he leſſened the Reputation
and ſtrength of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
overturned the Laws,
<pb facs="tcp:48279:7"/>
and invaded the Properties
of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>The Diſſenters again
ſcarcely afford him one good
word, but attribute all the
Corruption of our Morals
to the ill Conduct of his
Reign, and his own bad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
They charge him
with advancing the Intereſt
of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and
as having been an open
Fautor of <hi>Hobbiſm, Deiſm</hi>
and what not. They charge
him alſo with the greateſt
Perjuries that ever were
heard of, as the breach of
their ſolemn League and
<pb facs="tcp:48279:7"/>
Covenant, and his Delara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from <hi>Breda.</hi> They
complain of his having
weakned the Proteſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in the Nation, by
ſetting one party of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
to deſtroy another;
and expoſing all Piety and
Seriouſneſs to Ridicule; they
upbraid his Memory with his
manifold Whoredoms, which
hath ſo much infected the
Youth of the Nation, and
is attended by ſuch diſmal
Conſequences. And in ſhort,
there's ſcarcely any Party
who ſpeak moderately of
him; but do either exceed in
<pb facs="tcp:48279:8"/>
his praiſe or his diſpraiſe;
and therefore there's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to conceive that the
following Character of him
by a perſon of Honour, who
had the opportunity of
knowing him ſo well, and
who is ſo duly qualified in
all Reſpects to write it, will
be very acceptable.</p>
            <p>It is alſo to be noted that
as there is a great difference
amongſt Men and Parties,
as to their Accounts of this
Prince's Life, they are at no
leſs variance as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his Death; in which
moſt are agreed that there
<pb facs="tcp:48279:8"/>
was ſome Fraud, tho they
differ exceedingly as to the
Means and Inſtruments. Some
aſcribe it to the Intrigues
of <hi>France,</hi> who as they
undid the Father by a Wife,
they ruin'd the Son by a
Miſtreſs, and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. being
weary of feeding him with
Penſions, and dreading his
Natural Parts, if upon any
diſguſt he ſhould come to
unite againſt <hi>France</hi> with
his Parliaments, he thought
it his Intereſt to take him
off, and make way for a
Succeſſor, who, as he made
<pb facs="tcp:48279:9"/>
open profeſſion of his own
Religion, would be more pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his Dictates.</p>
            <p>Then as to the method
of effecting it, they ſay it
was thus, that the <hi>D.—es</hi> of
<hi>P—th</hi> who bewitch'd him
with her Amours, and had
not only drain'd the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of his Body, but
likewiſe the ſubſtance of his
Purſe, either of which being
once brought to paſs, the Love
of a St—et to her Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
vaniſhes, ſo that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a mind to Change Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,
or ſeeing no more
hopes of former advantages,
<pb facs="tcp:48279:9"/>
ſhe gave him ſuch Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
as made him act beyond
his natural ſtrength, and threw
him into theſe Apoplectick
Fits which carried him off.</p>
            <p>There are others who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
it to the R. C. Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who being angry at his
having ſo frequently decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them; and impatient
till they came to a Trial of
Skill for eſtabliſhing their
Religion, while <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV.
was in the height of his Power
and Glory, did therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
the Fatal Doſe,
which ſent King <hi>Charles</hi> II.
a going, and brought his
<pb facs="tcp:48279:10"/>
Brother to the Throne, under
whoſe Auſpicious Conduct
they made no doubt of reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to the
full poſſeſſion of all that ſhe
had formerly enjoyed in
<hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and to
make an amends to his Soul
for the Injury they did his
Body, they took care to have
thoſe about him that ſhould
perform the laſt Offices, in
making him an intire Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte
to the Romiſh Faith.
There are others who ſay,
that all this was a ſham, tho
atteſted by his Brother, and
the other unexceptionable
<pb facs="tcp:48279:10"/>
Evidence the <hi>Strong-Box;</hi> and
that all the time which they
pretended to ſpend in taking
care of his Soul was really
taken up in Cheating the
Nation of their Money, by
Sealing a Leaſe of the
Cuſtoms; that ſo they
might be enjoyed by his
Succeſſor after his Death,
whereas the Parliament had
only ſettled them upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
during Life. This is
what is thought fit to be
ſaid by way of Preface to
the Character of a Prince,
concerning whoſe Life, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb facs="tcp:48279:11"/>
and Death there are ſo
many various ſentiments.</p>
            <p>It's true that there are ſome
who would excuſe his Brother
from having any acceſſion
to his death, there's none
who have any reaſon to
doubt that if he came to an
untimely end, it was by the
Hands of the Papiſts, for
the high <hi>Church of England<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
they had no reaſon to
be weary of his Grovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor ground to expect
the like favours from his
Brother that they receiv'd
from him. As to the State
Whiggs or Excluſioners, it
<pb facs="tcp:48279:11"/>
was not their Intereſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for they had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to think that ever they
ſhould enter into his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
reſt as the late King
himſelf is ſaid to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
it to ſome of that Party,
who attended him upon his
Coming to the Throne: Nor
were they in a Condition to
have favour'd <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s
Title at the time of King
<hi>Charles</hi> his Death, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
by that unfortunate
Gentleman's deplorable fate
when he put in ſo boldly
for his Father's Crown, ſo
that Malice it ſelf cannot
<pb facs="tcp:48279:12"/>
faſten it on the Whiggs as
having cut him off to make
way for <hi>Monmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then for the Proteſtant
Diſſenters, they had no Acceſs
to his Court nor perſon and
were under the leaſt tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any Party to wiſh for
his death, ſeeing they knew
the D. of <hi>York</hi> to be their
Irreconcileable Enemy, and
always the greateſt promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of their perſecution, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
when the Intereſt of his
own Party perſwaded him to
moderation.</p>
            <p>There's no doubt but this
Introduction will be as vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb facs="tcp:48279:12"/>
cenſured as there are
Variety of Factions, but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every body takes the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to think and ſpeak of
the two Princes who are the
Subject of theſe few Sheets,
according as their Intereſt
and Inclination leads them,
it's but reaſonable that they
ſhould allow others the ſame
privilege with themſelves;
and if they have better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for the Negative than
are here laid down for the
Affirmative, they have the
ſame liberty of making them
known to the World, and
thus they are left to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal
<pb facs="tcp:48279:13"/>
of what follows, which
is enough to ſatisfie them
that the Author is no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
in the matter, ſeeing he

            <head>A
Short Character
OF
CHARLES II.
King of England.</head>
            <head type="sub">Setting forth his untimely Death.</head>
            <p>I Have pitched on this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of King <hi>Charles</hi> the II.
not for his being a King, or
my having had the Honour to ſerve
him. The firſt of theſe would be
too vulgar a conſideration, and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48279:14"/>
other too particular: but I think it
a Theme of Great Variety, and
whatever is wanting in the Writer,
may, I hope, be Recompenced, in the
agreeableneſs of the Subject, which
is ſometimes enough to recommend
a Picture (tho' ill drawn) and to
make a face one likes oftner look'd
on, than the beſt Peice of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin then according to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
with his Religion, which ſince
his death hath made ſo much noiſe
in the World, I yet dare confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm it to be only that which is
Vulgarly (tho' unjuſtly) counted
none at all, I mean Deiſm. And this
uncommon Opinion he owed more
to the Livelineſs of his parts, and
careleſsneſs of his Temper, than either
to reading or much conſideration;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48279:14"/>
for his quickneſs of Apprehenſion at
firſt View could diſcern thro' the
ſeveral Cheats of Pious pretences,
and his natural Lazineſs confirm'd
him in an equal miſtruſt of them all,
for fear he ſhould be troubled with
Examining which was beſt.</p>
            <p>If in his early Travels, and late
deſigns, he ſeem'd a little Byaſſed
to one ſort of Religion; The firſt is
only to be imputed to a certain eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Temper, and a Complaiſance
for that Company he was then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to keep; and the laſt was no
more than his being tired (which he
ſoon was in any difficulty) with thoſe
bold oppoſitions in Parliament, which
made him almoſt throw himſelf into
the Arms of a Roman Catholick
party, ſo Remarkable of late for their
Loyalty, who imbraced him gladly,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48279:15"/>
and lull'd him aſleep with thoſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting
Songs of Soveraignty, which
the beſt and wiſeſt of Princes are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
unable to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>And tho engaged himſelf on that
ſide more fully at a time, when 'tis
in vain, and too late to diſſemble,
we ought leſs to wonder at it, than
to conſider, that our very Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are apt to grow in time as
partial as our affections; And thus
by accident only, he became of their
Opinion in his weakneſs, who had
ſo much endeavoured always to
contribute to his Power.</p>
            <p>He loved eaſe and quiet, to which
his unneceſſary Wars, are ſo far from
being a Contradiction, that they are
rather proof of it, ſince they were
made only to comply with thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48279:15"/>
whoſe diſaffections would have
proved more uneaſy to one of his
humour, than all that diſtant noiſe of
Cannon which he would often liſten
to, with a great deal of Tranquility.
Beſides the great and almoſt only
pleaſure of mind, he appears addicted
to, was Shipping and Sea affairs,
which ſeemed to be ſo much his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
both for knowledge, as well as
inclination, that a War of that Kind,
was rather an Entertainment, than
any Diſturbance to his thoughts.</p>
            <p>If he did not go himſelf at the
head of ſo magnificent a Fleet, 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be imputed to that eagerneſs
of Military Glory, in his Brother,
which under the ſhow of a decent
care for preſerving the Royal perſon
from danger, ingroſſed all that ſort
of honour to himſelf, with as much
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48279:16"/>
jealouſie of any others interpoſing
in it, as a King of another Temper
would have had of his. 'Tis certain
no Prince was ever more fitted by
nature for his Countries intereſt than
he was, in all his Maritime Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which might have proved of
ſufficient advantage to this Nation,
if he had been as carefull in depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
all ſuch improvements in <hi>France,</hi>
as of advancing and encouraging
our own; but it ſeems he wanted
jealouſy in all his inclinations; which
leads us to conſider him in his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p>Where he was rather Abandoned
than Luxurious, and like our Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
Libertines, apter to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into Debauches for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of others, than to ſeek with
choice where moſt to pleaſe himſelf;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48279:16"/>
I am of Opinion alſo, that in his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times there was as much of Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as of Love, in all thoſe hours
he paſſed among his Miſtreſſes, who
after all only ſerved to fill up his
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> while a bewitching kind of
pleaſure called Sauntring, and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without any conſtraint, was
the true Sultana Queen he Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in.</p>
            <p>He was ſurely inclined to juſtice,
for nothing elſe would have retained
him ſo faſt to the ſucceſſion of a
Brother againſt a Son he was ſo fond
of. And the humour of a Party which
he ſo much feared, I am willing alſo
to impute to his Juſtice, whatever
ſeems in ſome meaſure to contradict
the general Opinion of his Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as his ſuffering always the Rigor
of the Law, to proceed not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48279:17"/>
all Highwaymen, but alſo
ſeveral others, in whoſe Caſes
the Lawyers, according to their
wonted cuſtom, had uſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a great deal of Hardſhip and
Severity.</p>
            <p>His underſtanding was quick and
lively, in little things, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
would ſoare high enough in
great ones, but unable to keep it up,
with any long attention or applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
witty in all ſorts of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and telling a ſtory ſo well, that
not out of flattery, (but for the
pleaſure of hearing it) we uſed to
ſeem ignorant of what he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
to us ten times before, as a
good Comedy will bear the being
often ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48279:17"/>
Of a wonderfull mixture, loſing
all his time, and ſetting his whole
heart on the Fair Sex, yet neither
Angry with Rivals, nor in the leaſt
Nice as to the being beloved, and
while he ſacrificed all things to
his Miſtreſſes, he would uſe to grudge,
and be uneaſie at their loſing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of it again at Play, tho' never ſo
neceſſary for their diverſion, nor
would he Venture 5 <hi>l.</hi> at Tennis
to thoſe Servants who might obtain
as many thouſands, either before
he came thither, or as ſoon as he left
of.</p>
            <p>Full of Diſſimulation, and very
<hi>adroit</hi> at it, yet no man eaſier to be
impoſed on, for his great dexterity
was in cozening himſelf, by gaining a
little one way, while it coſt him ten
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48279:18"/>
times as much another, and by
Careſſing thoſe perſons moſt, who
had deluded him the oftneſt, and yet
the quickeſt in the world at Spying
ſuch a Ridicule in another.</p>
            <p>Eaſy and good natured to all
people in trifles, but in greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
ſevere, and inflexible, in one
weeks abſence, quite forgeting
thoſe Servants to whoſe faces he
could hardly deny any thing.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of all his Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſo induſtrious, and indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
on ſome particular occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that no man would either
toil longer, or be able to manage
it better.</p>
            <p>He was ſo Liberal as to Ruine
his affairs by it, for want in a K.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48279:18"/>
of <hi>England</hi> turns things juſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
down, and Expoſes a Prince
to his peoples mercy, it did yet
worſe in him, for it forced him
alſo to depend on his great Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of <hi>France,</hi> who played the
Broker with him ſufficiently, in all
thoſe times of Extremity, yet this
profuſeneſs of his did not ſo much
proceed from his over valuing
thoſe he favoured, as from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing
any ſumms of Money,
which he did not ſee tho' he
found his Error in this, but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
a little of the lateſt.</p>
            <p>He had ſo natural an Averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to all formality, that with as
much Wit as moſt men ever had,
and as Majeſtick a Mien, yet
he could not on premeditation
act the Part of a King for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48279:19"/>
either at Parliament or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
either in Words or Geſture,
which carried him into the other
Entream, more inconvenient of the
two, of letting all Diſtinction and
Ceremony fall to the Ground, as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and foppiſh.</p>
            <p>His Temper both of Body and
Mind was Admirable, which made
him an eaſie generous Lover; A
Civil obliging Husband, a Friendly
Brother, an Indulgent Father,
and a good natured Maſter. If he
had been as Solicitous about improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the faculties of his mind, as he
was in the Management of his bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
health, (tho' alas 'tis proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to make his life long) that had
not failed to have made it Famous.</p>
            <p>He was an illuſtrious Exception,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48279:19"/>
to all the Common Rules of Phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
for with a moſt Satur<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

both of a Merry and Mercifull
Diſpoſition, and in the laſt 30.
years of his life, as Fortunate as
thoſe of his Fathers had been Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
and tumultuous. If his Death
had ſome appearance of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely,
it may be Partly imputed to
his Extream, healthy conſtitution,
which made the world as much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
at his dying before threeſcore,
as if nothing but an ill accident
could have Killed him.</p>
            <p>I would not ſay any thing on ſo
ſad a Subject; If I did not think ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
it ſelf in ſuch a Caſe, would
ſignifie too much; And therefore
as an Impartial Writer, I am oblig'd
