            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, it was an old complaint of an <hi>Heathen,</hi> that the noise of the old <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> opinions did hinder their dung-hill gods from hearing their prayers: And it is no very new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of a <hi>Christian,</hi> that the many idle sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties of the <hi>Schoole</hi> have so drawn up <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> to the highest pegge of a curious mind, that it hinders the heart from moulding it into <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and <hi>practice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This grave and <hi>serious Divine,</hi> whose living Sermons are here commended to thee when hee is dead, saw it with both eyes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though he was no small master in subtleties, yet all his thoughts were bent to draw them downe from the floating braine, to the feeling
<pb facs="tcp:34997:6"/>
heart; that his hearers might be better brought to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>doe.</hi> As this hath been his course in all his writings before extant; so is it in this, that now comes to thy hands. How might he have hid himselfe in the <hi>thornes of specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?</hi> How high might hee have flowne in the curious extracts of every word of this Text? But he, that delighted to speake <hi>ten words to edification,</hi> rather then ten thousand that could not pierce every ordinary braine, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himselfe <hi>to fill up deepe foards</hi> to make them passable, and to wade the sweete and shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low streames of the love of the Lord Iesus.</p>
                  <p>He might, from hence, have set himselfe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mount of <hi>cursings,</hi> and showred downe worse then fire and brimstone upon delinquents: but the meeknesse of his spirit carries him up to the mount of <hi>blessings,</hi> to learne good soules through death to finde life, through threatnings to meete with comforts.</p>
                  <p>Hee, being lifted up by the Divine love of <hi>Christ,</hi> doth describe love, and our <hi>love to Christ:</hi> He soares to the <hi>equity,</hi> and <hi>necessity</hi> of it: He rests not before he have given you the <hi>meanes, motives, markes,</hi> gaines <hi>qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> and <hi>obiects</hi> of this love. How faine
<pb facs="tcp:34997:6"/>
would he have thee <hi>love the Lord Iesus,</hi> that thou maiest avoid the <hi>curse,</hi> and enioy the <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing!</hi> Hee knew nothing more necessary for a good Christian then this love. First, he must be a Christian by <hi>faith;</hi> next, hee must live a Christian by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love</hi> too: Hee can doe neither without the love of Christ to him; and this hee can not have but in his time: hee shall have <hi>faith in Christ,</hi> and <hi>love to the Lord Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is neither <hi>thing,</hi> nor <hi>love</hi> in all the world more comfortable to a good man then this: Sinne presseth hard downe, and pulls him back from heaven; Satan baites both the hands, and hookes of the world, <hi>prosperity,</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,</hi> to entangle him; Death brings him downe to the <hi>bed of darkenesse,</hi> the land of oblivion, and laies him up as a despised lumpe: But if hee have <hi>this love,</hi> when all vanishing <hi>bubbles</hi> flie away; this mounts him up into the <hi>bosome of God.</hi> As water, be it convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Pipes never so low, yet in the same Pipes it will rise up as high as the Spring head: so this <hi>love</hi> springing from the bosome of <hi>God,</hi> though it bee shed abroad, and runne through the <hi>channels</hi> of our hearts on earth, yet with a
<pb facs="tcp:34997:7"/>
willing motion it mounts up to <hi>Christ</hi> againe, and carrieth us along with it in despite of stormes. Where we <hi>love,</hi> we <hi>live:</hi> where wee <hi>love,</hi> we desire to be; and <hi>God</hi> hath so ordered, that this appetite shall not be in vaine.</p>
                  <p>And as for other <hi>Loves,</hi> see whether the <hi>Love of the Lord Iesus</hi> doe not surpasse them all Love other things, and yet often they slide away from thee, so that in them thou hast but a momentany joy: But love thy <hi>Lord,</hi> and, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so he <hi>he abides with thee for ever,</hi> and is to thee a <hi>spring of everlasting joy.</hi> Love other things, and they cannot know the sincerity of thy heart, how much, and in what manner and measure thou lovest them: But love thy <hi>Lord,</hi> and hee knowes better the love of thy heart then thy selfe: Thou maist say unto him, as did <hi>Peter, Thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee;</hi> and shalt find entertainment answerable. Love other things, and thou hast vexing care over them, both about their gaining, keeping, and losing: But love thy <hi>Lord,</hi> and thy care is sweete for him; yea, <hi>he careth for thee</hi> in all thy wayes. Thou canst lose nothing by it, no not thy heart, which though it goe out to him, and he keepes it,
<pb facs="tcp:34997:7"/>
yet hee gives it to thee againe, and that better then it was, to comfort thee in thy whole course.</p>
                  <p>Love other things, and thou findest not them at all times, nor so often as thou wouldest: when thou hast need thou canst not speake to them so often as thou wouldst, neither doe they harken to thy words as thou couldst wish: But love thy <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>hee is with thee alwaies to the end of the world:</hi> Thou maiest speake to him at any time, by night, or by day; he heareth thee at all times, and <hi>gives thee thy hearts desires.</hi> Love other things, and thou canst not know their secrets; there may bee something in them which may bee vexations unto thee in the issue; there may lye a snake under the greene grasse, a filthy loade under a sweet flower, and a worme in the heart of a defired apple. But love thy <hi>Lord,</hi> and he will reveale the <hi>mystery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,</hi> and his <hi>hidden secrets</hi> of truth unto thee according to his word; yea, thou shalt see that nothing but that which is glorious in it self, and good for thee, is either in him, or about him.</p>
                  <p>Love other things, and they put thee to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a trouble; they hinder thee in thy prayers, and
<pb facs="tcp:34997:8"/>
all thy service to God, because thou dost alwaies think, and dote upon them: But love thy <hi>Lord,</hi> and hee bringeth into thy heart and conseience, <hi>peace which passeth all understanding.</hi> The more thou lovest him when thou prayest, the more hee gives thee to thy selfe; yea, the more he gives thee to himselfe, and fills thee with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfort.

                  </p>
                  <p>Love other things, and they seeke at thy hands a profit and gaine to themselves, or else they perish in thy love. They will take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage upon thy love to worke upon thee for their owne perfections: But love thy <hi>Lord,</hi> and hee seekes thy profit and perfection: he alwaies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures to glorifie himselfe in doing thee good. Love other things, and most times they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee, they are often lyars, variable, and inconstant: But love thy <hi>Lord,</hi> and thou shalt be assured: hee is most true, and unchangeable, and thou maist build upon him, that <hi>hee will not faile thee nor forsake thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:34997:8"/>
Love other things, and ofttimes they cause griefe and heavinesse, and so doe highly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please thee: But love thy <hi>Lord,</hi> and it banisheth feare and sad <hi>confusion of face,</hi> because thou canst see nothing in him that can displease thee. Lastly, love other things, and thou knowest not assuredly whether thou art loved of them again: But love thy <hi>Lord,</hi> and thou maist bee assured that he answereth thee with the same; yea, with better; for hee cannot but love a blessed child of the <hi>begetting of his owne will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By how much more excellent this love is then the love of all things else, by so much the more must thou presse to enjoy and practice it. Every thing naturally desires that which is best for it. If it have it not, it is from the errour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the object, or the miscariage of the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. That therefore thou maiest faile in neither, but mayest have the best object, and the best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite cleared from clouds of ignorance and sin unto thee, these five Sermons of <hi>an experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced master in Israel</hi> are tendred unto thee. If thou reapest benefit by them, give glory to <hi>God,</hi> who would not have this lampe of love <hi>kept under a bushel,</hi> and buried in oblivion.
<pb facs="tcp:34997:9"/>
If thou receivest the least encouragement, from these foregoing lines, to make use of this light, know that they proceede from the love of thee in <hi>Christ,</hi> in him, who desires thy prayers, that hee may <hi>love the Lord Iesus</hi> both in life and death. Farewell.</p>

al S. <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching, that faith and love, were that which he drave at; those two roots, those two pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars on which the Church is built, from whence all the rest flow: Hereby teaching Ministers what they should beat at, what should bee their aime: A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d so people are taught hence what to doe: they must water these two roots well, and then the branches will flourish. Our wisedome should bee to looke to these; for these being strong, all will be strong: If these bee weake, all will be weake <hi>If any man love not the Lord Iesus, let him bee had in execration; yea, accursed unto the death.</hi> His scope is to commend love to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians.</hi> If I should cast about me to commend some speciall thing unto you now at the closing up of my Epistle, I know nothing better then this <hi>Love of the Lord Iesus.</hi> And there are two reasons why you should love him, first ye were in a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and accursed condition if you doe it not. And the second is from the object you are to love, he is <hi>the Lord</hi> and so may well challenge your love; <hi>Iesus your Saviour,</hi> and so hath well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it: so that we have here an exhortation, and two reasons of it. The words have little difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Somewhat I will say of the two words in the originall <hi>Anathema</hi> &amp; <hi>Maranatha.</hi> The word <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema</hi> signifies the separatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a thing unto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. <hi>Maranatha</hi> is a Syrian word, signifying cursing; take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Hebrew root, and signifies more then <hi>Anathema.</hi> The Apostle doubles this curse to shew the greatnes of the punishment It is a great punishment which he would expresse in two languages. The generall doctrine we will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34997:10"/>
from these words, is this, <hi>That to love the Lord Iesus is so necessarily required of us, that hee is</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doctrine. 1</note> 
                     <hi>worthy to be cursed that doth it not.</hi> Sometimes in Scripture the promise is made to faith, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to repentance, sometimes to love. Love is so required, that without it, a man is worthy to be accursed; yea, and shall be cursed. I will but open and apply this; not standing to prove it. And First, I will shew what love is in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: Secondly, what this love of the Lord Iesus is; to shew which there will bee showne how it is wrought: And thirdly, how they come to bee worthy to be accursed, that love him not. And first for the first. Love is among the affections, which are planted in the Will; and it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed thus, <hi>It is a disposition of the Will and Heart</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">What love is in generall.</note> 
                     <hi>of man, whereby it turnes and inclines to some good, which it apprehends to bee agreeable to its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> The Will is carried to nothing, but that which is apprehended to bee good. Now this love is a principall act of the Will: and it must bee an agreeable good to him, whose Will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines unto it; for an envyous man may confesse the excellencies of another man, but hee hates them; he suffers by them; they seeme not to be an agreeable good to him. And this may bee il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated by the contrary. Hate is that whereby a man turnes from a thing which he apprehends contrary to himselfe. This Love shews it selfe <note place="margin">How love shews it selfe.</note> in two effects: first, it desires the preservation of what it loves, that it may be kept safe: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it desires Vnion with it, that they may draw neerer one to another. That you love, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34997:11"/>
you desire may bee yours, with which you desire conjunction: Now sometimes a thing may bee neerer, sometimes too far off; therefore it desires such a neerenesse as may stand with its conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And this is common to all love; if you love a Glasse, you will take care that it bee kept cleane, and whole, and for your use: so, if you love a Horse, you will take care that he bee well, and in good case, and that he be yours. The same we see in the love of a Father to his Sonne, of one friend to another. This is the nature of Love. Now Hate contrariwise, desires the destruction of that which is hated, that it may bee taken out of the world; and if that cannot bee, it desires sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from it, as far as may bee. And thus you have seene the nature of Love in generall. Now there are divers kindes of Love: There is <hi>a Love</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The kindes of Love.</note> 
                     <hi>of Pitty,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you desire the preservation of a mans person, and the removing of some ill quality; As, our Saviour mourned in Spirit, for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their hearts; hee did pitty them, and yet was angry with their sinne.</p>
                  <p>There is <hi>a Love of Desire,</hi> when a thing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bee kept safe for our use: And this is for <note place="margin">3</note> the inferiour faculties, as the sigh loves a pleasant object should be continued.</p>
                  <p>There is <hi>a Love of Complacence,</hi> when wee looke on a thing, in which all the faculties are <note place="margin">4</note> pleased; not onely the inferiour, but the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as the Minde and the Will.</p>
                  <p>There is <hi>a Love of friendship,</hi> when a man loves where he is loved again, when love is reciprocall; there is an intercourse of Love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:34997:11"/>
There is <hi>a Love of dependance,</hi> when wee love him on whom we depend; and thus we love God, when wee looke upon him, as on whom all our good depends: so that we love him more than our selvs, because our good depends upon him, more than on our selves.</p>
                  <p>Wee will adde the qualities of Love; there is <note place="margin">1 The qualities of Love.</note> a <hi>naturall Love,</hi> planted in us by nature: as the of parents to their children, of one man to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: this love is indifferent, not good in it selfe; good no otherwise, than directed on a good ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>sinfull Love,</hi> arising from sinfull ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, <note place="margin">2</note> which seeke things convenient to it. As no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is better than love on a right object, so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worse than love on a wrong object. As na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Love puts us in the condition men: so this sinfull Love makes men worse than beasts, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals them with the Divell.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>spirituall Love,</hi> arising out of holy qualities, which seekes an object agreeable to it. <note place="margin">3</note> And this makes a man above a man, and in some sort equall with the Angels. Men are as they love. GOD judges us by our affections, wee are judged by what we love. He that loves wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, is truly a wicked man; he that loves holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is truely holy. This foundation that wee have laid, though it may seeme somewhat remote, yet ye shall find it of use to hold up this building, before wee have done with the point.</p>

is wrought: now for the working of it, there must be two Antecedent things which must make way for it; and they are <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Faith:</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one beleeves not this to bee needfull; and if they doe beleeve it, yet they may bee opposite to it, because it is not agreeable to their nature, That a man must be broken so, and moulded again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee can have this love which is wrought by Humiliation and Faith. And they are wrought on this manner, when we preach the Gospell, and offer <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> unto you: for the duty of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, is nothing but this, <hi>to offer Iesus Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto the world. <hi>To us a Child is borne; To us a Sonne is given:</hi> for, <hi>unto you is borne a Saviour, that is, Christ the Lord.</hi> This is the summe of the <note place="margin">Esa. 9.

                     </gap>hing but this; we are to manifest, that God the Father is willing to give you his Sonne. We are his Spokesmen, <hi>to beseech you</hi> to take him, that you would take him as your <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> husband, to be ruled by him: none, before you are humbled, can marry you to Christ. You must bee divorced from all other things, and beleeve that Christ will take you; and this is Faith, the other Humiliation. And then when you can receive him, you will love him. Now when we
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34997:12"/>
preach thus unto the world, what answere doe wee finde? Why, there are some that will not beleeve that there is such a Lord: and then our worke is to perswade, that Christ is such a Lord; and this was the Apostles worke, and theirs at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But when wee intreat you to take Christ for your Lord, your answer is, as theirs who were invited to the feast. This, and this excuse they have to hinder them, to beleeve, that a Christ is propounded, and men regard him not, they will not looke after him. Now, that Christ may be received, there is required Humiliation and Faith: Humiliation opens their eyes, by the Law, and spirit of bondage, that they see themselves miserable men, men condemned to dye. Now when God hath discovered our misery unto us, and wee rightly apprehend what our estates are, then we beginne to looke on Christ as a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned malefactour on his pardon; as a Captaine on him that comes to redeeme him; as a Widdow that thought she should live well enough alone, but now when all her goods as seized upon, and they are now to carry her to prison, would bee content if any one would marry her. When a man shall see what hee is without Christ, one that is condemned, that must perish if hee have him not; then he lookes on Christ, as upon one most desirable, to prize him, to thirst for him; and if hee know that Christ will then receive him, oh then he cannot but love him; for Love (as hath beene said) is to a good apprehended; fit for us. Now without this, wee will thinke of Christ, as if wee might bee well enough without him: But
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34997:13"/>
when the heart is thus prepared by Humiliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, oh that all the World would vanish for Christ! Then comes the Gospel, and tels us that Christ is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take us, to redeeme us, to be ours. And then when we take him, the match is made up: and thence arises this <hi>conjugall Love.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle praies for the Ephesians, that <hi>Christ may dwell in their hearts by Faith,</hi> Ephes. 3. to unite them to Christ, to marry him; then presently it follovvs, <hi>That ye may bee rooted and grounded in Love:</hi> so that Love followes this, and not a flash, but it rootes us in Love. The act of justifying Faith, is the taking of Christ for rest. Now when yee have taken him thus, then you will love him, and then all that followes will be effects of this love: so that this love of the Lord Iesus, is this; to wit,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A holy disposition, arising from Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee cleave unto the Lord Iesus Christ, with full purpose of heart, to serve and please him in all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereby wee cleave to him. Love inclines, and knits our hearts to him, as it did <hi>Davids</hi> to <hi>Ionathans.</hi> And so <hi>Barnabas</hi> exhorted them to <hi>cleave unto the Lord with full purpose of heart, Act.</hi> 11. Neither is this idle; but makes a man desirous to please the Lord in all things. A man is saide to love the Lord, when out of a perswasion that Christ is most desirable, and willing to receive him, hee cleaves to the Lord with a desire to serve and please him in all thinges. Faith
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34997:13"/>
that begets Love, is not onely a perswasion that the Lord will be mercifull, and forgive us: (For a prisoner may see the Iudge willing to pardon him, and perswade himselfe that hee shall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and yet love not the Iudge, because hee lookes not on the Iudge, as on an amiable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,) but a receiving and resting upon his ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse. There is another affection; when the heart is so framed, it apprehends Christ for its one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, its happinesse. Faith is not onely an act of the minde, to beleeve that God will pardon us; but of the Will and heart also, to take Christ for our Husband; so that all the parts of the heart are inclined and bent after hem. <hi>If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve with all your heart,</hi> saith <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. If a Spouse should see one willing to have her, that is not enough to make up the match; she may not thinke him fit, shee may bee unwilling. But suppose there bee one that shee loves above all, whom she thinkes to bee most fit for her, yea she thinkes she shall bee undone if she have him not: but yet she is not sure that hee will have her, but thinkes it is very probable that hee may be induced unto it. So this is Faith, when a man sees Christ onely worth his love, he would gladly bee divorced from all, so that he might have Christ oh he cannot bee without him, yet there is somewhat betwixt them, he cannot firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeve that Christ loves him, but yet doth not thinke that hee is wholly averse from him. Though thy perswasion bee not full, yet if you have this thirst and desire, this hungering af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34997:14"/>
Christ, you may bee comforted. This shuts out such as have a perswasion of the pardon of their sinnes, and yet have not this love, this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, this desiring after Christ; and takes in such as doe thus love and prize him, yet finde not that full perswasion of his love; so that this love is that which follows Humiliation and Faith, the breaking of the heart, and the moulding of it up againe: when wee see our need of him, and his willingnesse to receive us, then wee will take him, which cannot bee without this love to him.</p>
                  <p>Now wee come to the third thing, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why they are worthy to bee accursed unto <note place="margin">3 Why they are worthy to be cursed that love not the Lord Iesus.</note> the death that Love not the Lord Iesus. This may seeme strange and harsh. What then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of all unregenerated men? The Apostle meanes, sure, such as continue in their not loving the Lord, or such as have sinned against the holy Ghost. But the former sence I take to bee the best, neither is this any strange thing: for it is one part of the Gospel. There are two parts of the Gospel, <hi>If you beleeve, you shalbe saved; if you beleeve not, you shalbe damned.</hi> Sometimes it is <note place="margin">Marke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Because when Christ shall come and bee a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to us, when he shall woe us, and offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">1 Reason.</note> to us, and wee will have none of him, then
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34997:14"/>
                     <hi>the Sonne waxes angry.</hi> When he shall offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto us, and none will kisse him, then hee <note place="margin">Psal. 2.</note> waxes angry unto the death, and they perish in the way. The greatest love not answered, turnes to the greatest hatred: so when the Father sent to <note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> call them to the feast that were invited, and they refused it, this made him wrath; when wee shall come to preach Christ to men, when this light hid from the beginning of the world shall shine, and you shall despise it and contemne it, know that now is the axe laid to the roote of the tree. God will beare it at your hands no longer. Now if a man will not Love the Lord Iesus, let him be had in execration, yea let him bee accursed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death.</p>
                  <p>If a man did not keepe the Law, he was to be <note place="margin">2</note> cursed, now there was a double keeping of the Law: A <hi>Legall,</hi> which answeres the exact rigour of the Law; an <hi>Evangelicall,</hi> which is an earnest endeavouring to keepe the Law, and to make a mans heart as perfect as may be. Now there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more mercy in this, there is a greater curse on the breach of it. Now Love is the fulfilling of the Law; and not to love the Lord, is, not to keepe the Law, and therefore the Curse fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it.</p>
                  <p>If a man love not the Lord Iesus, it is because <note place="margin">3</note> he loves something better than him. It may be you love your Wealth more than Christ: And are you not worthy to be cursed for it? It may be you are lovers of pleasure more than of God, and doth not this deserve a Curse? It may bee you
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34997:15"/>
love the praise of men, before that of God; and is not this to bee accursed? Adultery was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with death; and what punishment then is enough for the going a whoring from such a God, after such vanties?</p>
                  <p>Againe, Cursing belongs to Hypocrites; <hi>Woe be unto you Seribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites,</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew 23. Now, what a man doth not out of love, is done out of hypocrisie; which is, to doe the outward action without the inward affection: as counterfeit gold hath the same stamp and colour with true gold. But as wee cast away counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit silver and gold, set it apart to destruction, nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them up, that they may bee knowne, so will God deale with such as serve him outwardly, without this love to him.</p>
                  <p>Love is that which commands all in a man. It is as the rudder to a shippe; all followes love. <note place="margin">5</note> When a man love not the Lord, all go's from him. Now when the whole man shall go from the Lord, is not such a one worthy to bee cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, yea to bee had in execration to the death?</p>
                  <p>If this love of the Lord be so necessary, then see what a sinne it is, what an execrable thing it <note place="margin">

I say, <hi>bee stirred</hi> against such with an holy indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Act. 17. Doe not I hate those that hate thee?</hi> Psal. 139. yea I hate them with a perfect hate. <hi>This thou hast, that thou hatest the workes of the Nicholaitans, which thing also I hate,</hi> Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions 2. And this was a signe of <hi>Lots</hi> sincerity, that his righteous soule was grieved, and <hi>vexed with the uncleane conversation of the Sodomites,</hi> 2 Peter 2. If you can see Christ scorned and re jected, and his Word slighted, and <hi>his bloud tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on,</hi> and you your selves are not moved with it, you are not of <hi>Pauls</hi> spirit, who speaking of some, <hi>whose God was their belly, whose glory was their shame; of whom</hi> (saith hee) I <hi>have told you often, and now tell you weeping, that they are the enemies of the crosse of Christ,</hi> Philip, 3. Whence came this, but out of the abundance of his love to Christ, and mankinde? I wish yee would all looke to your selves, whether you are in this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or not, of those that love not the Lord. This is such a sinne, as the curse is doubled upon it: And the punishment is but to shew the measure of the sinne. Hee thunders not out his curse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him that opposeth the Lord, or resisteth him, but against him that loveth not the Lord. The Apostle, as <hi>Moses,</hi> gets him up to the <hi>Mount Ebal;</hi> and whom doth he curse? Even all such as love not the Lord Iesus. This Doctrine through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, may let in a crevice of light to thee, that now thou maist looke on thy selfe, as on an execrable thing which God hates; and thou maist see GOD, even stretching out his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34997:16"/>
to confound thee, yea thou maist see the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel cursing thee.</p>
                  <p>But what terrour is there in the preaching of the Gospel, you will say? <note place="margin">Ob.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>O much more (my Brethren) than may bee expressed; for the curse of the Law was not so <note place="margin">Sol.</note> peremptory; though we have plaine words for it, yet it was not without all condition. But God sweares to this curse, as if wee were thus cursed if wee would continue not to love him. The Law is the proper instrument of humbling, yet the Gospel humbles more; for sinne is the matter of Humiliation. And there bee sinnes against the Gospel, yea greater sinnes than against the Law: when thou hearest the curse of the Law, <hi>Cursed be he that continueth not in every thing that is written in the booke of the Law; to doe them,</hi> Galathians 3. You will say, you wil go to Christ, &amp; he shall do it for you: But when the Gospel curses such as love not Christ, to whom will you goe to love God? Another man cannot love for you. And if you thinke this be too harsh, let this verse sound oft in your eares.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If any man love not the Lord Iesus Christ, let him be accursed unto the death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This cannot bee altered, it is the Word of God; aske then thy selfe this question, whether thou lovest the Lord, or no? And put not your selfe off with your Hope, but try your Love; for Love will have sensible strings in the heart; it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34997:16"/>
will drive you close to the Lord, to keepe in with him, to have communion with him.</p>
                  <p>Dost thou then feele, that thou art never well, but when thou art with him, and yet dost thou <note place="margin">Signes of Love</note> not love him? Dost thou walke with God, as <note place="margin">1</note> 
                     <hi>Enoch</hi> did? Will any of you say, that a Wife loves her Husband, which with her good will, will never be with him?</p>
                  <p>Love is also very dilligent and laborious, you will never leave, till you get neere him whom you <note place="margin">2</note> love; no labour will be tedious, to get his favour; many yeeres seeme a few daies to <hi>Iacob,</hi> to serve for <hi>Rachel,</hi> because he loved her.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Love is not of a deferring nature, but <note place="margin">3</note> is impatient of all delayes.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Love is content with it selfe; it doth not need to be hired to love, <hi>Amor est sibi ipsi</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4</note> 
                     <hi>dulce pabulum:</hi> it carries its meate in its owne mouth. If you love the Lord Iesus, you would not aske what wages you should have to love him.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Love is a strong impulsive quality, it <note place="margin">5</note> carries you on impetuously unto the Lord, it is a fire that breakes through thicke and thinne: so that he that loves, cannot sinne wilfully, if hee would; hee cannot but obey, hee cannot doe any thing against the Gospel, he must doe all things for it. <hi>The Love of Christ constraines me,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, 2 Corinthians</hi> 5. Looke how a man is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with a strong streame, or by a strong man whom hee cannot resist; so his love compelled him; I preach, and preach, and men thinke mee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34997:17"/>
mad, but I cannot but doe it: the love of Christ constraines me, and as it constraines me, so there is nothing more different than constraint, and not to doe it. The effects of this Love are so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as if they were compelled; but for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working, nothing is so contrary to it as compulsion; for you love him, and are carried to it, as a stone to the center, you would doe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.</p>

Thou that livest in the Church, and hast gone farre, examine thy selfe in his, Hast thou done all out of Love?

                        </gap> let mee aske thee this question, Doe you all out of love? for without love all is naught. If a man should bee a Martyr, (which is the highest action;) yet without this love, it were to no purpose, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 13. Put the case a man should doe many things for thee, yet if hee doe it not out of love to thee, you cannot regard it; <hi>Neither circumcision, nor uncircumcision availes any thing, but faith which workes by love,</hi> Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans 5. It is all one, whether you pray or not; heare or not; live well or not, if it bee not out of love. What was said of circumcision or uncircumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may bee said of any duty; all that you have done, is as nothing, if it bee not out of love: try your selves by this, for I know not in all the frames of Theology, such a touchstone of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, as this. This most unmaskes a man of any thing. As it was with the Apostle, <hi>The Law revived, and he died,</hi> Romans 7. So, it may be, you have thought your selfe a living man; see then if you love, deceive not your selfe any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>This is a Doctrine of much moment; if GOD would conveigh it with Majestie, by the pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

stomacke to heare, <hi>Cursed is he, that loves not the Lord.</hi> If you love the Lord, hee will beare much with you: see what a testimony hee gives of <hi>David,</hi> for all his failing. But doe what you will for him, without love, and hee will regard it but as a Complement. As men count that a Complement not to be regarded, with which the heart go's not, o doth God: looke therefore, that you love the Lord Iesus, for it is a thing of great consequence, the curse follows you, if you doe it not.</p>
                     <p>You are now therefore to examine your selfe, Whether you love or no? And to helpe you in it, I will lay downe some markes of this love; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> first set downe with your selfe this conclusion, <hi>If I love not the Lord Iesus, I am an accursed man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Doe you feele this love in you? have you a <note place="margin">Notes of triall of this love of the Lord Christ.</note> sense of it? <hi>Ammon</hi> was sicke of love, so that his friends could see him weare away: so the Spouse, <hi>I am sicke of love,</hi> Canticles 2. And <note place="margin">1</note> dost thou love the Lord, and canst not feele it? Dost thou feele thy heart working towards God? This love is a thing that one would thinke needs no markes, you cannot but see it. It is noted in Love, so, that if you did love the Lord, you would have a longing desire after him: there will be joy in the fruition of him, anger against all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to it, griefe when he withdrawes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, hope when there it any probability of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying him, feare to lose him. Now doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy selfe; thou lovest the Lord, thou wil
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34997:20"/>
say, but is this love <hi>to his person,</hi> or <hi>to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> his goods? When thou presentest Iesus Christ alone to thy selfe, canst thou then love him? <hi>The Virgins love him, the Harlots love him.</hi> And there is a great deale of harlotry love in the world, to the Lord Iesus. It was one thing to love <hi>Alexander,</hi> another to love the King. It is true, Christ is a great King, that can doe much good or evill in the world, and so many may love him. But canst thou answere this question, <hi>Lovest thou me?</hi> with <hi>Peter, Lord thou knowest that I love thee,</hi> Iohn 20. Thou that knowest my heart, and the secret turnings of it, canst beare me witnesse that I love <hi>thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Doest thou love his company? Love is seene in nothing more than this. Doest thou love his <note place="margin">2</note> presence, to walke with God? Doest thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all his dealings to thee from morning to night, refer all still unto him? Art thou still in dealings with him? Still thou hast something to doe with him; there is not an houre that passes thee, wherein thou hast not recourse unto him: when Christ takes a man unto himselfe, <hi>hee comes and sups with him,</hi> Apocalypse 3. Hast thou then this communion with Christ? Doth hee sup with thee, dwell with thee? Now, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion stands in speaking to another, and in hearing him speake to us. When you pray, then pray you formally, as one that is glad when the duty is over? oh if you loved the Lord, you would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be better, than when you are at prayer. And you would goe to prayer, as you would goe to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34997:20"/>
speake with your dearest friend. So do you hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after the Word, which is the character of Christ his Will, his Love-letter? Put the case a Woman should have her Husband at the East-Indies, how welcome would a letter bee to her from him? Therefore <hi>Moses</hi> that loved God, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to see his glory,</hi> Exodus 33. to know him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to grow more acquainted with him. Now, that the Word doth to thee, it shewes to thee that glory which <hi>Moses</hi> saw.</p>
                     <p>If you love the Lord, Holy-daies and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-daies would bee as Feast-daies, and Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-daies; for then you meete with God more neerely. Doe you then put off your comming to the Sacrament, and would you not come neere it for the speech of some, and yet will you say that you love the Lord? where love is, there is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. A man delights in his fellowship, whom hee loves, whom ye have not seene, yet ye love him; yea, whom, though ye see him not, yet yee beleeve and joy with joy unspeakable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Doe you then delight in his presence? for delight will be in the injoying of that wee love; joy followes love.</p>
                     <p>To delight in a mans company, is that marke of love which cannot be dissembled. Dost thou then love <hi>the appearing of the Lord Iesus?</hi> 2 Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians 3. If one should bring you newes that you must goe to the Lord, or he would come to you to morrow, would this be acceptable newes to you? Doth he bring good tidings? If a Spouse should have her betrothed husband beyond the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34997:21"/>
Seas, and should heare of his returne; if she should say, that it were the worst newes that could come to her, would you thinke that she lov'd him? No, there could not come a more welcome Messenger to thee than such a one, if thou didst love the Lord. <hi>Blessed are the dead that dye in the Lord (for so saith the Spirit) from henceforth they rest from</hi>

So much the more spirit a man hath, so much the more he will say, it is blessed, and the more hee will pray submittingly for it, quickly. Indeed a godly man, when the flesh is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the spirit under hatches, then he may be desirous to be spared a while; oh spare me a little, as the Spouse may sometimes wish her Husband, deferring his comming, when she is not fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; the house is not ready, not cleane e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>

                        <hi>A Crowne of Righteousnesse,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>is laid up for all them that love the appearing of the Lord Iesus.</hi> 1 Timothy 4 8. And <hi>the second time shall Christ appeare to salvation, to all them that look for him,</hi> Hebrews 9. Art thou then one that lookes for Christ, that desires nothing but union with him, hee will come to thee to thy salvation. If men looke not for him, will hee come to them to salvation?

                     <p>But in thy youth, in the midst of all worldly contents, when thou art in thy pleasant Orchard,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34997:21"/>
with thy Wife and Children about thee, having what thy heart can wish, canst thou say then, Now would I most willingly leave all these to goe to Christ? when you prefer his company above all things, count that delight the best, that comes from communion with him; then thou lovest the <hi>Lord Iesus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Love is exceeding bountifull, apt to doe much <note place="margin">3</note> for the Lord, and to suffer any thing gladly. The Apostle, in the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chapter 13. sets downe many excellent proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Love; she that loved Christ, had a box of Oyntment; it may bee it was the best thing shee had, it may bee it was all she had, yet she bestows it on Christ. So <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God would have his Sonne, hee go's willingly about it; not formally, not out of necessity, but he rose up ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to doe it. It may bee there will come a time when God shall need thy Wealth; it may be, thy Credit.</p>
                     <p>Now, you can deny him nothing, if you love him. So, <hi>Dalilah</hi> would not bee perswaded that <hi>Sampson</hi> loved her, so long as hee kept backe any thing from her. If there bee any thing so neere unto thee as thy life, and it bee told thee that the Lord hath need of it, he shall have it. Thou wilt say, It was a wise action of <hi>David,</hi> to poure out that water as an offering to the Lord, which he so longed for, and obtained with the hazard of the lives of three of his Worthies. As when a man hath a good bit, he will send it to his friend: so in another place, <hi>he would not offer to the Lord of that

                     <p>And then if this should come in, if I doe this, I shall hinder my estate, lose my friends, it would be nothing: the love of the Lord would be farre better to thee than any thing, Love doth much for the Lord; Faith workes by Love, he loves much, that doth much. <hi>Paul,</hi> as he was abundant in love, so <hi>in labour.</hi> If <hi>you love me,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>keepe my Commandements.</hi> Are you willing then to take much paines for the Lord? Doest thou

feed the lambes of Christ? If thou art a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, or if thou art in the way to that calling, art thou diligent to fit they selfe for it? And love not onely workes, but it makes that <hi>the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not grievous.</hi> The wife may serve her husband, and the servant him, but with a different affection. The covetous man when he is before some great man that can imprison him, or put him to death may part with his wealth, or if with one that can greatly preferre him, in hope of that, he may be brought to part with his money; But wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly he will not. But you must finde delight in that you doe: when you doe a kindnesse to one that you love, you doe but doe your selfe a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse on that party. And in this sense what thanks deserve you? you doe but satisfie your love. As a mother loves her child, and doth the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of kindnesse to it with delight, though shee shall never have any thing for it. If you had this love, you would come to say, <hi>It is meate and drinke to doe your Fathers will.</hi> Now, you neede not bee hired to eate and <note place="margin">Iohn 4.</note> drinke.</p>

But I canno like, you will say, to bee put to it you doe not know, it may bee you may lose your wealth, your credit, and respect, among those whom you loved, and this is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what: yet love makes it as nothing.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34997:25"/>
these men which are to bee accursed unto death.</p>
                     <p>But I hope I deserve not so bad, my nature I hope is not so vile, as not to love the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. <note place="margin">Ob,</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, thou hatest him, doe you not wish that <note place="margin">Sol.</note> there were no such Lord to come to judgement, that thou mightest live as thou pleasest? Coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou not wish that thou mightest ever here enjoy these pleasures, and never come at him? Now to wish that one were not, what is it but to hate him? <hi>Quem metuunt oderunt:</hi> Wee say men hate him whom they stand in feare of. Doe you then feare and quake at his comming? surely then you are haters of God.</p>
                     <p>But I hope we are not haters of God. Why, <note place="margin">Ob.</note> this is not so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>God.</hi> 2 Tim. 3. yea, and that there were <hi>haters of God also.</hi> Rom. 1. 30. And in the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>What? you would make me out of love with <note place="margin">Ob.</note> my selfe. What doe you preach damnation to me? it may be all these signes are not in me; Am I then so accursed?</p>
                     <p>Yes: we doe preach damnation to all that are <note place="margin">Sol.</note> in such a case, and wee are to threaten the curse. And thus the Lord esteemes of thee, and it were
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34997:25"/>
good that you thought so of your selves in time. It is the Ministers dutie to seperate the precious from the vile, to distinguish betweene men; To shew you truely what your conditions are. Therefore apply this Text unto your selves, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one. If I love not the Lord Iesus, I am an <hi>accursed man,</hi> yea to bee had in <hi>execration to the death,</hi> which might make you loath your selves, in dust and ashes. It might make sinne alive in you, and bring you to love this <hi>Iesus.</hi>

                        </gap>e therefore is <note place="margin">6</note> this, hee that loves, will bee apt to praise and speake well of that he loves, and he will exceed in it: yea, he is very glad when he heares others speake well of it. So if we did love
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34997:28"/>
the Lord, we should be apt to speake will of him, we would be much in the speech of him. When the heart is full of this love of God in Christ, <hi>out of that aboundance in thy heart, thy mouth will speak.</hi> But thou speakest but little of God, and that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is brought in by company, thou art cold in thy praising of him: why thou doest not love him, see in <hi>David,</hi> a man that loved the Lord. How much was hee in the praising of him? Nay, he could not bee content to doe this alone, but hee must have all <hi>creatures to praise him and to speake good of his Name:</hi> Even as a servant that commends his Master, invites others to serve him. This love <hi>enlarges the heart and opens the mouth. O Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, our hearts are enlarged towards you, and our mouthes are opened,</hi> 2 Corinthians 6. 11. This is an argument that our hearts are enlarged, that we abound in love, when our mouthes are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. So that thy heart is straightened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, if thy mouth bee not open to his praises.</p>
                     <p>But I cannot speake as other men, I am no <note place="margin">Ob.</note> scholler, if I had elocution gifts, learning, I could thus speake.</p>
                     <p>This is no excush, it is the nature of love to make men eloquent, the passions make eloquent. <note place="margin">Sol.</note> As we say, <hi>Pectus facit eloquentes, &amp; magna pars eloquentiae constra animo.</hi> Are you hen apt to speake well of God? But this, you will say, is but a small matter, who doth not? Oh yes, wee are wanting in that manner of speaking of him which love requires. We doe not speake of him
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34997:28"/>
with that affection, that sensiblenesse, that may enflame others to love him. See the Spouse in the <hi>Canticles:</hi> Oh saith she, <hi>My love is fairer then ten thousands.</hi> And thus will the soule that loves God doe. It will <hi>tell of his mercies abroad.</hi> It will <hi>speake good of his Name.</hi> And that not as a duty onely, but as a thing in which it takes especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all delight: Love followes the judgement, you cannot love the Lord, but you will thinke well of him. See then what thy speeches are concerning him: see if <hi>thy heart doe nimbly indite, and thy tongue bee as the penne of a readie Scribe</hi> Psalme 45.</p>
                     <p>Consider whether you endeavour to doe any thing for Christ without expostulating, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denting with him. Whether you are ready to doe all things freely to him, without consulting with another about it. <hi>Amicitia non est revocan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da ad calculos.</hi> A friend must not bee strict in taking his account, for then hee plaies but the Huckster, he doth but buy and sell. When thou art trying and expostulating then whether such a duty be necessary or no, whether another will not serve the turne; this is a signe thou dost want love. A Minister that hath this love, when he is to take a Living, will not so much enquire what reward he shall have, as what service he may doe to God in it. If you did love the Lord you would not stand, saying, is it necessary to keepe the Lords day so strictly? You would bee ready to doe what ever hath but a shadow of pleasing him. Oh how you would be glad of such a day, so free
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34997:29"/>
from other businesse, wherein you might sequester your selves from the world, to attend upon God, and to injoy him? So for a family prayer, thou wouldest not aske, can it not be omitted without sinne? This questioning will not stand with this love: for the person thou servest is the Lord, and thou must not be as a mercenary servant. A wife will bee devising things to please her husband. So, <hi>what shall I render to the Lord</hi> (saith <hi>David.)</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>abundant in labours and sufferings.</hi> If <hi>Paul</hi> would have done nothing but out of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he had never done halfe so much, say then, I will even goe doe my duty, performe my taske, If I must pray in my family, then I will: If I must keepe the Lords day, I will make a shift to weare out the day; This I say argues a heart void of this love. We must know that Christ hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>to purchase to himselfe a people zealous of good workes:</hi> such as doe good workes with desire or deare delight; that would faine doe a great deale more then they doe. Would you then doe no more then just will bring you to heaven as you thinke? Do you set limits to your performances? you have not this love. Why? you pray that you may serve Christ <hi>on earth as the Angels doe in heaven,</hi> and yet will you say such a man goes faster, it is no matter, this pace will bring mee to heaven, and so never mend it? This is a sign of no love to the Lord Iesus.</p>
                     <p>If you did love the Lord, ye should find an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection of anger and zealerising against such as offend him. Anger waits on love. Love is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34997:29"/>
an affection that makes forwards to the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved: and if any thing stand in the way, Anger removes it hastily.</p>
                     <p>If thy heart then bee not stirred when God is dishonoured, his Church spoiled, and Religion goes downward, thou lovest him not, can you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to heare your selfe scandalized? No, and why? because you love your selfe. To see then the bloud of the Lord Iesus trampled on, negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted so, as no man should regard it, to see the Saints in adversity, and not to bee affected, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that your heart is void of this love of the Lord Iesus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eli</hi> when he heard the newes of <hi>Israels</hi> flight, his sonnes death, it must needs grieve him, but all this while, his heart was composed: But the worst newes (as usually it doth) comes last. The Arke of God was taken: Then his heart was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, hee could no longer subsist, but hee falls downe backward and breakes his necke. But it may be ye doe not hope to attaine to the grace of <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>;</hi> why, looke then on his daughter in law, one of the weaker sex; All that ill newes moved her not so much. Oh the Arke of God was taken, that was it which shee pitched upon, her sonne that was borne could not alay this griefe.</p>
                     <p>But the Arke is not taken (you will say) <note place="margin">Ob.</note> there is not the like cause now with us.</p>
                     <p>No? are not many Churches desolate? when <note place="margin">Sol.</note> you see so many Churches ransacked beyond the Seas, doe you not see the Arke of God taken in a great measure? when you see Popery increasing,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34997:30"/>
and the Saints wallowing in their bloud? If you take not this to heart, it is because the love of <hi>Christ</hi> is not in you.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Christ</hi> lose a man, if <hi>any be offended,</hi> and fall away, <hi>I burne,</hi> saith the Apostle. When the King, <hi>Ier.</hi> 36. tooke that booke and burnt it, it is noted of those that stood by, that <hi>they did rend their cloathes.</hi> God takes it as a great signe of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane heart, when one shall not take such disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of his to heart, when hee rends not his cloathes at the sight of such a thing. <hi>Paul</hi> when he saw the idolatry that abounded in <hi>Athens,</hi> was <hi>enflamed in his spirit.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 17.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>See what a commendation God gave to <hi>Phine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> for his zeale against <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi,</hi> he would have it remembred as a speciall note of his love to him, which he would not let goe unrewarded. If thou dost not then pray for the Churches wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, If thou art not affected with the losse and disadvantages of the Church, as with thy owne, thou wantest this love.</p>
                     <p>A ninth signe is not to dare to doe any thing that displeaseth him. If you doe a thing amisse <note place="margin">9</note> that would be displeasing, you had rather that all the world should see you, then him whom you love. Now you know God alwaies behold you: you should therefore bee alwaies alike care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. <hi>They shall feare the Lord and his goodnesse,</hi> Hosea 4: The Lord for his goodnesse; they shall feare to lose him. Above all consider when you have offended him, how you take that to heart. When you know there is a breach betweene you
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34997:30"/>
and the Lord, and you can be content, and rest in it, this is a shrewd signe of no love. When man and wife shall fall out, and grieve not for it, but let it passe, not seeking to be reconciled, it is signe of cold love betweene them.</p>
                     <p>Thinke with your selfe there is no man whom you professe to love, but you would not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoke. And dare you say that you love the Lord, and yet yee will grieve and vexe him?</p>
                     <p>If you love the Lord, there would bee an hungring in you after him: there would bee still <note place="margin">10.</note> an hanging that way. All impediments would be broken through, the heart would still bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thitherward. It would be bending thither. It would admit no repulse. As the woman of <hi>Canaan, Matth.</hi> 15. it would not bee put off. As the stone rests not till it comes to the center, so nothing can keepe you off from the Lord, no pleasures; away with them: nor any difficulties, no you cannot rest without him.</p>
                     <p>Say not then with your selfe, though you love him not now, yet I may love him hereafter, and I may love him hereafter, though not so much. No, love desires present union, it hates all delaies. Consider this: if you did repent out of love, your repentance would bee present, and what repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is it which is not out of love?</p>
                     <p>Then hence thou art to humble thy selfe, if thou art failing in this labour of love. See how <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vse</hi> 3. To humble our selves for want of this love.</note> great a fault it is, not to love the Lord: and learne to blame thy selfe exceedingly for it. And that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34997:31"/>
you may doe this, I will shew you what great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son you have to love the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Consider that <hi>hee is worthy to bee beloved.</hi> As <note place="margin">1. The reasons wee have to love the Lord.</note> 
                        <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>he is worthy to bee praised,</hi> so may wee well say, he is worthy to be beloved. And why? because he hath all that is amiable in him. If you see any thing lovely in the creature, it is eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him. Shall not he that made the eye see? hee that made the eare heare? shall not hee that gave these perfections to the creatures have them in himselfe more eminently?</p>
                     <p>This perfection of his beauty, is that which causeth the Angels so much to admire and adore him, to bee taken up in the admiration of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies. Observe that in any man whom you love; there is something not to bee beloved: But CHRIST is wholly delectable, there is nothing in him not fully to bee beloved. See how the Spouse describes him in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> how shee sets him forth in every part of him most to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired. If you could but see the Lord. If it did but please him to shew himselfe unto you, as hee promised to <hi>shew himselfe unto him that loves him,</hi> Iohn 14, 21. If the Lord, I say, would give you a glympse of himselfe; if by the light of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit you could see him, you would acknowledge him worthy of your love. And this is the reason that some love him, and others doe not, because hee discovers himselfe to some and not to others. As he did to <hi>Moses,</hi> where let us see a little his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of himselfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lord, the Lord,</hi> Exodus 34. this is but the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34997:31"/>
Casket, the Iewell is within. If Gods Spirit should open these words unto you, you would see him the fairest of ten thousand, <hi>Iehovah, Iehovah.</hi> Of every creature (you may say) somewhat it was that it is not, and samewhat it is that it will not be. But God is unchangeable <hi>Iehovah,</hi> in him is no alteration, he is not a freind to day, and none to morrow, and such a friend you would desire to chuse: as this Name signifies, his immutable being, so his omnipotency, he is <hi>Almightie.</hi> Now what a Loadstone of love is this? All the power in men, enableth them but to doe some things: as patience enables them to beare injurious acts; But the Lord hath all abilities, all ornaments, all excellencies, all is comprehended in this <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:</hi> So that well may such a friend bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</p>
                     <p>True, will the poore soule say, he is well worth <note place="margin">Ob.</note> the having. But hee will not match with such a match as I am.</p>
                     <p>Oh yes, he is wonderfully <hi>pittifull</hi> and <hi>Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:</hi> as great a Prince of pitty, as of any thing <note place="margin">Answ.</note> else.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercifull:</hi> but I have no beauty, no grace in <note place="margin">Ob.</note> me, no worth, no repentance.</p>
                     <p>But God is <hi>exceeding gracious.</hi> Kings are said <note place="margin">Answ.</note> to be gracious, because ther is supposed such a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene them and their Subjects, that they can deserve nothing of them: So <hi>God is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> hee doth not looke for any deservings in thee.</p>
                     <p>But I have provoked him by sinning, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Ob.</note>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:34997:32"/>
often: This will make him put mee off.</p>
                     <p>No, he is <hi>of great forbearance.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if he doe receive me, I must carry my selfe <note place="margin">Ob.</note> well, pray, and doe, that which I shall never bee able to doe.</p>
                     <p>Why no, <hi>hee is very kinde.</hi> Looke what a kinde Father, a kinde Husband, would doe to a <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Child, or a Wife, they are carefull to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: the like may you expect of the Lord. Hee will winke at many infirmities, if your desires be found.</p>
                     <p>Though he say so, how shall I know <hi>that he will</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ob.</note> 
                        <hi>doe it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To confirme this, <hi>He is true:</hi> he keepes cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> and hath given ensamples of his mercy on thousands of them that feare him.</p>
                     <p>Oh, but still my sinnes are many and <note place="margin">Ob.</note> great.</p>
                     <p>Be it so: yet he <hi>forgives iniquities, transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and sinnes,</hi> originall sinnes, sinnes of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> and sinnes of wilfulnesse.</p>
                     <p>This glory God shewed to <hi>Moses.</hi> This is the description of himselfe, such a one is Iesus Christ, O ye daughters of Ierusalem, and is hee not worthy to be beloved?</p>
                     <p>When thou hast considered the worth that is <note place="margin">2</note> in himselfe, consider that hee <hi>sues to thee for thy love.</hi> Suppose a Prince should come and aske this at thy hands, wouldest thou deny him? The weake should sue to the stronger, but here the Lord God comes to thee for thy love.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>This is that, O Israel, which hee requires of thee, that thou love the Lord thy God,</hi> Deuter. 10, 16. When such a God shall aske thy love, sue for it, shall he be denied? We (the Ministers) are but Christs spokes-men to wooe for Christ. See who it is that requires this? it is thy Soveraigne Lord that might have required thee to sacrifice thy children, thy life, thy goods, for his honour, and can he not have thy love? Now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to feare him, to love him? as if he should say, the Lord hath done great things for you, and might require great things of you againe. This may melt thee then, that hee requires nothing but thy love.</p>
                     <p>Againe consider, he hath planted this love in thy heart: shall hee not have his owne then when <note place="margin">4</note> hee requires? shall not hee which planted the tree, eate of the fruit? shall not hee which gave this fountaine of love taste of the waters of it?</p>
                     <p>Againe, on whom would you bestow it, if you will not give it to the Lord? It must be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on somewhat, and it is the best thing you have to bestow. It swaies &amp; commands al in you. Doth thy wealth deserve it? Do men deserve it? Why, they are not to bee compared to the Lord. Can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man doe for thee that which he doth? besides, he forgives thee thy sinnes day by day. Thinke of his excellencies.</p>
                     <p>Againe, you are engaged to love him. you are married to him; you have given up your names to <note place="margin">5</note> him in your baptisme: so that now well may I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34997:33"/>
call you <hi>an adulterous generation,</hi> if you love him not, <hi>Yee are witnesses against your selves this day</hi> (saith <hi>Ioshua)</hi> Ioshua 24. if ye serve not the Lord. Hee takes great advantage of their promise that they had made to serve the Lord: ye are now wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses against your selves if you doe it not.</p>
                     <p>So all that heare me this day are witnesses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst themselves. For in their baptisme they tooke the Lord for their God. Is hee not your Master? where then is your feare? is he not your Father? where then is your reverence? is he not your Friend, where then is your love?</p>
                     <p>Againe, he hath bought us, yea, he hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bought us. If you should see a flocke of sheepe, <note place="margin">6</note> and heare that such a man hath paid such a price for them, farre beyond their worth, you will bee ready to say, let him have them, he is well worthy of them. And shall Christ be denied that which he hath so dearely bought? he hath bought you from the world, from the power of the devill, yea, and from your selves, so that they are not to set us on worke, <hi>Wee are not our owne,</hi> 1 Corinthians 6. wee are therefore to doe a mothers businesse, and that is Christs, who requireth love.</p>
                     <p>Besides all these generals, thinke of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which worke most upon us. See all his <note place="margin">7</note> passages to you, how kinde he hath beene toward you. See how he hath dealt with you from your youth hitherto. Consider all his kindnesses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon thee: see also what hee hath done in forgiving thee. Thou hast sinned often, and greatly, and yet still he hath forgiven thee, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34997:33"/>
this is a great matter. <hi>Shee loved much, because much was forgiven her,</hi> Luke 7. Hee feeds thee, cloathes thee thou hast not a nights rest but hee gives it thee, he it is that keeps thee from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: that careth for thee when thou canst not take care for thy selfe. The creature cannot helpe thee, withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>ee command it to helpe thee, hee hath stood close to thee in all exigents. And this most of all affects us: in some great danger when all forsake us, wee cannot but love him most dearely that then sticks close unto us. Thus hath the Lord done unto thee, with this <hi>Nathan</hi> urges <hi>David,</hi> and aggravates his sinne? <hi>The Lord hath done thus and thus unto thee, and if that had not been enough, would have done more.</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 8. Take up the same practise with your soule; the Lord hath done thus and thus for mee, and shall I not love him? would wee not hate that man that should not love and respect him from whom hee hath his whole maintenance?</p>
                     <p>Lastly, consider that hee loves thee. Now as <note place="margin">8</note> fire begets fire, so let love beget love. The Son of God <hi>hath loved thee and given himselfe for thee,</hi> Galatians 2. Consider Christ hath loved thee, and hath given a good experiment of his love, to wit, himselfe for thee. And if he had given thee himselfe whole, it had beene a gift inestimable: But he hath given thee himselfe broken, <hi>crucified</hi> to thee, who hast beene a rebell against him. See his love he lookes on thee when thou thinkest not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> him, he took care for thee when thou tookest none for thy selfe; Nay, then thought it hee not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34997:34"/>
too much to dye for thy good. Oh the height, the length, the breadth, the depth of the love of Christ which passes knowledge! you can never <note place="margin">Ephes. 3.</note> know this love of the Lord, it astonished <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All this may stirre you up to feare the Lord. This shewes you what reason you have to doe it: And it may be an intentive to you, or at the least may cause thee greatly to condemne thy self for not loving him. Let these at least make you thinke well of the Lord, and ill of thy selfe, that you cannot love. It will goe heard if hee be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused: <hi>his wrath will be kindled,</hi> Psal. 2. after that hee hath sued to thee, and thou rejectest him, hee will not put it up, but will make his wrath knowne on thee, which GOD forbid.</p>

I will make you to keepe Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">The advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which arise from the love of the Lord Iesus.</note> with ease and delight: and this is no small benefit. This love makes you goe about the worke, as the Ship with wind and saile. The jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney must bee gone: now they that have not love, must rowe and take a great deale more paines. <hi>This is the love of God, that you keep his commandements. And his commandements are not grievous,</hi> 1 Iohn 3. This makes us keepe the commandements, so ye may feare, you will say. Oh, but love makes them easie. It will be very hard to do them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out love. How hard a taske had it beene for <hi>Paul</hi> to have done so much as hee did, without this love<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> See what love makes mothers doe to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. This <hi>love of Christ constrained Paul:</hi> it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him on like wings; it compelled him to doe thus and thus. And is this then nothing? yea, it shall make you <hi>abundant in the worke of the Lord.</hi> For this commands all the faculties, and it windes them up to their highest pegs: and this it will make you to doe out of an inward principle. There is a great difference betwixt a horse that runs freely, and one that is forced by the Spurre: Shall not this then cause you to set a high price upon this love?</p>
                     <p>There are scarse any so desperate, but they would say, they would faine keepe GODS com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, were they not so hard. Now this love will make them thy delight, it will make them easie and pleasant unto thee.</p>
                     <p>This is the surest testimony to your owne soule of all others, that <hi>you are translated from death to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34997:36"/>
life.</hi> An hypocrite cannot love the Lord, hee may doe the outward workes, hee may heare the Word, and be diligent in his calling. But here is the difference, he doth not this out of love. This is that distingnishing character which distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes a Christian; as reason doth a man. If you can finde this love of Christ, this hungring after him, that tendring of the heart towards him, that your heart is to Christ, as the Iron to the Load-stone, you must rest with him. If you can say, I have no great markes of a childe of God, I have many infirmities, but yet this I can say, I love the Lord; my life for thine, thy case is happie; heaven and earth may passe away, but thou canst not misse of thy happinesse. What ever you have without this, can bee no sound te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony unto you of your blessednesse; and this alone may secure you of it.</p>
                     <p>This love doth make you lose nothing: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the loving of other things, the more you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow, the lesse you have. When thou givest thy heart to God, he gives thee thy heart againe, and sets it on worke for thy owne good; <hi>Hee teacheth us to profit, and leadeth us by the way which we should goe,</hi> Esay 48. 17. As Christ said of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boath, the Sabboath was made for man: so may I say of all the commandements, when you give your hearts to the Lord, he sets them to keepe the commandements, but to this end, that it may be well with thee. <hi>Oh that there were such a heart in this people, to feare me, and to keepe all my comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements that it might goe well with them, and their
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34997:37"/>
children for ever.</hi> Deutrenomy 5. 20. Thou hast thy heart againe, when thou givest it to God. But here is the difference; before, thou wert but an unjust professor of it, now the Lord hath made thee Steward of it: for he hath given you leave to love your wives, children, and your lawfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, onely now you love them at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, as he will, whereas before you did it as you listed. Nay, the Lord doth not onely give you your heart againe, but returnes it better than it was, new pointed. As the earth receives in the puddle water, which it sends forth cleare and pure. All the streames of thy love runne as fresh for thy good as ever they did, and more. That onely which was amiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in them, is taken away. Let not this feede thy understanding onely, but finde it good in thy practise.</p>
                     <p>By this you shall have much comfort and joy, and this is that which all men desire. What is that <note place="margin">4</note> which keepes you from loving the Lord? Oh, you have a conceit, that then you must iose your pleasures, and your delights. No, it is the most comfortable action in the world, to love the Lord: delights follows action, as the flame the fire. Now the best action hath the greatest delight. The Philosopher could say, Happinesse was to love the most amiable object; <hi>Est amare optimum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabile,</hi> to love the best amiable knowne, is the best act. <hi>Whom not seeing, yet you love, joying with joy unspeakeable and glorious,</hi> 1 Peter 1. It is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant thing to love a creature like thy selfe, thy children, thy friend. But the creature is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34997:37"/>
and it may be it loves not thee againe. But Christ is perfect, and loves thee, thou canst not lose any love by loving of him. Oh what a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant thing it is to love the Lord, to live with him, to sup and dine with him, to be able to say, <hi>I am my welbeloveds, and my welbeloved is mine!</hi> When you shall consider the world hates you, what a comfort will it be, to know that the Lord loves you! that when the world uses you ill, you may flye unto Christ his bosome, and lay open all your grievances to him. To love, and to be beloved, are the most pleasant actions. Now to love the Lord Jesus, is so much the more pleasant, than the loving of other things, as he is a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent object than other things. Besides, is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing best in its owne place, conformed to its owne rule, carried to its owne end? Take it in thy body, when all the parts of it are strait, all the faculties and humours in a right temper, serving to their proper ends, then there is delight and comfort: so, Love, when it is setled upon its owne object, sets all things straight, whence wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full joy cannot but follow; <hi>Amor rectus omnia recta habet,</hi> as the Schoolman well observes.</p>
                     <p>Consider this, the love of the Lord makes you <note place="margin">5</note> a better man, gives you a greater excellency, which is a thing which all men desire. Looke on the excellencie of the creatures, it proceedes from their formes; as the excellencie of a Pearle above other stones comes from its forme: for we know that the matter of all these things is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Now the object to the faculty, hath the

property of the forme; for it gives name and distinction. Now this love makes God and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things, as it were the forme of the will. And according to this forme is the Excellencie of the man. Every man is better or worse, as his love is pitched on a better object. He that loves a base thing, is base; and hee that loves a thing somewhat better, excels that man; but hee that loves spirituall things, is the most noble. Looke on the lower faculties, when the sensitive appetite enjoyes its proper object, then a man hath his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in that kinde. Thus, when the will is fixed on Iesus Christ, its best object, then a man hath his full perfection. If water be united to Wine, its made better; when the body is united to the soule, how glorious a creature is it! how glorious a creature then will thy soule be, when by love it is united to the Lord! This love puts a greater excellencie on the soule, than the soule doth on the body. Love brings the soule to God, and makes him all in all to us; so that what wee cannot desire, we may have in him: have ye not then cause to wish that yee loved the Lord? True, you have said enough to enflame us. But how shall we doe it my brethren? if you are brought unfainedly to desire it, halfe the worke is done; when the Disciples prayed, <hi>Lord increase our faith,</hi>

Christ answers, If you have faith; but as a graine of Mustard seed, you may say unto <note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> this Mountaine, be thou moved, and it shall be moved. But this is not the meanes to get faith. No, but this commends faith. And if out of

this commendation they could come to prize and admire it, and so pray earnestly for it, God would give it them. Let this therefore be the first meanes to helpe thee to the getting of this, to the <hi>Lord Iesus.</hi>

                     <p>First, pray heartily for it, Lord I desire to love <note place="margin">1</note> thee, I see thee most amiable, and would faine love thee. This Petition is according to thy will, Lord grant it me.</p>
                     <p>How would this prevaile, how could God put off such a request?</p>
                     <p>But I have prayed, and I have not obtained it. <note place="margin">Ob.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But hast thou prayed importunately, as the woman to the unjust Iudge without giving over? <note place="margin">Sol.</note> This is a precious grace, and therefore God will have us bestow some paines in the getting of it. We shall not obtaine it easily, that so we may prise it the more, and keep it the more charily. <hi>The grace of Christ,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, was abundant with mee in faith and love, 1 Tim.</hi> 11. 14. This is that which the Apostle magnified so much, that God had given him love. The grace of Christ was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant towards him in giving him love.</p>
                     <p>But how doth prayer doe this? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>

                     <p>Prayer brings thee in acquaintance with God. <note place="margin">2</note> Before acquaintance there may be a wishing well to another, but there cannot be that love to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is required in friendship.</p>

                     <p>Yes: but of this love in a speciall manner: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause love is the most peculiar gift of the Holy <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Ghost. Now the Holy Ghost is obtained by Prayer. Our hearts are so carnall, so fleshly, that we cannot love the Lord; and he is so holy, so good, that we can no more love him, unlesse hee himselfe kindle this flame of love in our hearts, than cold water can heat, unlesse it had another principle. Contend therefore and strive with the Lord for his Spirit which workes this love, who hath <hi>declared also unto us your love in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, desire the Lord to shew you him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that Iesus Christ would manifest himselfe unto you. And this is the greatest meanes of all, to worke love. He <hi>that hath my Commandements, and keepeth them, is he that loveth me, and hee</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 14. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>shall be loved of the Father, and I will love him, and shew my selfe unto him,</hi> when Christ shall shew himselfe to you, when he shall open the clouds, and let you see his beauty, his glory, Oh then you cannot but love him.</p>

There is a great difference betwixt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters shewing of you Christ, and his excellencies, and the Holy Ghosts. Though wee could speake with the tongue of Angels, yet it would be but as the dead letter to Christs shewing of himselfe. When he shall shew you your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ilenesse, his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, your sinfulnesse, his holinesse, your mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, his mercies, you must needs love him. <hi>Paul</hi> when he had revealed Christ, what hee could, to the Ephesians, he prayes for them, that <hi>God would give them the Spirit of wisdome and revelation,</hi> Ephesians 1. 18. As who should say, the labour is all lost, if you should see no more than I preach. You love not a man till you know him your selfe; the Lord shewed himselfe to <hi>Moses, David, Paul,</hi> which made them love him so much. Goe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Lord, and pray as <hi>Moses Lord shew mee thy glory;</hi> and beg it earnestly at his hands: and that which was done extraordinarily, shall be done to thy soule. That was but a shewing of the Lord by a right light, which is done more or lesse to every one.</p>
                     <p>But this is an act of the Lord, what shall I <note place="margin">Ob.</note> doe to it?</p>
                     <p>Consider what the Scripture sayes of him, <note place="margin">Sol.</note> what the Saints say of him, but most of all what he hath beene to thee. See with what patience, love, and mercy, hee hath carryed himselfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, as when we converse with a man, out of his severall actions we gather his disposition, and so frame an Idea of him in our minde.</p>
                     <p>We must humble our selves, labour to see our <note place="margin">3</note>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:34997:42"/>
miserable conditions, for that will bring love. So <hi>Paul</hi> when he considered that hee was the worst of all, it made him love more then them all. So <hi>Mary</hi> when she conceived how unfit she was to conceive by the Holy Ghost, she sung that song. When we looke on our selves, and see our owne sinnes and miseries, our love to Christ will bee increased. When a man shall have a true appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of himself and his misery, and can expect nothing but death and damnation, and then Christ should come and say, no; But hee shall live: this wounds a mans heart with love. Looke on your secret sinnes, your relapses, your misery by sinne, and then on Christs comming with his mercies and favours, and you cannot but love him. I say looke on thy sinnes, weigh them with their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. Thinke that <hi>after so many adulteries</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Jerem. 2.</note> committed against Christ, yet that he should say, <hi>If you will come in, yet will I receive you,</hi> this might shake thee and melt thy heart. He that loveth not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> Lord, sees not his misery, nor that good hee hath by him.</p>
                     <p>Strengthen thy faith: for the stronger thy faith is, the greater will thy love be. A strong <note place="margin">4</note> hand rids more worke then a weake. Take a man excellent in all gifts whom thou much admirest, yet if hee loved not thee, thou wouldest not much care for such an one: so though thou feest much excellency in <hi>Christ,</hi> yet thou canst not love him, unlesse thou hast a perswasion that he loves thee. But how shall I know that he will love me? hee hath made it knowne that he is thine, and that he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34997:42"/>
is willing, to become thy familiar friend; GOD hath given him in marriage to thee. <hi>To us a child</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Esay 9.</note> 
                        <hi>is borne, to us a sonne is given.</hi> And Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath shewne sufficiently his love unto thee. He hath spent his bloud for thee, yea, he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally speakes to his Father in thy behalfe, yea, hee sues to thee for love, he loves thee first, and sues to thee, as the man doth to the woman; thou maist be perswaded therefore that he loves thee.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, and he knew that well enough. Hee <note place="margin">Answ.</note> will take thee a Blackamoore, and afterwards will <hi>put beauty on thee,</hi> Ezekiel 36. 16. Stand not thou on thy unfitnesse when he is thy Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But it may be he stands thus and thus affected <note place="margin">Ob.</note> to such and such persons, and how shall I know that the Lord loves mee and is willing to take mee?</p>
                     <p>I can say nothing to thee but this, and that is <note place="margin">Answ.</note> sufficient, thou hast his generall promise made to all, <hi>Mark. 16. Goe preach the Gospel to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> There is a generall mandate given to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to preach the promise to all, and why wilt thou make exceptions where God hath made none, and enterline his promises? Wee are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to offer Christ to all, every one that will come may come and drinke of this water of life freely. The offer is generall, though but some imbrace it.</p>
                     <p>But I want godly sorrow for my sinnes. And <note place="margin">Ob.</note> this is required before we can receive Christ.</p>
                     <p>Yet deceive not thy selfe, the matter is not <note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:34997:43"/>
whether thy humiliation be more or lesse, only come. The promise is made to all that come, they shall be refreshed. Indeede thou wilt not come till thou art somewhat humbled, Thou wilt not flye to the City of refuge till thou art pursued by the avenger of blood. But if thou come at all, God will fulfill his promise. Sticke not so much on the degree of thy humiliation. Take a man that hath committed high Treason, for which he is condemned and brought to the place of execution, ready to suffer, but then there is a pardon offered him: And take another guilty of the same fact, but as yet not condemned, and bring him a pardon, he is even as joy full as the other, for he saw his case was even as bad, onely it was not so farre gone, and he hath not lived so long in sorrow. So some mens sinnes are grosser, and their sorrow more violent, other sinnes are lesse, but yet such as they see them like to damne them; they therefore are humbled as truly, though not so violently. Therefore though thou hast not had so much sorrow as others, nor felt those ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Almighty, yet if thou hast so much as will bring thee to Christ, and make thee sticke close unto him, so as thou wouldest not leave him for any thing in the world; it is enough, thou shalt have him. Why then stick you? what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders your faith? The impediments must be on Gods part, or on your part: But it is not on Gods part, for his promise is full, and large, most free; neither is there any on thy part, for there is nothing required in thee, for which hee shall set
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34997:43"/>
his love upon thee. There are no merits desired on thy part, onely accept him, receive him, hee will afterwards put some lines upon thee. Art thou willing to take Christ for thy husband, for better and worse, with a crowne of Thornes, as well as Glory? then the match is concluded, thou maist be sure that Christ will be thine.</p>
                     <p>But I have renewed my sinnes, and have fallen <note place="margin">Ob.</note> into divers relapses. I still provoke him and fall backe, and GOD will not endure such a wretch.</p>
                     <p>Yet he forgives sinnes of all sorts, he is <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                        <hi>in mercy,</hi> he is still forgiving, and never gives over. There is a <hi>fountaine opened to Iudah and Ierusalem for sinne and for uncleannesse, Zach. 12. vers.</hi> 13. There is afountaine, not a cisterne, to wash in, which may be drawne dry. Onely this caveat must be put in, that we allow not our selves in any knowne sinne, but that wee maintaine warre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually against sinne, and by no meanes admit any peace with <hi>Amaleck.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another meanes is, to remove the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of love, which are two especially, <hi>strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">5.</note> and <hi>worldly-mindednesse,</hi> Strangenesse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves all friendship. By this meanes the interest of friendship may be broken off. This strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse breeds fearefulnesse when we goe to God, and fearefulnesse weakenesse of love: whereas boldnesse is the nurse of it. <hi>Herein is our love made perfect, that we have boldnesse in the day of the Lord Iesus.</hi> As by neglecting fellowship with the Saints, we come to lose our acquaintance wee
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34997:44"/>
had towards them: so the neglecting of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our acquaintance with God, brings us quite at last to leave him. Draw neere therefore to God continually, and this will increase your love to him. Be therefore oft speaking to him and hearing him speake to you.</p>
                     <p>Be much in prayer, and often in reading and hearing. And doe not these things customarily, and untowardly, but with life and affection: goe to prayer as you would goe to speake with your most deare friend, whom you most of all delight to talke with. Let it be pleasant to thee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with him in all things; when thou hast any injury befallen thee, goe and make thy cause knowne to him; and when any sinne hath esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thee, whereby he may be offended, give not over till reconciliation be made, and thy friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship rewarded. Looke especially to thy wayes, for sinne alienates and restraines a man from God: therefore see that that bee removed as much as may be.</p>
                     <p>Worldly mindednesse also hinders the love of God. This is the uncircumcision of the heart. Hence is that, the Lord thy God will <hi>circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, that thou mayest live.</hi> And untill the heart be circumcised, it is filled with the love of the World, so that hee cannot love the Lord, at least, with all his heart, as hee ought.</p>
                     <p>There is no such quench-coale to the love of God, as the love of the World. Pleasures and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34997:44"/>
the love of carnall things are very apt to steale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our hearts from God before we are aware. If we looke not more narrowly to it, they may doe it. Examine your owne hearts, and see if by how much the more you love the World, by so much the lesse you are affected to the Lord. These things, as <hi>Absalom,</hi> steale away our hearts from God, as he did the people from his Father. If thou findest not that love to God, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath beene, see what hath come betweene God and thy heart. Looke if some pleasure or lust have not crept in betweene: for these will sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate betweene God and thee. See if there be not in thy understanding conceits of things to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then indeed they are: for these will turne the heart from the Lord; but above all, looke to thy will and affections.</p>

                     <p>Thou must love him with all thy might, and with all thy strength. A publike person may doe more then a private. His example may doe much,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34997:47"/>
or he may command others, if not to doe good, yet to refraine from evill.</p>
                     <p>God desires that thou love him with all thy strength; if thou knowest much, thou must doe much. Besides some things thou canst doe, namely, which others cannot doe without great difficulty. As some men are temperate, some pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient by nature. If thou art such an one, God requires more of thee then of another, for he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that which thou canst doe, without set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy might to it, as nothing. It is not enough for thee to love the Lord, but thou must love him with thy might. The might of a rich man, of a Magistrate, of a Scholler, or whatsoever thou art, when thou shalt come to the Lord with a small pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tance, when thou hast opportunity to doe a great deale more, the Lord will not take it at thy hands. As a Landlord will not receive a small parcell, when the Tenant may pay a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter summe. Neither is this a thing indifferent, for you to doe, or not to doe: for <hi>God requires much of him, to whom he hath given much.</hi> Hee gives us all talents which he puts as prizes in our hands, which he expects we should lay out accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as we have received. <hi>Paul</hi> did no worke of supererogation, though he was <hi>abundant in the workes of the Lord,</hi> continually setting himselfe about the worke with his whole strength.</p>
                     <p>Thou must love him above all things else; Above all creatures, above that which is most <note place="margin">2.</note> deare unto thee, yea, above thy selfe. And if thou dost not so, thou lovest him but as a creature
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34997:47"/>
which will not serve his turne. Hee hath done more for thee then any creatue hath or can doe. He hath dyed for thee, hath given himselfe crucified for thee, he deserves therefore more love then thy pleasures, profits, or then any friend thou hast. You are therefore to love him above all, to imbrace &amp; cleave to him chiefly, to make him wholly thine.</p>
                     <p>But how can he (you will say) be wholly mine, <note place="margin">Ob.</note> seeing so many have their parts in him?</p>
                     <p>Yes, hee is wholly thine, and thou must bee wholly his. He is infinite, and so hath no parts, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> but is entire to every one, as every line drawne to the Center, may challenge the whole Center for it's owne, though there be a thousand lines beside.</p>
                     <p>But what? must I so love the Lord, that I may, <note place="margin">Ob.</note> not love earthly things?</p>
                     <p>Yes: thou mayest love them, so that it be not with an adulterous love. Thou mayest love them <note place="margin">Answ.</note> for God, as by them you may be enabled to serve God the better.</p>
                     <p>But how shall I know this adulterous love? <note place="margin">Ob.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>When you love any thing, so as it lessens your love to your husband, that is an adulterous love. <note place="margin">Answ.</note> As when thou lovest some pleasure and delight so, as it takes up the minde and hinders thee in hearing, and will not suffer thee to pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distraction, but thy thoughts must be upon it, this love is adulterate love. Thou mayest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, yet so as if thou rejoycest not. As this joy hinders not thy walking with God, so thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34997:48"/>
labour in thy calling with a love to it, yet so as it doth not draw away thy heart from God.</p>
                     <p>But this is very difficult (will some say.) <note place="margin">Ob.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>No, it is easie. When God hath put this love into thy heart, the necessity of it may make it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Thou mayest doe it, or thou canst not bee saved. Indeede it is impossible for a man that hath set his heart on riches, to remove it off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of himselfe. And in this sense Christ speakes, when he sayes, <hi>It is so hard for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> But when God hath wrought this love in thee, and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to thee the emptinesse and vanity of other things, it will be easie.</p>
                     <p>But I am not able to love the Lord above my <note place="margin">Ob.</note> selfe and all other things.</p>
                     <p>Yes, thou mayest, if once thou art through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswaded that hee is thy chiefest good, and <note place="margin">Answ.</note> how miserable thou art without him: thou wilt then bee content to forsake all, and to cleave to him alone.</p>
                     <p>A man that sowes Corne is content it should die, so as it may bee quickned againe and bring forth encrease. And therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> though hee saw the outward building of his body goe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, he cared not, so long as he <hi>was renewed in the inner.</hi> So when thou seest thy good conteined in him more then in thy selfe, when thou seest thy happinesse laid up in him, thou wilt easily bee perswaded to leave thy selfe to injoy him: For thou losest nothing by losing thy selfe, thy whole happinesse is in God.</p>

                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:34997:48"/>
Againe, thou must be <hi>rooted and grounded in Love.</hi> This is that which the Apostle so prayes for, for the Ephesians, <hi>Ephesians</hi> 3. 17. There is a certaine love by fits which God accepts not. When men come and offer to God great promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses like the waves of the Sea, as bigge as moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, oh they thinke they will doe much for God, But their mindes change, and they become as those high waves, which at last fall levell with the other waters. If a man should proffer thee great kindnesses, and thou shouldest afterwards come to him to make use of him, and hee should looke strangely upon thee, as if hee were never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thee, how wouldest thou esteeme of such love! If wee are now on, now off in our love, God will not esteeme of such love, and if you be not rooted in your love, you will be unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Let then your love bee well rooted, let the foundation be good on which it stands: now that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>This love must be <hi>founded in faith.</hi> Therefore <hi>Ephesians</hi> 3. when the Apostle had prayed that they might be strengthened in faith, he addes this also, that they <hi>might bee grounded</hi> in love. When thou art once rooted in faith, thou shalt bee grounded in love.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34997:49"/>
revealed to thee of the Lord Iesus Christ, and it is good for thee to rest upon it.</p>
                     <p>Your love must bee built upon his Person. If you love his, and not him, you will be unstable <note place="margin">2</note> in your love. If thou lovest him in his Person, thou changest not, for thy love will bee constant. But if thou love him for that hee hath done for thee, because hee hath done thee much good, and given thee many favours, and tokens of his love, and kept thee from many troubles, when hee changes his dealing towards thee, thou wilt change thy love to him. Thou wilt then doe as <hi>Iob,</hi> receive good from the hand of the Lord, and also evill. Put case God should take from thee, and send one affliction in the necke of another, this will try thy love, whether in this case thou wilt sticke close unto him. Sometimes God hides his face from his children, and <hi>writes bitter things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them:</hi> If then thou canst love him, thy love is on his Person, a constant love.</p>
                     <p>Another condition of our love is, that <hi>it must be diligent.</hi> The Apostle commends the Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians <note place="margin">3</note> 
                        <hi>effectuall faith and diligent love, 1 Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> 1. 3. If you say you love the Lord, and yet will doe nothing for him, you have not that love which God accepts. This love is operative, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and not idle, and dead. Wee regard not a dead drugge, a dead plant, wee cut it up and cast it away: even so doth the Lord esteeme of a dead love, and love that shewes not it's life, it's diligence to obey God. This love will cause thee to put on new aparrell, to adorn thy life so,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34997:49"/>
as thy love may take delight in thee. This will make thee carefull to beautifie thy selfe with the graces of the Spirit. See therefore whether thy love prepare thee for Christ. This love doth that which <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did. It prepares men for the receiving of the Lord. If thou wilt come then before him in thy old garments; it is a signe thou lovest him not. Againe, the operativenesse of it, is seene in opening thy heart to him, when he offers himselfe unto thee. This will give thee a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart to entertaine him, that hee may dwell plentifully in thee. This doth make thee <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This love therefore will suffer no slut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish corner to remaine in the heart, but keepes all cleane. <hi>It clenses a man from all filthinesse of flesh and Spirit,</hi> 2 Corinthians 5.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the diligence of love is seene in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his commandements. If thou doest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the Lord, thou lovest him not. So much love as thou hast, so much care will there be in thee to doe his will; so much fire, so much heat to stir for his glory: So much love, so much desire to walke in perfect obedience before him.</p>
                     <p>And now wee come to the object upon <note place="margin">The object on whom our love must be set.</note> whom our love must be placed, <hi>The Lord Iesus.</hi> Consider whom it is, whom, if you love not,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34997:50"/>
I pronounce you thus accursed. It is the Lord Jesus, he is your Lord, your Prince, your Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, your Messias, your Prophet, so that hee which loves him not, is worthy to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed.</p>
                     <p>First, he is <hi>our Lord.</hi> Now, to run from an ordinary Master is punishable, to rebell against an ordinary King deserves death, but he is more, our Lord and King in a more speciall bond. Besides, that he hath made us, and preserves us, we are his by purchase, and he hath bought us deere, hee hath shed his blood for us: so that hee that will not love this Lord; let him be accursed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, againe he is our Saviour, and in this <note place="margin">2</note> respecct love is now more due to God, then in time of innocency. When <hi>Adam</hi> broke the Covenant and made shipwrack, Christ offers himselfe a Saviour. Now if wee will not receive him, there is no more hope. He is the <hi>secunda tabula,</hi> left to us after shipwrack, which if wee let goe, wee cannot escape eternall destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, he is our Prophet, <hi>that Messias, Iohn.</hi> 4. <note place="margin">3</note> which <hi>tels us all things;</hi> That great Prophet whom <hi>Moses</hi> foretold, whom if we beleeve not, we must be for ever accursed. The time of our ignorance God regarded not, but now hee will have an eye to us, after that the light hath shone unto us, and he hath revealed himselfe, when this our Prophet hath come unto us and shewne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto us. Now God olaimes our love: and if now we refuse to love him, and to come in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34997:50"/>
him, we are rebels. Yea, he is our <hi>Priest,</hi> and would reconcile God unto us. Yea, he is made unto us a <hi>King,</hi> to subdue our lusts and rebellious affections, to draw us to himselfe, as it were by force: So that now if we love him not, wee deserve the curse. Now marke, the Lord hath joyned these two together, <hi>the Lord Iesus.</hi> We must take heede that we separate them not. And we must see that wee take him not onely as a Saviour, but also as a Lord. He is not onely the Authour of the remission of our sinnes, but he is our Lord to rule us. The preaching of the Gospel is nothing but the offering of Christ, his whole person, and so you must take him, as a subject, to bee your Lord, as a Spouse to be ruled and guided by him, and then wee shall have the benefit which arises thence. We are willing to part with the sweete, but we will have none of the sowre: as that young man would have had Christ, but he would not part with his wealth for him. But Christ tels him that he must either part with him or them. Canst thou be content to fare as I doe? to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected &amp; scorned in the world as I am? then well &amp; good, thou mayest follow me, but otherwise thou canst not. And if thou art content to doe thus, to suffer persecution, and to forgoe all for him, thou shalt have him, and all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits that come by him; if not, thou art not worthy of him: hee that beleeves not the Lord Iesus, is condemned already. i. e. Hee that takes him not when hee is offered, is in the state of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34997:51"/>
of condemnation. We must see therefore that we take his whole person, as hee is a Lord, as well as he is a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and not the latter without the former. <hi>If any man love not the Lord Iesus, let him be had in execration, yea let him be accursed to the death.</hi> The Apostle curses sueh as love him not, with a double curse. He expresses it <note place="margin">Of the curse of those that love not the Lord Iesus.</note> in two languages. They are men set apart to evill, appointed to destruction; as some men are set apart to good, so are these to evill. They are shut up in prison, such as God hath set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe against. His eyes are continually upon them for evill. Thus shall he be accursed that loves not the <hi>Lord Iesus.</hi> There shall be a curse on his soule, <hi>for matter of grace,</hi> that as Christ cursed the figtree, when hee came and found no fruit upon it, <hi>never fruit grow more on thee, and it withered away:</hi> So when Christ is offered, and this Gospell preached, and thou refusest this grace, thou mayest find Christ so curse thee, that thou be ever barren in the matter of grace. And if perhaps thou thinkest this no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the curse goes further. Thou shalt bee cursed <hi>from the presence of the Lord.</hi> Thou shalt have no part nor portion in the light, sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and comfort of his favour. And this <hi>Caine</hi> tooke to heart, though he were a wicked man, and had before but Gods common favour: and so <hi>Saul</hi> was exceedingly cast downe, when as God would not answer him by any of those usuall meanes: but is this such a matter to bee excluded from his presence? yea, and at the
<pb facs="tcp:34997:51"/>
time of death you shall find it somwhat, yea in troubles you shall see it a dreadfull thing (as they did) to want him to stand your friend. As <hi>Saul</hi> did, though in his prosperity he little regarded it, yet when the Philistines came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he was driven to his wits end, because the Lord would not answer him. But these are but spirituall things, I feele them not, you will say. But yet the curse goes further, <hi>You shall be cursed also from the earth,</hi> that is, from earthly comforts, which it yeelds to others. Now thou shalt bestow all thy travell and paine upon it, and be never the better for it.</p>
                     <p>But many a man receives him not, and yet is not thus accursed. <note place="margin">Ob.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed we see it not many times, and it may <note place="margin">Answ.</note> be, the time of execution is not yet come. Thou mayest have <hi>Cains</hi> priviledge, though thou art ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed, that none shall kill thee presently: Thou mayest enjoy thy health and wealth, and no man lay hold on thee here to hurt thee. But thou art reserved to a more solemne day of punishment. And yet the curse goes a step further, thou shalt <hi>be cursed eternally.</hi> But that thou wilt say, is a great way off; and you need not feare it yet. But consider what eternity is, what those dayes of darknesse will be, when the Sun of comfort shall set, and never rise againe upon thee. When it shall be alwayes perfect night, and never day. When God shall open all the treasures of his wrath, and powre them with full fury upon thee, when the storme of vengeance shall never bee
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34997:52"/>
blowne over, but thou shalt bee overwhelmed in the midst of all miserie, asthe old world was in the deluge.</p>
                     <p>If this be the case of men that refuse, yea, that <note place="margin">Vse.</note> love not the Lord, then take heed to your selves. Wee the Ministers offer you Christ when wee preach, and you sit negligently before us, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding other things, not caring to take the Lord. Take heed: this is your portion to be thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed.</p>
                     <p>The Gospell hath two parts: if you take Christ, you shall be happy, you shall be saved. But if you will not love him and imbrace him, you shall be damned. Therefore thinke not that there is nothing but hony in it: yea there is a sting that followes it, if it be neglected: Ministers are not to goe a begging in offering the Gospell, but are as Ambassadors of the Lord of Heaven. If men will receive our message, so it is, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the dust which we shake off from our feet, shall be a witnesse against you, that so God will shake you off. God will not have his Gospel refused, his Son despised; and therefore he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels us, to <hi>kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and wee perish all in his wrath,</hi> Psalm 2. Though hee be a Lamb, and have behaved himselfe meekly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, yet if wee provoke him, wee shall know that he can shew himselfe a Lyon. If hee be not entertained in the still voice, he will come in fire, in a wind that shall rend the rockes in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Thus he describes himselfe, <hi>One that hath feet like burning brasse, out of whose mouth proceeds
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34997:52"/>
a firie sword,</hi> Revelation 1. <hi>Moses</hi> went first to <hi>Mount Gerizim,</hi> to blesse the people; and if that would not move them, he go's up to <hi>Mount Ebal,</hi> and thence curses them: so the Apostle before exhorts &amp; perswades them to the love of Christ, but if they will not imbrace him on fair termes, he tels them what shall follow, they must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed.</p>
                     <p>But what if I take not the Lord at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant? <note place="margin">Ob.</note> I hope this curse will not befall me.</p>
                     <p>It is true, we cannot say so; for while this time lasts, wee are still commanded to offer <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Christ; yet there will come a time, when there will come forth a Decree which shall never be revoked. Take heed therfore, for this is very dangerous. The Lord will not suffer his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to be abused, or neglected: when once the Husbandmen refused the Son, they were present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>cast out of the vineyard,</hi> Mat. 21. This offends God more than any sinne that wee can commit. To refuse Christ offered, is worse than drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, theft, adultery, or the like, which men count the grossest sins. <hi>My people would none of me, therefore I gave them up to their owne hearts lusts.</hi> This refusing him, made him swear that they should never enter into his rest. As the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel offers greater favour than the Law; so, <hi>swifter damnation</hi> attends the neglect of it. My brethren, take heed <hi>that you receive not the grace of God in vain.</hi> While it is called to day, <hi>harden not your hearts;</hi> yea, take heed of refusing it now. For,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34997:53"/>
you know not whether this offer may ever bee made you againe; and if it be, thou knowest not whether thou shalt have the grace to receive it, or no. Know, that the same Gospel <hi>is a savour of life unto life,</hi> to such as receive it; but unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>of death unto everlasting death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Gospel is continued still. <note place="margin">Ob.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true: but how many are there that live in the congregation, and are never a whit the better, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> though they hear the Word daily, because by the contempt of it, it becomes the savour of death to them, and their hearts are hardned, so that they shall never receive good by it?</p>

of mine hath closed thy eyes, and kept thy heart from me: yet every base pleasure, and pleasing lust hath kept my heart and eye from thee.

Hitherto therefore I have loved thee, but <hi>for lust,</hi> not <hi>for love.</hi> I would have thee save me, but I would not honour, and please thee. I can thus think of my disloyalty towards thee; but thou knewest it before I thought it, and more then I can speake or thinke. Thou doest <hi>thinke thoughts of love and peace to me,</hi> but I minde the abuse of thy love, and the too late repentance of thee <hi>upon my owne termes.</hi> How can I be acceptable to thee, <hi>(My Love, my Dove, my undefiled,)</hi> Thou spreadest out thy hands, and art ready for <hi>blessing me:</hi> but if I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen my head, heart, hand, I am apt to receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Anathema, Maranatha</hi> from thee.

Shew me then where thou liest <hi>at this my noone.</hi> Now thy Sun doth shine upon this my tabernacle, and I have some time to behold thy beauty, that I may be in love with thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: where then shall I finde thee? if I looke to <hi>mount Tabor,</hi> I see thee in glory, and I cannot but love thee for that.

If I looke to <hi>mount Olivet,</hi> I see thee ascending <hi>farre above all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> and I cannot but love thee for that also. Indeed in <hi>Tabor</hi> thou hadst visible glory, but it soone vanished: in the <hi>Garden</hi> and <hi>Golgotha,</hi> thou hadst <hi>little</hi> visible <hi>beauty why I should desire thee:</hi> and in <hi>Olivet,</hi> thou wast quite carried out of my sight.

O let mee see thee here below, in the Church, in my selfe. Let thy glory goe before me, that I may love thee for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ever, and be blessed in thee. Thou hast a long time been manifested to me in thy natures, offices, and markes for me, and these draw mee to love thee. Thou hast beene crucified before my eyes, and the vertues of it have beene cleared by the Ministery of the Word, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

Thou wouldest have come <hi>in and supped with me</hi> after the noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine of the Gospel, with thine owne banquet. But, alas, there was no roome for thee, because I desired first to feast it out with the base guests of sinfull lusts, before I would give thee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement.

If I could give thee my heart, thou wouldst give it better to me againe: for no uncleane thing can come out of thy hands. But (O my desired love) I have denied thee; therefore, I deny my selfe. I have rejected thee; therefore, I reject my selfe. Doe with me as thou wilt, onely first love me, and let me answer thee with love againe. And why should not I be confident to be heard in this, seeing thou <hi>(my love) sittest at the right hand of God making request for me.</hi> Speak thou the word, and thy poore servant shall love thee.

And shall it be thus with me, O thou that <hi>wilt not the death of poore sinners,</hi> who pant after thee? No, no, thy merits and intercession have prevailed with my God. I finde the filth of domineering sinne, in some measure, washed from the windowes of my soule, that the beames of thy glory may pierce it, and draw my love after thee. Now doe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>to be sicke of love,</hi> and earnestly desire thy

company here, <hi>by grace,</hi> and hereafter <hi>by glory.</hi> I love to heare thee speak <hi>(let me heare thy voice for it is sweet)</hi> and to speake to others of thee, and thy beauties. Thou hast made mee something willing to doe, and to suffer any thing for thee, <hi>Lord perfect this good worke.</hi> If I see the meanest persons like thee in thy goodnesse, <hi>My delight is in them;</hi> I love them the better for thy sake. I dare not wilfully anger thee, and <hi>my soule is vexed</hi> with them that doe it. Thus the pulses of my soule (by thy blessing) doe begin to beat after thee. But (alas) when I consider how weake I am in thy love to thee my <hi>Saviour:</hi> when I find a thousand things creep in betwixt thee &amp; home, and steale my heart away from thee: when I feele how easily I am diverted from thee and thy service, what comfort can my poore soule have now? <hi>O my Lord Iesus,</hi> thou wilt not leave thy own worke, &amp; suffer <hi>thy tender plant to wither away!</hi> when thou hast sowed thy seed, hast thou not prepared the former and latter raine? <hi>Shall I not be able to doe this through him that loveth thee and me?</hi> I may not run from thy love, <hi>thou art my Lord.</hi> I dare not, <hi>thou art my Iesus.</hi> If thou live, let me know thy love to me. If I live, let me feele my love to thee. Oh <hi>shed it more in my heart,</hi> that as in beleeving in thee <hi>my person</hi> is justified, so in loving thee <hi>my faith</hi> may be justified, and in having <hi>faith working by love,</hi> I may so constantly walke in thy presence, that with comfort I may sing with the Bride, <hi>Come Lord Iesus, come quickly,</hi> Even so,</p>

                  <head>THE CHARISTIAN FREEDOME, OR THE CHAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER OF THE GOSPEL, SHEW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING THE PRIVILEDGE AND Prraeogative of the Saints, by vertue of the Covenant.</head>
                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>ROM. 6. 14.</bibl>
                     <q>For sinne shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese words are brought in thus; the Apostle exhorts them not to sinne, but to give their members as instruments unto righteousnesse: and to move them to this, hee tells them that sinne was not their Lord now as it was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that it shall have no more dominion over them, and therefore he bids them strive against it:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34997:61"/>
and then he adds a reason of this, because <hi>they were not under the law, but under grace,</hi> now Christ hath changed their hearts: for while a man is under the Law, sinne hath dominion over him; it tells him what to doe, but gives him no power to doe it: but you have the grace of sanctification to change your hearts, and enable you to every good word and work, so that <hi>you delight in the Law after the inner man,</hi> albeit <hi>you see another law in your members warring against the Law of your minde, and bringing you into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to the law of sinne which is in your members,</hi> as it is said, <hi>Chap. 7. ver.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>Whence wee may learne, That <hi>hee that is in the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>state of grace, lyeth in no knowne sinne; no sinne hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, sinne is said to have no Dominion over a man, three manner of wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> in regard</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It hath no right to rule over him; it is no more our Lord, but is as a servant that hath no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, but is said to offer violence to us: as if the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> should rule over us, hee hath no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In regard it is not obeyed, for there it hath dominion: as a Prince may have right to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet if hee be not obeyed, hee hath no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In regard though it strive against us, yet it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gets the victory: for though it assault us, yet if it get not the victory, it hath no dominion over us: this is proved by three Similitudes which must be explaned, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, it was our Master, and we its servants; but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34997:61"/>
now wee have changed our Master, and <hi>are become the servants of righteousnesse,</hi> ver. 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is said that we were married to sin, and it had dominion and command over us, as the husband over the wife; but now it is dead, and there is a divorce betweene us, and now wee are married to Christ, and hee commands us, and wee obey.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is said we are <hi>dead to sinne, and alive to God,</hi> ver. 11. and therefore we cannot live in sinne: for, command a dead body to goe about a businesse, and he cannot, because he is dead.</p>
                  <p>Now the reasons of the point be these. The first <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> is taken from Christ; wee are <hi>ingrafted into Christ, and into his death, and into the similitude of his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, verse 5.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are grafted as a graft into Christ, and all the old sap is taken away, and wee have new sap, and bring forth new fruit, and have no other, because we grow in another tree, and we live to God: yet we may commit sinne, though wee allow not our selves in it; for <hi>they that are Christs, have crucified the flesh with the affections and lasts thereof:</hi> if therefore there be any lust reigning in us, we are not in Christ. Againe, <hi>if any man be in Christ, hee is a new creature,</hi> and therfore he doth not wallow in his old sins: so saith God, <hi>I will give you a new heart;</hi> and, <hi>all things are become new;</hi> and, <hi>old things are done away:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee cannot lve in any knowne sinne. Againe, whosoever is in Christ, <hi>hath received of his fulnesse, and grace for grace; in him we are able to doe all things:</hi> and therefore if we cannot strive against old sinnes,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34997:62"/>
wee are not in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because wee have the Spirit of God ruling in us, and therefore we walk after the Spirit, and not after the flesh: now if we lye in any known sinne, we have not the Spirit, and therefore are not in the state of grace: if any man have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace, he is not the Sonne of God: now if he walk after the flesh, hee hath not the Spirit, for the Spirit gives him ability to strive against all sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he is borne of God: now, <hi>he that is born of God, sinneth not,</hi> that is, sinne ruleth not over him: for a man is said to sinne that favours wickednesse, and setteth his heart to sinne: hee sinneth not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is like God, as a sonne is like his father; and therefore a wicked man is like the devill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is his Father, and his wickednesse is in him, and therefore the devill is called the father of the wicked: and so every regenerate man hath all the righteousnesse of Christ, though not in the same degree; he hath perfect holinesse <hi>of parts,</hi> though not <hi>of degrees:</hi> now then he hath no member of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in him, that is, no knowne sinne which hee loveth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, because hee hath the whole law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart, and his heart is set to obey the whole law, and therefore hee cannot lye in any knowne sinne.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, because he is wholly changed and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated to another man: which is exprest two wayes. 1. The whole drift of his minde is changed. As suppose the earth were made free, the whole bent of it were to goe upward; so a man is wholly bent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34997:62"/>
towards heaven, or else his heart is not changed: and if so, he can lye in no knowne sinne. 2. He is changed in his taste. S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>They that are in Christ, savour not the things of the flesh, but of the spirit:</hi> every sinne is bitter to the regenerate man; if it be not, then he savoureth the things of the flesh. To this is that agreeable, <hi>Keepe this feast with unleavened bread, and not with old leaven of maliciousnesse:</hi> we must be unleavened bread to Christ, we must give no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to sinne.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, because they know God. The Lord saith by his Prophet, <hi>I will write my law in their hearts, and they shall know me:</hi> so that with this writing the law in their hearts, they cannot but know sinne; for they are changed in their mindes before they can know God: hence I inferre that he that knowes God, will not change from the immutable God to the mutable creature; and they that doe it, doe it because they know not God.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, because hee hath faith, which will make him not lie in any knowne sinne: for all sins are either of the temptation of the devill, the flesh, or the world: now, faith overcomes all these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It overcommeth the world; <hi>This is the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that overcommeth the world, even your faith:</hi> but if the world could overcome the regenerate in any temptation, then this were not true that <hi>faith over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the world;</hi> but he shall not be overcome by the glory and riches of the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the flesh; <hi>The just walketh in his integrity.</hi> To this may be added, that blessings are every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where annexed to the keeping of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34997:63"/>
                     <hi>Blessed are they that have respect unto thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: If you leane to the right band, or to the left, &amp;c,</hi> Againe, <hi>If you keepe the whole law, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in anyone, you are guilty of the whole law.</hi> But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these Scriptures, there be other reasons to prove that the regenerate man cannot lye in any knowne sinne.</p>
                  <p>First, because hee that lyes in any knowne sinne, hath another for his Lord and God, and so is an Idolater, and so cannot be regenerate, for hee yeeldeth to the same still; if it commands, hee obeyeth; God commanding him, hee neglecteth it, and therefore maketh it his God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because he that lyeth in any knowne sinne, will be unconstant in the serving of God: now God rejecteth such an one; for though the temptation to that sinne being removed, hee serve God; yet that sinne setting upon him, hee forsakes Gods service, and obeyeth it, and when soever oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is offered, hee turneth to obey it: now such unconstancie God hateth. As among men a flower though it be more beautifull than a pearle, yet it is not regarded so much, because it is fading; and a ship may saile safe a great while, but yet falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a rock maketh shipwrack: so a man may <hi>make shipwrack of faith and a good conscience;</hi> and such a one cannot be in the state of grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because hee that lyeth in any knowne sinne, will, if he had like strong temptations, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all the sinnes in the world; as be a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to covetousnesse or uncleannesse, hee would commit any other if hee were as much enclined to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34997:63"/>
any other: now, such an one cannot be in the state of grace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, because if a man have a good heart, no sinne can grow there, because it is out of its proper place, and therefore cannot prosper: as plants that grow in <hi>India,</hi> if they be set here, wither; so every sinne in a good heart is out of its proper place, and wil not grow, but wither every day more &amp; more: but he that findeth finne growing in his heart, his heart is not regenerate.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, because he must hate the word of God and godly men: for when a man is ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sinne, the word is at him to disswade him, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men disswade him; and therefore now if he doe it, and they still rebuke him, hee commeth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the word a reproach, and he hates it and good men likewise. Thus <hi>Herod</hi> is <hi>Iohns</hi> friend a great while, till he tels him of his beloued sinne, and then off goes his head: so hee hates God, and wishes there were none, because he resolveth to sinne, and God reproves him, and so hee cannot be in a good estate.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly and lastly, because all his actions will have an evill tincture from that his sinne; it so swayeth all he doth, that nothing is currant in Gods sight. As if a man were set to get honour, though he did not directly fall into that sinne, yet hee squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all his actions that way, hee affecteth such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as may further that his intent, so that sinne leaveneth every action of his; and whensoever any act of religion opposeth him, he then forsaketh all: as if a man have a project to get a harvest that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34997:64"/>
is not yet come, all that hee doth, is for that end, hee ploweth, soweth, and the like; so it is with a man that hath a sinne, and resolves to follow it, hee byasseth all his actions by that, therefore God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres him and all that he doth.</p>
                  <p>First, this is to try us: hereby every man may <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> know whether he be in the state of grace or no. If he lies in the least knowne sinne that is, hee is but counterfeit; if though he be admonished, and told that God will not have him to doe such a thing, yet he doth it, it is a signe he is not in a good estate: as if a man knew and were perswaded he ought not to abound in idle speeches, and yet will, it is a signe he is not in the state of grace. So when he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to pray, and yet doth it not, or doth it only for shew, it's a signe he is in a bad estate: or if hee knew it a sinne to be idle, and is perswaded of it, and yet will, it's a signe his estate is not good: so for immoderate gaming, if one be told hee should not, yet will use it, certainly he is bad: so for the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, when a man shall spend all his time, and finde all thoughts bent that way for any one of them, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is his heart is not gracious; for then these thoughts would not abound in him, but thoughts of growing in grace; but if his morning thoughts be for satisfying of the flesh and the lusts thereof, or his secret plots, he may justly feare it's a reigning sinne: for when all his projects and thoughts are upon one thing, as to be in fine apparell, it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine sinne reigneth in him, and so he is in the state of damnation; as a Scholer that wholly aymes at
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34997:64"/>
vaine glory, and how to get honour and credit, that sinne reigneth in him.</p>
                  <p>But there were many which seemed religious <note place="margin">Object.</note> men, which had these infirmities in them in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>True, and many therefore not truly regenerated, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> but seeming only so: now many make a faire show under the meanes, when falling into temptations, they fall away: but if they be not commanded, or think not of it, great faults may stand with true grace; but if they be admonished by their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or others, and told they must not doe it, then their estate is not good; for true grace cannot stand with these failings.</p>
                  <p>Now, the signes whereby we may know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we live in knowne sinnes or not, are these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Living in a knowne sinne is of two sorts; 1. <hi>Knowne,</hi> when men <hi>sell themselves to commit wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Ahab</hi> did; when he powreth out himselfe to vanity, as when a man shall give up himselfe to drink or to company, or to commit any sinne of uncleannesse, or giveth himselfe to spend all of his time in recreations, this is evident to the world and to his owne conscience. Againe, when he plainely forsaketh God and good courses which he tooke before, as <hi>Demas</hi> did, this is plaine, he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a knowne sinne. Secondly, the <hi>secret</hi> lying in sinne, the signes whereof are these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When a man committeth it ordinarily: this is that <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that the Saints fall upon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: as if a man be sailing into <hi>France,</hi> a tempest driveth him into <hi>Spaine;</hi> so the Saints face is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34997:65"/>
heaven, but a suddaine passion may drive them another way. To commit sinne ordinarily, is to commit it when temptation assaileth, and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is offered, and impediments removed, then hee commits the sinne ordinarily; for if there were such temptations alwayes, hee would commit the sinne alwayes: as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was good by fits, he was often restored, and desired <hi>Moses</hi> to pray for him; yet when temptation came, hee would not let the people goe, though before he had intended to do it. So <hi>Saul,</hi> when opportunity was offered, would have killed <hi>David,</hi> though he swore not to doe it; and so <hi>Hazael:</hi> this is committing of sinnes ordinarily.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When a man rejecteth admonitions, and the reprover. <hi>A poore childe is better than a foolish</hi> (that is a rich) <hi>King that will no longer be admonished,</hi> for then his heart is evill: for if a man be willing to have his lust mortified, hee is well pleased with him that brings him a knife to cut it off, because he doth as he would have him to doe: but when men are purposed to lye in sinne, they doe as a man doth with Physick that he loatheth, he hateth even the very pot it selfe wherein it was; so they hate them that admonish them, even as dogs: but if they can endure the company of good men, it is a signe their hearts are good.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Abstinence from occasions: for many say their infirmities make them runne into such and such sinnes; but if they were minded to leave their sinnes, they would leave their evill company and all occasions. To this adde the use of the meanes: for hee that purposeth to forsake his sinnes, will use
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34997:65"/>
the meanes: as if a man that is a drunkard, will keepe drunkards company, hee hath not purposed to forsake his sinnes, for then he would forsake and leave his evill company: but if hee use the meanes for mortifying the sinnes hee loveth, then it is a signe he is willing to leave sinne.</p>
                  <p>Now the meanes for mortifying sinfull lusts in us, are these.</p>
                  <p>First, to make a vow not to commit that sinne, nor touch the occasions; for then it is a signe our heart is sincere: this is a comfort to those that have made vowes; which should be more used, not to make perpetuall vowes, but for some short time.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to fast and pray; for some lusts are not cast out but by these three.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to use godly mens company, for their practise and example helps them to forsake their sinnes, to fast and pray.</p>
                  <p>Another signe of not lying in any knowne sin, is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man prayes for admonitions, that God would stirre up some to admonish him, and can be content to search reasons out of the Scripture against it, and is glad when he heares it reproved in the publique ministery.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when we can be content to be deprived of many things which might further our lusts, and to loath what sweetnesse might encrease them; that is a sure signe that sinne rules not in us.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, when a man confesseth his sinnes parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, and plainely: for this is a signe hee would forsake them: this reason the Scripture doth show, because then the conscience maketh such a noyse
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34997:66"/>
that he cannot denie it; for when a man is purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to continue in sinne, hee will not confesse his sinnes, no not to God: it is said when they came to <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist, <hi>They confessed their sinnes, Matth.</hi> 3. 6. So <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>I said, I will confesse my transgressions unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sinne. Psal.</hi> 32. 5.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, When he is easily convicted: but when men will not be convicted, but seeke out distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to maintaine their sinne, it is a signe it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in them. Againe, when they will not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine both sides, but runne to commit it, and stop their eares <hi>like a deafe adder, which refuseth to heare the voyce of the Charmer, charme he never so wisely,</hi> and will not heare the reasons against that sinne, least they should be restrained. Therefore the righteous are said to <hi>ponder their wayes,</hi> and <hi>consider their paths,</hi> and to <hi>try everything,</hi> and to <hi>take that which is good.</hi> Now, hee that will but heare reasons against the sinne he doth, he is none of these: but when he will not be convinced, which is the first work of the spirit, it is a signe he is under the dominion of sinne.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, when a man abstaineth from sinne not onely out of a naturall conscience, but out of a spirituall; for a naturall conscience may deceive him: for there be three degrees of conscience: First, a prophane man hath some conscience; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a civill man hath more conscience; yet both naturall: Thirdly, a godly man hath most conscience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of the heathen, that they had a conscience that did <hi>accuse and excuse them:</hi> but when
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34997:66"/>
a man doth not commit sinne, being enlightned by a spirituall conscience, which is when a man hath a love to the contrary grace, and is carried with a certaine desire to doe it (as men eat) though there were no reward, and hate the sinne, and will not commit it, this is a good signe that sinne hath not dominion over him: but a man may have a restraint from a naturall conscience, yet it may have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over him, because it is as a barking dogge, that keepes the theefe from robbing.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, when a man 1. Doth not purpose to commit the sinne; 2. Hath reluctancie in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of it. 3. Grieveth afterwards, and riseth with a better resolution not to doe it. But if this proceed from a naturall conscience, it is nothing: but if it proceed from a spirituall conscience and hatred of sinne, this is a good signe.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, when after striving we have the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for we shall have the victory if we strive aright. This takes away their excuse that say it's their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie: but if they lye not in sinne, they will have the victory over it; else thou art not a King, for a King is victorious; yet a King may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, yea, he may be wounded, yet hee keepes his power. So the Saints may have many infirmities, yea they may have sound falls, yet in the end they have the victory; <hi>God shall tread Satan under their feet:</hi> wherefore the Godly mans heart, though hee faileth sometimes, is like a troubled fountaine, which though it be muddie, yet because there is a spring of grace in his heart, it worketh it selfe pure againe, and works out all the mud. Therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34997:67"/>
not your selves with dislike of sinne, but leave not till you have got the victory.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Observe whether thou delightest in those that commit the same sinnes: if you doe, you lye in sinne, whatsoever you pretend. <hi>They doe not onely those things, but have pleasure in those that doe them. Rom. 1. ult.</hi> This is a signe of a desperate heart. For a man may be drawne to sinne by passion, yet his heart may be upright: but when hee alloweth and loveth it in another, then there is no passion to lead him, but it's a signe his heart is bent to it: for it's a signe of grace when you love those that excell in grace; so on the contrary it's a signe of a corrupt and rotten heart, when wee <hi>rejoyce in iniquity.</hi> As for example, suppose a man have a lust of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, yet disliketh it in another, and liketh those that excell in the contrary vertue, it's a signe hee is in a good estate; and this is true, because in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man hath no passion to lead him away.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, when a man shall commit a sinne cleane to the contrary after perswasion, and long deliberation, as in <hi>Ieroboam, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Ahab;</hi> these committed their sinnes but once or twice: <hi>Saul</hi> had a commandement from <hi>Samuel</hi> not to doe it, he had many dayes deliberation upon it, yet hee did; which lost him his soule. <hi>David</hi> committed greater sinnes, yet God counted them nothing, because he did not cast God away: but <hi>Saul</hi> had cast him off; so <hi>Ieroboam</hi> set up the calfe on deliberation, and contrary to the perswasion of the Prophet, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God cast him off. This was <hi>Balams</hi> sinne, who deliberated what he should doe, yet having a secret
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34997:67"/>
desire of reward, did curse <hi>Israel;</hi> which made God cast him off: this was the sin of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> who was smitten for committing of a sinne of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly and lastly, when a man shall make no conscience of small particular sinnes, wherein his judgement is convicted that they are sinnes, it's a signe sinne hath dominion over him: this is plaine by Scripture; <hi>He that is not faithfull in the greatest,</hi> he may doe it, yet not be faithfull. Againe by reason, if a small sinne be a sinne against God, then why make you no conscience of the least? for God is offended with these as well as with the greatest: so if ye make conscience of the greatest of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods worship, why doe you not also of the least duties? for God is pleased with these, as well as with the other. Some say they will be religious, but they need not be so precise as some scrupulous men are: but let them examine themselves: if the least sinnes be sinnes, they must also make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them: so if we must keepe an houre of the Sabboth, there is the same reason of the rest of the houres; so for idle speeches, and fashioning of our selves to the world; so if we seeke for preferment or riches, it is contrary to the commandement of God: seeke not to be rich; for <hi>they that will be rich, drowne themselves in perdition and destruction:</hi> so wee must not keepe company with evill and unsanctified men: examine how wee practise this in all duties commanded, let us try our selves by abstaining from occasions, whether wee refraine our selves from the temptations of objects; for our speech
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34997:68"/>
must be gracious, not by fits, but alwayes; so we must be diligent in our Callings: if out of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we doe this, we are faithfull; otherwise wee are not: for the same God which commanded us not to kill, commanded us not to commit adultery: if then thou committest adultery, thou offendest God: so <hi>Moses</hi> would not leave an hoofe behind him in Egypt, because God commanded him so to doe. <hi>Know you not that no unrighteous man shall inherit the Kingdome of God? 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 9. So if wee abstaine from foule sinnes, yet if we commit the least, wee shall never goe to heaven.</p>
                  <p>It serves for encouragement for fearefull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> for if sinne shall not have dominion over you, then this may encourage you against the sinne that prevaileth against you sometimes; at last you shall have the victory: it is true that many sinnes make warre against many Christians, and will not be overcome for a long time, it may be for one, two, or three yeares; yet let us not be discouraged, but renew our strength againe, and in the end wee shall have the victory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we have here the priviledge of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; <note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> for though they be servants while others be Princes, yet they are free in regard of their lusts. To see a man led to his execution, wee would not think it were for his honour; so when ungodly men thrive in their worldy lusts, their soules are led to destruction, when sinne shall have no dominion over the godly; but the ambitious and voluptuous men doe whatsoever their lusts command them, with a miserable bondage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:34997:68"/>
It is not enough for men to see their sinnes, or to <note place="margin">Vse 4.</note> blame them in themselves, or to purpose to amend or forsake them, but they must strive to overcome them, or else they shall have no promise of the Gospel apply'd unto them. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a wicked man, yet with heart he purposed to let the children of <hi>Israel</hi> goe; but when some temptation assaulted him, then he would not let them goe: so <hi>Saul</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in his heart not to kill <hi>David,</hi> insomuch that he sware to <hi>Ionathan</hi> he would not doe it; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he attempted it upon another temptation: but wee must come to feele that sinne hath no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over us, otherwise we shall heare that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Depart from mee ye wicked into everlasting fire;</hi> and, <hi>Out of thy owne mouth I will adjudge thee, O thou wicked servant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so much may be sufficient for the unfolding the first point of doctrine; proceed wee to a second which flowes from hence also, and that is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>sinne although it doe not raigne in the Saints, yet</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>doth remaine and dwell in them:</hi> for proofe whereof see this place of Scripture, <hi>If any man thinketh</hi> (saith <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 8.</note> Saint <hi>Iohn) that he hath no sinne, hee is a lyer, and there is no truth in him.</hi> The truth whereof will be seene in these things clearely.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because our knowledge is imperfect, and therefore every grace is imperfect, as our faith, and so our love; and therefore much sinne must be in a man, in as much as his grace is not perfect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The flesh lusteth against the spirit; therefore it is plaine there is sinne in us, yea so much that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times it even captivateth us.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:34997:69"/>
3. Wee have in this life but the first-fruits of the spirit: now when wee shall have it in fulnesse, we shall have no more than enough; therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now but the first-fruits of the spirit, Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Sanctification, sinne is not wholly abolished in the Saints in this life, but doth dwell in them. The reasons hereof are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To humble us, and to make us see what is in <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> our hearts, and to make us know that the Lord bringeth us to the holy Land; therfore God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times left the Israelites to try them; and so hee troubled <hi>Hezechiah</hi> to know what was in his heart; and so he sent a Messenger of Satan to buffet S. <hi>Paul,</hi> lest hee should be exalted above measure through aboundance of Revelations; and so the Lord doth deale with every Saint.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Christ may be acknowledged; for if wee had no sinne in us, we should not acknowledge <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> the benefits of his mediation so much as now wee doe: <hi>All are shut up under sinne, that he might have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie upon all, Rom. 3. 9. &amp;</hi> 11. 32. that is, that it might be manifested and declared, that they are saved meerely by the mercie of God in Christ, as is said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26. Otherwise wee should not rightly value our justification and sanctification; but seeing him subduing, pardoning our sinnes, wee see what need we have of him, how that we are lost without him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That wee might exercise our faith. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 2. <note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Wee are the sonnes of God, but it doth not yet appeare what wee shall be, &amp;c.</hi> So God hath hid his children under basenesse, that their faith might be exercised: for things we see, we may easily beleeve; but <hi>faith is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34997:69"/>
of things not seene:</hi> therefore God doth as men doe, hide Jewels under base places, where men would looke least for them: wherefore wicked men stumble, and are offended at this, because they doe not beleeve it; and therefore it is made an article of our faith, that we need and beleeve the remission and forgivenesse of sinnes. But let us apply it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This should teach us not to be discouraged <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> for those infirmities that are in us, for there are such in every Saint. Sinne is a guest to evill men, but a theefe to the godly, which they would not have come in their hearts: so it is one thing to weare a chaine as an ornament, and another as a fetter to restraine them: therefore the godly ought not to be discouraged, but to assure themselves they are under grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee must not censure men for the slips and falls wee see in them: for wee must remember <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> that sinne dwelleth in them, we must not presently judge them to be hypocrites: <hi>Be not many masters,</hi> saith S. <hi>Iames,</hi> that is, censure him not, for <hi>he standeth or falleth to his owne Master. Rom,</hi> 14. 4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This should teach us to be watchfull, and not to think our labour is at an end when we are in the <note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> state of grace; for sinne still dwelleth in us, and though we have the victory over sinne one day, it will fight against us the next day: as in a garden the weeds will grow, because the roots are not quite plucked up, and taken away; so sinne is in us, and therefore we must think it will fight against us and vex us; and therefore I say, let us renue our strength.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:34997:70"/>Now for this, we must doe these two things. <list>
                        <item>First, weaken sinne.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, pray to God to make us watchfull.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so I have also done with the second doctrine. Againe, from the latter part of these words, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the promise made unto them in the former part of this verse, that <hi>sinne shall not have dominion over them, because they are not under the Law, but under grace:</hi> I gather this conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the way to overcome sinne, is to get assurance of the love and grace of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>God, and that it is forgiven them:</hi> the reason why the Apostle promises them <hi>sinne shall not have dominion over them,</hi> is, because <hi>they are not under the Law, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace,</hi> that is, they had assurance of Gods love, and that their sinne is forgiven them: this is proved from that, <hi>Faith purifieth the heart;</hi> and, <hi>You repent and beleeve the Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the reasons hereof are these foure especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it is the meanes to get the spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no sinne is forgiven, which commeth by <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> faith; for it is not recieved by the law, for so saith the Apostle, <hi>Received you the spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Gal.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is the way to make us beleeve the promises, to make us beleeve that wee are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> into a heavenly nature: for when wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the promises are true, that works love in us, and love transformeth us into the divine nature, without which no sinne is overcome.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because hereby wee are able to resist the tentations, which are either for the enjoying of <note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note>

good, or fleeing of evill; so that these promises propound more good than sinne can harme: sinne threatned the losse of outward things, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises propound eternall life, which is better than all things else in the world.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, because we doe delight in God: for when wee doe beleeve in God that our sinnes are forgiven us in Christ, then we looke at God as on a mercifull Father, and then wee cease to delight in the world, and we begin to delight our selves in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The use hereof is, first, for direction, to teach us <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> the way how to heale a sinne, and that is to get as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance that it is pardoned and forgiven; for legall terrours doe not heale a sinne, but it is faith that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the heart, and purifying pacifies it: As a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor will not come in, when hee heares a proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out for his death; but when he heares he shall live, and be pardoned, this makes him to come in: so we, when wee onely fix our eyes upon the legall terrours, shall not heale our sinnes; but when wee beleeve they are pardoned, this heales them.</p>
                  <p>But sorrow and a broken heart are required for <note place="margin">Object.</note> sinners to be assured of their forgivenesse.</p>
                  <p>This sorrow is not so much commanded, but it <note place="margin">Answ.</note> is that whereby God prepareth his servants hearts, to make them see what need they have of pardon, and so they may ask pardon: but the sorrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded is that which followes beliefe; for the more I beleeve the promises, the more I shal grieve for displeasing him.</p>
                  <p>But what is the way to get assurance of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:34997:71"/>
of our sinnes may some say.</p>
                  <p>I answer, That that be <list>
                        <item>done which is to be done on our part,</item>
                        <item>beleeved which God hath promised. <note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, The things to be done on our part, are these:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Confession plainely and truly: we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse them to God, and to man, when we our selves cannot overcome them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Contrition; which is when a man is not stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, and resisteth Gods will, and will please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; to get his heart broken, and to say as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have mee to doe?</hi> and then we are subject to his will. <hi>To him will I looke that is of a contrite heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Desertion, or forsaking of sinne: for, <hi>He that forsaketh not his sinnes, shall not prosper;</hi> which is when we having the like occasions, yet will not give way to him, but follow our owne lusts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That that be beleeved which God hath promised; and that is, that as hee hath said, <hi>He will forgive our sinnes,</hi> upon such and such condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so we beleeve it. And to make us to doe this, these motions may perswade us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because he is mercifull; in whose mercy there are three things, all very materiall and moving. <note place="margin">Motive 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is naturall to him, hee is not weary of shewing mercy: as the eye is not weary of seeing, nor the eare of hearing, no more is God in shewing mercie: but in us it is not naturall, but an infused quality, and therefore wee are weary when men provoke us often.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:34997:71"/>
2. His mercy is infinite; but in men it is not so: therefore come within compasse of this quality, and hee will exercise it; for no sinne is beyond Gods mercy: this keepeth us from despaire: for though they be great, yet God is able to forgive them. As the raine watereth as well the great field as the little garden, and as the Sunne shines as well on mountaines as on Molehills, and as it disperseth the thick mist as well as the least thinne cloud, so doth Gods mercy passe by great sinnes as well as little.</p>
                  <p>But if our sinnes be exceeding great, aggravated <note place="margin">Object.</note> with circumstances, and often committed, then we cannot imagine that God will forgive us. This is <note place="margin">Solut.</note> answered by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah;</hi> God is more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull than man can be sinfull, he is more mercifull than we can imagine: <hi>My thoughts are as much above</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">I say 55 9.</note> 
                     <hi>your thoughts as the heaven is above the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see much mercy in men, and in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a childe: now, it is but as a drop out of the ocean of Gods mercy, but as a spark to the whole element of fire. <hi>If you being evill, can give good things to your children, how much more shall your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi> See what the Scripture saith, <hi>I am merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, forgiving iniquity, transgression and sinne:</hi> the first word signifies originall sinne, the second actuall, the third rebellion; all which God can forgive.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because it is the end of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <note place="margin">Motive 2.</note> into the world: now, no man will doe any thing, especially so great a matter as to kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, for no end: Christ then dyed for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse of sinnes. This S. <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth: the end
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34997:72"/>
of Christs comming was <hi>to save sinners;</hi> otherwise <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 15.</note> the crosse of Christ had beene of none effect, and his mediation of no use, if men did not commit sinnes, or if God should not forgive them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God must needs be ready to forgive.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because God beseecheth us to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled <note place="margin">Motive 3.</note> unto him through Christ: now, if God doth this, if wee seeke earnestly, hee will heare us. The Prodigall being willing to come home to his Father, he met him, and received him joyfully: so doth God, hee chargeth his Ministers to compell men to come in, that is, to preach Gods mercy, that he will forgive their sinnes; and therefore the most acceptable action to God is to bring a sinner to him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the charge laid on us to beleeve: wee are charged on the paine of death to beleeve; and <note place="margin">Motive 4.</note> therefore it is most profitable for us, and most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to him: hee takes it wel at our hands that wee should beleeve, and by the hand of faith lay hold on him; which hee would not doe if he were not ready to forgive.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, from the examples of others; let us see <note place="margin">Motive 5.</note> what God hath done for them, and it will make us beleeve: he forgave <hi>Manasses</hi> as well as <hi>Ioshua,</hi> he pardoned <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> as well as <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> as well as <hi>Peter:</hi> he hath forgiven the greatest sinnes as well as the least, and he will also deale so with us.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, from the effects of it which are these. <note place="margin">Motive 6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It glorifieth God much: <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved, and glorified God much: for the greater the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is, the more honour is given to God: as the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34997:72"/>
Physitian hath the greatest glory by curing the greatest wound: so God hath the greatest glory by forgiving the greatest sins, which wound the soule even to death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It moveth us to love God the more. <hi>Mary</hi> loved much, because much was forgiven her.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It mollifies the most; it causeth them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and weepe much more. This is plaine by that place, where it is said, that when God forgave the greatest sinnes, then they mourned and lamented, as in those Converts, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It purifies the heart: for no man lookes to keepe his heart pure, untill hee be assured of the forgivenesse of his sinnes; for till then hee cannot looke on God as on a Father: but on the contrary, when the sinne is not forgiven, God loseth the glory of being a Father, and the glory of his truth, and of his mercy; and that hardens the heart from relenting.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, from the price which was payed, and <note place="margin">Motive 7.</note> which no sinne can goe beyond: indeed, if Christ had payed but a finite price, wee might feare that our sinnes should not be forgiven. If a man were in debt two thousand pound, and there were but one pay'd, hee might be discouraged: but when there is infinitely more pay'd than the debt is, this should make us beleeve our sinnes are forgiven us whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, seeing they be all but finite.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, from the tenour of the Promises, which <note place="margin">Motive 8.</note> proclaime that they that beleeve and repent, and forsake their sinnes, shall finde pardon for them: as a King that proclaimes that all traytors and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34997:73"/>
shall be pardoned if they would lay downe their weapons. Now, <hi>Non est excipiendum ubi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ex non excipit,</hi> There is no exception to be made where the law makes none. God faith, yea therefore hath said and sworne it, that he will forgive our sinnes, that we may beleeve it.</p>
                  <p>But I have committed the sinne oft. <note place="margin">Object.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet God will forgive thee. <hi>Though thou hast oft committed whoredome, yet I will forgive thee, if thou turne</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>unto me,</hi> saith the Lord, by the Prophet, of the house of Israel, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                  <p>Hence then (to make some use of it) wee may learne not to deceive our selves, to think we are in <note place="margin">Vse</note> the state of grace, when we are not: for if wee did truly beleeve our sinnes are forgiven us, wee would be healed: but if we have the same lusts, and keepe the same company, which we did when wee were not changed, it is a meere delusion, whatsoever we say or think.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the third point too: there yet remaines one more, wherewith wee will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the whole text; and that we may draw from the contrary to what the Apostle here saith; and indeed it is implyed, though not exprest: for if sin have no dominion over them that are not under the law, but under grace: then on the other side must it needs be as true, That <hi>Whosoever is under the law, sinne hath dominion over him,</hi> that is, Hee that refraineth <note place="margin">Doct. 4.</note> sinne onely for feare of the law, and of judgements, sinne hath dominion over him: this is the case of them that refraine sinning onely for feare, and for the salvation of their soules, or for educations sake,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34997:73"/>
which have beene brought up in good families, or such as repent upon some amazement, like the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rushes which hang downe their heads onely while the shower lasts. And that,</p>
                  <p>First, because all such as are not under grace, but <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> under the law, have not received the spirit, which commeth by hearing the Gospell: and no creature can change one creature into another, as lead into gold, or a Wolfe into a Lamb, unlesse it be by Gods spirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to such Gods service is burthensome; and violent motious last not long: they are weary in clambering up an hill: all naturall motions are swifter at the last than at the first; but these are like the Israe ites, who after a time would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>Aegypt</hi> againe.</p>
                  <p>Now then, to end all with the time, let us 1. Be <note place="margin">Vse 1,</note> exhorted not to abstaine from any sinne for feare of punishment, but consider whether thou wouldest serve God for Gods sake, although there were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heaven nor hell: it must be our meat and drink, which men would doe though there were no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for the omission of it. <hi>Blessed is hee that hungreth and thir steth after righteousnesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence we may learne not to deferre repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> till death, sicknesse, crosses, or age comes: then it may be you would not sinne, though with <hi>Balaam</hi> you had your house full of gold and silver: for it's not the abstinence from sinne that God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, but the change of the heart. <hi>Amaziahs</hi> heart was not right though he walked in all the wayes of <hi>David.</hi> There are men that have made a covenant
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34997:74"/>
with hell and death; but God will disanull that covenant, or it will be but equivocall; many have sworne in their sicknesse never to commit sinne again, which afterward they have committed again with greedinesse; many have dyed in the same without repentance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Labour to see your selves doing duties with as much love as you can, and with as little feare, because <hi>perfect love casteth out feare.</hi> And so (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) I have given you a briefe survay of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall points contained in this portion of holy Scripture: wherefore, if you know these things, happy are yee if yee doe them.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth in these words give us a part of a description of wicked men in the latter times: &amp; he bringeth them in by way of prevention or objection, or answer to an objection, as if some should wonder that there should be such kinde of persons in the Church, as hee in the former verses had described; <hi>Covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankfull, unholy, &amp;c.</hi> doe these live as the Church do's?

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34997:76"/>
saith the Apostle, <hi>they doe, wee cannot denie it; only this, They have a forme of godlinesse, but &amp;c.</hi> So that the point of doctrine arising from hence, doth plainly appeare even at the first sight to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>there is a powerfull godlinesse necessary to salvation, and that many have but the</hi> forme, <hi>not the</hi> power <hi>thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, there be three things to be explained in opening of this doctrine, to shew <list>
                           <item>1. What <hi>godlinesse</hi> is.</item>
                           <item>2. What the <hi>power</hi> thereof is.</item>
                           <item>3. The reasons why many have no more but the <hi>form</hi> therof.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the first, that you may the better conceive what <hi>Godlinesse</hi> is, I will first shew you what it is not.</p>
                     <p>First then, it is not bare nature; but that <hi>godlinesse</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> is not.</note> which God requireth of all men, is more then so. God indeed hath commanded nature, yea even cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, to bring forth many fruits of <hi>godlinesse;</hi> as much abstinence from pleasure, much patience, much temperance, and such like, which are all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beautifull in their owne Spheres; but because they come not from God, nor his Spirit of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or because they have no respect of God, therefore they are not <hi>godlinesse,</hi> neither doth God regard them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is not the act of religion proceeding from selfe-love, though offered to God, in regard that men see that God is the governour of the world, that he hath the keyes of heaven and earth, and men may doe much to God for such respects,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34997:76"/>
using him as a bridge to get to heaven by, making themselves their utmost ends: and therefore this is not <hi>godlinesse:</hi> but what is it then, you will say?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is a divine grace infused into the soule <note place="margin">What <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> is.</note> by God, whereby a man followes God, loves him, magnifies him, sets him up in his heart above all, and manifesteth this in his life, and the whole course of it, doing all for him and to him: and it is thus wrought; When the creature comes to see no beauty in himselfe, and no help in himselfe: and sith God is full of all beauty, and all excellencie, and all power, able to answer our desires in every thing; when he comes to see and consider this, then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to set up God in his heart; as the Jvy having no root, cleaves faster to the tree, so likewise doth he only to God, seeing that hee cannot subsist of himselfe; and when hee comes to see that hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on him for all things, he will doe all things for him, because all are from him: whereas before, seeing something in himselfe, hee magnified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and so withdrew himselfe and his heart from God. And so I come to the next particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is meant by the <hi>power</hi> of godlinesse: and <note place="margin">What is meant by the <hi>power</hi> of godlinesse.</note> for that, you shall know there is a godlinesse, which is not only in words and complements, but in deed and truth; for it not only puts upon a man a washie colour of perfection, but dyes his heart in graine in holinesse; and it differs from the other in five things.</p>
                     <p>First, It is done in the <hi>Power,</hi> when it is not the bare picture, where there are not only the outward

lineaments of nature, but when there is life in it; <note place="margin">Five differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betweene the <hi>forme</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</note> and that you shall know when a man needs not to be called on to good duties, but there is a naturall principle of life in him, wherby he doth them with facility and constancie, as naturall actions of life: when likewise he doth grow in them; for where there is life, there is also growth; and when hee doth likewise desire that which may feed it, as the meanes which may strengthen him in the doing of it; as if a man have life, he desireth meat and sleep; and when as there is life, then the works that come from a man, are not dead works, and then you have the power of godlinesse, it is not a fashion only.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is not true, but counterfeit, when it is like the true, but not the same, but wants some particular property that is to be found in the true; as that which is counterfeit Balsame, which is like the true, but wants the power of healing; and so likewise a counterfeit drug, and a counterfeit jewel, which wants that property which the true hath: and the want of this you shall finde in the use, and in the wearing: As a rotten bow is found to be rotten when the arrow is drawne to the head; so if a mans <hi>godliness</hi> be counterfeit, and hee unsound, it will be discovered in the wearing, or in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular case, when he is put to it, or tried. A Jeweller will finde out the property of a Jewell, but an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary man cannot doe it, but by use &amp; the wearing. To instance in some particular parts of <hi>godliness;</hi> the love of God, if it be true, hath these properties, that a man loves the brethren; for how canst thou love an immateriall holinesse in God, if thou lovest not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34997:77"/>
that holinesse which is stampt upon the creature like thy selfe? so likewise rectitude and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart; try it by this property, which our Saviour Christ makes of it, <hi>gracious speeches;</hi> Christ saith, that that which is predominant in the heart, the mouth will be full of: so for keeping of the commandements, if in truth they have this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they be not grievous, they will doe them with a naturall delight, and inward willingnesse: so for taking of Christ by faith, every man beleeveth he doth so, but our Saviour Christ trieth it by this, <hi>Goe sell all that thou hast, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven:</hi> &amp; so mayest thou try thy self when thou art put to it by losse of goods, or credit, or otherwise.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is in the <hi>power,</hi> when it is strong and not weake, when a man hath power and strength in doing good duties: and hereby many are disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, who have good purposes only, which though they be hearty in them for a time, yet they want power and strength; and this is the case of many which be in the Church, who though they have the knowledge of the word of God, and approve the truth in their consciences, desiring to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the practise of it, and so take up many good purposes, which yet come to nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they want power and strength. Consider therefore if thou hast power and strength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thy purposes, and then thou hast the <hi>power</hi> of godlinesse; but not else. Many will say, I am but flesh and blood, and what will you have me to doe? now here wants the power, as you may see in the fifth Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> from the 7. verse
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34997:78"/>
to the 29, the people there said to <hi>Moses, That what the Lord should speake to him, they would doe it;</hi> they said then what they thought, and what they meant and minded, and the Lord saith of them, <hi>O that there were such an heart in them, that they would feare me, and keepe my commandements, &amp;c.</hi> They wanted the <hi>power,</hi> though they had good purposes.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If thou wouldest know whether thy godlinesse be in the <hi>power</hi> or no, see whether thou hast not only the shaddow of it, but the substance; for there is a shaddow with the substance: as if thou pray, there is a formall doing of it, which is as the shaddow; but to pray in the holy Ghost, not in the voyce of thy owne spirit, but out of Gods owne spirit; not out of memory or wit, but out of thy heart, and that an heart sanctified by the Spirit of adoption; this is the substance. And so to heare for knowledge onely, that is the shaddow; but to heare for practise, that is the substance: And so againe, for us to preach the Gospel, to doe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>necessity it laid upon us,</hi> and there's <hi>a woe denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against us if we doe it not,</hi> as saith our Apostle of himselfe, there is the shaddow; <hi>But to preach with power, and authority, and not as the Scribes and Pharises, with the enticing words of mans wisedome,</hi> this is the substance.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly and finally, It is in the <hi>power</hi> when a man goeth thorough the work: a thing is said to be in the <hi>power</hi> when it is effectuall, when a man bringeth it to an end, and doth it not by halves: so some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin indeed, but then they leave the work in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments: but if a man have the power, hee will
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34997:78"/>
break through all difficulties, hee will leape over all till he hath <hi>wrought out his salvation with feare and trembling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus having dispatcht the <hi>two</hi> former parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, I hasten to the <hi>third</hi> and last of the premises, <hi>viz.</hi> The reasons why some have but the <hi>forme,</hi> and not the <hi>power:</hi> and they are especially these.</p>
                     <p>First, because the forme is most easie, but the <note place="margin">Reasons why many men have but the forme.</note> 
                        <hi>power</hi> is a matter of more difficulty: for the former it doth not call upon a man to cut off his <hi>right hand,</hi> to pluck out his <hi>right eye,</hi> and to <hi>denie himselfe</hi> in things nearest and dearest unto him, as the <hi>power</hi> doth; for it requires a man should take paines in good duties, and goe through them, not to omit or slight the least of them in the least measure that may be, or to lie in knowne sinnes; and farther, it requires a man should doe this from day to day, and that when it crosses the flesh most: this is an hard saying, and caused many that they would no longer abide with Christ; they were willing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the <hi>forme,</hi> but not the <hi>power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, because this <hi>power</hi> breeds hatred and opposition in the world, and the world will crosse it againe: now then, when a man may retaine the forme, and hold in with the world, a man may be of the world still, and the world will love his own: whereas the <hi>power</hi> makes men <hi>Antipodes</hi> to all the world; this makes many care for no more but the forme. Fit for this purpose is that place, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 2. 12. where the ungodly say of the righteous on this wise. <hi>These mens lives are contrary to ours, and their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings reprove our thoughts, therefore let us oppresse them:</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:34997:79"/>
and Christ tells us we must look for no other, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>We shall be hated of all men for his names sake;</hi> and it is no easie matter to have all men in contention with us: this then is another reason hereof.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, because it is enough to serve a mans turne for his unregenerate ends: for men having a naturall conscience, whereof they must stop the mouth, and it being injudicious, and not able to judge of the <hi>power of godliness,</hi> they are satisfied with the <hi>forme:</hi> as when Children are wayward and wrangling, because wee know they are not judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, we give them Nutts, not gold or silver to still them, and it serves their turnes as well; so is it here in the naturall conscience, it doth judge the <hi>forme</hi> to be enough to carry a man to heaven; and who would doe more than he needs must?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, because if men have but the <hi>forme of godliness,</hi> Satan troubles them not, nor the flesh: but when men labour for the <hi>power of godlinesse,</hi> and goe on any further than the <hi>forme,</hi> then Satan (knowing this will bring them to heaven) hath the power of hell against them, and hee keepes a great busseling with them to hinder them what hee can: and so doth the flesh too; but it will not resist the <hi>forme,</hi> for that will stand with a mans lusts; but if hee be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided against himselfe, hee cannot endure it; as to denie a friend or a stranger, if he be importunate, is a hard matter; but to denie a mans wife that lyes in his bosome, if shee be earnest, is more difficult; but to denie a mans selfe when he is importunate with himselfe, is most difficult; and yet this you must doe, if you have the <hi>power</hi> of it. Now to denie the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34997:79"/>
                        <hi>power</hi> of it, is when it is laid open to men and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and they with stubbornnesse of will resist and denie it.</p>
                     <p>And so much for the opening of the words: now for the folding of them up againe, and first from the first, what <hi>godliness</hi> is,</p>
                     <p>Let us learne not to deceive our selves, for it is <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> not (as I told you) naturall or morall vertues only, no nor the doing of the actions of religion, a man making himselfe his utmost ends thereof: content not your selves therefore with any thing that is not godlinesse: let mee speake unto you as <hi>Peter</hi> to the dispersed brethren, where after that he had recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up many vertues, <hi>patience, knowledge, temperance, &amp;c.</hi> he bids them add to all these <hi>godliness;</hi> as if hee had said, all the rest are not availeable unlesse you have <hi>godliness</hi> also: see therefore that all these be <hi>godliness,</hi> that is, that they all come from God, and looke to him; for this is the nature of <hi>godliness,</hi> to come to the Wells head, and to search higher than nature, to have another <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of all that is within us, or that comes from us, than what is within us of our selves. And then againe, if we be to preach to others, wee should learne to preach Christ and God, that is, to enforce all as from them and to them; not only to exhort to morall vertues, with such instructions as may be taken out of <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> or <hi>Plutarch</hi> (though these have their use and place) but as out of the Scriptures, let Christ and God come in, and shew you how all doe come from God, and looke to God: and so all you that are hearers, be sure all you doe be <hi>godliness,</hi> that is,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34997:80"/>
comming From God, and tending to him: for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have their denominations from their <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> and from their ends; as that is called <hi>cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> that tends to <hi>heat:</hi> so is that truly <hi>godlinesse</hi> that tends to <hi>God,</hi> and hath respect unto him. Art thou a Student? when thou studiest and takest paines in thy books, see whether thou do'st it for thy selfe or for thy credit, or doest thou make God thy utmost end? examine thy heart, and examine it narrowly: and so likewise you that are exercised in other Callings, doe you doe them that you may doe good to mankinde in them, as a servant that uses his talent to his masters service? then is this <hi>godliness:</hi> so if you eat or drink, or recreate your selves, doe you doe it that you may doe good bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as men whet their sythes that they may mowe the better? then this is also <hi>godliness,</hi> for it tends to God and <hi>godlinesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But you will say, Doe you altogether condemne naturall and morall vertues? must they doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? yes, you shall have this use of them, that they will help as winde to drive the ship; only it is <hi>godliness</hi> is the rudder that guides it, and aymes at the right haven: as for example, you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to love your children, and your wives; you are bound to doe this, if you had no naturall affections in you; only having these affections in you, you doe it with more ease; else you must drive the ship with oares, whereas now the winde fills the sailes, and you doe it with more facility and ease: and so likewise you are bound to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and meeke, and you must be so, though your
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34997:80"/>
natures be not so; but if your natures be so, you may the more easily be so, yet so as <hi>godliness</hi> must set the Compasse, and steere the ship. Morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are like good horses, that draw the Chariot, but <hi>godliness</hi> is the <hi>Auriga,</hi> the <hi>Coachman;</hi> without which, take the most excellent things that nature is capable of, if it be not guided by it, the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards them not; for God regards nothing but that which drawes the creatures unto him; but now <hi>moraell vertues</hi> makes us rest upon our owne bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, and so likewise all things whatsoever they be that beautifie the flesh; for God will have <hi>no flesh to glory in it selfe; but let him that glories, glory in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 29. 30</note> 
                        <hi>the Lord.</hi> Nay, I add more, take the graces of the spirit, wherewith God adornes his Saints, as an husband doth his wife with Jewels, if you magnifie them, you doe so much withdraw your hearts from God: therefore in heaven it is said there is neither Sunne, nor Moone; now what is that? there is no excellencie in any creature that is magnified there, but God is all in all, hee is Sunne and Moone: and therefore in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> it is said, and said to their honour, it is made their worth that they give all to God; <hi>Glory and power be to our God</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 7. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>for ever;</hi> they fall on their faces, throw down their crownes, though created glorious creatures. When the evill Angels began to reflect upon themselves, it was their ruine, they fell from God: for the creature of it selfe is like a glasse without a bottom; if it commeth to stand upon its owne bottome, it falls, and breakes; and so the Angels when they would stand of themselves, they fell downe to the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34997:81"/>
lowest pit: and therefore of all graces, labour for emptying graces, as Faith and Love; for these give all unto God, nothing to mans selfe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are the great graces in religion, which you must chiefly labour for.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, from that there is a <hi>power</hi> in <hi>godlinesse,</hi> if it be such a powerfull thing (as you have heard it <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> is) then this may serve to comfort us in the wayes of it. Wheresoever it is in truth, there it is <hi>in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi> say that thou hast such a light that thou canst not beleeve, that there be such roades as that thou canst not walk by them, yet if thou hast <hi>godlinesse,</hi> thou shalt be able to overcome; for <hi>the kingdome of God consists in power.</hi> When God commeth to dwell in any mans heart, hee sendeth godlinesse into it, which rules in it as a King in his Kingdome; think therefore of it as of Monarchs as <hi>Alexander</hi> was, or those which <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh of, it carries all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, it bringeth every thought into subjection: and therefore also the Spirit is called a <hi>spirit of power;</hi> and if you have <hi>godlinesse,</hi> it commeth from the spirit, and therefore is accompanied with power; and therfore Christ is said to be <hi>full of the holy Ghost,</hi> and of <hi>power;</hi> and so <hi>Stephen,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist;</hi> And grace is said to be a <hi>powerfull</hi> thing: <hi>Be strong in the grace of God, and in the Power of his might.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, the reason why godlines hath <hi>power,</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>God</hi> hath put vertue into it: As when you see such and such an hearb have such a vertue in it to doe such and such a thing, it is because God hath endued it with such a power; and so hath he done with godlinesse. If therefore thou hast any thing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34997:81"/>
to doe in religion, set on it; Hast thou any lust to overcome? set on it, and let mee speake to thee as hee spake to <hi>Gideon, Goe on thou valiant man in the might of the Lord.</hi> The people of <hi>Israel</hi> travelling to the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> saw the Cities walled to heaven, and that the Gyants were there, the sonnes of <hi>Anak;</hi> yet <hi>Ioshua</hi> biddeth them be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and feare not, for the Lord would fight for them, and <hi>deliver their adversaries into their hands:</hi> so, though you see difficulties in the way to heaven: yet godlinesse is a powerfull thing that will carrie you through all: therefore likewise the Apostle having prayed for the Ephesians, that they might <hi>not faint at his tribulations for them, which was their</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 13, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>glory,</hi> but that they might <hi>be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man, to comprehend with all Saints, the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love of Christ wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">Ver. 20 21.</note> 
                        <hi>all that we can aske or think, according to the power that worketh in us, be all glory:</hi> as if hee should have said, God is able to doe it, and that by the power which worketh in him; so suppose to subdue some lust of the flesh, be a thing so hard as you think it wil never be done; nay, you conceive it to be a thing so impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable as that you are asham'd to ask it: yet, <hi>according</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>to that power which worketh in us, he is able to doe above all we ask or think:</hi> and therfore he prayeth <hi>that their eyes may be opened, that they may see the greatnesse of the power that wrought in them;</hi> and it was not that they might see and look at it idly, but for the use to serve their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34997:82"/>
turnes, that they laying hold of it, and using of it, might be able to doe these things which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire should be done, even such things to which a mans nature is as untoward as water is to heat when there is none in it: only, as Christ said to <hi>Mary, Beleeve and you shall see the power of God;</hi> thou must goe to God for it by faith, and God will shew it forth unto you, and you shall have fruits of it. The end of faith is not only to apply the holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of justification, but of sanctification also: as for example, he hath promised to baptize you <hi>with the holy Ghost and with fire,</hi> that is, with zeale &amp; other graces of the spirit, which must give them power and strength; and all, that <hi>sinne might not raigne in their mortall bodies.</hi> Goe to God then and urge him with his promise, and hee cannot denie you. When men therefore think to excuse themselves by saying, I am not able to doe such a thing, what will you have me to do? it is no excuse: for if they were but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, it is all he requireth of them; the <hi>power,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to God; which if men would but beleeve, and go to him, he would undoubtedly give it them.</p>
                     <p>I therefore now ask thee, Wouldst thou turne to God? Wouldst thou overcome such and such a lust of uncleannesse, drunkennesse? &amp;c. be it what it will be: if thou answer, No; then thou art justly condemned, thy blood be upon thy owne head: but if thou sayest, Yes, thou wouldst; then come but to God, be resolute to be religious in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and I will assure thee, hee will vouchsafe thee power to doe it. The Apostle saith, that God <hi>would confirme them unto the end, that they might be blamelesse in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34997:82"/>
the day of the Lord Iesus;</hi> for, saith he, <hi>God is faithfull,</hi> he hath <hi>said,</hi> he hath <hi>promised</hi> it, hee shall break his word if he do not: let me reason it a little with you; Is it not an acceptable request to goe to God with all thy heart, and to say, Lord, I desire but the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> to goe through with thy owne work? Do'st thou think hee will not heare thee? Remember Christ, the only Physician, how ready he was to heale men of their bodily diseases when they came unto him; and hee hath not put off his nature now: Do'st thou think the power of his death &amp; resurrection were but fancies, or a notion? If not, goe on and feare not; for as God said to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> so shalt thou finde him to deale with thee, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And so leaving what I have said, to your further <note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> consideration, I come to a third use, that seeing god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse is such a powerfull thing as you have seene, therefore you would take heed how you deceive your selves with fond desires and purposes, that have no power, no force in them, so as to think that they will serve the turne; no nor yet a few feeble faint endeavours. I say to men that set on religious courses without having their hearts changed, as Christ said unto his Disciples, <hi>Tarrie yee in the Citie,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 49.</note> 
                        <hi>till yee be endued with power from on high:</hi> as if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ should have said, If yee goe presently into the world, yee will not be able to goe through with your works; stay therefore with fasting and prayer till you have received power from on high to carrie you through: for new purposes in a man that returnes to his old nature, are like <hi>new wine in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34997:83"/>
old vessells,</hi> they will break the vessells and be too bigge for your hearts: it is therefore enough to take up now a purpose, and begin to be diligent in your Calling or sanctifying the Sabbath; for, it is impossible these purposes should live in an hart that is carnall: for, as the soyle must be sutable to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature, or else it will not live; so likewise you will never be able to performe these purposes.</p>
                     <p>In the first place therefore labour to get new hearts, as the bottome of these purposes, which <note place="margin">How to get the power of godlinesse.</note> may be as the root to give sap to them; for then they will live and grow in you, when there is a soyle to sute with them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, get power in beleeving. Christ our Saviour, when he came unto his Country, it is said, <hi>He would not put forth his power to work many miracles there:</hi> Why so? one would have thought hee should rather have wrought them there than any where else, both for his owne honour, and the good of his Country-men; no place then was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for that than it: yet there he works few or none, and the reason was, <hi>because of their unbeliefe, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved not:</hi> so that it is the want of faith that holds Gods hands from strengthening you; you will not (I say) beleeve God, who hath sworn (and it is not an idle oath) that hee would grant that wee should <hi>serve him in godlinesse and holinesse all the dayes of our life.</hi> When the widow came to Christ to be healed of the issue which she had many years, it is said that <hi>vertue went out of him to heale her, because she beleeved:</hi> and though it have bin a disease of never so many yeares, yet if he say, <hi>Be ye whole,</hi> it is no matter what

the disease is, so God be the Physician; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beleeve.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, pray, and furnish your selves with all the graces of the spirit: not only goe about things, but maintaine a stock, fill the cisterne every day within, whet and point the graces of God in you; for the inward man every day is subject to decay, as well as the outward man: and doe not take ayme at your selves, or at your strength, when you are in a good mood, or by the present temper; for it vanishes if there be not a supply from day to day from grace within, if you doe not whet your soules every day.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly and lastly, if this be true, that many <note place="margin">Vse 4.</note> are partakers of the <hi>forme</hi> that have not the <hi>power</hi> of godlinesse; that when we come to looke on the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our Churches, we finde the <hi>forme</hi> in many: but if we come unto their dealings and carriages in private, ye shall scarce finde the <hi>power</hi> (it's as rare, as the other is frequent;) in their profession indeed there is a <hi>forme,</hi> but yet ye shall finde religious ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as idle as others, and wives as stubborne as others, husbands and masters as like Lyons in their families, and as false in their dealings as others: if this be true (I say) as it is too true, then <hi>be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, God is not mocked,</hi> but try and examine your selves herein; for the Kingdome of God consists not in <hi>word</hi> but in <hi>power:</hi> the Lord will not judge you according to your intentions and purposes, but according to your works; and it's not he that saith, <hi>Lord, Lord, shall inherit the kingdome of heaven, but hee that doth the will of my Father, &amp;c.</hi> Be not then children
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34997:84"/>
in understanding for to take counters for gold, lay not out your money for counterfeit things, be not fooles to take paines, and yet not have your turnes served. Let me speake unto you as <hi>Iames</hi> doth, <hi>If you say yee have faith, and not works, can your faith save you?</hi> I say, if you have the <hi>forme</hi> of godlines, and not the <hi>power,</hi> will that save you? if you would not be deceived then, examine your selves.</p>
                     <p>First of all, if thou dost more than nature: see <note place="margin">Five marks whereby to know whether wee have the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse or no.</note> that thou beest not the same man thou wast, that thou standest not up in the same troupe thou didst; if thou dost, thou hast no more but the <hi>forme</hi> of godlinesse in thee; for if thou hadst, it would turne thy nature, and add wings unto thee, making thee soare higher than nature: <hi>I am able through Christ that strengthens me,</hi> and that, not to doe some things, but <hi>all things.</hi> He sayes not, I doe purpose or desire, <hi>but, I am able to doe all things; &amp;c.</hi> Those therefore that are able to stand against some lusts that are against their dispositions, but not against all, are weake, and have not this power in them. It may be thou art able to serve God when thou art poore, but what art thou when the world comes in upon thee? thou art able to abstaine from sinnes by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but godlinesse (as wee say of Physick) helps when nature failes: and as a naturall man with his sight sees farre, but with an Optick glasse sees fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; so when nature falls short, Art helps: as though by nature a man may measure or count, yet if he comes to a large piece of ground, or a great summe, Art is required: so though thou mayest doe many things by nature, yet when godlinesse
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34997:84"/>
comes, it helps out in things wherein nature failes: as <hi>Sampson</hi> could doe many ordinary things by his owne strength; but when hee came to take downe or carrie away the gates of a Citie, and to pull downe an house, it is still said, <hi>The spirit of the Lord came upon him, the Lord went with him;</hi> and even so it is here.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, examine whether ye be godly in truth or no; for in Christ there are said to be <hi>dead bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> as well as <hi>living,</hi> that is, those that have the <hi>forme</hi> as well as those that have the <hi>power:</hi> but how are they distinguished? the dead beare no fruit; and therefore as <hi>Iohn</hi> said, <hi>Every tree that bringeth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 15 2.</note> 
                        <hi>not forth good fruit,</hi> God puts the <hi>axe</hi> to it: and so the three grounds did not bring forthfruit. Examine therefore your selves whether ye be full of fruit or no, whether ye abound in good duties or no, and doe them with an honest heart, for thereby the fourth ground is distinguished from all the rest.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, examine whether ye hold out in time of triall or not, whether you are able <hi>to approve your selves with joy,</hi> as the Apostle sayes of himselfe, that he did <hi>when he was in trouble on every side,</hi> on the right hand and on the left, in prosperity and in adversity. The third ground held not out in temptation; and the reason was, <hi>because they had not depth of earth,</hi> that is, they wanted <hi>power,</hi> and an inward stock of <hi>grace,</hi> for that is <hi>depth of earth:</hi> as a man that keeps a great house, if he have not a stock able to supply him, he will soone prove bankrupt, and for a trades-man (as yee say) if he be not diligent in his trade, and follow it well, and make his returnes, he will soon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34997:85"/>
breake; so also when a man wants inward <hi>power,</hi> and an inward stock of graces to beare his daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences out, he will soone become bankrupt.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, every grace hath some property an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, which doth distinguish and difference it from counterfeit, as in <hi>faith unfained, laborious love, patient hope,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, take heed lest some lust overcome all, and so lust overtop all, and be predominant, as the praise of men, or a respect of pleasure; as an Hawk (you see) though shee may soare and flie high, yet she will have an eye to the prey below; and so have hypocrites. See therefore that ye serve God <hi>in singlenesse of heart,</hi> and not <hi>with eye-service,</hi> that you doe not harbour any lust within, for that will spoile all at last: as weeds in a garden, if they be let alone, and not plucked up, will over-runne the hearbs; so is it with sinne; if it be suffered, though it be but a little one at first, yet it will like a leprosie over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread the whole man: and therefore looke to that, that some lust doe not overcome all in the end. And so I end for this text and time.</p>

And in all this Chapter, I finde not a richer and fuller sentence then this which describes to us the <hi>fullnesse</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The parts of it are three.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, this is not a respective but a <hi>diffusive Fulnesse,</hi> that is, <hi>Fulnesse</hi> not shut up in its owne Bankes, but running over for our benefit and use.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of his Fulnesse we have all received,</hi> that is, all that ever had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Grace took it from this heap, drew it from this fountaine.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, these receits are amplified by the variety of them, <hi>Grace</hi> for <hi>Grace.</hi> That is, <hi>Christ</hi> hath given to us for all the Graces which he received of his father for us; Graces answerable, as the Seal is said to give to the Waxe print for print, Character for Character, or as a father is said to give to the sonne lymbe for lymbe, member for member, though not of the same bignesse and measure. In the same sence Christ is said to give to us <hi>Grace</hi> for <hi>Grace.</hi> So that now you see here a full shop, many Buyers or Receivers, chose of wares, or rather to use the Scriptures similitude: A full Table, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Guests, Variety of dishes: <hi>Of his fulnesse we have all received</hi>

[We begin with the first. This <hi>Fulnesse</hi> is attributed to <hi>Christ</hi> in 4. respects. [1. <hi>In regard of his person:</hi> So hee was full. 1. with an <hi>increate Fulnesse:</hi> for as the glory of God filled the <hi>Temple</hi> that <hi>Moses</hi> could not enter in: so the humanity of <hi>Christ</hi> which answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">1. In regard of his person.</note> to that type, was filled not only with the effects of the Diety as then, but with the Diety it selfe, which is therefore said to dwell in him corporally or essentially. [2. Hee was moreover filled with a <hi>Created Fulnesse,</hi> and so hee was said to be full of all divine good things, which <hi>Iohn</hi> reduces to two heads, <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth. Truth</hi> which comprehendeth all the vertues of understanding; And <hi>Grace</hi> which comprizeth all beautiesand perfections of the will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this <hi>Fulnesse</hi> is attributed to Christ in regard of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices [1. as a <hi>Prophet.</hi> He was <hi>full</hi> of all the Treasures of wisedom <note place="margin">2 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>All the <hi>Revelations</hi> which <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> ever had; All the <hi>Visions</hi> which <hi>Esaias, Ieremy,</hi> and the rest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ever saw; <hi>All the mysteries</hi> which ever were declared to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> came from him, they all received their light from this <hi>Sun,</hi> which from the first morning of time shone to the darke world, without setting more or lesse, though the darkenesse comprehended it not. Secondly, hee was <hi>ful</hi> as a <hi>Priest, full</hi> of fauour with God, whence he hath audience, alwais full of <hi>Compassion</hi> to man, whence he is ready to entertaine any suits or Suitors; <hi>full</hi> of merit, whence sure to prevaile in all his requests and Intercessions [3. He was <hi>full</hi> as a <hi>King, full</hi> of authority, all power was given him, in Heaven &amp; in Earth, full of strength and might to defend his Servants, and to resist his enemies till he hath made them his foot-stoole.

                  <p>Fourthly, this <hi>Fullnes</hi> is attributed to him in regard of his <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. In regard of his Effect.</note> Scarce was there ever any action that Christ did, but you shall see a <hi>Fulnes</hi> in it. At the first Miracle that ever he wrought, he filled 6 water-pots with wine, afterwards he filled 5000 guests with 5 loaves and 2 fishes, so that twelve Baskets <hi>full</hi> of broken meates were taken up; So he filled the Netts with fishes till they were ready to breake againe, and which was the best <hi>Fulnes</hi> of all, he filled the Disciples with the holy Ghost in the day of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost, and often afterwards, whence they are said to be full of Joy, and the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>If we would know the Reasons; It is partly in regard of Christ <note place="margin">1. Reasons from Christ.</note> himselfe, hee was the Corner Stone, therefore there is reason hee should be the fairest in all the Building. He was the Prince of our Salvation, therefore it was meet he should be like <hi>Saul</hi> higher than all the people by head and shoulders, farre exalted above all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers.</p>
                  <p>But chiefely it was in regard of us and our <hi>emptinesse,</hi> that with his <hi>Fulnes</hi> hee might replenish our Vacuity, otherwise wee could <note place="margin">2. From our selves</note> neither have seen him nor received of him. Not have seene him, for the glorious Beauty of his Godhead was too bright for our eyes to behold. It was therefore reason that it should be put into the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne, or Vaile of <hi>Christs Humanity,</hi> that in that we might behold it. Nor could we have received of it, for the <hi>Diety</hi> is an <hi>Inacces. sible Fountaine;</hi> It was reason therefore that <hi>Christs Humanity</hi> should be the Cesterne or Conduit-Head to receive it for our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell and use.</p>
                  <p>But here one Question must bee answered. <hi>Steven</hi> and other Saints are said in Scripture to be full of the Holy Ghost, and how <note place="margin">Quest.</note> differs this from the <hi>Fulnesse of Christ?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, first they were said to be <hi>full according to their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ out of measure,</hi> as a little Dish may be said to be full as well as the Ocean. So they were said to be <hi>full,</hi> because filled accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the narrownes of their present Capacity. But Christ was full according to all dimensions, length, breadth, and depth of <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in them there was <hi>Plenitudo Vasis;</hi> In Christ, <hi>Plenitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34997:89"/>
fontis,</hi> that is, there was in them a derived participated <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> but in Christ there was a <hi>Fulnes</hi> like the <hi>Fulnes</hi> of a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine springing from himself, which is well expressed by the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, when they say, that the <hi>Fulnes</hi> of the Saints and of Christ dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as <hi>Ignis</hi> and <hi>Ignita,</hi> the one like Torches kindled, the other like Fire it selfe, for the <hi>Fulnes</hi> of the Ocean is too little to expresse this; For if you take a drop or two from it, it is so much lessened, rather the <hi>fulnes</hi> of the fire, which lights a thousand Torches, yet is not it selfe diminished.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in them there was a Comparative <hi>Fulnes. Steven</hi> was said to bee <hi>Full</hi> in regard of other lesser Saints; But in him there was an absolute <hi>Fulnes</hi> without all limits, without all comparison.</p>
                  <p>What shall we now deduce hence for Application to our selves?</p>
                  <p>First, that which is also the Scope of the Evangelist in this place; This should <hi>invite us to come to Christ, and to take of this full heape.</hi> This Incentive <hi>Paul</hi> often uses to inflame the desires of the Gentiles to come to Christ, even the Riches of that <hi>fulnes</hi> which is in him, which in the <hi>fulnesse</hi> of time began to be exposed to all Commers, as he saith, hidden before, but now fully revealed; seen before but in Types and Shadowes, now with open face; before preached but to a few, now to every Creature under Heaven; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit was given but by drops, but now <hi>he that hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended on high, and led Captivity Captive,</hi> hath so given gifts to men, that he hath filled all things.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore be exhorted when we heare of such a <hi>fulnesse,</hi> not to take the <hi>Grace of God in vaine,</hi> but labour we to have our part in it, that as those Corinthians, we may be <hi>made rich in Christ filled with all knowledge and every grace.</hi> Content not your selves therefore to know this onely, for that is our common fault to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selves with the Notions of such things without practise.</p>
                  <p>But go to Christ as Bees to a meadow that is <hi>ful</hi> of flowers, as Merchants to the Indies that have <hi>full</hi> Mines, that you may expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally find your selves returning from him <hi>full</hi> fraught with the Treasures of Truth and Grace.</p>
                  <p>In other things fullnes invites us much; <hi>Ioseph's full</hi> Barnes in Aegypt, drew <hi>Iacob</hi> and his Sons thither: <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Land <hi>Ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> flowing with milke and honey, and that invited the <hi>Israelites</hi> to secke it: <hi>Solomons</hi> abundance and <hi>fulnesse</hi> of wisedome, caused the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34997:89"/>
Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> to come out of the South to his Court. In every thing fulnes doth much allure and affect us. The Covetous man though he spend but little, yet he desires to take it from a full heape, as he saies <hi>De pleno tollere acervo.</hi> How much more then should this fulnes of Christ worke on us, especially since there is in him not onely a repletive but a diffusive fulnes; not onely plenty, but also bounty? But alas, if we looke upon the waies and actions of men, we shall find that men seeke a fullnesse in every thing else, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, a fulnesse in pleasure and delights, a fulnesse in honour and preferments; But this full <hi>Honey Combe</hi> is almost every where despised, but happy hee, the bent of whose heart God hath turned the right way to seeke a fullnes of Faith and Wisedome, and a fulnesse of the Holy Ghost, who cares not though he be empty of any thing else, so hee bee full of these? though a looser in other things, so a Gainer in these. Such a one hath chosen the better part which shall never be taken from him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If there be a Fulnes in Christ, we should answer it with fulnes of affection on our parts, fully beleeve and trust in him, fully love and adore him, fully delight in him, for it is reason the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be answerable to the <hi>Object.</hi> A little excellency desires little love and esteeme; more excellency more love, but wher there is a fulnesse of al excellencies, that we shold procecute with fulnes of all our affections. All the excellency in the Creature in comparison of this, is but as a drop to the Ocean, and a sparke to the whole Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire. Therefore if we proportion our affections to the object, which ought to be the Rule and square of them, we should bestow on the Creature but a drop of love and delight, but the full streame of our affections should be carried to him, in whom is the <hi>fullnesse</hi> of all perfection. It is true indeed, that as men hide treasure from theeves under straw or baser covering, so God hides this ful excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie from the world under a base outside, that his secret ones only might find it out, and others seeing, might not see, but stumble at it. Thus he hid Christ himselfe under a Carpenters sonne, so hee hides Divine Misteries under the meane Elements of Bread and Wine, so the wisedom of God is hidden under the foolishnesse of preaching: and under Sheep-skins and Goat-skins, as the Apostle speakes, were hidden; and such as the world is not worthy of, yet there is such a <hi>fulnes</hi> of excellency notwithstanding: for if ever wee saw
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34997:90"/>
beauty in Sun, Moone, Stars, men, women, &amp;c. Or if ever wee found delight in musicke, meates, drinks, friends, &amp;c. All must needs be more abundantly in God, who is the Author, Maker, &amp; giver of all these; As <hi>Solomon</hi> reasons; <hi>He that made the eye, shal not he see,</hi> so he that made all these things, shall he not have them eminently in himselfe, for as the worth of many peeces of silver is comprized in one piece of gold, so all the petty excellencies which are scattered abroad in the Creatures, are all united in God, yea the whole volume of perfections, which is spread through heaven and earth, is epitomized in him; Why do we not then with <hi>Paul,</hi> tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the Pompe and Glory of the world, for the excellent knowledg of Christ? Why do we not with <hi>David,</hi> turn away our eyes, hearts, and affections from beholding vanity, and pitch them all on him? Why do we not re-collect our selves, and gather up our affections and thoughts, which are scattered and busied about a thousand trifles, and bestow them all on him, in whom is the <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of all excellency, beauty, and perfection?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if there be a <hi>fulnesse</hi> in Christ, then let us be <hi>content with him,</hi> having our hearts filled and satisfied with him.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>in regard of spiritual things.</hi> Goe we not to the brookes of <hi>Teman,</hi> the broken Cesterues, and Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ers packs of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Saints, Merrits, Churches Treasury, &amp;c. For if there be a <hi>fulnes</hi> in Christ, hat needs not, <hi>for in him we are all compleat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, for Temporal things let us be <hi>content with him alone,</hi> for he is our fullnesse even in them also, for the better conceiving of this, we must know that the first <hi>Adam</hi> brought a generall Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse through all the world, for though the world be full of pomps and pleasures, as <hi>Iohn</hi> calls them, Lust of the flesh, Lust of the eye, &amp;c. yet it is properly empty, because not full of that it should bee: even as we say a well is empty, though it be full of ayre, because it is not full of water which should be in it: for Emptinesse is not so much, <hi>Absentia Entitatis</hi> as <hi>absentia Entitatis debitae.</hi> Hence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not onely the hearts of men, but the creatures are said to bee empty, hence <hi>Solomon</hi> saith <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> the 1. Chapter, <hi>Vanity of Vanities, all is but vanity,</hi> that is emtine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts of men are not satisfied with the world, but as the Prophet speaks: <hi>They eat and are not filled, they drink,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34997:90"/>
and behold their soule is empty,</hi> because the Creature is now but as the huske without the graine, the shell without the kernell, full of nothing but emptinesse, and being empty in it selfe, cannot give us satisfaction; But Christ the second <hi>Adam</hi> hath filled all things againe, <hi>Epes.</hi> 1. last verse. <hi>He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ls all in all things,</hi> that is, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hearts of men, but the things also. It is the <hi>Newter Gender.</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Hence we may observe, that many finde a want in the midst of plenty, their hearts finde no rest or satisfaction in al they enjoy, but with the holy Regenerate man it is much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, though he have but a little wealth, a little food and rayment, yet there is a secret <hi>fulnesse</hi> put into that little which makes it fit to give him satisfaction, which is the meaning of that of the Psalmist, <hi>Psal. 37, 16. A little thing to the Righteous, is better then great riches to the wicked,</hi> because in that little it being filled with the blessing of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> they finde a <hi>fulnesse,</hi> whereas the wicked finde an emptinesse in the midst of their greatest a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If there be a <hi>fulnesse</hi> in Christ, then what though there be a <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Vse 4.</note> 
                     <hi>of sin and guilt in us,</hi> yet there is a <hi>fulnes of Grace in him</hi> able to remove it, and take it away. A <hi>fulnes of mercy</hi> to receive our Supplications, a <hi>fulnes of merit</hi> to make an Attonement for our foulest sins, a <hi>fulnes of Favour</hi> to prevaile with his Father in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny requests. If therefore there be a <hi>fulnes of grace</hi> in Christ, as there is, be not discouraged, though thy sins abound, yet his <hi>Grace</hi> abounds much more, they cannot be so out of measure sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as he is out of measure merciful. Remember but the two Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors used in Scripture, <hi>I wil scatter your sins as a mist, and they shal be drowned in the bottom of the Sea.</hi> Now the Sun by reason of its great force can scatter the thickest mist, aswel as the least va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour: The Sea by reason of its great Vastnes can drowne moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, aswel as molehils; So Christ by reason of that Vast <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Grace</hi> which is in him, is as able, yea as forward and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to forgive the greatest sins aswel as the least, I say as forward and willing for mercy, though it be a quality in us, yet it is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in God: Now what is natural, there is no unwillingnesse or wearinesse in doing that, as the eye is not weary with seeing, nor the eare weary with hearing; Therefore though our sins be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so great and many, yet if this condition be observed, that wee
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34997:91"/>
lie in no knowne sin, that we have a ful and resolute purpose, God bearing witnesse to our consciences, not to doe the least evil, nor omit the least good, in a word that wee make our hearts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to God in al things, for without this conditon there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins. But if this condition be observed, I say that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our sinnes be never so great any many, yet they are not gone beyond the price which hath beene paid for them, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Grace</hi> of him with whom we have to doe, for there is a <hi>fulnes</hi> in him.</p>
                  <p>Now I beseech you take not this Exhortation in vaine, for there is nothing more effectual to heale a rebellious disposition, to instil saving <hi>Grace,</hi> to cause a finner to change his course, then to be fully perswaded that he shal be received to mercy, and that his sins shalbe forgiven in Christ: Even as the Theese, while <note place="margin">Simile.</note> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Therefore let this <hi>fulnesse</hi> of mercy in Christ be an effectuall motive to us all, to come in to lay down the armes of Rebellion, to choose God for our good, and to give up our selves wholly to him, to serve him with perfect hearts &amp; willing minds, all our dayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So much for the first part.</hi>

                  <p>The second part I wil as briefely dispatch, and not meddle with the third, left I be tedious.</p>

                     <hi>Of his Fulnes weo have al received</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHence the second Point is <hi>[That al Grace is received]</hi> For as al Stars shine in the light of the Sun; So doe al the Saints through <hi>grace received.</hi> What else distinguished <hi>Iohn</hi> from <hi>Iudas Simon Peter,</hi> from <hi>Simon Magus?</hi> but onely Christ, who shone upon one, and not upon another, when they sate both alike in darknesse, and in the shadow of death.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture is evident for this, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. The <hi>Deed</hi> is wrought in us by God, and not the <hi>deed</hi> onely, but the <hi>Wil</hi> also

which produces that <hi>deed,</hi> nor that onely, but the <hi>thought</hi> also which begat that <hi>wel. For we are not able so much as to thinks a good thought of our selves.</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. So that al <hi>grace,</hi> yea al preparation to <hi>grace,</hi> and ability to accept <hi>grace</hi> are al from God: contrary to what <hi>Arminius</hi> affirmeth: and not of our selves, and that for theise reasons.</p>
                  <p>Because <hi>nothing can worke beyond the Spheare of us owne reach,</hi> the eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ct exceedeth not the Cause, therefore it is impossible for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature either to beget Supernatural <hi>grace,</hi> or to doe any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preparing, or bending, or inclining the wil to it: For as the water cannot heate (which is an Action above the nature of it) until an higher principle of heat be first infused into it; no more can meere nature doe any thing tending to saving <hi>grace,</hi> having no principle in it selfe whence it can raise it. <note place="margin">Objecti.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if it be objected (as it is by the <hi>Arminians)</hi> that though <hi>Grace</hi> doe al, yet to accept or reject it, to wil or nil it, is natural to man as a free Agent.</p>
                  <p>I answer; that to wil, is natural, but to wil wel, is supernatural, and must rise from a higher wel-head than nature is. For as an hatchet wil cut when handled but with a common hand, but not make a chaire, or stoole, or any Artificial thing except it have <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluentiam Artificis quatenus Artifex,</hi> the influence of an Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer as he is an Artificer; So though to wil be natural, yet, to wil wel, to doe a supernatural worke in a supernatural and holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it cannot except it have the influence of a supernatural Agent to direct and guide it.</p>
                  <p>If a man might accept <hi>Grace</hi> or refuse it, as he would. God were not God, because he might be crossed by his creature, and his own wil should not absolutely beare rule, especially in that great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of beleiving, and not beleeving, and in putting difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and man in the matter of Salvation and Damnation: For according to <hi>Arminius,</hi> though God did heartily desire the conversion of such a man, and offered him al the meanes of <hi>Grace</hi> that could be, yet it is stil in the free choise of his wil to convert, or not to convert; Their onely answer here is, that seeing God hath made a Decree, that man shal be a free Agent, though he doe most earnestly desire the conversion of such and such men, yet because he cannot disa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ul his Decree, he doth, and must leave it to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34997:92"/>
of the Creature to doe contrary to even that himselfe desires. But what is this else but to put God into such streights as <hi>Darius</hi> was in, who would faine have saved <hi>Daniel,</hi> but because of his Decree he could not? And if griefe in Spirits and Angels be but <hi>Renisus volunt at is,</hi> a reluctancy of the wil, as the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, what is this else but to attribute griefe unto God, and so to detract from his Blessednesse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if all <hi>Grace</hi> be not received, but a man may accept it or reject it as he will, how can it be solved, but that a man must <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and boast partly in himselfe,</hi> contrary to <hi>Paul's</hi> rule, and not <hi>wholly in the Lord,</hi> for aske the question of all that are saved, what is the reason that you are saved rather then another, their answer must needs be; I out of the liberty of my owne will, did receive and use well the <hi>Grace</hi> offered, when another did not. So that according to <hi>Arminius,</hi> the Saints in heaven are not a jot more beholding to God then the damned in hel, for the offering of <hi>Grace</hi> on Gods part, was a like common to both, only he that is in heaven, may thank his own wil that he chose it, when onother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused it.</p>
                  <p>They have nothing here to answer, but onely that the meanes of <hi>Grace</hi> are dispenced by God with some disparity; But what is that when they maintaine such freedome of wil, that he who hath the greatest meanes may reject grace, and he who hath the least, may accept it?</p>
                  <p>Other reasons there are, but that I hasten: as that <hi>Grace is not Grace without being received,</hi> no more then a man can be a man without reason, or a gift can be a gift without being given, for no lesse doth it imply contradiction to suppose it to be a <hi>grace,</hi> &amp; yet not to be freely bestowed by God, and received by us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, bowing of the will is an effect of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> is an effect of the spirit. Now the spirit breaths, when, where, &amp; in what measure it listeth. Againe, if <hi>grace</hi> should spring out of our so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The first shewes us the errors of <hi>Arminius,</hi> who hath but refynedl the old Pelagianisme, a dangerous errour: for Arrianisme was like a land flood that overflowed the whole world, but was soone dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up againe, because it had not a spring to maintaine it, but the best ages of the Church had in them as he called. <hi>Multas fibras virulentiae Pelagianae,</hi> because it is an errour agreeable to nature &amp; reason, so that we have a spring within our own breast to nourish and maintaine it. But now to keep close to the point in hand, this point sheweth the error of <hi>Arminius</hi> and <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who ascribe the beginning, preparations, and ability of accepting <hi>grace</hi> to our own free will, although the complement to God. Whereas you see by what hath been said, that not only the fuller streames, but every drop of <hi>grace,</hi> is received from his <hi>fulnes.</hi> This errour proceedes from their not distinguishing aright betwixt acquisite habits and infused, indeed in the acquisite, the acts goe before the habits, and prepare for them, but with infused habits it is clean contrary; It is with them as it is with the naturall powers of the soule, wee have first the faculty of seeing before we doe see, and the faculty of hearing before wee doe heare, so it is in infused habits, we have first the habits before we exercise the operations of them, for even as the wheele doth not run that it may be made round, but it is first made round that it may run, so the heart doth not first do the actions, whereby it is put into a right frame, but it is first fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned and made a new Creature by <hi>grace,</hi> and then it doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and brings forth fruits worthy amendment of life, for what is said of the soule, is as truly said of <hi>Grace,</hi> it doth, <hi>Fabricari Sibi Domicilium,</hi> prepareth a room for it selfe, useth no Harbenger, for nothing can prepare for <hi>grace,</hi> but <hi>grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if it be objected, as <hi>Arminius</hi> doth in his book upon the 7. <note place="margin">Object.</note> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that such as <hi>Senecae</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> were much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, did approve the law of God according to the inward man, and had a kind of universall common <hi>grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, that this priviledg cannot be denyed to many among <note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So though they fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the right end, the glory of God, yet they were not destitute of many excellent common gifts, wherein though one did go farre beyond another, as <hi>Seneca</hi> beyond <hi>Nero,</hi> and so others, yet as they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34997:93"/>
say of sins, they do all alike passe the rule of rectitute, though some goe further beyond than others, so were they al alike destitute of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Righteousnesse, although some more elongated from it than others, al are alike dead in sins, though some (as dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) more corrupted and putrified than others.</p>
                  <p>And if it be objected, as it is by <hi>Arminius,</hi> to what end then <note place="margin">Object.</note> are Exhortations and Threatnings, the propounding of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Rewards, if it be not in our power to accept <hi>Grace,</hi> &amp; refuse it as we wil.</p>
                  <p>I answer, that as the raine although it fal aswel upon Rockes and Heathes, as upon Vallies and Fruitfull places, yet no man as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note place="margin">Answ.</note> to what end is the first and latter raine; So Exhortations &amp; Admonitions though they fal aswel upon the Reprobates, and those that are desperately wicked, as upon those that are docible and capable of better things, it is to no lesse folly to aske to what end they are, seeing as the raine, so they are to many beneficial and useful.</p>
                  <p>So much for the first Corollary, which serves to rectifie Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>The next is for Practise. If al <hi>grace</hi> be received, then <hi>deferre not repentance,</hi> for no repentance is accepted, but what proceeds <note place="margin">Corol. 2.</note> from a <hi>Sanctifying grace,</hi> and that as you see is received, that is given by God as he wil. <hi>It is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but he hath compassion on whom he wil have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, and whom he wil, he hardeneth,</hi> Rom. 9. 15. As I said before, the Spirit breatheth where, and when it listeth. Therefore we should as Millers, and Mariners are wont to doe, who take the Gale when it commeth, because they know the winds are not at their command: Suppose a man were to passe the Seas within 20 dais upon pain of death, if the wind should blow the second day, third day, or fourth day, no wise man would omit the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, because he knowes the winds are not in his power; So, if the spirit shal breath into our hearts good motions of turning to God unfainedly in our youth,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at 16. 17. or when ever, it is the greatest wisedome in the world to take the opportunity, and not to put it off, who knoweth whether they wilbe had againe or no: How many thousand are now in Hel who thought to have repented, and did not because they neglected those breathings of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34997:93"/>
the Spirit where they were offered? For there are certaine accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table times, after which God offers <hi>Grace</hi> no more: happy he that <hi>knowes that day of his visitation,</hi> and as our Saviour speaketh, <hi>the things which belong to his Peace,</hi> in that his day, which <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> did not, which made Christ to weep over it, and which <hi>Saul</hi> did not: and the Jewes in <hi>Ieremiah's</hi> time did not, when God forbad <hi>Ieremy</hi> to pray for them. For as there were certaine times when the Angell moved the waters in the poole of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> and he that then stepped in, was healed; so there are certaine accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble times, wherein God troubles the hearts of men by his spirit. Happy is he who then steps into a good course, that he may be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Salvation. I say there are certaine times, wherein God doth (as it were) thaw and soften the frozen hearts of men. And it is wisedome then with the husband-man to put in the plough, while the ground is soft: for the heart in such a case is like iron in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, easily fashioned, but stay till it be cold, and it will not be wrought upon. I beseech you therefore let us be exhorted to take the opportunity, and not be like to those whom <hi>Isayah</hi> complaines of, <hi>who like bulr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If a man would sit downe and call his thoughts together but for one half hour, and consider this seriously, I have but a little time to live here, it is another place where I must live for all eternity, and it shall be with me for all this eternity, as I spend this short time. I say if this were thoroughly considered, I wonder that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing else should take up the intentions and thoughts of a mans heart, but only how to make sure his salvation. But alas we are robbed of our selves through worldly delights, and doe <hi>magno conaru, magnas nugas agere,</hi> and so we spend our lives. But if we would not have with the Merchant, <hi>Fortunam rudentibus ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But wee mistake repentance, and that is the cavse we defer it, it is not as it is commonly thought, a sorrow for our sinnes onely, nor a n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34997:94"/>
a man may doe out of the strength of naturall wisedome, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for his owne safety, but it is a much different thing, <hi>viz.</hi> putting life into a dead man: <hi>Ephesians</hi> 2. 1. Making a man a new Creature, 2 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 5. 17. A change of the whole frame of the heart. As if another soule dwelt in the same body, as he saith; <hi>Ego non ego.</hi> In a word, when a man is cleane another man, then he was serving of God out of an inward propensnesse and having the whole bent of his disposition turn'd to delight in the Law of God without these by-respects. And that this may yet be made clearer, and put out of all doubt, I would aske but this question; That repentance which men take up in age, or in times of extreamity, whence proceedeth it, if from selfe love, as it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually doth in such cases, because the soule is then strongly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with an apprehension of death and hell, and another life, then there is no more then nature in it, for the streame riseth not higher then the fountaine. A beast would doe as much, which sinking into danger, would struggle to save it selfe. But if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from love to God, why was it not done sooner, why not in the flowre of our youth, yea when it is done soonest, would we not be heartily sorry that it was not done sooner, if it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of love to him. And if it thus proceed out of an holy love to God, it cannot arise but from his holy spirit: the breathings of which spirit as they are most free, so are they most pretious. Therefore when such a sparke is kindled in our hearts, let us bee carefull to put fuell to it, and not suffer it to goe out againe.</p>
                  <p>Al the Creatures in Heaven and Earth cannot helpe us againe to them, yea the best Ordinances are but as pens without inke, or empty Conduit-pipes which give not a drop of true <hi>Grace.</hi> except <hi>Christ</hi> who is the Fountaine please to conveigh it by them. You know the Famous Story of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> what bitter cryes hee used upon his Death-bed: O that I had but one drop of <hi>Faith!</hi> One of the motions which I have beene wont to have, but yet could not have them! But died with those desperate words in his mouth, <hi>I am Damned.</hi> Therefore let us take heed how we let such motions rise up like bubbles in us, and breake againe; or goe our like sparkes upon wet tinder, lest often checking, and snibbing, and <hi>quenching the Spirit,</hi> in the end we be guilty of <hi>resisting the Holy Ghost,</hi> and <hi>God shal sweare in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34997:94"/>
his wrath that we shal not enter into his rest.</hi> [Where by the way observe, that this Doctrine teacheth us not to be idle, and leave al to God, as they slander it] but as <hi>Paul</hi> maketh the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, because <hi>God worketh in you both the wil and the deed, therefore worke out your Salvation with feare and trembling. Arminius</hi> contrarily, ourselves worke in our selves the <hi>Wil,</hi> and the <hi>deed;</hi> Therefore we need not worke out our Salvation with any such feare and solicitude, since we may d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e it at our owne pleasure and leisure.</p>
                  <p>But it wil be said this is a hard case, although a man would repent, yet he cannot: though he desire to serve God, yet it is impossible. Therefore to take away this Scruple, we must know that God is exceeding free and open-handed in giving <hi>grace</hi> (if it may be taken in time) and if we wil not believe it, <hi>Iohn</hi> commeth here and telleth you, <hi>I have received of his Fulnesse,</hi> and not onely I, but al we have received, that is, al other Saints that either are, or have beene: and since <hi>Iohn's</hi> time, many thousand thousands: And shal not such a Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses perswade us? If a Beggar doe but heare of an open House kept; or a great Dole, it affects him, and invites him to goe: But when he sees many come from it with armes-ful, and laps<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and baskets-ful, then he is confident: that addeth wings to him; So if a sick man doe but heare of a Famous Physitian, or a healing Wel, it stirs him up to goe and try: But when he meets with 100 and 1000 comming from the Wel, and telling him, I have beene there and am healed, I have beene there, and am made whole, then he maketh no question; So doth <hi>Iohn</hi> here, <hi>Al we have received of his Fulnesse:</hi> Like a Bird that hath found out a <hi>ful</hi> heape and calls his fellowes to it. Say not therefore, oh my sinnes are so great, and my wants are so many: But rather thinke thus with your selves, if there was <hi>grace</hi> inough for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, there is surely inough for me: Onely you must receive when it is offered <hi>in the acceptable time,</hi> lest often grieving the Spirit, God suffers <hi>his Spirit to strive no longer.</hi> Gen. 6, 3. But (as I said before) <hi>sweare in his wrath that you shal not enter into his rest.</hi>

                  <p>But as I said before of the lawfulnesse, there is little question. That which is chiefely to be reprehended, is of a secret disesteem of publique prayers?

One thing there is, which if it were well considered, would breed in the hearts of men another esteem of our publique prayers then there is.

Againe it is objected, that we cannot pray for occasionall neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities. Therefore we bind not only to a set forme: but men may, and ought to use besides, private prayer, wherein we may expresse our private, accidentall, and particular occasions. And if they be more publique, there are prayers before and after Sermon, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>blike prayers, as it is in the <hi>Gun-powder-treason, times of War, dearth, &amp;c.</hi> But there needs not much be said to convince the judgement: that which is chiefely to be desired, is, that they may be better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and more esteemed, especially seeing our publique prayers be holy and good, (and which should be a greater inducement) the Church hath commanded them: And if the Church be to be obeyed in indifferent things, as it is, much more in appointing of Gods owne Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>And if a set forme of prayer bee lawfull, then the Lords Prayer must needes excell, being dedicated by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and is therefore to bee more frequently used, and withall Reverence both in minde and gesture. Nor doth this want the practise and approbation of the Auncient, it is <hi>Cyprians</hi> speech. <hi>Quanto efficacius impertramus quod peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Christi nominae si ipsius Oratione petamus.</hi> And Saint <hi>Augustine.
