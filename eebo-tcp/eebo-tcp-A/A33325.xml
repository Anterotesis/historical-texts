         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Life and Death of EDVVARD
Surnamed, The Black Prince.</head>
            <p>THIS <hi>Edward</hi> was the eldest Son of that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
Prince, King <hi>Edward</hi> the third:
His Mother was the fair <hi>Philippa,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Henault</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi>
who was delivered of this her first born Son at
<hi>Woodstock,</hi> July 15. Anno Christi 1329. and in the
third year of his Fathers Reign. He was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Duke of <hi>Aquitain</hi>
and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Chester.</hi> He was also
Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> in right of his Wife <hi>Joan,</hi> (the most
admired Beauty of that Age,) Daughter of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>
Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> Brother by the Fathers side to
King <hi>Edward</hi> the second.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> was very solicitous in the Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this his Son, and provided him choice Tutors,
to train him up both in Arts and Armes: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
others <hi>Walter Burley,</hi> a Doctor of Divinity,
brought up in <hi>Merton</hi>-Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> who
wrote many excellent Treatises in Natural and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Philosophy,</hi> for his great Fame in Learning, had
the Honour to be one of the Instructers of this hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Prince.</p>
            <p>When he was but 15 years old, his Father King
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56426:3"/>
               <hi>Edward</hi> passing over into <hi>France</hi> with a great and
gallant Army, took this his Son along with him,
making him a Souldier, before he was grown to be
a Man: But (it seems) he longed to try what Metal
his Son was made of in the bud; and haply he was
loth to omit any thing that might give countenance
and credit to this Battel, wherein two Kingdoms
were laid at the stake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1345. our King <hi>Edward</hi> was upon
the Sea in a Fleet of above a Thousand Sail, and
landed in <hi>Normandy:</hi> His Land-Forces were about
two Thousand five Hundred Horse, and his Foot
thirty Thousand, most of them Archers. Making
pittifull havock in <hi>Normandy,</hi> he marched up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to the very Walls of <hi>Paris. Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
King had not slept all this while, but had raised and
brought together one of the bravest Armies that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>France</hi> had seen, consisting of about a Hundred
or sixscore Thousand fighting men.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward,</hi> loaden and rich with Spoils, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not unwilling to retreat. But they were now in
the heart of their Enemies Country, between the
two good Rivers of <hi>Sein</hi> and <hi>Some:</hi> And it was
judged meet by our King to seek a passage out of
these straits: and this Enquiry was interpreted by the
enemy to be a kind of flight, and King <hi>Edward</hi> was
willing to nourish this conceit in them.</p>
            <p>The River of <hi>Some,</hi> between <hi>Abeville</hi> and the Sea,
was at low-water fordable, and Gravelly ground,
whereof our King was informed by a <hi>French</hi> Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
whom they had taken. But the <hi>French</hi> King
(well acquainted with his own Country) had set a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56426:3"/>
Guard upon that Pass of a Thousand Horse, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
six Thousand Foot, under the Conduct of one
<hi>Gundamar du Foy,</hi> a <hi>Norman</hi> Lord of special note. King
<hi>Edward</hi> coming to this place, plunges into the Ford,
crying out, <hi>He that loves me, let him follow me,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
either to pass or die. These words, and
such a President, so inflamed his Army, that the
passage was won, and <hi>du Foy</hi> defeated almost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was fought with (the incomparable courage
and resolution of the <hi>English</hi> appaling him) and
carried back to King <hi>Philip</hi> sewer by two Thousand
then he carried with him, besides the terror which
his retreat brought along with it: And if the <hi>English</hi>
were before unappaled, now much more they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to live and die with such a Sovereign.</p>
            <p>Now was King <hi>Edward</hi> neer unto <hi>Crescie</hi> in the
County of <hi>Ponthieu,</hi> lying between the Rivers of
<hi>Some</hi> and <hi>Anthy</hi> (a place which unquestionably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to him in the right of his Mother) where he
was carefull to provide the best he could for his
safety and defence. King <hi>Philip,</hi> being enraged for
the late defeat, precipitates to the Battle (wherein
the Great and Just God intended to scourge the Pride
and sins of <hi>France)</hi> being the rather induced thereto
by his confidence in his numerous and gallant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
who were ready to tread upon one anothers
heels, till the view of the <hi>English</hi> Colours and
Battel put them to a stand.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward,</hi> having called upon God for his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Aid and Assistance, full of Heroick Assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
without the least perturbation, divided his
Army into three <hi>Battalia</hi>'s. The first was disposed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56426:4"/>
into the forme of an Hearse, where the Archers stood
in the Front, and the Men of Arms stood in the
bottom; And this was led by the Young Lion of
<hi>Wales,</hi> our brave Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> to whose Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
the King joyned some of his Prime and most
experienced Captains; as <hi>Beauchamp</hi> Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,
Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Harecourt;</hi> the Lords, <hi>Thomas
Holland, Richard Stafford, John Chandois, Robert Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
La'ware, Bourchier, Clifford, Cobham, &amp;c.</hi> And
many other Knights and Gentlemen, to the number
of eight hundred men at Arms, two thousand Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and a thousand Welch-men. In the second
were the Earles of <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Arundel,</hi> the
Lords <hi>Rosse, Willoughby, Basset,</hi> St. <hi>Albine, &amp;c.</hi> with
eight hundred Men at Armes, and twelve hundred
Archers. In the third was the King himself, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
about him seven hundred Men at Armes, and
three thousand Archers, with the residue of his
Nobles and People.</p>
            <p>The battel thus ordered, our King mounted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a white Hobby, rode from rank to rank to view
them, and with quickning words encouraged them,
that bravely they should stand to, and fight for his
Right and Honour. And he closed the battels at
their backs (as if he meant to barricado up their
way from flying) which he did by plashing and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Trees, and placing his Carriages there, and
all his other Impediments. He commanded all men
also to dismount, and to leave their horses behind
them; and thus all ways and means of flight being
taken away, the Necessity doubtless did double
their Courages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:56426:4"/>
The <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi> had with him <hi>Iohn</hi> of
<hi>Luxenbourg,</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the King of <hi>Majorca,</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Alanson</hi> his Brother, <hi>Charles de Bloys</hi> the
Kings Nephew, <hi>Ralph</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the Duke
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Flanders, Nevers, Sancerre,</hi>
with many other Dukes, Earles, Barons, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
bearing Arms, and those not only <hi>French,</hi>
but <hi>Almains, Dutch,</hi> and others. And just the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Battel, there came to the <hi>French</hi> Army <hi>Anne</hi>
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with a thousand men at Arms, so that all
things seemed to elate the Pride of the <hi>French,</hi> and
to fit them for destruction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Army was also divided into three
<hi>Battalia</hi>'s. The Vaunt-Guard the King committed to
his Brother, the Duke <hi>de Alanson,</hi> and the King of
<hi>Bohemia;</hi> The Reer to the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> And the
main Battel he led himself, being so impatient of
all delayes, that he would scarce permit time for a
little Councel to consider what was fittest to be
done. He caused also the <hi>Auriflamb</hi> to be erected,
which was an hallowed banner of Red Silk, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the <hi>French</hi> had a Wonderful high conceit, as of a
thing sent them from Heaven, as the <hi>Ephefians</hi>
thought of their <hi>Diana.</hi> The King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> though
he was short sighted, hearing in what good Array
the <hi>English</hi> attended their coming, said plainly (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the proud conceits of the <hi>French,</hi> who
thought them in a posture of flight) <hi>Here will the</hi>
English <hi>end their dayes or Conquer.</hi> He advised also
that the Army should take some repast, and that the
Infantry consisting of the <hi>Genoueses</hi> (who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
fifteen Thousand Cross-Bows, and sure men)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56426:5"/>
should make the first front, and the Cavalry to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
which was done accordingly.</p>
            <p>A little before the fight began, God, to shew
that he was Lord of Hosts, and the only giver of
Victory, caused the black Clouds to power down
upon them plenty of water, like so many Funerall
Teares, enarching the Aire with a spacious <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow;</hi>
and discharged sundry Peals of Thunder. The
Sun also, which before had hid his Face under a
black dark Cloud, now brake forth, shining full
in the <hi>French</hi> mens Faces, and on the backs of the
<hi>English.</hi> At the same time also great Flocks of
Ravens, and other balefull Birds of prey came flying
over the <hi>French</hi> Army.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>A lanson,</hi> contrary to his order,
took it ill that the <hi>Genoueses</hi> were set in the Front, and
therfore in fury caused them to change place which
changed that seat of the Army, and wrought that
discontent also in these <hi>Italians</hi> as irritated them
more against these <hi>French</hi> then against their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>The sign of Battel being given by King <hi>Philip,</hi>
was entertained with clamours and shouts, all things
shewing the dread, and horrour of Warr: Drums
and Trumpets sounding to a charge, Banners flying
in the Aire, and everie where the glittering weapons
threatning Death and Destruction. The <hi>French</hi>
calamities began at their <hi>Genowayes,</hi> who under <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo
Grimaldi,</hi> and <hi>Antonio Doria,</hi> their Collonels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all of them Cross-bow men, were to open a way
by their Arrows for the <hi>French</hi> Horse: but this was
the success of their service: Their bow-strings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56426:5"/>
wett with the late Rain, their Bodies weary
with a long March, their Ranks (after the <hi>English</hi>
had received their first Volley upon their Targets)
opened with innumerable Gapps, occasioned by the
fall of their slain fellows, who were overthrown by
our home-drawn Arrows, were at last most out ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
scattered, and trampled under foot by
<hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Alanson</hi> (by command of King
<hi>Philip</hi> himself) who bringing up the Horse with a
full carier, cryed out, <hi>On, On, let us make our way
upon the Bellies of these</hi> Genoueses, <hi>who do but hinder
us:</hi> and instantly pricks on through the midst of them,
followed by the Dukes of <hi>Lorain</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> never
staying till he came up to the <hi>English</hi> Battel where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our Gallant Prince commanded. This fiery young
Count (contrary to good Discipline) had also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
disobliged them, by disgracefull speeches
even when they were ready to joyn Battel.</p>
            <p>These <hi>French</hi> Gallants, being thus mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, were very many of them overthrown
and slain by the <hi>English</hi> Arrows, which equally
brought to destruction both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Genowayes,</hi>
shooting thickest where the crowd and confusion was
greatest. Some Rascals also that followed the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Army, as they saw opportunity, stept in among
them, and helpt to cut their throats, sparing neither
Lord nor Lozell.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Men at Arms, half out of breath
with their Post-hast, and terribly disordered by the
perpetual storms of our whistling Arrows, were now
at handy strokes with the Princes Battel: Neither
was it long before the bright Battel-Axes, glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56426:6"/>
Swords, and Lances, and such like other <hi>English</hi>
weapons, had changed their hue, being covered
over with humane gore, which having thirstily
drunk out of the enemies wounds, let drop in bloody
tears to the Ground.</p>
            <p>The fight was sharp and fierce whilst each strove
for Victory. But here may not be forgotten, the
high resolution and valour of the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
who (as only seeking an honorable Grave for his
old Age) thrust himself into the first Ranks of his
own Horsmen, and with full carrier charging the
<hi>English,</hi> was slain with his Sword in hand, the Troop
of his faithfull Followers, with their slaughtered
Bodies covering him even in Death: This was soon
seen by the fall of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Standard, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
his Son <hi>Charles</hi> (who was lately elected Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of <hi>Germany,</hi> whilst King <hi>Lewis</hi> was yet alive)
wisely took care for his own safety, by a timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
when he saw the case desperate.</p>
            <p>Now was King <hi>Philip</hi> himself in Person, with the
full power of his Army, come to the rescue of his
Brother, and Friends, who while they had breath,
were fighting hard for their hoped for Victory, but
finding the <hi>English</hi> Valor far beyond what they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
they were beaten to the Earth in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
so that the carnage was very great. Yet was
not our brave Prince without danger, though now
the second Battel of the <hi>English,</hi> for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Prince, rushing in among their Enemies
fought most couragiously.</p>
            <p>Our King <hi>Edward</hi> all this while was standing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Windmill Hill, with his Helmet on, which never
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56426:6"/>
came off till all was ended, juditiously watching,
beholding the whole Field, to see how all things
went, and ready to bring down his Army (which
stood about him like a black hovering in a cloud)
when just necessity should require it. The Prince in
the mean time, being hard put to it, having the
whole power of <hi>France</hi> against him, some of the
Nobles, sensible of his danger, sent to the King, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing
for his Presence for the aid of his Son in
this necessity: The King asked the Messenger,
<hi>Whether his Son was slain or hurt?</hi> And when they
answered, No, but that he was like to be overpower'd
with the multitude of his Enemies: <hi>Well then</hi> (said
the King) <hi>go back to them that sent you, and tell them
that so long as my Son is alive, they send no more to me,
what ever happen. For I will that the honour of this
Day shall be his, if God permit him to survive, and that
he shall either win his Spurrs, or lose his Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Message, though it carried not back men to
to assist, yet it inspired such new life and spirits into
the <hi>English,</hi> that they fought like Lions, as resolving
either to conquer or die. On the other side King
<hi>Philip,</hi> whose Kingdome lay at the Stake, performed
the Dutie of a good General and gallant Soldier,
fighting so long in his own Person till his Horse was
killed under him, himself twice dismounted, and
wounded both in the neck and thigh, and near be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
troden to Death, had not the Lord <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault</hi>
Earle of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> rescued and remounted him:
The <hi>French</hi> also about him (out of a loyal desire of
his preservation) almost against his will, conveyed
him out of the Field, who rather seemed desirous to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56426:7"/>
end his dayes in so Noble company.</p>
            <p>The King being departed out of the Field, and the
matter being divulged in both the Armies, it soon
put a period to this bloody medly, wherin as yet none
were taken to mercy, but all were put to the Sword.
The <hi>French</hi> King himself, with a small Company,
got to <hi>Bray</hi> in the night, and approaching the walls,
and the Guard asking who was there? He answered,
<hi>The Fortune of</hi> France: By his Voice he was known, and
thereupon received into the Town, with the Tears and
Lamentations of his People. The rest of his Army
sought to save themselves by flight, whom the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
(warily fighting upon the defensive) and loth
to hazard so glorious a Victory, by breaking their
rancks to pursue the enemy too far in the night
(which was now come on) suffered them to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
only by their own feares, contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to make good their ground, by standing still
upon their Guard, according to the Rules of true
Martial Discipline, knowing that there were so
many of the Enemy escaped, as might yet serve to
overwhelm their weary Army with their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>Our King <hi>Edward,</hi> seeing the Coast for the present
cleared of all his Enemies, came down from the Hill
with his intire Battel towards his Victorious Son,
and most affectionatly embracing and kissing him,
said, <hi>Fair Son, God send you good perseverance to such
prosperous beginnings: You have acquitted your self
right Nobly, and are well worthy to have a Kingdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with your Government for your Valor.</hi> To which
the most noble and Magnanimous of Princes replyed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56426:7"/>
with silence, most humbly falling on his Knees at
the feet of his triumphant Father.</p>
            <p>As for other things concerning this famous Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
I refer my Reader to my Narrative of it in
the Life and Death of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
my self here only to describe it, so far forth
as our Noble Prince was therein a prime Actor,
and without which I could not have given a just
Account of his life.</p>
            <p>Immediately after this Victory our King march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his Army through <hi>France,</hi> and sat down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Calice.</hi> But as the splendor of the Sun darkens
the stars, so did the Presence of the Father obscure
the Actions and Vertues of the Son, that I read no
more of him till the year 1355. At which time our
King was informed, that <hi>John</hi> the now King of
<hi>France</hi> (his father <hi>Philip</hi> being dead) had given the
Dutchy of <hi>Aquitain</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Dolphin;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
King <hi>Edward</hi> being much incensed, conferred
the same upon his own Son, the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi>
commanding him to defend his right therein with
the Sword against his Adversaries.</p>
            <p>He was also appointed by Parliament to go into
<hi>Gascoin</hi> with a thousand Men at Arms, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Archers, and a great number of Welch-men,
who accompanied their Prince: And in <hi>Iune</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
he set forward with three hundred Sail of
ships, attended with the Earls of <hi>Warwick, Suffolk,
Salisbury</hi> and <hi>Oxford;</hi> and the Lords, <hi>Chandois, Aud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
Beufort, Lile,</hi> with Sir <hi>Robert Knowls,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis
Hall,</hi> with many others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>With these arriving in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> he betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56426:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to do things worthy of his Name and courage.
He did wonders in <hi>France.</hi> For with his Victorious
Army, he recovered multitudes of Towns and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners:
He entred <hi>Guienne,</hi> passed over <hi>Languedoc</hi>
to <hi>Tholouse, Narbone, Bruges,</hi> without any encounter,
sacks, spoiles and destroyes where he goes, and
loaden with Booties, returns to <hi>Burdeaux.</hi> In the
mean time the <hi>French</hi> King gathered all the Power
he possibly could, and the Prince, (the Winter
being spent) sets forth upon a new Expedition.</p>
            <p>He had in his Army about eight Thousand brave
expert and well Disciplined Souldiers, and with
them he advanced through <hi>Perigort</hi> and <hi>Limosin,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the bosom of <hi>France,</hi> even up to the very Gates
of <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Bery,</hi> the terrour of his Name flying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to his great advantage. Thus satisfied for the
present, he wheeled about with purpose to return
by <hi>Remorantine</hi> in <hi>Blasois</hi> (which Town he took) and
so through the Country of <hi>Tourain, Poictou,</hi> and
<hi>Xantoyn,</hi> to his chief City of <hi>Burdeaux.</hi> But <hi>Iohn</hi>
King of <hi>France,</hi> having assembled a great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Army, followed close, and about the City of
<hi>Poictiers</hi> overtook our invincible Prince.</p>
            <p>Where the Armies (with the odds of six to one
against the <hi>English)</hi> drew near each other, two Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
sent from Pope <hi>Clement</hi> mediated (as they
had done before) to take up the quarrel. But the
<hi>French</hi> King supposing that he had his enemy now
at his mercy, would accept of no other conditions,
but that the Prince should deliver him four Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and as vanquished, render up himself and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to his discretion. The Prince was content to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56426:8"/>
restore unto him all the places which he had taken
from him, but without prejudice to his Honour,
wherein (he said) he stood accountable to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and his Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the <hi>French</hi> King would
abate nothing of his former demands, as being
assured of the Victory, as he supposed; and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was ready instantly to set upon the Prince, who
seeing himself reduced to this strait, took wha
advantage he could of the ground, and by his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
got the benefit of certain Vines, Shrubs and
bushes upon that part where he was like to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted,
whereby to pester and intangle the <hi>French</hi>
Horse, which he saw was ready to come furiously up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him.</p>
            <p>The success answered his expectation. For the
Cavalry of his enemie in their full carrier, were so
intangled and incumbred among the Vines, that the
Princes Archers galled, and annoyed them at their
pleasure. For the <hi>French</hi> King, to give the honour
of the Day to his Cavalry, made use of them only
without the help of his Infantry: Hence it was that
they being disordered, and put to rout, his whole
Army came to be utterly defeated. Here (if ever) the
Prince and his <hi>English</hi> gave full proof of their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and undaunted courage, never giveing over till
they had wholly routed all the three <hi>French</hi> Battels,
the least of which exceeded all the Princes numbers.
The King himself fighting Valiantly, and <hi>Philip</hi> his
youngest Son (who by such his boldness and zeal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
his distressed Father, as it purchased unto
him the Honourable Surname of <hi>Hardy</hi> were taken
Prisoners.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56426:9"/>
Those of the Princes side, whose Valour and
great deeds was most conspicuous, were, the Earles of
<hi>Warwick, Suffolk, Salisbury, Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Stafford:</hi> The
Lords, <hi>Chandois, Cobham, Spencer, Audley, Berkley,
Basset,</hi> &amp;c. and of <hi>Gascoin,</hi> Subjects to the Crown of
<hi>England,</hi> The Capital <hi>de Beuf:</hi> The Lords <hi>Lumier,
Chaumont,</hi> with others of inferior Title, but not of
unequal Valour: Among others, <hi>Iames,</hi> Lord <hi>Audley</hi>
wan immortal Renown at this bloody Battel, in
which he received many Wounds, and was reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Noble Prince with a Gift of five Hundred
Marks, Land in Fee-simple in <hi>England,</hi> which he
divided among his four Esquires, who had stood by
him in all the fury and brunt of the Battel: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Prince asked him, <hi>if he accepted not of his
Gift?</hi> He answered, That these men had deserved
it as well as himself, and needed it more; With
which reply the Prince was so well pleased, that he
gave five Hundred Marks more in the same kind. A
rare Example, where desert in the Subject, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the Prince strove which should be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
This Lord <hi>Audley</hi> having vowed to be formost
in the Fight made good his words accordingly.</p>
            <p>It was the misfortune, or rather the Glory of the
<hi>French</hi> Nobles in these disasterous times, that the
loss fell ever heavily upon them. For in this great
overthrow and Carnage (by their own confession)
there fell fifty and two Lords, and about seaventeen
Hundred Knights, Esquires and Gentlemen, that
bore Coats of Arms: Among the Knights were fifty
two Bannerets. The chief among the slain, were
<hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> Duke of <hi>Athens,</hi> The high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56426:9"/>
of <hi>France Iohn de Clermont</hi> Marshal, <hi>Ieffery
de Charmy</hi> High Chamberlain; The Bishop of
<hi>Chalons,</hi> the Lords of <hi>Landas,</hi> of <hi>Pons,</hi> and of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</hi>
Sir <hi>Reginald Camian,</hi> who that day carried the
<hi>Auriflamb,</hi> was slain also, and as many others as
made up the former number: And of the common
Soldiers there died about six Thousand. So won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
did the great God of Battels sight for the
<hi>English</hi> in those Days.</p>
            <p>There escaped from this bloody Battel three of
the <hi>French</hi> Kings Sons (for he brought them all
with him) <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Dauphin, Lewis,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> Duke of <hi>Barry,</hi> all
of them great Actors in the times following. The
<hi>French</hi> Prisoners taken were, <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Philip</hi> his Son, afterwards Duke of <hi>Burgoine:</hi>
The Arch-bishop of <hi>Sens; James</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Earle
of <hi>Ponthieu: John</hi> of <hi>Artoys,</hi> Earle of <hi>Eu: Charles</hi>
his Brother, Earle of <hi>Longuevil: Charles</hi> Earle of
<hi>Vendosm:</hi> The Earles <hi>Tankervile, Salbruch, Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
Dampmartin, La Roch;</hi> The Counts of <hi>Vaudemont
Estampes</hi> and <hi>Iohn de Ceintre,</hi> accounted the best
Knight of <hi>France,</hi> and many other great Lords;
and about two Thousand Knights, Esquires, and
Gentlemen, that bore Coats of Arms. And in
this Expedition the <hi>English</hi> took an Hundred En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</p>
            <p>But here great contention arose between many
who should be the man that took King <hi>Iohn</hi>
Prisoner: The Prince wisely commanded
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56426:10"/>
them to forbear till they came into <hi>England,</hi> where,
the matter being heard, it was adjudged by King
<hi>John's</hi> own Testimony, that one Sir. <hi>Denis Morbeck</hi>
of St. <hi>Omers</hi> had taken him Prisoner; for which
service the Prince rewarded him with a Thousand
Marks.</p>
            <p>And now, though King <hi>Iohn</hi> had the hard hap to
fall into the hands of an Enemie, yet he had the
happiness to fall into the hands of a Noble Enemy.
For Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> having conquered his Person by
force of battel, now strove to overcome his minde
by his humble deportment, expressing himself in a
Language so ponderous, humble, grave, and natural,
and yet so stately, as none but the best Soul, adorned
with the best education was able to have performed.
And the next Day, causing the Chaplains, and the
other Priests in the Army to celebrate Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
he put off from himself the whole Glory of
Victory, and most devoutly gave it unto God: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which, in the sight and hearing of the Prisoners,
he highly commended and heartily thanked his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
with speeches full of life and affections, seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his words to every one with bountifull large
fees as his present meanes would permit. Mr. <hi>May</hi>
in his <hi>Edward</hi> the third, sets forth this Battel excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
in these words,</p>
            <l>—The first hot Charge</l>
            <l>The valiant Lord, renowned <hi>Audley,</hi> gave;</l>
            <l>Who to perform a Noble vow, in Deeds</l>
            <l>Almost the Prowess of a Man Exceeds;</l>
            <l>And like the stroak of <hi>Joves</hi> resistless Thunder,</l>

            <l>Is kindled now, and blazes high: Desire</l>

            <l>Not in the Chiefs alone: Each Soldier</l>
            <l>In that small Army feels bright Honours flame,</l>
            <l>And labours to maintain his proper Fame.</l>
            <l>Ne're was a Battel through all parts so fought,</l>

And now though King <hi>John</hi> had the unhappiness
to fall into the hands of an enemy, yet that which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviated
his affliction was, that he fell into the hands
of a Noble Enemy: for Prince <hi>Edward</hi> used him with
such respect and observance, that he could not finde
much difference between his captivity and liberty,
Mr. <hi>May</hi> gives us this Narrative of it.</p>
            <l>The chase together with the day was done,</l>
            <l>And all return'd In his Pavilion</l>
            <l>Brave <hi>Edward</hi> feasts his Royal Prisoner;</l>
            <l>At which as Noble did the Prince appear</l>
            <l>As erst in battel, and by sweetness won</l>
            <l>As great a Conquest as his Sword had don.</l>
            <l>No fair respect, or Honour that might cheer</l>
            <l>That Kings afflicted breast was wanting there.</l>
            <l>No Reverence, nor humble courtesie,</l>
            <l>That might preserve his state and dignity,</l>
            <l>But <hi>Edward</hi> shew'd at full. And at the Feast</l>
            <l>In Person waited on his captive Guest.</l>
            <l>But what content, what Object fit could Fate</l>
            <l>Present, to comfort such a changed State</l>
            <l>—For him.</l>
            <l>Whose State the Morning Sun had seen so high,</l>
            <l>This night beholds in sad captivity;</l>
            <l>His restless passions rowling to and fro</l>
            <l>No calm admit: when thus his noble <hi>Fo,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Prince <hi>Edward</hi> spake, (Great King, for such you are</l>
            <l>In my thoughts still, whate're the Chance of War</l>
            <l>Hath lately wrought against you here) forgive</l>
            <l>Your humble Kinsmans service, if <hi>I</hi> strive</l>
            <l>To ease your sorrow, and presume to do</l>
            <l>What is too much for me, to counsel you.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:56426:12"/>
Do not deject your Princely thoughts or think</l>
            <l>The Mnrtial Fame that you have gain'd, can sink</l>
            <l>In one succesless Field: Or too much fear</l>
            <l>Your Nations Honour should be tainted here.</l>
            <l>Mens strength and Honours we most truly try,</l>
            <l>Where Fields are fought with most equality.</l>
            <l>But God was pleas'd to make this days success</l>
            <l>The more miraculous, that we the less</l>
            <l>Might challenge to our selves, and humbly know,</l>
            <l>That in so great and strnge an overthrow</l>
            <l>Some secret Judgment of our God was wrought,</l>
            <l>And that the Sword of Heaven, not <hi>England,</hi> fought, &amp;c.</l>
            <l>And for your self, Great King, all History,</l>
            <l>That shall hereafter to the VVorld make known</l>
            <l>Th' event of <hi>Poictiers</hi> Battel, shall renown</l>
            <l>Your Personal Prowesse, which appear'd so high,</l>
            <l>As justly seem'd to challenge Victory,</l>
            <l>Had not Gods secret Providence oppos'd:</l>
            <l>But though his Will (Great Sir) hath thus dispos'd;</l>
            <l>Your State remains, your Person, and your Fame,</l>
            <l>Shall in my humble thoughts be still the same.</l>
            <l>And till my Father see your Face, to show</l>
            <l>How he respects your Worth, and State, to you</l>
            <l>As to himself, were he in Person here,</l>
            <l>In all observance, <hi>Edward</hi> shall appear.</l>
            <l>The Noble King, a while amaz'd to see</l>
            <l>Victorious Youth so full of Courtesie;</l>
            <l>At last replies: Brave Cousin, you have shown</l>
            <l>Your Self a Man built up for true Renown;</l>
            <l>And, as in Action of the Wars, to be</l>
            <l>This Ages <hi>Phaenix</hi> in Humanity.</l>
            <l>Why do you wrong me thus, as to enthrall</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56426:12"/>
Me doubly? Not insulting o're my Fall,</l>
            <l>You rob me, Cousin, of that sole Renown,</l>
            <l>Which I, though vanquish'd, might have made mine own,</l>
            <l>To bear Adversity. I might have shew'd,</l>
            <l>Had you been proud, a Passive Fortitude;</l>
            <l>And let the world, though <hi>I</hi> am fallen, see</l>
            <l>What spirit <hi>I</hi> had in scorning misery.</l>
            <l>But you have rob'd me of that Honour now,</l>
            <l>And <hi>I</hi> am bound in Honour to allow</l>
            <l>That Noble Theft, content (since such are you)</l>
            <l>To be your Captive and your Debtor too;</l>
            <l>And since my Stars ordein'd a King of <hi>France,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Arm'd with such odds, so great a Puissance</l>
            <l>Must in a fatal Field be lost, to raise</l>
            <l>So great a Trophie to anothers Praise,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>I</hi> am best pleas'd it should advance thy Story,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Johns</hi> dishonour be Prince <hi>Edwards</hi> Glory.</l>
            <p>After the Battel, which was fought on the 19.
day of <hi>September, Anno Christi</hi> 1357. Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
led King <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Captive Nobles Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the Archiepiscopal See, and chief
City of his Dominions in <hi>France,</hi> where he retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them till the Spring following: But sent present
News of this Victory to his Father, who thereupon
took speedy Order by <hi>Simon</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
that a <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> should be celebrated all over
<hi>England</hi> for eight days together.</p>
            <p>The Prince, having sufficiently rested and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his people, the <hi>May</hi> following set sail for <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:56426:13"/>
with his Prisoners, and safely arrived at <hi>Plimouth,</hi>
and was with great joy and acclamations received
everie where. At his coming to <hi>London</hi> (where
at that time, a magnificent Citizen, <hi>Henry Picard</hi>
(he who afterwards at one time so Nobly Feasted
the four Kings of <hi>England, France, Scotland,</hi> and
<hi>Cyprus)</hi> was Lord Major) who received him with
all imaginable Honour. And the multitude of
People, that came to see the Victorious Prince, with
the King of <hi>France,</hi> his Son <hi>Philip,</hi> and the other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
was so great, that they could hardly get to
<hi>Westminster</hi> between three a Clock in the Morning,
and twelve at Noon. Great <hi>Edward,</hi> saving that he
forgat not the Majestie of a Conquerour, and of a
King of <hi>England,</hi> omitted no kind of Noble courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
towards the Prisoners. King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and his Son,
were lodged under a safe Guard at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> which
was then a goodly Palace belonging unto <hi>Henry</hi>
Duke of <hi>Lancaster;</hi> and the other Prisoners in other
places</p>
            <p>Some time after Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> by dispensation,
was maried to the Countess of <hi>Kent,</hi> Daughter to
<hi>Edmund,</hi> Brother to King <hi>Edward</hi> the second, and
his Father invested him with the Dutchy of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:</hi>
So that he was now Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Aquitain,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and Earle of <hi>Chester</hi>
and <hi>Kent.</hi> And not long after, he with his Beloved
Wife, passed over into <hi>France,</hi> and kept his Court
at <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was now grown famous over
all the Christian world, and the man to whom all
wronged Princes seemed to Appeal, and to fly for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56426:13"/>
succour. For which end there came at this time to
his Court <hi>Iames,</hi> King of <hi>Majorca,</hi> and <hi>Richard,</hi> King
of <hi>Navarr,</hi> just when his beloved Lady brought him
a Son, for whom these two Kings undertook at his
Baptisme, giving him the Name of <hi>Richard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Companies of Soldiers, most of whose Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
were <hi>English,</hi> either by Birth, or Obedience,
wanting employment, because the Warrs of <hi>Britain</hi>
were quieted for the Present, ranged tumultuously
up and down <hi>France:</hi> But about this time Sir <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram
de Glequin</hi> (having paid his Ransom) found
employment for them, drawing the greatest part of
that Millitary Pestilence into another Coast. For
by the assistance of <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and the
Power of <hi>Glequin,</hi> with his floting Bands, called
<hi>The Companions,</hi> or <hi>Adventurers, Peter</hi> King of
<hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Leon</hi> (a cruel Tyrant) was driven out
of his Kingdome, his Bastard Brother <hi>Henry</hi> being
chosen in his room, and Crowned King of <hi>Spain</hi> at
<hi>Burgos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Peter</hi> was Son to <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the eleventh
King of <hi>Castile,</hi> and had to Wife a <hi>French</hi> Lady cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Blanch,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Peter</hi> Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who
was Father also of <hi>Ioan,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings Wife.
His Tyrannical cruelties were so many and so foul,
that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Stories, scarce suffer <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Caligula</hi>
to go beyond him: For which, by his Subjects he
was deposed, and his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> (as is
said before) was substituted, and Crowned in his
room.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> thus driven out of his Kingdome, by the
aid of the <hi>French,</hi> applyed himself to Prince <hi>Edward,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56426:14"/>
craving his assistance for his restitution, making
many and large Promises to him upon the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
thereof. And the Prince, partly out of
Charity to succour a distressed Prince, and partly out
of policy to keep his souldiers in exercise, having
first sent to his Father, and gotten his leave, marched
with a gallant Army of thirty thousand men (burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with desire of Renown) upon confidence of good
pay for his men, and other Commodities, when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
should be reestablished upon his Throne.</p>
            <p>He made his way through the famous straits of
<hi>Rouncevallux</hi> in <hi>Navarre,</hi> by permission of the King
thereof, who yet suffered himself to be taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
and carried into <hi>Castile,</hi> that he might not
seem to cross the <hi>Freneh</hi> Kings designes, who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<hi>Henry</hi> the Usurper.</p>
            <p>Our Prince had in his Company, besides most of
all the principal Captains of the <hi>English,</hi> two Kings,
<hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Castile</hi> whose the quarrel was, and the King
of <hi>Majorca;</hi> As also <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> who
somewhile after <hi>Don Pedro</hi> his death, having marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his eldest daughter, wrote himself King of <hi>Castile</hi>
and <hi>Leon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other side, King <hi>Henry</hi> for the defence of
his new Kingdom, had amassed together a very great
Army, consisting partly of <hi>French,</hi> under <hi>Glequin</hi>
their famous Captains; and of <hi>Castilians</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
both Christians and Saracens to the number
of about an hundred thousand. And upon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>Castile</hi> it came to a bloody battel, wherein the
valiant Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> obtained a very great victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
having slain many thousands of his enemies.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56426:14"/>
               <hi>Henry</hi> himself fighting valiantly, was wounded in
the Groin, but yet escaped. There were taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
the Earle of <hi>Dene, Bertram de Glequin</hi> (who
yet shortly after, by paying a great Ransom was set
at liberty) The Marshal <hi>Dandrehen,</hi> and many others.
Neither was this Victory less worth to <hi>Peter</hi> then
a Kingdom: For our most Noble Prince left him
not, till at <hi>Burgos</hi> he had set him upon his Throne
again.</p>
            <p>But this unworthy Kings falshood and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
were odious and monstrous. For the Prince,
notwithstanding his so great goodness extended to
him, was enforced to return to <hi>Burdeaux</hi> without
money wherewith to pay his Army, which was
the cause of exceeding great mischiefs to himself,
and the <hi>English</hi> Dominions beyond the Seas, as if
God had been displeased with his succouring such a
Tyrant. The Prince himself, though he came
back with Victory, yet he brought back with him
such a craziness, and indisposition of Body, that he
was never throughly well after. And no marvel,
considering the Country, the season, and the action
it self, and it may be more marvelled that his
Souldiers came home so well, then that he came
home so ill.</p>
            <p>Being now returned, there was presently, to
his indispositon of Body, added discontentment of
mind. For not having money wherewith to pay his
Soldiers, he was forced to wink at that which he
could not choose but see, and seeing to grieve
at. For they preyed upon the Country, for which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56426:15"/>
the Countrey murmured against him. And now
to stop this murmuring, his Chancellor the Bishop
of <hi>Rhodes</hi> devised a new Imposition of levying a
<hi>Frank</hi> for every Chimney, and this to continue for
five years to pay the Princes debts.</p>
            <p>But this Imposition (though granted in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
made the murmuring to be encreased. For
though some part of his Dominions, as the <hi>Poicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
the <hi>Xantoigns,</hi> and the <hi>Limosins,</hi> in a sort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to it, yet the Count of <hi>Armigniac,</hi> the Count
of <hi>Cominges,</hi> the Vicount of <hi>Carmain,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
so much distasted it, that they complained
thereof to the King of <hi>France,</hi> as unto their Supreme
Lord: Pretending that the Prince was to answer
before King <hi>Charles,</hi> as before his Superior Lord, of
whom (they said) he held by homage and fealty:
whereas King <hi>Edward</hi> and his Heirs by the Treaty
at <hi>Bretagny,</hi> were absolutely freed from all manner of
Service for any of their Dominions in <hi>France;</hi> King
<hi>Charles</hi> did openly entertain this Complaint, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to regain by surprize and policy, what the
<hi>English</hi> had won by dint of sword, and true Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
he proceeded to summon the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>
to <hi>Paris,</hi> there to answer to such Complaints as his
subjects made against him.</p>
            <p>Our stout Prince returned for Answer, <hi>That if he
must needs appear, he would bring threescore thousand
men in Arms to appear with him.</hi> And now began the
Peace between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> to be unsetled
and wavering. For while our King <hi>Edward</hi> rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the excellent Vertues and Actions of his Sons
and people, <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, warned by so
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56426:15"/>
many calamities as his Dominions had sustained by
the <hi>English</hi> in fair War: and withal, earnestly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting
to recover the Honour of his Nation, betook
himself wholly to secret practices and designs: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
adventuring his own Person in the Field, but
executing all by his Deputies and Lieutenants, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by the valour and service of <hi>Bertram de Gle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>
Constable of <hi>France,</hi> who from a low estate
was raised to this height for his prudent and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
Conduct in War. And our truly Noble
King (without suspicion of craft) reposing himself
upon the Rules of Vertue and Magnanimity, did not
reap the stable effects of so great and important vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
nor of the Peace so Ceremoniously made,
that (in the Worlds opinion) it could not be broken,
without the manifest violation upon one side, of all
Bonds both divine and humane.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> by Letters advised his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not to trust to any fair words, or overtures of
further Amity made by the <hi>French,</hi> because (as he
said) they entertained Practices underhand in every
place against him: But his counsel was not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to, because he was judged to write thus out of a
restless humour, delighting in War, though the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
shewed that his words were true. For now King
<hi>Charles,</hi> having by quick paiments, and by one
means or other gotten home all the Hostages which
had bin impledged for performance of the Articles
of Peace, set all his wits on work to abuse the King
of <hi>Englands</hi> credulity. He courted him with loving
Letters and Presents, while in the mean time his
Plots were ripened abroad, and he surprized the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56426:16"/>
County of <hi>Ponthieu</hi> (our Kings undeniabe inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
before King <hi>Edward</hi> heard thereof.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> hereupon calls a Parliament, declares
the breach, craves aid, and hath it granted. And
then againe claims the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and sent
over his Son <hi>Iohn,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and <hi>Humfry de
Bohun,</hi> Earle of <hi>Hereford,</hi> with a great Army to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi>
to invade <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the States and Towns made over to the
<hi>English</hi> at the Treaty of <hi>Bretigni,</hi> which had revolted
to the <hi>French,</hi> was the City of <hi>Limosin:</hi> Thither did
the Prince march, and sat down with his Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it: And not long after came unto him out of
<hi>England,</hi> his two Brethren the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
and the Earle of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> with a fresh supply of
Valiant Captains, and Souldiers. The City stood
it out to the uttermost, and was at last taken by storm,
where no mercy was shewed by the inraged Soldiers,
but the Sword and Fire laid all desolate: After
this Service, the Princes health failing him more
and more, he left his Brethren in <hi>Aquitain</hi> to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Warrs, and himself taking Ship, came over
to his Father in <hi>England,</hi> his eldest Son <hi>[Edward]</hi>
being dead a little before at <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and brought
over with him his Wife and his other Son <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince having left <hi>France,</hi> his Dominions
were either taken away, or fell away faster then
they were gotten, <hi>Gueschlin</hi> entred <hi>Poictou,</hi> took <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morillon,
Chauvigny, Lussack</hi> and <hi>Moncontour.</hi> Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
followed the Country of <hi>Aulnis,</hi> of <hi>Xantoyn,</hi> and
the rest of <hi>Poictou:</hi> Then St. <hi>Maxent, Neel, Aulnay:</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:56426:16"/>
Then <hi>Benaon, Marant, Surgers, Fontency,</hi> and at last
they came to <hi>Thouras,</hi> where the most part of the
Lords of <hi>Poictou,</hi> that held with the Prince, were
assembled. At this time the King, Prince <hi>Edward,</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and all the Great Lords of
<hi>England</hi> set forward for their relief: But being
driven back by a Tempest, and succour not coming,
<hi>Thouras</hi> was yeilded up upon composition: In fine,
all <hi>Poictou</hi> was lost, and then <hi>Aquitain,</hi> all, but only
<hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and <hi>Bayon.</hi> And not long after Prince
<hi>Edward</hi> died, and with him the Fortune of <hi>England.</hi>
He was a Prince so full of Virtues as were scarce
matchable by others. He died at <hi>Canterbury</hi> upon
<hi>Trinity Sunday, June</hi> the eighth, in the forty sixth
year of his Age, and the forty ninth of his Fathers
Raign: and was buried in <hi>Christs-Church</hi> there <hi>Anno
Christi</hi> 1376.</p>
            <p>Among all the Gallant men of that Age this our
Prince was so worthily the first, that.</p>
            <q>Longe erit a Primo quisque secundus erit.</q>
            <p>He had a sumptuous Monument erected for him,
upon which this <hi>Epitaph</hi> was engraven in Brass, in
<hi>French</hi> thus <hi>Englished.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here lyeth the Noble Prince Monsieur <hi>Edward,</hi>
the Eldest Son of the thrice Noble King <hi>Edward</hi> the
third, in former time Prince of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and of
<hi>Wales,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and Earle of <hi>Chester,</hi>
who died on the Feast of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which was the
eighth of <hi>June,</hi> in the year of grace 1376. To the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56426:17"/>
Soul of whom, God grant mercy. Amen.</p>
            <p>After which were added these verses in <hi>French,</hi> thus
Translated according to the homely Poetry of those
