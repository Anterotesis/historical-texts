         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>NOW, now you that fancy all miracles ceas'd,</l>
               <l>I'll tell you a Tale of a late <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſt,</l>
               <l>Who has produc'd ſuch a number, that he</l>
               <l>Muſt own they had Birth moſt miraculouſly.</l>
               <l>And never hereafter be hard of Belief,</l>
               <l>And thus I'll begin them, although I'll be brief;</l>
               <l>And when I my Task in this point do fulfil,</l>
               <l>They will be all Miracles ſay what you will.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Firſt, out of pure zeal to diſcover the Plot,</l>
               <l>He was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and yet he was not;</l>
               <l>For though to the <hi>Pope</hi> he was ſworn, and more,</l>
               <l>The Hoſt he received, and the Bread did adore,</l>
               <l>And knew their Conſpiracy, and each deſign,</l>
               <l>And in a moſt Helliſh Plot did with them joyn:</l>
               <l>O yet the fam'd Hero's a Proteſtant ſtill,</l>
               <l>And this is a Miracle ſay what you will.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He knew on what miſchief their Malice was bent,</l>
               <l>And on what dire murders their minds were intent,</l>
               <l>Yet truſted their fury long e're he made known</l>
               <l>The Helliſh deſign, which to mountains was grown,</l>
               <l>And might have proſper'd in ſpight of the Prieſt,</l>
               <l>Had not the kind Heavens their fury ſuppreſs'd;</l>
               <l>For why they had time enough all to fulfil,</l>
               <l>Yet this is a Miracle ſay what you will.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then that there appointed were Armies ſo great,</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pilgrims, wild <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and that</l>
               <l>Some thouſands of <hi>Papiſts</hi> were cruelly bent,</l>
               <l>For with black Bils, Guns, Swords, &amp; Staves, 'twas their intent</l>
               <l>To ſet on the Nation, yet ſtrange is the thing</l>
               <l>That none of them e're to light any could bring,</l>
               <l>Or where they ſuch Magazines hoarded up ſtill,</l>
               <l>Yet this is a Miracle ſay what you will.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>That this Prieſtly worthy who knew all the Plot,</l>
               <l>And might have commanded the Devil knows what;</l>
               <l>Who had at his beck ſtill the Lives and Eſtates</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Romes</hi> bold Villains, who held ſuch Debates,</l>
               <l>Shou'd be in ſuch miſery, ſo wondrous Poor,</l>
               <l>That he was oblig'd to haunt each <hi>Popiſh</hi> door,</l>
               <l>His Hungry Belly with Bread for to fill,</l>
               <l>Then this is a Miracle ſay what you will.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>That after the dreadful Diſcovery was made,</l>
               <l>And that Diſcovery was become a Trade,</l>
               <l>He ſhould proteſt he ſome Perſons ne're knew,</l>
               <l>And in a while after the ſame ſhould purſue,</l>
               <l>To the loſs of their lives, as having well known,</l>
               <l>How from time to time their Deſigns they went on,</l>
               <l>To ruin three Kingdoms, and Royal Blood ſpill,</l>
               <l>Yet this is a Miracle ſay what you will.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>A Thousand miles diſtant, as ſome they did ſay;</l>
               <l>Indeed't does much puzle me, unleſs he flew</l>
               <l>On ſome ſwift Whirl-wind, for plainly he knew</l>
               <l>What in the ſame day was done here, and eke there,</l>
               <l>And in his own Perſon Tranſactions did hear:</l>
               <l>If this be not unuſual than I have no Skill,</l>
               <l>Nay 'tis a Miracle ſay what you will.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>That he took Degrees in a place he ne'r ſaw,</l>
               <l>And to hear him diſpute, did great Crouds thither draw;</l>
               <l>And that in the Senate-houſe he ſhould once ſwear,</l>
               <l>He nothing more had of the Plot to declare,</l>
               <l>Yet after bethinking him, ſhou'd ſtill proceed,</l>
               <l>To accuſe ſome of high rank Treaſon indeed:</l>
               <l>If this bea't a Miracle ſtrange it is ſtill,</l>
               <l>But ſure 'tis a Miracle ſay what you will.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>That he with one Mouth ſhould ſo frankly declare,</l>
               <l>A man to be honeſt, then loudly to ſwear;</l>
               <l>He's a <hi>Jeſuit Prieſt,</hi> and the vileſt of Knaves,</l>
               <l>Becauſe to comply with his intreſt he waves:</l>
               <l>That one unbaptiz'd can a Chriſtian be ſaid,</l>

               <l>By giving him Poyſon, and ſo getting free,</l>
               <l>But that that Patron alive yet ſhou'd be,</l>
               <l>Exceeds all the reſt, and it is not gain-ſaid,</l>
               <l>But 'tis moſt Miraculous to raiſe the Dead;</l>
               <l>For rarely that Task can a Mortal fulfil,</l>
               <l>Then theſe are all Miracles ſay what you will.</l>
