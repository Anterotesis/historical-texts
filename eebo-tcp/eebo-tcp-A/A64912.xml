            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

most remarkable, of the Roman City, and of forraign Nations; which he very luckily finish'd. He flourish'd in the Raign of <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> and in his time, whose Numen he invokes, he wrote this History: For the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, when by their vertue they had justly and uprightly manag'd the Empire, were translated into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Gods, and were call'd <hi>Divi Imperatores.</hi> He deriv'd his Pedigree by the Fathers side from the <hi>Valerian</hi> Family; by the Mothers side, from the <hi>Fabian:</hi> from both which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the name of <hi>Valerius Maximus.</hi> Of his Death there is nothing certain reported.</p>

many Ages? Or what wise man can hope to deliver the order of Domestick and Forraign story, which our Predecessors have done in such happy stiles, either with greater care, or more abounding Eloquence? Therefore, <hi>Caesar,</hi> thy Countries onely safety, thee I invoke in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of my Vndertaking, whom the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Gods and men hath ordain'd the great Commander both of Sea and Land; by whose Divine providence those Vertues, of which I am to discourse, are most favourably cherish'd, Vices most severely punish'd: For if the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Orators did well to begin from the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent <hi>Jove,</hi> if the most excellent Poets did always call some particular <hi>Numen</hi> to assist 'um; much the rather does my little Work fly to your protection: For other Gods we adore onely in Opinion, you we behold equal to your Fathers and your Grand-fathers Stars in brightness, whose resplendent Lustres have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not a little to the Ceremonies of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Others we receive for Gods, <hi>Caesars</hi> we make such. And because it is my intention to begin with the worship of the Gods, I shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course briefly of the nature thereof.</p>

                  <p>THe observation of Omens is founded upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain touch of Religion, as depending not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any fortuitous Chance, but upon Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:60321:16"/>1. Whereby it came to pass, that when the City was destroyed by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and the Senate was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting whether they should remove to <hi>Veii,</hi> or rebuild their own Walls, some Cohorts returning from Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, a Centurion crying out in the place for publick Assemblies to his Eagle-bearer, <hi>Fix your Ensigne, we'll stay here in good time:</hi> the Senate hearing his voice, took it for a good Omen, and left off their designe of going for <hi>Veii.</hi> In how few words was the Domicil of the future Empire of the World designed? The Gods disdaining that the <hi>Roman</hi> Name sprung from happy Omens, should change its Seat, or that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Victory it self should lie buried in the Ruines of a City already neer decay'd.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Author of this most famous Work, <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> while he was praying, that if the happiness of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> seemed to any of the Gods to be too great, that they would satisfie their Envy by any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief done to himself, at the end of his Prayer sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly stumbling sell down; which Omen is thought to have related to the Condemnation which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards underwent. But deservedly did Victory and the Prayers of this great man strive together for praise: nor was the strife of his Vertue less, that he increased the good fortune of his Country, wishing all its evil fortune might fall upon his own head.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How memorable was that which befel <hi>L. Paulus</hi> the Consul! who being by lot designed to make War with <hi>Perseus</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> in his return to his house met his youngest Daughter at the door, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving her to look something sad, kiss'd her, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the cause of her discontent; who answered, That <hi>Persa</hi> was dead: that was the name of a little Dog which she highly esteemed, which di'd a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Paulus</hi> laid hold of the Omen, and upon a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous saying, built the hopes of his future Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60321:17"/>4. But <hi>Cecilia</hi> the Wife of <hi>Metel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us,</hi> when her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Daughter r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>quired after the antient custom those Nuptial-Rites due to a Virgin of ripe years, gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to the Omen her self: for the Virgin having slaid in a certain Chappel for that purpose, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no body speak to her minde, wearied with long standing, she desired of her Aunt to let her have some place to sit down; to whom her Aunt repli'd, <hi>I freely give thee my Seat:</hi> Which saying proceeding out of kindness, prov'd ominous in the event; for not long after <hi>Cecilia</hi> dying, <hi>Metellus</hi> married the Virgin of whom we speak.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The observation of Omens was certainly the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> at what time he was adjudge an Enemy by the Senate, lying at the house of one <hi>Fannia</hi> at <hi>Minturnae</hi> for his security: For he observed an Ass-colt when he gave him Meat, that neglecting that, he ran still to the water. At which sight thinking that what was now offered by the Providence of the Gods, was to be followed, being himself otherwise very skilful in Religious Interpretations, he desired of the Multitude that came to his aid, that he might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the Sea: and so getting aboard a little Ship, he sailed into <hi>Africk,</hi> and so avoided the Victorious Arms of <hi>Sylla.</hi>

                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great at the Battel of <hi>Pharsalia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overthrown by <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. To <hi>M. Brutus</hi> an Event befitting the Murther

which he had committed, was designed him by an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: For after that wicked deed, as he was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Birth-day, and studying for some convenient Greek Verse, by accident he pitched upon one in <hi>Hem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Me cruel Fate and Son of fair <hi>Latona</hi> slew.</q>
                  <p>Which God being by <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Antonius</hi> given for the Signe, seemed as it were to be the occasion of his overthrow.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. With such a strange Ejaculation, the Fortune of <hi>Cassius</hi> amazed his ears, who when the <hi>Rhodians</hi> begg'd of him that they might not be deprived of all the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the Gods, made answer, That he had left the Sun: for having lost the Field in <hi>Macedon,</hi> he was not onely forced to leave the Effigies of the Sun, which he had granted them as suppliants, but also the Sun it self.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Worthy of remark is that Omen under which <hi>Petillius</hi> fell in the <hi>Ligurian</hi> War: for being to assail a Mountain that was called <hi>Letho,</hi> he boasted in his Exhortation to his Souldiers, saying, <hi>This day I will take</hi> Lethum <hi>or</hi> Hell: And fighting inconsiderately, confirmed by his death the truth of his fortuitous Speech.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. While <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> was an Infant and asleep, his Attendants b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>held a flame upon his head; which Prodigy <hi>Tanaquil</hi> the Wife of <hi>Tarquinius Priscus</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60321:18"/>
she brought up <hi>Servius,</hi> who was the Son of a Servant, instead of her own Son, and advanced him to the Throne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Equal happiness in Event did that flame promise which blaz'd upon the head of <hi>Lucius Marcius,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the two Armies, which the deaths of P. and <hi>Cn. Scipio</hi>'s had much weakned in <hi>Spain,</hi> while he was speaking to his Souldiers: for upon the sight of that, the Souldiers before fearful, now encouraged to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their wonted Fortitude, with the slaughter of 38000 men, and a great number of <hi>Prisoners,</hi> they took two Camps of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> crammed with spoil.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Also when after a long and sharp War the <hi>Veii</hi> could not be taken, though besieg'd within their own Walls, and that the delay was no less terrible to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegers than the besieged, the Gods themselves open'd the way to an unexpected Victory: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or on a sudden the Lake <hi>Albanus,</hi> neither augmented by any showers, nor assisted by the inundation of any other S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ream, rose far above its usual hight. To know the reason whereof, Messengers were sent to the Oracle at <hi>Delphos,</hi> who brought for answer, <hi>That they should let the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that over-swelled the Lake into the Fields: For so the</hi> Veii <hi>would come into the power of the</hi> Romans. Which before the Messengers could bring back, a Southsayer of the <hi>Veii,</hi> take<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> by one of our Souldiers and brought into the Camp, had also declared; so that the Senate doubly admonished, both obey'd the Gods, and got possession of the City.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nor was this which follows an Omen of bad success: <hi>Lucius Sulla</hi> Pro-Consul in the Confederate War, while he was sacrificing before the <hi>Pretorium</hi> in the Country of <hi>Nolas,</hi> on a sudden beheld a Snake glide from the lower part of the Altar; at the sight whereof, by the advice of <hi>Posthumus</hi> the Southsayer, he led forth his Army, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60321:19"/>
got the strong Camp of the <hi>Samnites:</hi> which Victory was the first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oundation and step to his future great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Chiefly to be admired are those Prodigies which hapned in our City, <hi>P. Volumnius</hi> and <hi>Ser. Sulpitius</hi> being Consuls. And Ox his Lowing being chang'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Humane Speech, exercised the minds of all people with the strangeness of the Accident. Little pieces of Flesh also fell like showers of Rain from the Sky, of which a great part was devoured by the Birds; the rest lay many days upon the ground, neither offensive to the smell, nor irksome to the sight:</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of another Tumult, Monsters of the same nature were to be seen. A Childe of half a year old in the Cow-market, proclaimed a Triumph. Another Childe was born with an Elephants head.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Picenum</hi> it rain'd Stones. In <hi>Gaul</hi> a Woolf came and took a Sword out of the Centinels Scabbard. Bloody Ears of Corn dropt among the Sheaves, as men were reaping neer <hi>Antium.</hi> The Waters of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi> were mix'd with Bloud. And before the second <hi>Punick</hi> War, an Ox was heard to speak, <hi>Look to thy self, O</hi> Rome.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Caius Flaminius</hi> being inauspiciously made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l, when he was preparing to fight with <hi>Hannibal</hi> at the Lake of <hi>Thrasymene,</hi> commanded the Ensignes to be taken up, when immediately his Horse stumbling, he was thrown to the ground and pitched upon his head: and nothing r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>garding this Prodigy, when the Ensigne-bearers told him they could not stir the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, threatned to punish um if they did not dig um out. But of this rashness of his, would onely he himself, and not the whole people of <hi>Rome</hi> had felt the doleful success: for in that Battel 15000 <hi>Romans</hi> were <hi>slain,</hi> 6000 taken, and 20000 put to flight. The headless body of the Consul, <hi>Hannibal</hi> sought for, to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60321:19"/>
have buried it, who had done what in him lay to bury the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The headlong obstinacy of <hi>Caius Flaminius, C. Hostilius Mancinus</hi> followed with a vain obstinacy, to whom these Prodigies hapned as he was going Consul for <hi>Spain.</hi> Being resolv'd to sacrifice at <hi>Lavinium,</hi> the Pullets being let out of the Bin, flew to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Wood, and though sought for with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence imaginable, could never be found: And when he was about to go abroad in the Port of <hi>Hercules,</hi> whither he went afoot, he heard a strange Voice, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Stay,</hi> Mancinus: With which affrighted, and in his return putting into <hi>Genoa,</hi> and there going aboard a little Boat, a Snake of a prodigious bigness appeared, and suddenly vanished out of sight. Which three Prodigies he equalled with the number of Calamities which befell him; and unfortunate Battel, a shameful Truce, and a most dismal Surrender.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The sad Event of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> a most dangerous Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, who being an inconsiderate person, and being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd, would take no advice or counsel, makes his rashness less to be wondered at: For when being Pro-Consul, he was sacrificing among the <hi>Lucaus,</hi> two Snakes on a sudden creeping out of some hidden place, having eaten the Liver of the Beast which he had sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, retir'd to their lurking holes. And whereas by reason of this accident the Sacrifice was renew'd, the same Prodigy happen'd again. The third Sacrifice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slain, and the Entrails more diligently lookt to, neither could the Serpents be driven away when they came, not be hinder'd in their flight; which though as the Southsayers affirm'd, it signified that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was to be careful of his own safety, yet was not <hi>Gracchus</hi> so careful, but that by the treachery of <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> at whose house he lay, he was drawn to a place where <hi>Mago</hi> hid himself with an armed power, who slew him naked and without defence.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. And where shall I sooner begin, than from the most sacred memory of Divine <hi>Augustus?</hi> His Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian <hi>Artorius</hi> being asleep, the night before the day wherein the <hi>Romans</hi> fought one against the other in the fields of <hi>Philippi,</hi> the appearance of <hi>Minerva</hi> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd him to warn <hi>Augustus,</hi> then lying very ill, that notwithstanding his sickness he should not abstain from the Battel: Which <hi>Caesar</hi> hearing, caus'd himself to be carried in a Litter into the Field, where, while he laboured above his strength for the Victory, his Camp was taken by <hi>Brutus</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> we think then,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60321:22"/>
but the Divine Benevolence so ordain'd it, that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage destined to immortality, should not be subject to a Fate unworthy his Divinity?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor was it onely the Dream of <hi>Artorius</hi> that gave warning to <hi>Augustus,</hi> who had a natural perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacity and vigour to judge of every thing, as a fresh and domestick President: For he had heard that <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purnia</hi> the Wife of his Parent <hi>Iulius,</hi> the last night that he lived upon earth, dream'd that she saw her Husband lie stabbed and bleeding in her bosom; and being affrighted with the strangeness of the Dream, was an earnest suiter to him to abstain from going to the Senate the next day: but he, lest he should have been thought to have been mov'd with a womans dream, went the rather to the Senate-house, where the Murtherers quickly laid violent hands upon him. It is not needful to make any comparison between the Father and the Son, both equal in their Divinity: for the one had made way for himself to Heaven by his own works, the other was to let the world enjoy his Vertues a long time. Therefore the Gods were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly willing that the first should know the approaching change, which the other was to defer; it being enough that one Honour should be given to Heaven, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promised.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Admirable also was that Dream, and famous in the Event, which the two Consuls <hi>Decius Mus,</hi> and <hi>Monlius Torquatus</hi> dream'd, when they lay incamped not far from the foot of the Mountain <hi>Vesuvius,</hi> at the time of the <hi>Latin</hi> War, which was very sharp and dangerous: For a certain person foretold to both of them, that the <hi>Manes</hi> and <hi>Terra Mater</hi> claim'd as their due the General of one side, and the whole Army on the other: But that which Captain soever should assail the forces of the Enemy, and devote himself a Victim for the good of his Army, should obtain the Victory.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60321:23"/>
This the Entrails of the Sacrifices confirmed the next mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ning to both Consuls, who endeavoured either to expiate the misfortune, if it might be averted, or else resolv'd to undergo the determination of the Gods. Therefore they agreed, that which Wing should begin to faint, the other should with his own life appease the Fates; which while both undauntedly vent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. The Dream which follows, seems to concern publick Religion. A certain Master of a Family ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caused his Servant to be whipped, and brought him to the punishment of the Fork in the Flaminian <hi>Circus,</hi> at the time of the Plebeian Plays, a little before the Show was about to begin, <hi>Iupiter,</hi> in a Dream, commanded <hi>Titus Atinius,</hi> one of the Vulgar, to tell the Consuls, <hi>That he that had done'd before the last</hi> Circensian <hi>Games, did no way please him; and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the fault were expiated by an exact restoration of the Plays, there would ensue not a little vexation and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the City.</hi> He tearing to involve the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth by Religion to his own disadvantage, held his peace. Immediately his Son, taken with a sudden fit of sickness, died. Afterwards being asked by the same God in his sleep, <hi>Whether be thought himself pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished enough for the neglect of his Command?</hi> yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining obstinate, was strucken with a general weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of body: At length, by the advice of his friends, being carried in a Horse-litter to the Consuls Tribunal, having fully declared the cause of his misfortunes, to the admiration of all men recovering his former strength, he walked afoot to his house.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Nor must we pass over in silence, that when <hi>M. Cicero</hi> was banished the City, by the Conspiracy of his Enemies, He diverting himself in a certain Village in the Country of <hi>Atinate,</hi> and falling asleep in the field,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60321:23"/>
as he thought himself wandring through strange pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and uncouth Regions, he thought he met <hi>C. Marius</hi> in his Consuls Robes, who asked him, <hi>What he made there wandring with so sad a Countenance?</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Cicero</hi> making his condition known to him, the Consul took him by the right hand and delivered him to the next Lictor, to conduct him to his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, telling him, <hi>That there there was a more joyful hope of his better condition laid up for him.</hi> Nor did it otherwise fall out; for the Senate made a Decree for his return in the Temple of <hi>Iupiter</hi> built by <hi>Marius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. But <hi>C. Gracchus</hi> was most openly and apparently foretold, in a Dream, the mischief of an approaching mischance: for being asleep, he saw the shape of his Brother <hi>Titus,</hi> who told him, <hi>There was no way for him to avoid the same Fate which he had undergone, when he was driven out of the Capitol.</hi> This many related from the mouth of <hi>Gracchus</hi> himself, before he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the Tribuneship, wherein he perish'd. And one <hi>Caelius</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Historian, said, <hi>He had heard much talk thereof while</hi> Gracchus <hi>was living.</hi>

                  <p n="8">8. But the Dream of <hi>Aterius Rufus,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, was more plainly hinted to him: for he dream'd one night, at a time when there was a great Fencing-prize at <hi>Syracuse,</hi> that he saw himself slain: which he told the next day to those that sate by him in the Play-house. It happened afterwards, that neer to the Knights place, the Net-player was introduced with the Challenger, whose face when he saw, he said, that he was to be slain by the Net-player; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately would have departed. They endeavouring by discourse to put away his fear, were the cause of the destruction of this miserable man.

Fabius Maximus</hi> onely, and he also through imprudence, going into the Countrey and meeting <hi>P. Crassus</hi> by the way, told him what was done in order to proclaiming the Second <hi>Punick</hi> War, remembring that he had been Questor three years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and not knowing t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However, though this were but a harmless errour in <hi>Fabius,</hi> yet he was severely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for it by the Consuls. For they would by no means suffer Taciturnity, the best and safest bond of Government, to be violated in the least. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Eumenes</hi> King of <hi>Asia</hi> gave intelligence to the Senate, that <hi>Perseus</hi> was preparing to make War, it could not be known either what <hi>Eumenes</hi> said, or what the Fathers answered, till <hi>Perseus</hi> was taken.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60321:35"/>
The Court was the faithful and deep breast of the Commonwealth, environ'd and fortifi'd with Silence; which they that enter'd, soon cast off private Love, cloathing themselves with publick Zeal. So that I may say, that one would have thought, that no man heard what was committed to the ears of so many.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But our antient Magistrates how they behaved themselves in bearing up the Majesty of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, from hence may be observed, that among all their other marks of Gravity, this they punctually maintain'd, not to talk with the <hi>Greeks</hi> but in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue. And also causing them to lay aside the volubility of their own language, forc'd them to speak by an Interpreter, not only in our own City, but in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia:</hi> That the honour of the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue might be spread with greater veneration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Nations. Not but that they had their Schools of Learning, but that they did not hold it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient that the Gown should in any thing be subject to the Cloak. Believing it a poor and low thing, that the weight and authority of Government should be tam'd by the charms of Eloquence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And therefore, <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> thou art not to be condemn'd of clownish Rigour, not to let thy old age, crown'd with a double Lawrel, illustrious with <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Numidian</hi> Trophies, be softned and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Eloquence of a vanquish'd Nation. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, lest while he appear'd a forrainer in the exercises of his Wit, he might seem a Runagate from his native Rites and Customes. Who therefore open'd the way to the <hi>Greek</hi> Pleadings that now deafen our ears? <hi>Molo</hi> the Rhetorician, as I am perswaded, who likewise sharpned the studies of <hi>M. Cicero.</hi> For he was the first Stranger that was ever heard in the Senate without an Interpreter; which Honour he receiv'd not undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, having mainly advanc'd the force of the <hi>Roman</hi>

Eloquence. Of conspicuous felicity is <hi>Arpinum,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you respect the one as a great contemner of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the other as the abounding Fountain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. With great diligence this Custome also was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by our Ancestors, that no person might walk between the Consul and the last Lictor, though he went along by vertue of his Office, unless he were a Child and the Son of the Consul. Which Custome was so obstinately maintain'd, that <hi>Q.

Whom <hi>Fabius</hi> readily obeyed, saying, <hi>Son, I did not this in contempt of thy Authority, but only to try whether thou knewe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60321:42"/>
And that the <hi>Ionians</hi> were the first that used Anointing and giving Crowns and Garlands at Feasts, and brought up the custome of a Second Course, no small incitements to Luxury. And it is no wonder, that men delighting in Labour and Patience, would not that the most indissoluble Nerves of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey should be weakned and broken by the contagion of forreign Delicacies: finding it easier to decline from Vertue to Luxury, than to recede from Luxury to Vertue. Which that it was no vain fear of theirs, their Captain <hi>Pausanias</hi> made apparent, who after he had perform'd great Actions, was not asham'd to suffer his Fortitude to be softned with the effeminate Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Apparel of <hi>Asia.</hi>

The Armies of the same City were never wont to joyn Battle, till they had heated their Courage with the sound of their Flutes, whose Tunes went all in <hi>Anapaestic</hi> measures, whereby they were taught to assail their Enemies with smart and thick Blows. They also were wont to use Scarlet Coats, to hide the Blood of their Wounds. Not that the sight thereof was any terrour to them, but that their Enemies should gain no heart or Courage thereby.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

For I am certain, thine eyes, orewhelm'd with darkness in the brightest light, could not behold the great work of thy mind. But thou <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> Consul in the <hi>Latine</hi> War, didst command thy Son to be carried away by the Officer, and to be slain like a Sacrifice, though he obtain'd a noble Victory, for that he had presum'd to fight with <hi>Geminius Metius</hi> Captain of the <hi>Tuscans,</hi> when provoked to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat by him.

And lest the breach of Military Honour should go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punish'd,

the Consul, punisher of all Crimes, must himself be punished. By these Propitiatory Sacrifices, as I may so say, O <hi>Mars</hi> the Father of our Empire, when we degenerated from thy auspicious Discipline, thy Deity was appeas'd: By the infamy of Kindred, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Brothers, by the murder of Sons, and the ignominious degrading of Consuls.</p>

Wherefore his Father, after having been Dictator, and three times Consul, was compell'd to appeal to the People, and upon his Knees to beg the assistance of the Tribunes in the behalf of his Son. Neither by this means could the Severity of <hi>Papirius</hi> be restain'd; but being intreated by the whole City, and by the Tribunes themselves, made a protestation, that he forgave the Punishment not to <hi>Fabius,</hi> but to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Authority of the Tribunes.</p>

Marcius</hi> Propretor. Which usurp'd Title the Senate would not permit him to take, knowing that it was the Custome for the People, not the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to choose the General. Which being a time that the Common-wealth was in great danger, and had sustain'd great Losses, one would have thought they should have rather flatter'd the Tribune, who they saw so fairly acting for the restauration of their former Honour. But no Overthrow, no Merit could sway the Senate more than their Military Discipline. And we may remember what a couragious Severity their Ancestors us'd in the <hi>Tarentine</hi> War: Wherein the Forces of the Common-wealth being very much weakned and broken, when they had receiv'd a great number of their Captive Fellow-Citizens, which <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> had sent them of his own accord; they decreed, that they who had serv'd on Horseback, should serve among the Foot; and they who had served as Foot, should be-listed among the Slingers.

These Punishments made them, that were late the deformed Gifts of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> to be his most eager and fierce Enemies. The same rigour did the Senate use toward them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted the Common-wealth at <hi>Cannae:</hi> For when by the strictness of their Decree they had reduced them to a worse condition than they who are dead, and at the same time had received Letters from <hi>Marcellus</hi> that they would send um to him, to assist him in the storm of <hi>Syracuse</hi>; the Senate wrote b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But they would send um to him, provided he would do with um as befitted the honour of the Common-wealth, That they should never be freed from Service, that they should never receive any Military Reward, nor be permitted to return into <hi>Italy</hi> while there were any Enemies therein. Thus has Vertue alwaies despis'd pusillanimous minds. How hainously was the Senate offended that the Souldiers suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For they would neither let the Stipend of the Legion go on, nor pay them any Arrears, for that they had not offer'd their Bodies to the Darts of their Enemies for the safety of their Emperour. And that Decree of so noble an Order remains a glorious and eternal Monument of <hi>Petellius</hi> same, under which his Ashes rest renowned in the Field by his Death, in the Senate by their Revenge. With the same Courage, when <hi>Hannibal</hi> sent them the liberty to redeem Six Thousand <hi>Romans</hi> which he had taken, and which were Prisoners in his Camp, they scorn'd his Kindness; well knowing, that if Six Thousand Young-men had resolv'd to die bravely, they could not have been taken basely. So that it

was hard to say, which redounded most to their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny, that their Countrey had so little esteem and care of them, or that their Enemies shewed so little fear of them. But if at any time the Senate shew'd themselves severe in the maintenance of Military Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, certainly then they did it in a high measure, when they imprison'd the Souldiers that had rebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liously possess'd themselves of <hi>Rhegium,</hi> and <hi>Iubellius</hi> their Captain being dead, had of their own heads chosen <hi>M Caesius</hi> his Secretary for their Leader; and notwithstanding that <hi>M.

Some Commanders have requir'd Triumphs to be decreed them for light Battels: and therefore there was a Law made, that no Captain should triumph unless he had slain Five Thousand of his Enemies in one Set Field. For our Ancestors believ'd, that the Glory of our City consisted not in the Number, but in the Glory and Magnificence of her Triumphs. And lest so brave a Law might come to be obliterated by too greedy a desire of the Lawrel, it was supported with another Law, which <hi>L. Marius</hi> and <hi>M.

For that made it criminal for any Emperour to multiply in their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Senate, the number of Enemies slain or Citizens lost. And they were also commanded assoon as they enter'd into the City, to swear before the City-Questors to the truth of what they had written to the Senate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Having mention'd these Laws, it will be seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to relate what was adjudged thereupon, wherein the Right of Triumphing was discuss'd and debated among most worthy Personages. <hi>C. Lutatius</hi> the Consul and <hi>Q.

                     </gap>t of <hi>Sicily,</hi> whereupon the Senate decreed a Triumph to <hi>Lutatius</hi> the Consul. But when <hi>Valerius</hi> requested that a Triumph might be granted to him, <hi>Lutatius</hi> withstood it, lest through the honour of Triumph, the lesser Authority should be made equal to the greater. The contention grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing higher and higher, <hi>Valerius</hi> sues <hi>Lutatius,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Navy was not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by his Conduct. <hi>Lutatius</hi> puts in Sureties to answer. The Judge between them <hi>Atilius Calatinus</hi> meets, before whom <hi>Valerius</hi> pleads, that the Consul was lame and lay in his Litter, and that he perform'd all the Offices of the General. Then <hi>Calatinus</hi> before
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60321:51"/>
                     <hi>Lutatius</hi> made his defence: Tell me (said he) <hi>Valerius,</hi> if you two were of contrary opinions whether to fight or not, whether were the command of the Consul or the Pretor to be obey'd? <hi>Valerius</hi> answered, that he could not deny but the Consul was chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fly to be obey'd. Again, said <hi>Calatinus,</hi> if the Consuls and your Omens were different, which were first to be follow'd? The Consuls, replied <hi>Valerius.</hi> Then said the Judge, See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that upon these two Questions, about the Chief Command and the Priority of Omens, thou <hi>Valerius</hi> hast confest they Adversary to be superiour in both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am not to make any further doubt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Lutatius,</hi> though you have as yet made no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I give judgment on your behalf.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60321:51"/>
but out of their care of preserving the Right of the Law; whereby it was enacted, that Triumphs should be only decreed to those that had enlarged the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, not to those who had only recovered what was in the possession of the <hi>Roman</hi> People be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5. This Law whereof I speak was so carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that Triumphs were denied to <hi>P. Scipio</hi> and <hi>M. Marcellus,</hi> though the first had rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="6">6. In this place I am to adde, that it was the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome for the General that triumph'd to invite the Consuls to Supper, and for them so invited not to go; that no person on the Day of Triumph should appear of greater Authority, at the same Feast, than the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpher.</p>
                  <p n="7">7.

                  <p>I am grieved and weary of ripping up the Wounds of the Common-wealth. The Senate never gave to any one, nor did any one desire it, while the Fathers of the City wept. But every one stretched out his hand for the Oaken Garland, which was the Reward of him that had saved the Life of a Citizen.

                  <p>THe most indissoluble Cord of Military Discipline, and the strict observation of the same, admonish me to pass from thence to the Censorship, the Mistriss and Guardian of Peace. For as the wealth of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> by vertue of their Commanders, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creast to such a vastness; so their Modesty, Continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Conversations were examin'd by the Censors Severity. A work equalling the glory of Military Actions. For what avails it to be couragious abroad, and live ill at home? To take Cities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conquer Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and lay violent hands on Kingdoms, unless there be Reverence, Justice and Honour in the Courts of Law and Council? For unless that be, Riches hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped unto the Sky will have no stable Foundation. Necessary it is therefore to know these things, and to record the Acts of the Censors Authority.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Camillus</hi> and <hi>Posthumius,</hi> being Censors, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them that lived unmarried till they were old, to bring a sum of Money into the Treasury by way of Penalty: deeming them worthy of further punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they should complain of so just a Constitution.

of a Father and a Husband. Go therefore, said they, and pay that which may be useful to the numerous Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of others.</p>

But whether this Crime were greater than the former, I know not well to determine: though this may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e said, that by the former the sacred Rites of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were only contemn'd, by the latter injur'd. With great prudence therefore the Censors thought him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to have admission into the Senate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thus <hi>Portius Cato</hi> removed <hi>L.

He might have been forborn in respect of the Consulship which he had born, and the authority of his Brother <hi>T. Flaminius.</hi> But the Censor and <hi>Cato</hi> to shew a double example of Severity, thought him the rather to be degraded, because he had with so notorious and foul a crime defil'd the Majesty of so great and high an Authority; and that he had thought it a slight mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to give the same respect to the eyes of an Harlot delighted with humane Blood, and the suppliant hands of King <hi>Philip.</hi>

from the Senate, because he had abrogated a Law, whereby the costs of Banquets was limited, with very good reason for so doing. For how impudently did <hi>Duronius</hi> in the Pulpits for Orations utter these words! <hi>There are bridles put into your mouths, most worthy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, by no means to be endured.

                  <p n="6">6. Let us now produce a pair, linked together with the same Chain of Vertue, and society in goodness, yet dissenting when they came to be struck with the hook of Emulation. <hi>Claudius-Nero,</hi> and <hi>Livius Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator,</hi> in the second <hi>Punick</hi>-war, strong supports of the Commonwealth; yet how divided was their Censor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship! For when they numbered the Centuries of the Horse, of which number, by reason of the strength of their years, they themselves were, when they came to the <hi>Polian</hi> Tribe, the Cryer seeing the name of <hi>Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator,</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To whom if any of the Celestial Deities had signified that they in a long series of posterity should lay the foundation of our Guardian Princes Family, they would soon have entered into a strict League of indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluble kindness, being such as were to leave their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Country to thirty divided Off-spring.

                  <p n="1">1. For what could be more like a Monster than the Son of the Elder <hi>Scipio Africanus?</hi> who receiving his beginning from so Illustrious a Family, could endure to suffer himself to be taken by a small party of King <hi>Antiochus</hi>; when it had been better for him to have died a voluntary death, than between two the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Sirnames, the one obtained by the destruction of <hi>Africk,</hi> and the other got by the Conquest of <hi>Asia,</hi> to suffer his hands to be bound by the Enemy, and to be beholding to his mercy for a pitiful life, over whom <hi>Scipio</hi> was to obtain, in a small time, a Triumph, most glorious in the sight of Gods and men. Coming to claim the Pretorship, he appeared in the field with such a spotted and bedaub'd white Gown, that had it not been for the courtesie of <hi>Cicereus,</hi> who was his Father's Secretary, he would not have obtain'd the honour.

Which confidence grew from the assurance which he had, that all the Laws were by that means secur'd. I will not be tired with the relation of his Actions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, seeing that he himself was never wearied in the exercise thereof. <hi>P. Nevius</hi> Tribune of the People, or as some relate, the two <hi>Petellii,</hi> had prefix'd him a day to appear before the People; who appearing in great multitudes in the <hi>Forum,</hi> he ascended the Pulpit for Orations, and putting a Triumphal Crown upon his Head; <hi>This day,</hi> said he, <hi>most Noble</hi> Romans, <hi>did I compel</hi> Carthage, <hi>hoping great things, to submit to your Laws: And therefore I hold it just that you go with me to the Capitol, to give thanks to the Gods.</hi> Which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60321:75"/>
most splendid Speech of his had as noble a success. For immediately the whole Senate, the whole Order of Knights, and all the People follow'd him to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> The Tribune remained alone to plead to the people without the people, being deserted in the <hi>Forum</hi> with great contempt of his Calumny.

                  <p n="5">5. This was a warlike presence of minde, that which we relate, though in a person of the Gown, not less praiseworthy; which <hi>Furius Philus</hi> shewed in the Senate: For he compelled <hi>Quintus Metel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60321:76"/>
himself, yet never convicted of any Crime, at length reposed so much confidence in his Innocency, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publickly questioned, he made <hi>Gracchus</hi> his Judge, to whom he bare a singular hatred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Courage he abated the envy of his Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The same was the fortune of <hi>M. Scaurus,</hi> the same length of years, the same courage of minde: Who being accused before the Pulpits for Orations, that he had taken money of <hi>Mithridates</hi> to betray the Commonwealth, pleaded his Cause in this manner: <hi>It is unjust, O</hi> Romans, said he, <hi>that I who have lived among one sort of people, should come to give an account of my actions among another; yet I will dare to ask ye all, the greatest part of whom could not possibly be present at the Deeds which I have done, and the Honours which I have attain'd.</hi> Varius Suetonensis <hi>says that</hi> M. Scau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus <hi>brib'd by the King, has betray'd the Commonwealth: Whom of the two do you believe?</hi> The people mov'd with admiration of his Saying, with their loud Cries forced <hi>Varius</hi> to desist from his violent and mad prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Contrariwise did <hi>M. Antonius,</hi> the Eloquent man: For he, not by refusing, but by embracing his own defence, testified how innocent he was. Going Questor into <hi>Asia,</hi> he was on his Journey as far as <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusium</hi>; where being informed by Letters that he was accused of Incest before the Pretor <hi>Cassius,</hi> whose Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, because of his severity, was called the <hi>Rock of the Guilty,</hi> though he might have shun'd it by the benefit of the <hi>Memmian</hi> Law, which forbids the Names of them to be taken who are absent upon the Affairs of the Publick, yet he return'd to the City; by which advice of a good Confidence, he not onely obtained a quick absolution, but a honester departure.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. These that follow, are also splended Examples
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60321:76"/>
of noble Confidence. For in that War which was undertaken against <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> when the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had sent a Navy of an Hundred and Thirty Ships to <hi>Ostia,</hi> to the assistance of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Senate were pleased to send Messengers with Instructions to tell their Captain, that they did not use to enter into Wars which they were not able to carry on without the help of Strangers; and that therefore he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with his Navy to <hi>Carthage.</hi> The same Senate some few years after, when the <hi>Roman</hi> power was almost broken by the Overthrow at <hi>Cannae,</hi> sent a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit of Forces to the Army in <hi>Spain</hi>; whereby they shew'd, that although <hi>Hannibal</hi> was with his Army at the <hi>Capene</hi> Gate, how little they valued his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Thus to carry themselves in Adversity, what was it else, but to compel Fortune, overcome with shame, to return to their side?</p>
                  <p n="11">11. It is a great leap to descend from the Senate to the Poet <hi>Accius.</hi> But that we may pass from him more decently to forreign Examples, let us produce him. He, when <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> a great and powerful man came into the Colledge of Poets, would not so much as rise: not that he was forgetful of his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, but that he believed himself superiour in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of their Studies. And therefore not guilty of the Crime of Insolence, seeing the contest was about Volumes, not Statues.</p>

                  <p>THere remains the labour of Constancy, as it were due to him that has demonstrated an open and couragious breast endued with good Confidence: For Nature has provided that whoever believes himself to have comprehended any thing orderly and rightly in his minde, should stifly defend it, and put it into act against opposition; or if not done, should bring it to effect without delay maugre all resistance.</p>

But while I seek for an Example of what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, looking about me at a distance, before all the rest, the Constancy of <hi>Fulvius Flaccus</hi> offers it self. He at that time held <hi>Capua,</hi> which through the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promises of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> had resolv'd by their vile Revolt to put the Kingdom of <hi>Italy</hi> into the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours hands. Having therefore made a true value of the Enemies Crime, he purposed with himself wholly to extirpate the Senate of <hi>Capua,</hi> who were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of that wicked Decree. To this intent he sent them all to <hi>Theana,</hi> and <hi>Calena,</hi> laden with Chains,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60321:79"/>
into two several Prisons, resolving to execute his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, when he had done some other things which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a more necessary speed. In the mean time a Rumour being spread of more favourable Proceedings being intended toward them, left they should escape their deserved punishment, he took horse in the night-time, posts to <hi>Theana,</hi> where he put to death all that were in custody there; thence hasting to <hi>Calena,</hi> he finish'd the work of his severe Resolution: For though while yet the <hi>Campanians</hi> were bound to the stake, he had received Letters in favour of them, he notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing kept the Letters as he re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eived them in his left hand, commanding the Lictor to do his duty; nor would he open them, till he knew it was too late to obey them. By which Constancy of his he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted the glory of a Victory: For if we make his Estimate by dividing the praise between himself, we shall finde him greater in <hi>Capua</hi> punish'd, than in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua</hi> taken.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This was a Constancy is Severity; that which follows, a most admirable Constancy in piety, which <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> render'd indefatigable for the good of his Country. He told out the Money to <hi>Hannibal</hi> for the Captives; being publickly defrauded of it, he said nothing. The Senate had made <hi>Minutius</hi> Master of the Horse, equal to him in Authory, he held his tongue. And although provoked with many other injuries, he persisted in the same habit of minde; nor would ever give his passion liberty to be angry with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, so stedfast was the love he bare to his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. In his managing the War, was not his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy the same? The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire broken at the overthrow at <hi>Cannae,</hi> seem'd scarce able to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Army; and therefore believing it to be better to delay and weary the force of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> than to come to Handy-blows with all his power,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60321:79"/>
though provoked with the frequent taunts of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> though he had many times a fair opportunity of well succeeding offer'd, yet he would never recede from his own wholesome deliberations, not so much as to the hazard of a Skirmish; and which is most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, he every where appear'd to be Superiour both to Anger and Hope. And therefore as <hi>Scipio</hi> by figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, so he by not fighting reliev'd his Country: For the one ruin'd <hi>Carthage</hi> by his Celerity, the other by his delay took care that <hi>Rome</hi> should not be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

By the following Narration it will also appear, that <hi>Gaius Piso</hi> being Consul at a time of much turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and combustion in the Commonwealth, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself with a wonderful Constancy. The fury of the people being highly moved by the delusions of <hi>M. Palicanus,</hi> a seditious person, endeavour'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a most foul, act at the great Assembly for choosing Consuls, intending to have given into his hands a most large Power, whose vile actions requir'd rather the utmost severity of punishment, than any the least mark of Honour. Nor was the furious flame of the Tribunes Authority wanting to incense the amazed Multitude. In this miserable and shameful condition of the City, <hi>Piso</hi> being plac'd before the Pulpit for Orations, though not by the hands of the Tribunes, and all flocking about him; and demanding of him whether he would declare <hi>Palicanus</hi> Consul, now chosen by the Suffrages of the People, answered; First, that he did not believe the Commonwealth had been overwhelm'd with so much darkness, as to act a thing so unworthy. And when the People still press'd him to declare the Election, crying out <hi>If it were unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily done, let it be so,</hi> he replied, <hi>I will make no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</hi> With which short Answer he bare away the Consulship from <hi>Palicanus,</hi> before he had obtain'd

it. Thus <hi>Piso</hi> contemn'd many terrible hazards, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainining to renounce the well-grounded rigour of his mind.</p>

calls them both before him; the one to justifie, the other to defend what he stood accused of.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60321:83"/>
of praise; and therefore let us shew the effects thereof in men of Fame.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And that I may begin from the Cradle of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>P. Valerius,</hi> who for the honour he bore the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of the people, was called <hi>Poblicola</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who after Kingship was driven out of <hi>Rome,</hi> seeing the whole stress of their power, the Ensignes of their Authority translated to himself under the Title of Consul, he reduced the envious height of Magistracy to a Habit easily to be endured. He made the <hi>Fasces</hi> give way to the <hi>Axes,</hi> in all publick Assemblies laying them down at the feet of the people: he brought the number of the <hi>Fasces</hi> to be less by one half, and of his own accord took <hi>Lucretius</hi> to be his Colleague in Authority; before whom, because he was the Elder, he caused the <hi>Fasces</hi> to be carried first. He also enacted a Law in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of the Hundreds, That no Magistrate should strike or kill a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen; so that the freer the Condition of the City was, the more he by little and little extenuated his own Authority. He also pulled down his own house, because that being seated in a higher part of the City, it seemed to have the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a Castle. Thus lower in his house, did he not appear higher in his glory?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I can no sooner forsake <hi>Poblicola,</hi> but I am pleas'd in coming to <hi>Furius Camillus</hi>: Whose Translation and change from great Ignominies to highest Command, was so moderate, that when his Fellow-Citizens, after that <hi>Rome</hi> was taken by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> required his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, being then an Exile in <hi>Ardea,</hi> he had no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner began his Journey to <hi>Veii,</hi> there to take charge of the Army, but that he understood all things were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in most solemn manner in relation to his being made Dictator. Magnificent was the <hi>Veientine</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of <hi>Camillus,</hi> famous was his Victory over the <hi>Gauls,</hi> but much more admirable that his Pause: for it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60321:84"/>
was a harder labour for him to overcome himself than the Enemy; neither avoiding adversity with too much haste, nor meeting adversity with too much joy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Equal to <hi>Furius</hi> in Moderation, was <hi>Marcius Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius Censorinus:</hi> For being a second time created Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, he called the people together to an Assembly, and in a Speech most sharply reprehended them, that they had twice conferred that Office upon him; seeing that their Ancestors thought rather fit to abridge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the time of holding the same, as being too great for one man. Both did well, bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h <hi>Censorinus</hi> and the people: for the one instructed them to bestow their high Honour with Moderation, the other intrusted themselves in the hands of a moderate person.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Go to! <hi>L. Quinctius Cincinna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5. But <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> having observ'd that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had been Consul five times, and oftner by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Grandfather, and Great-Grandfather, at the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the People, where his Son was created Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul, pleaded very hard with the people, That they would permit a vacation of Honour to the Family of the <hi>Fabii:</hi> Not that he did mistrust the Vertues of his Son, for he was a person of great Honour, but that the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Honour of the Commonwealth should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in one Family. What more powerful than this Moderation, that could so overcome his Fatherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which are generally so strong in Parents?</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:60321:84"/>6. There was no Gratitude wanting among our Ancestors to give the rewards due to the Elder <hi>African</hi>; seeing that they have endeavoured to adorn his greatest Enterprizes with equal Honours. Willing they were to place his Statue in the great Halls of Justice, and Publick Assemblies, over the <hi>Rostra</hi> in the Court; and in the Temple of <hi>Iupiter</hi> himself, they were willing to adorn his Statue with Triumphal Habits, and lay it upon the Cushions or Beds of the Gods in the Capitol. They would have given him the Consulship as long as he lived, or a perpetual Dictatorship. But he not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during any Act of the People, nor Edict of the Senate to pass in his behalf, carried himself with more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in refusing those Honours, than he had got in obtaining them.</p>
                  <p>With the same strength of mind he defended the Cause of <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the Senate, when his own Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens by their Ambassadors accused him of raising Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among um. Adding, that it did not become the Conscript Fathers to meddle in the affairs of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>; with a most high moderation consulting the safety of the one, and the dignity of the other; which amounted to a Victory, while both seemed to act the parts of an Enemy.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi> who was the first that taught that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> could be vanquished, and <hi>Syracuse</hi> taken, when in the time of his Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the <hi>Syracusans</hi> came into the City to complain against him, he would not permit the Senate to hear the Cause, because his Colleague was by chance absent, lest the <hi>Sicilians</hi> should grow fearful or remiss in their Accusation: But assoon as his Partner retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he himself was the first that put the Senate in mind of calling in the <hi>Syracusans</hi>; and patiently heard them while they made their Complaints. And though they were commanded by <hi>Levinus</hi> to depart, yet he
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60321:85"/>
caused them to stay, that they might be present at his defence. Afterwards when both parties had been heard, he followed them going out of the Court, that the Senate might be the more free in passing their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. And when their Accusations were rejected, he courteously embraced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hem, suppliantly entreating him to receive them into his protection. Moreover, having drawn <hi>Sicily</hi> by Lot, he yielded that Province to his Colleague. And indeed so often may the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>Marcellus</hi> be varied, as he made use of various degrees of Moderation toward his Associates.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. How admirable did <hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> render himself! For being Tribune of the People, though he bare a profess'd hatred to the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s both <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Asiatic</hi>; yet when the <hi>Asiatic Scipio</hi> not being able to pay the Money wherein he was condemn'd, was therefore by the Consul commanded to be carried to Prison, upon his appeal to the Colledge of Tribunes, when no man would intercede for him, he dissenting and departing from the Colledge, made a Decree: And when every one thought that in the writing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he would have us'd the words and expressions of an angry enemy; In the first place he swore that he was not friends with <hi>Scipio,</hi> and then recited this Decree of his own framing: <hi>That whereas</hi> Cornelius Scipio <hi>had cast into Prison the Captains of the Enemy, led before his Chariot on the day of his Triumph; it was unworthy and unbecoming the Majesty of the</hi> Roman <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he should be led thither himself. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would not suffer it to be done.</hi> Then willingly the <hi>Roman</hi> People saw how <hi>Gracchus</hi> had deceived them in their opinion, and extoll'd his Moderation with deserved Praise.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Claudius Nero,</hi> is also to be number'd among the choice Examples of principal <hi>Moderation.</hi> He was partner in glory with <hi>Livius Salinator</hi> in the defeat
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60321:85"/>
of <hi>Asdrubal.</hi> Yet he chose rather to follow him tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing on Horseback, than to accept of that honour of Triumph, which the Senate had equally decreed to him; because the action was perform'd in <hi>Salinator</hi>'s Province. Wherefore he triumph'd without a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, so much the more renownedly, because only the Victory of the one, but the Moderation of the other was thereby commended.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Nor does the Younger <hi>Africanus</hi> suffer us to pass him by in silence: Who being Censor, when he mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster'd the Army, and in the Sacrifice then wont to be made, the Scribe was also singing a solemn Hymn of Praise set down in the Books, the Gods were suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to prosper and advance the affairs of the <hi>Roman</hi> People: <hi>They are,</hi> said he, <hi>in a condition good and great enough, and therefore I desire the Gods to preserve them safe as they are.</hi> And therefore ordered the Song to be mended accordingly in the publick Records. Which Modesty the Censors when they muster'd ever after us'd in their Prayers. Prudently believing, that then the increase of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was to be fought, when they fought for Triumphs but Seven Miles from the City. But when they now possessed the greatest part of the World, that it was a piece of over-Covetousness to desire more. Being happy if they lost nothing of what they had already won.</p>
                  <p>Nor did his Moderation appear less in his Censor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship before the Tribunal. For when he was mustering the Centuries of the Hors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Scaevola,</hi> a most excellent Personage: For being produced as a witness against a Criminal, when he had answered that which seemed to make much against the party, he added at his going away, that they ought not to give him onely Credit, unless many others did aver the same thing; for that to believe the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of one, seem'd to be of a very evil Example: Whereby he produced that Faith which was due to his Sinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I am sensible what Citizens, what Deeds and Sayings of theirs I am forced to comprehend in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compass of Oration; but when many and great things are to be spoken concerning the renown of great men, there is no relation comprehending infinite persons and transactions that can perform both.

the correction of <hi>Plato</hi> should deserve the same repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension: which makes me no less wonder that he was so constantly moderate toward <hi>Zenocrates</hi> his Scholar. <hi>Plato</hi> was informed that he had spoken ill of him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times. He without hesitation slighted the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Informer very seriously asked him, Why he did not believe him? who replied, That it was not credible that he whom he loved so well should not love him as well again. At length when the envie of the Make-bate confirm'd his story with Oaths, he affirm'd, That he did not believe him perjur'd; however, if <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates</hi> did say such things of him, he would not have said them, but that he thought it convenient to speak so.

                  <p>WHich being demonstrated by many and most renowned presidents, let us pass to a most rare Affection of the Mind, or the course of Hatred to Friendship, and let us pursue it in a pleasant Style. For if the boisterous Sea prove calm, and the stormy Sky appear with a serene aspect, and War making a change for Peace, be no small cause of comfort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the asswagement of the bitterness of Hatred is to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated with a candid Narration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Marcus Aemilius Lepidus,</hi> twice Consul, and high Priest, equal in the Splendor of his Honours to the Gravity of his Life, bare an inveterate and continued Hatred to <hi>Fulvius Flaccus,</hi> a person of the same digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which assoon as they were both declared Censors together, he laid aside in the Field. Believing it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable for those to be at private difference, who were coupled together in Supreme publick Authority.

That judgment of his mind the present Age hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and the old Writers of Annals have recorded to us as a thing most worthy of applause.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now would they let the illustrious advice of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Salinator</hi> for the ending of Quatrels be unknown to Posterity. For though he went into Exile with a burning hatred against <hi>Claudius Nero,</hi> anger'd at the testimony which he gave against him; yet when the People has recall'd him, and made him Farmer with <hi>Nero</hi> in the Consulship, he commanded himself to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his own disposition, which was most fiery, and the heavy injury which he had received.

                     </gap>p of Government, through the inward disaffection of his mind, he should have acted the part of an evil Consul, by shewing his hatred to his Enemy. Which inclination of his mind to a better disposition, in an unsafe and difficult conjuncture of affairs, wrought no small advantage to the City and all <hi>Italy</hi>; while they supported with an equal strength of vertue, were the first that broke the force and turn'd the fortune of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. A fair Example also we finde in the Elder <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> and <hi>T. Gracchus</hi> of Enmity laid aside. For at the sacred Rites of that Table, to which they came with a boyling Hatred each to other, from the same Table they departed entire Friends. For <hi>Scipio,</hi> at the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Senate, not contented to enter into Friendship with <hi>Gracchus</hi> in the Capitol, at the Feast of <hi>Iupiter</hi>; he there also espoused his Daughter <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This gentile humour appear'd chiefly in <hi>M. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>: For he most vehemently defended <hi>A.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Scipio</hi> in the twenty fourth year of his Age, having taken <hi>New Carthage</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and conceiving

in his mind prosperous hopes of taking the greater <hi>Carthage,</hi> had regained into his power many Hostages, which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> kept close in that Town, and among the rest a Virgin of most surpassing Beauty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in years, though he were young, unmarried and a Conquerour, yet understanding that she was of a Noble Family among the <hi>Celtiberians,</hi> and affianced to <hi>Indibilis,</hi> one of the Princes of that Countrey, he sent for her Parents and her Spouse, and delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd to her own Friends, adding to her Dowry the Gold that was brought for her Ransome. Which Continency and Bounty of his so moved <hi>Indibilis,</hi> that he wrought with the <hi>Celtiberians</hi> to take part with the <hi>Romans,</hi> thereby approving himself truly grateful for so great a favour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As <hi>Spain</hi> was a witness of this mans Abstinence, so did <hi>Epirus, Achaia,</hi> The <hi>Cyclade</hi> Islands, the Sea-Coast of <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> give testimony to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence of <hi>Cato</hi>: From whence when he had the charge of sending great sums of Money, he carried himself as free from Wantonness, as from desire of Gain, though he had opportunity enough to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate in both: For the Royal Treasure was all at his charge, and he was forced every where to take up his Lodgings in Cities the most fruitful of all pleasures. And this is testified in writing by <hi>Minatius Rufus,</hi> his faithful Companion in the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Expedition.

Senate shew'd their gratitude, and the exact discipllne of our Ancestors. For what they had laid up in the Treasury was restor'd to the Embassadours not only by the Decree of the Senate, but by the consent of the People, which was by the Questors with the same willingness paid. Thus the Liberality of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the Abstinence of the Embassadours, the Equity of the Senate and People, had in all an equal share of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause.</p>

And therefore when he travell'd through the Countries of his Associates and Allies, and other forraign Nations, they were not accompted his Slaves, but his Victories. Nor did men consider how much Gold and Silver, but how much weight of worth he bare about him.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. This Continence appear'd in the very breasts of the generality of the People, but it shall suffice to relate two Examples of ages far distant one from another. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> when he saw the violence of his fury at a stand, &amp; that the hearts of his <hi>Epirotes</hi> began to fail, designing to purchase the good will of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, whose Vertue he could not overcome, had transported almost all the wealth of his Treasures into our City. But when his Embassadours went from House to House with great Gifts fit for the use of Men and Women, they could not finde a door open to them. Thus the more stout than prosperous defender of the <hi>Tarentine</hi> petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie, was repulsed and defeated as well by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes as Arms of the City; nor can I determine which was the greatest Victory.

wonderful was the abstinence of the People.

                  <p>THat Children are the greatest Ornaments to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, we finde written by <hi>Pomponius Rufus</hi> in his Book of Collections, in these words. When a <hi>Campanian</hi> Lady lying at the House of <hi>Cornelia,</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> shewed her her Jewels and other Ornaments, which were the fairest of any in that time, <hi>Cornelia</hi> held her in discourse till her Children return'd from School. <hi>And these,</hi> quoth she, when they appeared, <hi>are my Ornaments.</hi> For he hath all things that covets nothing, and much more certainly than he that possesses all things. For great Estates many times fail, but a good Habit of Minde is above the violence of Fortune. And therefore what matters it, whether we put Riches in the highest part of Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, or Poverty in the lowest degree of Misery? Especially when the chearful countenance of Wealth is full of many conceal'd Bitternesses; and the more
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60321:95"/>
rugged and deformed aspect of Poverty many times abounds with many sure and solid Contents.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The pride of <hi>Tarquin</hi> having put an end to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Government, <hi>Valerius Publicola</hi> with <hi>Iunius Brutus</hi> his Colleague auspiciously began the Office of Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

The same person having afterwards born three Consulships to the great content of the People, and by many and most renowned Actions having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged the Grandeur of his Nobility: And yet this great Pillar of History died, not leaving a Patrimony sufficient for the expences of his Funeral, which were therefore defray'd at the Publick charge. It imports not to make any farther search into the Poverty of so great a Person, for it is apparent what he possessed when he lived, though being dead he wanted both a Bier and Funeral-Pile.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may well guess how high in Dignity <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa Menenius</hi> was, whom the Senate and People chose Arbitrator of their differences, and to make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween um. For how great ought he to be, who was Umpire of the publick Safety? This man, unless the People had gathered among themselves the sixth part of a Penny to make up the Sum, could not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed his meer Funeral-Expences, dying so poor that he wanted for the decency of Burial; and therefore the City divided by pernicious Sedition, were content to be reconcil'd by the Ghosts of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who though they were poor, yet they had observed them to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously sincere. Who as he had nothing while he lived that could be publikly taxed, yet being deceas'd had the Concord and Unity of the City for his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I cannot deny but that there was Silver in the Houses of <hi>Caius Fabricius</hi> and <hi>Q. Emilius Papus,</hi> the most principal men of their times. But <hi>Fabricius</hi> seem'd the more prodigal, because he had a Horn-fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. They were also certainly very rich who were call'd from the Plough to be made Consuls; for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures sake they plough'd the sandy and barren Soil of <hi>Pupinia,</hi> and ignorant of delicacy scatter'd those vast clods with c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5. They who were sent by the Senate to call <hi>Atilius</hi> to undertake the Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, found him sowing in his Garden; but those hands, hardned with Countrey-labour, establish'd the safety of the Common-wealth, and defeated mighty Armies of the Enemies; and those hands that lately held the Plough, now hold the reins of the Triumphant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot: Nor was he asham'd, when he had laid down his Ebony Staff, to return again to the Plough Tail. Well may <hi>Atilius</hi> comfort the Poor, but much more instruct the Rich, how little the troublesome care of gathering Riches, advantages the true desire of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing solid Honour.</p>

Wife. The minds of Men and Women were then most noble in the City, and the worth of every Man was then in all things weighed against his Goods and Estate. For every one made it his business to serve his Country, not himself: And they rather chose po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty in a rich Empire, than riches in a poor Empire. And to this noble resolution that reward was given, that it was not lawful to buy any of those things which were due to Vertue; and the wants of Illustrious Men were supply'd out of the publick Stock.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And therefore, when <hi>Cneus Scipio</hi> had written out of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Senate, desiring that a successor might be sent him, for that he had a daughter now fit for marriage, and that no portion could be provided for her, without he were present: The Senate, lest the Commonwealth should loose a good Captain, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the office of a Father, and having with the advice of his Wife and Relations agreed upon the Portion, caused it to be paid out of the publick Treasury. The Portion was two thousand pieces of brass mony: whereby not only appears the kindness of the <hi>Conscript Fathers,</hi> but the usual measure of the ancient Estates may be guessed at. For they were so small, that <hi>Tatia</hi> the daughter of <hi>Cato</hi> was said to have brought her Husband an exceeding Portion, when she brought him ten thousand pieces of brass mony. And <hi>Megullia,</hi> that entred her husbands house with fifty thousand pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of brass mony, was called for that reason, the <hi>Maid with the Portion.</hi> And therefore the Senate vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the daughters of <hi>Fabricius Luscinus,</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> from being portionless, by their own Liberality, seeing their Parents had nothing to give them but their wealthy honours.</p>

men to neglect their own private Estates, and to have regard only to the publick. A vertue worthy, that to her should be Temples rear'd and consecrated, as to a Celestial Numen; as being the Parent of all good Counsel, the Guardianess of the most solemn Offices, the Mistress of Innocency; dear to her own, accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Strangers, and in all places, and at all times, carrying a favourable Aspect.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But that we may return from the praises to the actions thereof, from the first building of the City, to the time that <hi>Africanus</hi> and <hi>T. Longus</hi> were Consuls, the Senate and People sate at the beholding all Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and shews promiscuously together: yet not one of the people would venture to take place before any of the Senate. So circumspect was the modesty of our Citizens; a most certain experiment whereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd on that day, when <hi>T. Flaminius</hi> being by the Censor removed from the Senate, was contended to stand in the hindermost part of the Theater, though he had been Consul, and was the brother of <hi>Flaminius</hi> the Vanquisher of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon.</hi> Which the people no sooner beheld, but they compelled him to take that place which his Dignity required.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> gave a great wound to the Commonwealth, by his rash giving battle at <hi>Cannae.</hi> Yet by his refusing to take upon him the Dictatorship, which after that was decreed him by the full consent of the Senate and People; by his bashful modesty, made satisfaction for the fault of a most fatal overthrow: and through his modest behavior, made them impute the publick Calamity, not to him, but to the anger of the Gods.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us behold a more famous piece of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty. Fortune, not without great envy, had brought <hi>Cn. Scipio,</hi> the son of the elder <hi>Africanus,</hi> together with <hi>Cicereius</hi> the Scribe, into the Common Hall for
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60321:98"/>
Election of Pretors; and very much reprehended he was, that he had abused the Nobility and authority of so great a person, by appearing at such an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. But <hi>Cicereius</hi> turned his crime to his praise. For when he saw himself preferr'd by all the Centuries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Scipio,</hi> he went out of the Temple, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off his Candidates Garment, came in again and gave his voice for <hi>Scipio.</hi> Being more willing to yield the Pretorship to the memory of <hi>Africanus,</hi> than to Challenge it for himself. Nor was the reward of his Modesty small; for though <hi>Scipio</hi> obtained the Pretor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, yet <hi>Cicereius</hi> was more applauded.</p>

The adoration of Felicity, being to be attributed more to Flattery than Love, is full of Suspicion, and still desires more than it expends. For men of unshaken fortunes more desire friends, either for a guard, or for their society.

For the Friendship of the one consum'd away in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Luxury and Delight; but the mutual Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the other, in a sad and hard condition, grew famous by the trial of their Miseries.

And therefore all people waited the event of an accident so new and rare.

pardon to so much Fidelity; farther desiring them to receive him into the Society of their Friendship, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising a most strict observance thereof. Such is the power of Friendship, to beget contempt of Death, take away the sweet desire of Life, tame Cruelty, turn Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Love, and to reward Punishment with Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: to which there is almost as much worship due, as to the Ceremonies of the Gods.

Who being possess'd of the Camp of <hi>Darius,</hi> where all his Relations and Kindred were, he came with <hi>Ephestion</hi> most of all belov'd by him covering his side, to speak to them. At whose approach the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Darius</hi> taking heart, lifting up her Head as she lay prostrate upon the ground, saluted <hi>Ephestion,</hi> flattering after the manner of the <hi>Persians,</hi> mistaking him for <hi>Alexander,</hi> because he was more amiable for his Stature and Beauty. But being made sensible of her errour, in great fear she sought for words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it. <hi>There is no reason,</hi> replyed <hi>Alexander, to be troubled for this, for this is another</hi> Alexander <hi>also.</hi> Whom shall we congratulate? him that said it, or him that heard it? While the King endued with a great Soul, having already grasp'd the whole World, either by his Victories, or in his thoughts, in so few words made so equal a division of it to his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. O the Gift of a Royal Tongue, as fair to the Receiver as to the Giver! Which I reverence as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man, having had the experience of the Bounty of a most wise and renowned person toward my self. And I do not doubt but it may become me to think my <hi>Pompey</hi> to be like <hi>Alexander</hi>; while he will have

his <hi>Ephestion</hi> to be another <hi>Alexander.</hi> And therefore I should be lyable to a very great errour, to pass over the Example of constant and kind Friendship, without any mention of him: in whose minde, as in the breast of most loving Parents, my prosperous condition of Life hath flourish'd my Misfortunes have remain'd contented. From whom I have received all increase of profit freely offer'd; by whom I have stood more firmly against mishap; who by his own prosperous Conduct and good Omens, hath render'd our Studies more pleasant and delightful. And therefore I fed the envy of some with the loss of my best friend, dividing my kindness, such as it was, to some that knew not how to make use of it. But there is no Prosperity so modest, that can escape the teeth of Envy. But in what retirement are some to be avoided, with what allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of kindness canst thou restrain their inveteracy? There is no remedy but they will rejoyce and be tickled at the misfortunes of others, as well as at their own good.

                  <p>LEt us recal our work, that had straid in a pious Digression, in exposing our own discontents, to its former course, and now take <hi>Liberality</hi> into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; which hath two probable Fountains, true Judgment, and honest Benevolence. For when it springs from these, then only is it duely founded: A Gift being acceptable for its greatness, but somewhat more efficacious, when it is seasonable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Beyond the price of the thing, we find a most inestimable moment of an opportunity, which with the expence of a small sum of Money rendr'd <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> highly applauded so many Ages since. He had received the Captives from <hi>Hannibal,</hi> upon a Contract for so much Money. Which when the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate would not stand to, sending his Son to the City, he sold the only Farm which he had in the world, and presently sent <hi>Hannibal</hi> the Money. If we consider the Sum, but small, as being the price but of seven Acres of Land, and those lying in <hi>Pupinia</hi>; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Soul of the Giver, a most large sum, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60321:106"/>
far exceeding the Money. For he would rather want his Patrimony, than that his Countrey should be poor in Credit. So much the more to be commended, as it is a more certain signe of a real meaning, to stretch beyond ability, rather than to do the same act out of superfluity. For the one can do what he performs, the other more than he is able.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Therefore a Woman of the same time, <hi>Busa</hi> by name, the richest in the Countrey of <hi>Apulia,</hi> won her self an ample testimony of Liberality; though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not so great, if we compare her flowing Riches to the Poverty of the <hi>Fabians.</hi> For though she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved about Ten Thousand of our Citizens, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the Battle of <hi>Cannae,</hi> within the Walls of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nusium,</hi> yet she shewed her self munificent to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> without prejudice to her Estate. But <hi>Fabius</hi> for the good of his Countrey exchang'd Poverty for Want.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We finde also in <hi>Quinctus Considius</hi> a most whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Example of Liberality, not without some profit to himself. Who when the Fury of <hi>Catiline</hi> had put all the Commonwealth into such a tumult, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now they who act with rigour in business of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when they carry bloody Money home, may hence learn to know, with what 'an accursed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious joy they rejoyce, if they do not loath to read the Decree of the Senate, which gave <hi>Considius</hi> publick thanks.</p>

They also took care to send him Gifts by the Questor every day; and by these degrees of kindness advanced him from Expulsion to the Royal Throne.

For when the <hi>Gentobricenses</hi> had opposed the Sons of <hi>Rhetogenes,</hi> who had fled to him, against all the shot of the Engine, lest the Children should be cruelly kill'd in the fight of their Father (though <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togenes</hi> himself bid him not fear to go on with his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery for all that) he rais'd his Siege. By which act of Clemency, though he took not one City, yet he took the hearts of all the <hi>Celtiberians,</hi> and thereby so far prevailed, as not to want many Hostages to keep them faithful to the <hi>Roman</hi> people.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Splendidly also did the Humanity of the Elder <hi>African</hi> appear, who having taken the City of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> sent to all the Cities of <hi>Sicily,</hi> to fetch the Ornaments of their Temples, which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had taken from them, and to take care to restore them to their proper places. A Kindness acceptable both to Gods and Men.</p>

                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:60321:111"/>
sent him a Boy of a very excelling Beauty, and very well habited; whom when he understood to be lest an Orphan by his Father, and educated under the tuition of his Uncle <hi>Massanisa,</hi> and that without his leave he had immaturely tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore having bestowed a Ring, a Gold Button, and a broad emboss'd Tunick, a <hi>Spanish</hi> Jacket, and a Horse with all Furniture upon him, he sent him to <hi>Massanisa</hi> with a Convoy to attend him. The <hi>Romans</hi> believing these to be the greatest fruits of Victory, to restore the Temples their Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Kings their Kindred.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Nor is the Memory of <hi>L. Paulus</hi> to be forgot, who when he heard that <hi>Perseus,</hi> a Captive now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a King, was brought before him, went to meet him in all the Ornaments of a <hi>Roman</hi> General, and with his right hand rais'd up the King, endeavouring to cast himself at his feet, and in the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue bid him be of good chear; and bringing him into his Tent, caus'd him to sit next him in Council, not thinking him below the honour of his Table. Range the Army in view, which conquer'd <hi>Perseus,</hi> and the Story which I have related, it may be doubted which sight would be most delectable. For though it be a renowned thing to overcome an Enemy, yet is it no less praise-worthy to take compassion of him in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. This Humanity of <hi>L. Paulus</hi> teaches me not to forget the Clemency of <hi>Cn. Pompey</hi>: Who having overthrown <hi>Tigranes</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> who not only made cruel Wars with the <hi>Romans</hi> himself, but also protected <hi>Mithridates,</hi> a most inveterate Enemy to our City, would not suffer him to lye prostrate at his

feet; but giving him words of comfort, caus'd him to put the Diadem, which he had cast away, upon his Head again. And having laid certain commands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, restor'd him to his former Dignity.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. How noble an Example of Clemency afforded was <hi>Cn. Pompey,</hi> how miserable an Example of Pity desired! For he that had impal'd the Brows of <hi>Tigranes</hi> with Regal Ornaments, his Head dispoyl'd of Three Triumphal Crowns, could not finde a Burial-place in that, which was but now, his own world: But cut from his Body, wanting a Funeral Pile, was presented as a Gift of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Perfidie, lamentable in the very eyes of the Victor. For assoon as <hi>Caesar</hi> beheld it, forgetful of his Enemy, he put on the Countenance of a Father-in-law; and then, as became himself, he caus'd the Head of <hi>Pompey</hi> to be burnt with most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Odours, and paid his Tears to the memory of him and his Daughter. For if the mind of that divine Prince had not been so tender, He that a little before was accompted the Pillar of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire (so Fortune turns the scales of Humane Affairs) had lain uninterr'd. <hi>Caesar</hi> also hearing of the Death of <hi>Cato,</hi> was heard to say, <hi>That he envied</hi> Cato's <hi>glory, as</hi> Cato <hi>had envied his</hi>; giving his Estate safe and whole to his Children. And certainly it would have been no small part of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s divine endeavours, to have been the safety of <hi>Cato.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. And certainly the Soul of <hi>Mark Antonie</hi> did not want the knowledg of equal Humanity. For he gave the Body of <hi>Mar. Brutus</hi> to his Freeman to bury. And that he might be the more honourably burnt, caused him to be covered with his own Imperial Robe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving him as he lay, not an Enemy, but a Citizen, all hatred now forgotten. And when he understood the Freeman had taken away the Imperial Garment, in great anger he commanded him to be punished, using

The same Personage also yielding not to any Mortal, but to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Fortune, though faint with the violence of his distemper, yet leaning upon his Elbow, he reacht out his right Hand to all that would take their leaves of him. Who would not run to embrace that hand, which now opprest by Fate, sufficed to embrace an Army, with an Humanity as vivacious as his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Humanity is of no robust nature, yet we may
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60321:112"/>
declare the Clemency of <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Athens</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who when a Youngman inflamed with the Love of his Daughter, meeting her in the Street, kist her; and being therefore desired by his Wife to punish him, made answer, <hi>If we punish those that love us, what must we do to those that hate us?</hi> A worthy Saying; to which we must adde, that it came out of the mouth of a Tyrant.</p>
                     <p>Thus he took the affront offered his Daughter; thus the injury done to himself more commendably. For being incessantly taunted and reviled by his friend <hi>Thrasippus</hi> at Table, he so restrained his anger and his tongue, as if he had been one of the Guard reviled by the Tyrant: and as he went away, thinking he had retired sooner than ordinary for fear, he kindly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him to stay. <hi>Thrasippus</hi> being in the heat of his drink, spit all in his face, and yet he could not move him to revenge. He pull'd away his Sons also, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to intercede for the abuses of him that was their Father. The next morning when <hi>Thrasippus</hi> intended to punish himself with a violent death, the Tyrant came to him, and giving him his faith that he should still remain in the same degree of favour with him, kept him from the execution of his purpose. Had he done nothing else worthy of honour or memory, yet by these very acts of his he had sufficiently recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himself to Posterity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Patient and gentle also was the mind of King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> Who hearing that some of the <hi>Tarentines</hi> at a great Feast has spoken largely in his disgrace, he call'd for those that were present, and demanded of them, if they had spoken those things which he had been told. Whereupon one of them made answer, <hi>If our Wine had not fail'd us, those things which we spoke of thee, would have been but baubles and trifles, to what we should have said.</hi> This so pleasant excuse of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60321:113"/>
their Drunkenness, and simple confession of the truth, turn'd the Kings Anger into laughter; by which Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of his he so far prevailed, that the sober <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> gave him thanks, and those that had been drunk wish'd him well. The same height of Humanity caused him to send <hi>Mico</hi> with a Convoy for the greater safety of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ambassadours, whom he heard were coming toward him for the redemption of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. And for their more honourable reception, he himself with a Body of Horse richly attired went out of the Camp to meet them. Not so much corrupted with the success of Prosperity, as to hinder all prospect of respect from them with whom he was at greatest Enmity.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Of which mild temper he received the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the last hour of his death. For when he had invaded the City of <hi>Argos</hi> with most dismal Omens, and that <hi>Alcyoneus</hi> the Son of King <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> had brought his head cut off, with great joy, as a most happy act of Victory to his Father, labouring in the defence of the City; <hi>Antigonus</hi> rebuking his Son for insulting over the ruine of so great a man, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of humane Calamity, took up his Head from the ground, and cover'd it with the Hood wherewith his own head was cover'd, after the manner of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi> and caused it, being return'd to the body, to be honourably burnt. And when his Son <hi>Helenus</hi> was brought a prisoner to him, he commanded him to bear a Royal Minde, and to continue his Regal Habit, and moreover gave him the bones of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> inclosed in a Golden Chest, to carry into his Countrey of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> to his Brother <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The <hi>Campanians</hi> also, when our Army was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by the <hi>Samnites</hi> to pass under Gallowses at <hi>Caudium,</hi> entring their City not only unarmed but naked, received them as kindly as if they had enter'd
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60321:113"/>
in Triumph, bearing the Spoils of their enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Immediately presenting the Consul with all the Ensignes of his Honour, and bestowing upon the Souldiers Cloaths, Arms, Horses and Provision, taking away the want and deformity of the <hi>Roman</hi> overthrow. Had they been as constant against <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> for the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, they had not given an occasion for the rage of the cruel Axes.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Having made mention of a most bitter Enemy, with those actions of kindness which he performed to the <hi>Romans,</hi> I shall make an end of the subject in hand. For <hi>Hannibal</hi> having sought the body of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius Paulus</hi> slain at <hi>Cannae,</hi> with all diligence, as much as in him lay, would not permit it to lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried. He also caused the body of <hi>T. Gracchus,</hi> who fell unhappily into the ambushment of the <hi>Lucans,</hi> to be honourably buried, and deliver'd his bones, to be carried into his own Countrey, to our Souldiers. When <hi>Marcellus</hi> was slain in the Countrey of the <hi>Brutii,</hi> while with more eagerness than consideration he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to spy the actions of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> he sought him out, and laid him upon the Funeral Pile, clad in a <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Jacket, and adorn'd with a Crown of Gold. And therefore the sweetness of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity penetrates into the very breasts of rude Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, mollifies the cruel and severe eyes of Enemies, and bends the most insolent pride of Victory. Nor is it a difficult thing for Clemency to finde an easie pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage through hostile Weapons, and Swords drawn hand to hand. It overcomes Anger, throws down Rage, and mingles hostile Blood with hostile Tears. Which produced that admirable Speech of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> delivering his judgment at the Funerals of the <hi>Roman</hi> Captains. Wherefore <hi>Paulus, Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Gracchus</hi> brought him more honour by their Funerals, than by their Deaths. For he deceived them with his <hi>Punic</hi>

                  <p>NExt let us take a view of the grateful and ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects and actions of the Minde, that Vertue and Vice may receive their due reward, from a due estimate of the value of either. However, because they are distinguished by contrary ends and designes, we also intend to separate them in writing: And therefore let us begin with those things, that rather deserve praise than reprehension.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And that we may take our rise from publick Acts, let us take into our consideration <hi>Marcius Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus,</hi> who invading his own Country, and having
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60321:114"/>
brought a very great Army of the <hi>Volsci</hi> to the very Gates of the City, threatning the utter destruction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; yet at the intercession of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Vituria,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Volumnia,</hi> he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to give over his violent Enterprise. In me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory whereof the Senate gave very great Priviledges to the <hi>Order of Matrons.</hi> For they order'd that men should give the upper hand to Women in the street, as acknowledging the Womens Garment to have been a greater safety to their City than their Arms: They added also a new distinction of Coiss to the adornments of their Ears; they also permitted them to wear Purple and Gold Laces; and more then all this, they erected a Temple and an Altar to Womens Fortune, just in the same place where <hi>Coriolanus</hi>'s wrath was appeased, to testifie their grateful acknowledgment of so great a benefit, by their religious respect and reverence that they had of it.</p>
                  <p>For which the Senate was no less famous at the time of the Second <hi>Punic</hi> War: For when <hi>Capua</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged by <hi>Fulvius,</hi> there were two Women in the Town that would by no means be perswaded from shewing eminent signes of good Will toward the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>; the one named <hi>Vestia Opidia</hi> the Mistriss of a good Family, the other <hi>Cluvia Facula</hi> an Harlot; one which dayly sacrificed for the success of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, the other still supplied the necessities of the <hi>Roman</hi> Captives. The Town being taken, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate restor'd them both their Liberty and their Goods; and if they had any other Boon to crave, bid them freely demand it, for that they were as free to give it. It was more wonderful that the Senate had leisure, in a time of so much Exultation, to return thanks to two mean Women, than that they took upon them to do it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What more commendable than that of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:60321:115"/>
Youth, who in the Consulship of <hi>C. Nantius</hi> and <hi>Minutius</hi> lifted themselves voluntarily to give assistance to the <hi>Tusculanes,</hi> who were enter'd into the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the <hi>Aequi,</hi> who had a little before most stoutly defended the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. A new thing, to hear the whole Army listing themselves, lest their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey should seem to want a grateful mind.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A great Example of Gratitude was that of the People toward <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus:</hi> Who dying after he had born Five Consulships, with great success and advantage to the Commonwealth, strove who should bring in most Money to advance the splendour and magnificence of his Funeral. Let us prize the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of vertue, when we finde brave men to be more happy in their Burials, than the sloathful in their Lives.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. With no small glory was another piece of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude shewn to the other <hi>Fabius,</hi> yet living. For when <hi>Minutius,</hi> Master of the Horse, was made equal in Commission with him being Dictator, by an Act of the Senate, which was never done before, and dividing the Army had fought apart with <hi>Hannibal</hi> in <hi>Samni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>; yet he seeing the great Overthrow he had like to have had by his own Rashness, had not <hi>Fabius</hi> come in timely to his relief, he presently acknowledged him for his Father, and commanded him to be saluted Patron and Preserver by his own Legions; and laying down his Commission of Equality, submitted the Mastership of the Horse to the Dictatorship, as of right it ought to have been; correcting the impudent errour of the Vulgar, by the grateful signification of his Minde.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A Story to be related upon as good grounds, is, that <hi>Terentius Culeo,</hi> a Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rian by Birth, and of the Senatorian Order, should follow as he did the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Chariot of the Elder <hi>Scipio,</hi> with his Cap in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60321:115"/>
his hand bare-headed, for that being a Captive to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> he had been retaken by him. And therefore he deservedly return'd, in view of the whole people, the acknowledgment of a Benefit received from him, as from his Patron, who was the Author of his Liberty.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But when <hi>Flaminius</hi> triumph'd over <hi>Philip,</hi> there was not only one, but two thousand <hi>Roman</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens that followed his Chariot bare-headed; who having been taken in the <hi>Punic</hi> Wars, and being sold into <hi>Greece,</hi> had been by his care collected together and restor'd to their former Freedome. The Honour of the General seem'd redoubled that day, who at the same time let the People see their Enemies by him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, their Fellow-Citizens by him preserved: Also their preservation was doubly acceptable to all, seeing that so many, and those so grateful persons, had recovered their deserved Liberty.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Metellus,</hi> as famous for his Tears as others for their Victories, obtain'd the name of <hi>Pious,</hi> for his passionate and constant Love of his Father in Exile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: This man being Consul, was not ashamed to entreat the People on the behalf of <hi>Q. Calidius,</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate for the Pretorship, because that he being Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune, was author of the Law by which his Father was recall'd. He always after call'd him also the Patron of his House and Family. Nor did he thereby any way derogate from his greatness which he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; seeing that it was not the Lowness of his Spirit, but the Gratefulness of his Minde, which made him submit the grandeur of his Dignity to the greatest desert of an inferiour person.</p>

THe Senate placed by the Parent of our City in the highest degree of Honour, yet miserably tore him in pieces in the Senate-House; and thought it no crime to take away his Life, who had given life to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. That rude and fierce Age con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated with the Blood of their <hi>Founder,</hi> the known Piety of posterity cannot dissemble.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ingrateful errour of a debauch'd minde shortly after caus'd the sad repentance of our City.

                     <hi>Camillus,</hi> the most triumphant Enlarger, and the most certain Defender of the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, yet could not preserve himself in his own City, whose safeguard he had establish'd, encreas'd and enlarg'd. For being accused by <hi>L. Apuleius</hi> Tribune of the People, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving embezled the Spoils of the <hi>Veientines,</hi> he was by a hard, and as I may say Iron Sentence, condemn'd and sent into Exilement. And at such a time, when having lost a most hopeful Son, he was rather to have been relieved with Comfort, than to have been laden with Calamities. But his Countrey unmindful of the extraordinary Merits of so great a Person, heap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Poorly done, for Fifteen thousand Pence (a pitiful Sum) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themselves of so great a Prince. The Elder <hi>African,</hi> when <hi>Rome</hi> was almost quite broken by the Arms of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> when she lay bleeding to death, and bleeding out the very last drop, restored her again, and made her Mistress of all <hi>Africa</hi>; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence whereof, his Countrey-men continued him to a poor Village near a stinking Lake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which he seem'd to be sensible to his death, causing this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription to be put upon his Tomb: <hi>INGRATEFVL COVNTREY, THOV HAST NOT SO MVCH AS MY BONES.</hi> What more unworthy the necessity which they put him to, what more just than his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, or more moderate than his revenge?

                     <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and reduced <hi>Asia</hi> under the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> was by the People ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of converting the publick Money to his own private use, and thrown into prison.</p>
                  <p>No less inferiour in Vertue was the Younger <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> nor yet more fortunate in his end. For alter he had quite reduced to nothing two Cities, <hi>Numantia</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> both threatning destruction to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, met with his murtherer at home, but not with one to revenge his death in all the <hi>Forum.</hi> Who can be ignorant that <hi>Scipio Nasica</hi> was as famous for Counsel, as the other two <hi>Scipio</hi>'s were for War? Who kept <hi>T. Gracchus</hi> from strangling the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth with his pestiferous hands; yet he, because of the low esteem which his Citizens had of his Virtue, under the specious pretence of an Embassie, went into a voluntary Exilement, as far as <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and there spent the remainder of his days, never sought after by his ungrateful Countrey.</p>
                  <p>I still keep in the same name, not having yet done with the complaints of the <hi>Cornelian</hi> Family. For <hi>P. Lentulus,</hi> a most famous Citizen and eminent Lover of his Countrey, after he had overthrown <hi>C. Gracchus</hi> in a pitched field in the Countrey of <hi>Aventinum,</hi> as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of that Victory, whereby he preserved the Laws, Peace and Liberty of his Countrey, was not permitted to live in the City, and therefore wearied with envy and slaunder, he begg'd a Lieutenancy of the Senate; and having made a set Speech, wherein he prayed to the Immortal Gods that his ingrateful Countrey might never have occasion to use him again, he went into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and there spent the remainder of his days.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But what Satyr can be sharp enough, what words severe enough to express the Ingratitude of <hi>P.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60321:119"/>
and delivered him up to the cruelty of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, coming to his house for shelter in the time of <hi>Cinna</hi>'s proscription. Had his accuser implored the same kindness upon his knees, it had bin inhumane to have denied him. For those that injuries do cause us to hate, misery makes us to compassionate. But <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius</hi> betrayed not his Accuser, but his Protector, to the cut-throat hand of his most inveterate adversary: if for fear of death, unworthy of life, if for hope of reward, most worthy of death.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To repeat another Example of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>M. Cicero</hi> had defended <hi>C. Popilius Lenas</hi> of the Countrey of <hi>Picena,</hi> with no less Care than Eloquence, when his Cause was very doubtful. This <hi>Popilius</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, being neither in word or deed injur'd by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> of his own accord begg'd of <hi>M. Antonius</hi>; that he might be the person to be sent by him to cut his Throat in his Banishment; and having obtain'd that detestable Commission, away he flew over-joy'd to <hi>Cajeta</hi>; and that very person, I need not say who was the author of his dignity and safety, but also one who ought to have been respected by him to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, that very person did he command patiently to lie down, and have his head struck off. And thus laden with the head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Eloquence, and the most famous right hand of Peace, he return'd with joy to the City, as if he had brought along with him the Spoils of some Enemy. Letters are too imperfect to set forth this Monster, seeing there is not another <hi>Cicero</hi> living to bewail his unhappy fate.</p>

But lest other Cities should insult, after we have confess'd our own Infirmities; we finde that the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> had an intention to have kill'd or banish'd <hi>Hannibal,</hi> after that for their honour and for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of their Empire, he had slain so many of our Generals, and cut to pieces so many of our Armies; that had he but slain so many common Souldiers of his Enemies, it had won him renown sufficient.</p>

Yet neither the Integrity of his Life, nor the constant Love which he bare his Countrey, nor all the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Laws which he had made, could preserve him from the hatred of his Citizens. For sometimes they threw stones at him in the Streets; they put out one of his Eyes, and at last utterly banish'd him out of his Countrey. What may we think of other Cities, when a City so famous as this for Constancy, Moderation and Gravity, proved so ungrateful against a Citizen so well deserving?</p>

Yet was he banished by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the Island <hi>Scyros,</hi> less than the Exile, became only famous for his Tomb. <hi>Solon</hi> also that made such wholesome Laws, and so famous withal, that had the <hi>Athenians</hi> used them still, they had been still the Lords of great Territories: Who took <hi>Salamine</hi> a strong Fortress that threatned their ruine, and was but a little distance from them: Who foresaw the Tyranny of <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> and was the first that durst advise the People to resist him by force of Arms; in his old age lived an Exile in <hi>Cyprus.</hi> Nor was it his hap to be buried in his own Countrey, of which he had so well deserved. The <hi>Athenians</hi> had dealt well by <hi>Miltiades,</hi> had they, after the Battle of <hi>Marathon,</hi> wherein he overcame the <hi>Persians,</hi> with their loss of three hundred thousand Men, sent him presently into Exile, and not kept him in prison till he died: Nay more than that, they would not suffer his Body to be buried, till <hi>Cimon</hi> his Son had surrender'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the same place. A sad Inheritance for the Son of so great a Captain, who was himself after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one of the greatest Captains of that Age. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stides</hi> also, who was the Rule of Justice all over <hi>Greece,</hi> and the greatest example of Continence that ever was, was commanded to depart his Countrey. Happy <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> could they have found out any one that had been either a Good Man, or a Lover of his Countrey, after this man was gone, with whom Sanctity itself seem'd to go along! <hi>Themistocles</hi> was a notable example of all that had experience of the Ingratitude of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey?

And not without reason, because he looses and abolishes the commerce of doing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Benefits, which is the support of human Life, that neglects to return Kindness for Kindness. How severely therefore are they to be reprehended, who having most just Laws, but being very wickedly encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, rather choose to obey their deprav'd manners, than their Laws?

Keeper, compassionating her case, did not strangle her presently.

But seeing her live many days without any alteration, he began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with himself by what means she kept herself alive; thereupon more diligently watching her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he observ'd her giving her Breast to her Mother, and pacifying the rage of her hunger with her Nipples. The novelty of which wonderful sight, being by him related to the Triumvir, by the Triumvir to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by the Pretor to the Council of the Judges, they granted the Woman her pardon.

Nor do I go about to detract from the honour of the <hi>Argives,</hi> or to cloud the glory of the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> But I hold the light of knowledg to the ignorance of a more obscure Piety: which makes me renew the memory of a piece of <hi>Scythian</hi> Piety.

Ancestors, then be should know how the</hi> Scythians <hi>were wont to fight.</hi> By which pious answer, that fierce and barbarous Nation redeem'd themselves from the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of Savageness. Therefore is Nature the first and best Mistress of Piety, which neither wanting the help of Speech, nor the use of Letters, through her own silent and proper Power infuses Charity into the breasts of Children. What is then the profit of Learning? That their Wits should be more polite, but not more honest. For true Vertue is rather born than acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

For the City of <hi>Sardis</hi> being taken by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when one of the <hi>Persians</hi> not knowing who the person was, furiously was going about to have kill'd his Father, call'd back the Sword that was just at his Throat, by crying out aloud to the Souldier, that he should not kill King <hi>Croesus.</hi> So that he, who till that time was mute, recovered his Speech for the safety of his Father.</p>

The same Charity arm'd a Youngman of <hi>Pinna</hi> (sirnamed <hi>Pulto)</hi> in the <hi>Italian</hi> War, with the same strength of Body and Mind: Who being Governour of the City when it was besieged, when the <hi>Roman</hi> General caused his Father to be brought forth, and threatned to put him to death before his face, unless he would deliver up the Town, made a Sally, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his Father out of the Enemies hands.

                  <p n="1">1. And this I speak by the testimony of <hi>Scipio Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> who though he had contracted a most strict Friendship with <hi>Laelius,</hi> yet he besought the Senate that they would not transfer to him his Brothers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Lot which they had taken from him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to go himself Lieutenant to his Brother: So that the Elder became inferiour to the Younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the stout and couragious to the faint-hearted, the renowned to a person of no fame; and, which is more, he that was already <hi>Africanus,</hi> to him that was not yet <hi>Asiaticus.</hi> So that he assumed one of the most noble Sirnames, and gave the other. He received the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial

Coat of one Triumph, and gave the other; greater by assistance, than his Brother by Superiority of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But <hi>Marcus Fabius</hi> the Consul having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the <hi>Veientes</hi> and <hi>Hetrusci,</hi> in a most remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fight, would not accept of a Triumph, which was offer'd him with the full consent of the Senate, and eager desire of the People; because his Brother, a person of Consular Dignity, was kill'd bravely fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Battle.

He also order'd a Praetorium to be erected for him upon the right hand, and would make him take the Consular and Imperial Dignity: and at the same time he submitted to the Majesty of his Brother, and the stroak of Death.

He might have liv'd Innocent, had he pleaded Ignorance; but he rather chose to make use of his own Piety, than the pardon of others; and for that reason to accompany his Brother in Death.</p>

                  <p>WE have seen Piety to private Relations, we are now to shew it toward our Native Countrey; to whose Majesty paternal Authority, almost equal to that of the Gods, has ever submitted, and to which Brotherly Affection willingly yields, and with a great deal of reason too. For a Family may be ruin'd, and yet the Commonwealth be safe; but the ruine of the Commonwealth necessarily draws with it the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of every Family. But how can we express in words, what so many have testified at the expence of their own Lives?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Brutus</hi> the first Consul meeting <hi>Aruns</hi> the Son of <hi>Tarquin</hi> the <hi>Proud,</hi> whom he had expell'd from his Kingdom, in the field ran at him with that fury, that running each other in the body with their Spears, they fell both dead at the same time. I may very well
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60321:126"/>
adde, that the <hi>Roman</hi> People paid dear for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But when the Earth suddenly sunk in the midst of the <hi>Forum,</hi> leaving a wide hole; and that the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle had return'd for answer, that nothing could fill up that concavity, but that which the <hi>Roman</hi> People most valued; <hi>Curtius</hi> a young Gentleman, noble in Birth and Minde, understanding that our City did excel in Vertue and Warlike Prowess, putting on all his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Ornaments, and getting up a Horseback, he put spurs to his Horse, and rid full speed into the dismal Precipice, upon whom the Citizens in his honour c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st Fruit and Grain, and then the Earth miraculously clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed again. Many wonderful things did afterwards adorn the <hi>Forum.</hi> Yet never did any one come near the Piety of <hi>Curtius</hi> to his Countrey: For which, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the chief place of Honour, I will adde another somewhat like it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Genucius Cipus</hi> being Pretor, and just coming out of the City in his Habit of General, there befel him a most unheard-of Prodigy. For of a suddain some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what started out of his Forehead like Horns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a Voice answer'd, that he should be a King, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into the City again. Which lest it should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, he condemn'd himself to perpetual Banishment. A noble act of Piety, which considering the honour it deserves, is to be preferr'd before seven Kings. In testimony whereof, a brazen Image of his Head was set up upon the Gate out of which he went.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Genucius</hi> bequeath'd the inheritance of his praise, than which a greater could not be given, to <hi>Aelius</hi> the Pretor. For when a Crow came and sate upon his Head, as he was fitting in Judgment, the Soothsayers affirm'd, that if he preserv'd the Crow, his Family should flourish, but the condition of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth be most miserable; but the Crow being slain, the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60321:127"/>
quite contrary would happen to both: took the Crow and wrung off his neck in the view of all the Senate. He lost seventeen Souldiers of his Family, all stout men, at the Battle of <hi>Cannae.</hi> But the Common-wealth soon after recover'd its glory. But these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples <hi>Sylla, Marius</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nna</hi> laugh'd at as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Decius,</hi> who first brought the Consulship into his own Family, seeing the <hi>Romans</hi> ready to fly and almost overthrown in the <hi>Latin</hi> War, vowed his own Life for the safety of the Army, and presently, putting Spurs to his Horse, he flew into the midst of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, seeking his own Death and the Safety of the Commonwealth: and having made a great slaughter, at length orewhelm'd with the multitude of Piles and Darts, the Victime fell. And from his Blood and Wounds sprang an unlookt for Victory.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There might have been but one example of such a General, had he nor begot a Son answerable to him in courage. For he in his fourth Consulship, with the same devotion and stoutness in fight, with the same event of fortune, sustain'd the weak and sinking force of our City. And therefore it was a difficult thing to understand, whether it were more profitable for the <hi>Roman</hi> City to have the <hi>Decii</hi> Commanders, or to loose them: For living, they kept her from being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, but by their death it overcame.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Elder <hi>Scipio</hi> did not loose his Life for the Commonwealth, but he carefully provided against the destruction of the Commonwealth. For when our City, after the Battle of <hi>Cannae,</hi> expected nothing else but to be the Victor <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s prey; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by advice of <hi>L. Metellus,</hi> the reliques of the broken Army were consulting to forsake <hi>Italy</hi>: He being a young Tribune, and drawing his Sword, threatned death to every man that would not take an Oath never
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60321:127"/>
to forsake his Countrey: And not only shew'd an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Piety himself, but recall'd it back, when it was just forsaking the breasts of others.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. To come from particulars to generals; How was the City equally divided in their flames, and equally inflamed with the Love of their Countrey! For the Treasury being emptied in the Second <hi>Punic</hi> War, thát there was not enough for the performance of their divine Ceremonies; the Publicans going to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, promised to let out their Money, in the same abundance, as if Money had abounded in the City, and not require a Farthing profit till the War was ended. The Masters also of the Slaves whom <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius Gracchus</hi> had made free, for fighting so stoutly at <hi>Beneventum,</hi> forbore to ask any Money for their Service. In the Camp it self there was not a Knight, not a Centurion that desir'd any Pay. The Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men also brought what Gold and Silver they had, nay the Children also brought their Purple Coats and Golden Hearts, that hung about their Necks, which were the ensignes of their Ingenuitles, Nor would any one take advantage of the benefit of the Senates Decree, whereby such and such were freed from Taxes. For they were not ignorant, when <hi>Vei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     </hi> was taken, when the Gold which <hi>Camillus</hi> had vowed as the Tenth of their Spoil should have been sent to the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> but could not be purchased, that the Matrons brought in all their Golden Ornaments into the Capitol. They had also heard, that the Thousand Pound of Gold, which was to be paid to the <hi>Gauls,</hi> when they besieged the Capitol, was made up by their Liberality. And therefore out of their own Goodness, and admonished by the Example of Antiquity, they thought they were not to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
                  <div type="section">

                        <hi>FORREIGN</hi> Examples.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. But I will touch upon some few Forreign Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to the same purpose. The King of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Codrus,</hi> when he saw his Territories wasted and invaded by vast numbers of his Enemies, despairing of humane assistance, sent to the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and by his Embassadors desired to know, which way he might avoid that terrible War. The God returned for answer, that it would be ended when he fell by his Enemies hand. Which was not only spread about among his own People, but in the Camp of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: who thereupon commanded that not a man should touch the body of <hi>Codrus.</hi> Which when the King understood, he threw off his Royal Robes, and in a servile Habit threw himself into the midst of a Squadron of the Enemy, that were out a forraging, and wounding one of them with a scythe, provoked the souldier to kill him; by whose Death <hi>Athens</hi> escaped ruine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the same Fountain of Piety flowed the soul of <hi>Thrasybulus.</hi> For he being desirous to free his Countrey from the oppression of the Thirty Tyrants, and was going about the enterprize with a small number of Men, one of his Company said to him; How much will <hi>Athens</hi> be indebted to thee, if they regain their Liberty by thy means? <hi>The Gods grant,</hi> answered he, <hi>that I may have then paid them what I owe them.</hi> With which Wish he heap'd a greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon his renowned work of destroying the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But <hi>Themistocles,</hi> whose Vertue made him Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, his Countries injury the General of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> that he might not be forced to invade it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving instituted a sacrifice, he drank up a full Beaker
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60321:128"/>
of Bulls Blood, and fell before the Altar a renowned Victime of Piety.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There follows an Example of the same nature. When <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Cyrene</hi> contended most obstinately for a spot of ground, at length it was agreed to send certain Young-men from such a distance, and where ever they met, that place to be the bound of both their Territories. But in this Agreement two <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> Brothers, call'd <hi>Philaeni,</hi> were too hard for the other, setting out sooner and making more haste: which when the Young-men of <hi>Cyrene</hi> understood, they for a long time complain'd of their fallacy; but at length they resolv'd to recompence the injury by proposing a severe condition. For they proposed to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that that place should be the bounds agreed upon, provided the <hi>Philaeni</hi> would suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be buried there. But the event disappointed their expectation; for they without any delay deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their bodies to be buried.

But the destruction of their Countrey did not abolish the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that noble Act perform'd by the <hi>Philaeni.</hi> So that mortal courage or strength can purchase nothing immortal, but Vertue alone.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This Piety was inflamed with youthful Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Horatius Pulvillus</hi> being to dedicate a Temple in the Capitol of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> as he was holding the post, and ready to pronounce certain solemn words, news was brought him that his Son was dead: But he neither took his hand off the post, nor made the least interruption in the Dedication of the Temple, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his countenance from the publick Ceremony to his private Grief; lest he might seem rather to have acted the part of a Father, than a High-priest. <hi>Bury the carcass then,</hi> said he.</p>

                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:60321:133"/>2. A great Example, and no less renowned than the former, is that which follows. <hi>Aemilius Paulus</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the pattern of a most happy, yet a most unfortunate Father, of four Sons which he had, all hopeful and beautiful youths, had translated two into the <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Family by right of Adoption, and only reserved two to himself. One of which died four daies before his Fathers Triumph. The other alive in the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Chariot expir'd the third day after. Thus he that was so liberal in bestowing Children upon others, was himself left childless in a short time. Which Misfortune, that you may know how magnanimously he brook'd it, he made plainly apparent in an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he made to the People, concerning the Actions which he had done for them, by adding this little clause: <hi>When in the highest success of my felicity, I was afraid, most noble</hi> Romans, <hi>that Fortune would do me some mischief or other; I prayed to</hi> Jupiter, Juno <hi>and</hi> Minerva, <hi>that if any thing of Calamity threatned the</hi> Roman <hi>Government, they would exhaust it all upon my Family. And therefore 'tis very well; for according to my wishes, they have so ordered it, that you should rather compassionate my private, than I bewail your pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick losses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I will only adde one Domestic Example more, and then permit my Story to wander. <hi>Q. Marcius Rex</hi> the Elder, Colleague with <hi>Cato</hi> in the Consulship, lost a Son of eminent hopes and piety, and which added to his calamity, his onely Child. Yet when he saw his Family ruin'd and ended by his death, he so suppress'd his grief by the depth of his prudence, that immediately he went from his Sons grave to the Senate-house; and as it was his duty that day, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WHence shall I summon thee forth, fair Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, the chief support of Men and Women! For thou inhabitest the Hearths consecrated to <hi>Vesta,</hi> by the antient Religion. Thou broodest upon the Cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Iupiter Capitoline.</hi> Thou the pillar of the <hi>Palatium,</hi> renderest famous the most illustrious Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-Gods, and the most sacred Genial Bed of <hi>Iuliá,</hi> by thy fixed habitation there. Thy Guardianship de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends the honour of young Youth. And out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to thy Deity, riper age continues incontaminate. Under thy protection the Matrons Stole, or long
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60321:135"/>
Garment is reverenc'd. Come hither then, and know what thou thy self wouldst have others do.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Lucretia</hi> the first Example of <hi>Roman</hi> Chastity, whose manlike Soul was, by the mistake of Fortune, enclosed in a female Body, being constrain'd to suffer herself to be ravish'd by <hi>Sextus Tarquinius,</hi> the son of him sirnamed the <hi>Proud</hi>; when she had before an assembly of her Kindred and Friends lamented in most passionate expressions the Injury which she had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, stabb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d herself with a Dagger, which she had conceal'd under her Garment. Whose magnanimous Death gave the people an occasion to alter the Kingly Government into Consular.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither would <hi>Virginius</hi> brook an injury of this nature, though a person of a very Vulgar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, but of a Patrician spirit; for lest his Family should be dishonour'd, he spared not his own flesh and blood. For when <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> the Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vir, confiding in his power, violently prosecuted the defiling of his Daughter, he brought her forth publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Market-place and slew her: choosing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the Murtherer of a chast, than the Father of a contaminated Daughter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor was <hi>Pontius Aufidianus</hi> endued with less Courage of Minde, being a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, who finding the Virginity of his Daughter prostituted by a Pedagogue to <hi>Fannius Saturninus</hi>; not content to have put the wicked Servant to death, he kill'd his Daughter. And that she might not celebrate disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Nuptials, he married her to a bitter fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What shall I say of <hi>Pub. Maenius?</hi> What a strict Guardian of Chastity was he! For he punished a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his, for whom he had a great kindness, only because he had kiss'd his Daughter, being of womans estate; though it might seem not to have bin done so
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60321:136"/>
much out of Lust, as by a mistake of breeding, or long acquaintance. But he thought fit to imprint the Discipline of Chastity into the apprehension of the tender Maid, by the severity of his servants punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and taught her by so severe an Example, that she was not only to preserve her Virginity, but her Lips uncontaminated for her Husband.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But <hi>Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus,</hi> after he had born many great Offices with renown, coming to the Censorship, question'd his only Son for the doubtful loss of his Chastity: and he underwent the punishment, by banishing himself out of the reach of his Father.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I should have said the Censor had been too rigid, but that <hi>P. Attilius Philiscus,</hi> who suffered his body to be made use of by his Master for gain, prov'd so severe a Father afterwards: For he slew his Daughter, because she play'd the whore. How sacred then ought we to think Chastity was, in our City, where the Procurers of Lust, did so cruelly chastise it?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Example of a most excellent person and a memorable act follows. <hi>M. Claudius Marcellus,</hi> one of the Aedils that rode in the moving Chair of State, accus'd <hi>Scantinius</hi> a Tribune, and summon'd him to answer before the People; because he had given out, that his Son had been abus'd in his Body. But he averring that he could not be compell'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y was call'd in question. <hi>Scantinius</hi> therefore being cited, was condemn'd by that very witness, who was accus'd by himself. For it is said, that the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being produc'd before the Judgment-seat, with his eyes fixed upon the ground, observ'd a most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute silence; by which modest silence he most of all prevail'd in his revenge.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:60321:136"/>8. <hi>Metellus Celer</hi> also was a most severe chastiser of Libidinous Intent; summoning <hi>Cn. Sergius Silus</hi> to answer before the People, for only proffering a sum of Money to the Mistriss of the Family, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for that single Crime. For then not the deed alone, but the very intention was brought into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; and it was more harm, to have willed an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, than it was profitable not to offend.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Thus far the Juridical Gravity: here follows the extrajudicial. <hi>T. Veturius,</hi> son of that <hi>Veturius,</hi> who was delivered bound to the <hi>Samnites</hi> for making a dishonourable Truce with them, when by reason of the ruine of his Estate, and the great Debts of his family, he was forc'd to yield himself in his youth bound to <hi>Plotius,</hi> and was by him severely whipp'd, because he would not permit him to make use of his Body, complain'd thereof to the Consuls: Who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the Senate with the matter, sent <hi>Plotius</hi> to prison.

Nor did silence proceed from fear, but because through the aid of the <hi>Cornelian</hi> and <hi>Aemilian</hi> Families, many fears of the City and <hi>Italy</hi> were put to an end; the People of <hi>Rome</hi> were not free, in respect of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Liberty.</p>

Nor was it without great applause that he took things patiently, because it was his fortune to be a laughing-stock to the license of all sorts of men. <hi>Cn. Piso</hi> when he had indited <hi>Manilius Crispus,</hi> and saw him, though apparently guilty, to be protected by <hi>Pompey</hi>; being carried on with a youthful heat and desire of accusation, he tax'd the potent defendour with many great and hainous Crimes: Being then examin'd by him, why he did not accuse him himself? <hi>Do but thou,</hi> said he, <hi>give Sureties to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, if thou art accused, that thou wilt not raise a Civil War, and I will cause the Iudges to sit upon thy head, before they sit upon the head of</hi> Manilius. Thus by the same Judgment he maintain'd two persons guilty; <hi>Manilius</hi> by his Accusation, <hi>Pompey</hi> by his Liberty: and the one he fulfill'd by Law, the other by the profession of his good will, not being able to go any farther.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What therefore is Liberty without <hi>Cato?</hi> No more than <hi>Cato</hi> without Liberty. For when he sate Judge upon a Senator, that was very guilty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, and that there were Certificates produced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Pompey</hi>'s hand, in favour of the party accus'd, he presently caus'd them to be laid aside, reciting the Law, wherein it was enacted that no Senator should make use of any such assistance. The fact is not much to be wonder'd at, considering the person; for what might seem sauciness in another, was in <hi>Cato</hi> known to be Fidelity to his Countrey.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Cn.

                  <p n="1">1. When our City was in a st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As <hi>Annius</hi> formerly and the <hi>Campanians</hi> avert'd, that one of the Consuls ought to belong to <hi>Capua,</hi> and the other to <hi>Rome:</hi> so sick was then the condition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.

For as before they were broken by the Arms of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, so now they gave over, vanquish'd by this mans words.</p>
                  <p>Equal to this was the Gravity of <hi>Manlius:</hi> For when the Consulship was conferr'd upon him by the consent of all men, and that he refus'd it by reason of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of his Eyes, yet sor all that was vehemently urged to accept it; <hi>Choose,</hi> said he, <hi>some other person upon whom to confer this Honour; for if ye compel me to take it upon me, neither shall I endure your Customes, neither will you endure the Severity of my Government.</hi> If the voice of a private person was so heavy, what would the Fasces of the Consul have bin?</p>

of his past years: But so order'd it, that his Tryal was rather an Experiment, than any Impediment of his Gravity. And when <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Victories gave him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to return into his own Countrey, he rather chose to tarry in Banishment, than to do any thing against the Laws.

                  <p>'TIs now time to enter the sacred recesses of Justice, where alwaies the respect of just and honest Actions is conversant with Religious Observation. Where Modesty is studied, and Desire gives way to Reason; there nothing is reputed profitable that is not honest. Of which our City among all Nations is the most certain and principal Example.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When <hi>Camillus</hi> the Consul besieg'd the <hi>Falisci,</hi> a School-master brought over to the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Youths, and those the most noble in the City, under pretence of taking them to walk abroad. Not questioning but they being in the power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the <hi>Falisci</hi> would submit themselves to our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Upon which affair, after consultation, the Senate decreed that the Youths should be sent home, lashing their Master all the way, while his hands were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yed behind him. Which Justice of theirs overcame the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60321:148"/>
Minds of those, whose Walls they were not able to expugn. For the <hi>Falisci</hi> overcome by their Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, not by their Arms, open'd their Gates to the <hi>Romans.</hi> The same City oftentimes rebelling, but alwaies broken by adverse Fortune, was at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to yield to <hi>Q. Lutatius</hi> the Consul. Against which when the <hi>Roman</hi> People desir'd to have shewn the extremity of their Revenge, when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood from <hi>Papyrius,</hi> who by the Consuls command had writ the Articles of Surrender, that the <hi>Falisci</hi> had surrender'd themselves to the Faith, not to the Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they laid aside all their Anger, lest they should be wanting to their Justice; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the force of their Hatred, which is not easily overcome; and the pride of Victory, which easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets Licentiousness. Another time when <hi>P. Claudius</hi> having by his prosperous conduct taken the <hi>Camerini,</hi> had sold them under the Spear according to custome, though thereby they saw their Exchequer filled with Money, and their Empire enlarged: yet because it did not seem to be done according to the Rules of Honour and Justice, they sought them diligently out, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them again; assigning them a place of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in <hi>Aventinum,</hi> and restoring them their Lands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They gave them Money also to build Chappels and purchase Sacrifices; and by their Justice gave the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable an occasion to rejoyce in their destruction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so rais'd again.</p>
                  <p>What I have related was confin'd within our own Walls and the neighbouring parts; what I now relate has flown over all the world. <hi>Timochares</hi> the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Notice whereof being given to the Senate, they sent Embassadors to give <hi>Pyrrbus</hi> intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of it, admonishing him to be careful again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

such kind of treachery. Remembring that their City was built by the Son of <hi>Mars,</hi> and that War was to be carried on by Arms, and not by Poyson.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Admirable was the Justice of the four Tribunes of the People at the same time. For when <hi>L. Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> their Colleague had cited <hi>C. Atratinus</hi> (under whose comand they had rallyed the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, and restor'd the Battle against the <hi>Volsci</hi> at the Lake <hi>Verrugo)</hi> to appear before the People; they swore, that it would be a shame to them, if their General should be guilty. For those noble Gentlemen would not endure to behold him as a Gown-man under the last extremity, whose Life, when in Arms, they had defended with their own Wounds and Blood. Which Justice of theirs so moved the Ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mbly, that they caus'd <hi>Hortensius</hi> to desist.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor did they shew themselves less noble in that which follows. When <hi>Titus Graccbus</hi> and <hi>C. Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> had exasperated the greatest part of the City, by carrying themselves so severely in the Censorship, <hi>Rutilius</hi> the Tribune accus'd them before the People of High-Treason; moved not only by the publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation, but his own private interest, because they had order'd a part of his wall to be pulled down for the benefit of some Publick-place. In which Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, while many Centuries of the first Classis openly condemn'd <hi>Claudius,</hi> but all consented to quit <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cbus; Graccbus</hi> cried out aloud, <hi>That if his Colleague suffered, he would undergo the same punishment as he did.</hi> Which Justice of his diverted the storm from both their heads and fortunes. For the People absolved <hi>Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Rutilius</hi> releas'd his Action against <hi>Gracc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Colledge of Tribunes also got great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause: for when one of them, <hi>L. Cotta</hi> by name, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of his sacred Authority, denyed to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60321:149"/>
pay his Creditors, they decreed, that if he would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pay his Debts nor give Security, they would assist the Creditors in their Appeal: thinking it unjust, that the publick Majesty should be a protection to private Knavery, Thus the Tribunitial Justice drew out <hi>Cotta</hi> lurking in the Sanctuary of his employment.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Of which to come to another Example, <hi>Cn. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius</hi> Tribune of the People cited <hi>Marc. Scaurus</hi> before the People, being then Prince of the City, to ruine him, if fortune had favour'd him; or at least to eclipse his renown by a Criminal Accusation. While he was thus eagerly thirsting after the blood of <hi>Scau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> a Servant of <hi>Scaurus</hi> came to him by night, and promis'd him to discover many great and hainous Crimes, to advance his Accusation. As a Master and an Enemy he consider'd and weigh'd in his mind the Impeachment with different thoughts, Justice over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his Hatred: For immediately shutting his own ears, and the Impeachers mouth, he caus'd him to be carried to <hi>Scaurus.</hi> An Accuser, I will not say, to be belov'd, but rather to be applauded by the person accus'd; whom the People, as well for his other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as also for this reason, created Consul, Censor, and High-Priest.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Nor did <hi>L. Crassus</hi> behave himself otherwise as to the same Example of Justice. He had alwaies born a most perfect hatred against the Name of <hi>Carbo,</hi> as his profest Enemy; and yet when a Servant of <hi>Carbo</hi>'s brought him a Cabinet of his Masters, conteining se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Writings, which he might have made use of to his ruine, he sent the Cabinet, lockt as it was, and his Servant bound, to his Master. What Justice may we conjecture then flourished among Friends, when Enemies and Impeachers one of another so nobly behav'd themselves!</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Sylla</hi> desired not so much his own safety, as the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60321:149"/>
ruine of <hi>Sulpitius Rufus,</hi> whose Tribunitial rage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vex'd him. But when he was banish'd, and that he understood that he was betray'd by his own Servant, where he lay skulking; that the Fidelity and Justice of his Decree might be permanent, he caus'd the Freed-man for his perfidiousness to be thrown down the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock, together with his freed-mans Cap, which he had purchased by his Treachery. A most insolent Victor at other time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, now most just in his Authority.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>FORRAIGNERS.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. But that we may not seem to forget the Justice of Forreigners, <hi>Pittacus</hi> of <hi>Mitylene</hi> was one to whose merits his Citizens were either so much engaged, or else had so much confidence in his Vertues, that they offer'd him the Soveraign Authority of their City; which he so long kept as the War continued with the <hi>Athenians</hi> about the <hi>Sygaeum,</hi> or possession of a piece of ground so called. But after he had by a Victory setled Peace, he presently resign'd his Authority against the will of the <hi>Mitylenians,</hi> that he might not be the Lord of his City any longer than the necessity of affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd. And when by the consent of all the People the half of the Land was offered him, he utterly refus'd the Gift; esteeming it below himself, to lessen the glory of his Vertue by the greatness of his Prey.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I must now relate the Prudence of another, that I may also relate the Justice of another. When <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi> had given the <hi>Athenians</hi> wholesom advice to betake themselves to their Vessels, and after that <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi> and his Army were driven out of <hi>Greece</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to restore the antient dignity of the City, and laid up Treasure secretly to raise his City to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all <hi>Greece</hi>; he told the People in publick,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60321:150"/>
that he had found out something, which if fortun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> would suffer it to be brought to pass, there could no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing happen greater or more for the honour of the <hi>Athenian</hi> People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that it was not a thing to be divulged: and therefore desired them to appoint some person, to whom he might privately reveal it. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stides</hi> was deputed. Who when he understood th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Themistocles</hi> intended to have burnt all the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Navy that lay in the Road of <hi>Gytheum,</hi> that it being destroyed, the Dominion of the Sea might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them; return'd to his fellow Citizens, and told them, <hi>That</hi> Themistocles <hi>was hammering that which was very profitable, but very unjust.</hi> Presently the whole Assembly, when they heard it was unjust, bid him say no more of it, and commanded <hi>Themistocles</hi> to desist from his Enterprize.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Nothing more prevalent than the following Examples of Justice: <hi>Zaleucus</hi> the <hi>Locrian</hi> having strengthend his City with most profitable and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Laws; when his Son, condemn'd for Adultery, according to the Law made by himself, was to have lost both his Eyes, and all the City interceded for the Son, for some time he obstinately refus'd it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but at length, constrain'd by the intreaty of the People, first putting out one of his own Eyes and then one of his Sons, he left the use of fight to both. Thus he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the Law the punishment which it claimed, with a most admirable mixture of Justice; dividing himself into a merciful Father and a just Legislator.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But something more severe was the Justice of <hi>Charundas</hi> the <hi>Thurian.</hi> He had pacified the Harangues of his Citizens, that were seditious even to blood and violence, making a Law that if any person entred the Common-hall with his Sword on, he should be presently put to death. Some time after, having been in the Countrey and coming home, he presently call'd
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60321:150"/>
a Hall, and forgetting himself enter'd the Hall with his Sword on. Whereupon being minded of the breach of his own Law, by one that stood next him; <hi>Well,</hi> said he, <hi>the same person shall establish it</hi>; and immediately drawing his Sword, fell upon it and died, When it was lawful for him to have defended or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused his errour, he rather chose to make the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment publick, than put a slur upon Justice.</p>

                  <p>WHen this Image is set before our eyes, the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Divinity of Truth stretches out her right hand, the most certain pledg of human Safety. Which how it has flourished in our City, all Nations have been sensible of, and we shall make evident in a few Examples.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When <hi>Ptolomey</hi> the King had left the People of <hi>Rome</hi> to take the tuition of his Son upon them, the Senate appointed <hi>M. Aemilius Lepidus,</hi> the High-Priest, to be Guardian to the young Infant, and sent him to <hi>Alexandria</hi> for that purpose; making use of the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>cti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a famous and most upright person, whose publick Abilities had been sufficiently known among them, lest

the credit and dignity of the City should have been any way injur'd. This became not only the preservation, but the ornament of the Royal Infancy, so that when he came of age, he knew not of which he had most to boast, whether in the Fortune of his Father, or the Majesty of his Tator.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Famous also was the succeed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng piece of <hi>Roman</hi> Integrity. A great Navy of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being overthrown near the Coast of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> the Captains of the Enemies, quite out of heart, began to think of making some overtures of Peace. But when it was argued who should go, <hi>Amilcar</hi> refus'd, for fear lest the <hi>Romans</hi> should serve him as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had served <hi>Cor. Asina</hi> the Consul, whom they had detain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d a Prisoner in Chains. But <hi>Hanno,</hi> better understanding the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, very confidently profer'd himself. To whom as he was in treaty, when a Tribune of the People spoke, and bid him take heed he had not the same usage as the Consul <hi>Cornelius</hi> had had; both the Consuls commanding the Tribune to be silent: Hanno, cryed they, <hi>from that fear the reputation of our City frees thee.</hi> It had made them famous, that they could be Masters of so great a Captain of their Enemies; but much more famous, that they would not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The same reputation the Conscript Fathers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in defending the Priviledges of Embassadors. For when <hi>M. Aemilius Lepidus</hi> and <hi>C. Flaminius</hi> were Consuls, <hi>Culeo</hi> the Praetor by an order of the Senate caus'd <hi>L. Minutius</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>L. Manlius</hi> to be deliver'd to the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Embassadors by the Heralds themselves, because they had laid violent hands upon them. The Senate regarding more their own Honour, than the persons for whose sake they did the Justice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. These Examples the Elder <hi>Africanus</hi> following, when he had taken a Vessel wherein were several persons, and many of the chiefest among the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. Let us not forget that noble Act of the Senate, by no means to be omitted. <hi>Q. Fabius</hi> and <hi>Cn. Apro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> Aed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Could such a Court as that be said to be a Council of mortal Men, and not rather the Temple of Faith? Which was no less admir'd by our Allies, than it was reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously observ'd in our City.</p>

                     <head>FORRAIGNERS.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. For before the miserable slaughter of the two <hi>Scipio</hi>'s in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the destruction of as many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Nation, the <hi>Saguntines</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd within their own Walls by the victorious Arms of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when they could no longer resist the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> power, they brought forth all their most precious things into the Market-place, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling the Pile, threw themselves into the common and publick fire, that they might not be accompted false to our Alliance.

                  <p>IT remains that we relate the Fidelity of Servants to their Masters; so much the more praise-worthy by how much it was least expected from them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> a most celebrated Oratour in the days of our Ancestors, was accus'd of Ince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t; whose Accusers were obstinately importunate with the Judges that his Servant might be examin'd for a witness;
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60321:153"/>
because they pretended that he carried the Lanthorn before him, when he went to commit the Fact. He was at that time a beardless Youth, and saw himself ready to be sent to the Rack, yet never budg'd for it. But when he came home, and saw <hi>Antonius</hi> very much troubled about the business, he earnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly begg'd of his Master, that he might be put to the Rack; affirming, that they should not force a tittle out of his mouth to do him a prejudice. And with a wonderful patience he performed his promise: For being lash'd with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny stripes, set upon the Wooden-horse, and fear'd with burning plates of Iron, he overthrew the whole force of his Masters accusation, by standing firm to his preservation. Fortune might be deservedly blam'd, for having imprison'd so pious and stout a Soul in the Body of a Slave.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the Consul <hi>C. Marius,</hi> whose ill success was miserable at the Siege of <hi>Praeneste,</hi> seeing it in vain to escape through a little Myne under ground, and slightly wounded by <hi>Thelesinus,</hi> with whom he had designed to live, was run through and slain by his Servant, to free him from the cruelty of <hi>Sylla</hi>; though he had large promises made him, to deliver him up to the Victor. The seasonable assistance of whose right hand, no way seems inferiour to the Piety of those who have protected their Masters in safety. Because that time not Life, but Death was most beneficial to <hi>Marius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Equally illustrious was the following Example <hi>Caius Gracchus,</hi> that he might not fall into the power of his Enemies, laid his neck to be cut off by his Serva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:60321:153"/>
he had avoided the threatning danger, by the benefit of his own and not his Servants hand. But now he gave way that the Carcass of <hi>Philocrates</hi> should lye in more splendour than that of <hi>Gracchus</hi> his Master.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another sort of Fury, and another sort of Nobility, but the same Example of Fidelity. For <hi>Pindarus,</hi> the Freed-man of <hi>Cassius,</hi> having slain his Master by his command, after he had lost the Battle of <hi>Philippi,</hi> preserv'd him from the insultings of his Enemies; nor was the Servant ever seen after. Which of the Gods, Revenger of the most hainous Crimes of Mortals, so benumb'd that Valour, that ventur'd to the destruction of the Parent of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that it should so abjectly trembling submit it self at the knees of <hi>Pindarus,</hi> to avoid punishment of publick Parricide, which it deserv'd from the hands of a most pious Victor? Thou, thou it was, most divine <hi>Iulius,</hi> that didst exact the revenge due to thy celestial wounds, compelling that proud Head, so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious to thee, to implore the sordid aid of a Slave, driven to that extremity of fury, that he neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fir'd to live, nor durst to dye by his own hand.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Of these calamities <hi>C. Plotius Plancus,</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Munatius Plancus</hi> both Consul and Censor, was a sad partaker; who lurking in the Territories of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lernum,</hi> after he had been banish'd by the Triumvirs, discover'd the Sanctuary of his Safety by his effeminate way of living, and the odours of his sweet Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For thereby the industrious care of those that persecute the miserable, smelt out his secret haunts: By whom the Servants being apprehended, and long tortur'd, denied they knew where their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster was. Then would not <hi>Plancus</hi> endure that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, so faithful and exemplary, should be any longer tormented; but discover'd himself, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd his Throat to the Souldiers weapons. Which
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60321:154"/>
contest of mutual good Will, makes it difficult to be decided, whether the Master were more worthy, who had the trial of such a constant Fidelity in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; or the Servants, who were freed from the severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Rack, by the just compassion of their Master.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. What shall I say to the Servant of <hi>Vrbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor did our Allies disdain to obey his Fasces, whom they had seen flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Tribunals of Forreigners. For he behavd himself faithfully and nobly: plainly demonstrating, that his former way of living, was only the effect of Fortune; but that the pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt advancement of his Dignity, was to be attributed to the greatness of his parts.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Publius Rupilius</hi> was no Toll-gatherer in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> but only a mean Officer under them; so miserable poor, that he had nothing to keep Life and Soul together, but a small Office that depended upon the leave of the vanquish'd. Yet from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Consul afterwards, all <hi>Sicilia</hi> receiv'd their Laws, after he had freed them from the terrors of a smart War of the Pirats and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives. I believe that the very Ports themselves, if there be any sence in mute things, admir'd the wonderful change in the Condition of that man. For the same person that they had seen exacting the dayly Customs, the same person they saw giving Laws to Navies and Armies.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To this increase of Dignity I will adde a greater. When <hi>Asculum</hi> was taken, <hi>Cn. Pompeius,</hi> the Father of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, prostituted to the eyes of the People <hi>P. Ventidius,</hi> a beardless Youth, in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph that he had obtain'd. Yet this was that <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidius,</hi> who afterwards triumph'd at <hi>Rome</hi> over the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and reveng'd the death of <hi>Crassus,</hi> mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably foyl'd in a strange Countrey. Thus he that a Captive dreaded imprisonment, now a Victor crowns the Capitol with his success. And this is farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable of the same person, that he was made
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60321:156"/>
Pretor and Consul both in one and the same year.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Now let us consider the diversities of Chance. <hi>L. Lentulus</hi> was depos'd by the <hi>Caecilian</hi> Law, of his Consulship, being convicted of Bribery, and yet was created Censor with <hi>L. Censorinus.</hi> Thus Fortune shuffl'd him between Honour and Disgrace; condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in his Consulship, and honouring him with the Office of Censor when he was condemn'd; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffering him to enjoy a lasting happiness, nor long to abide in a miserable condition.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Thus Fortune shew'd her power also in <hi>Cn. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Scipio Asina.</hi> Who when he was Consul, being taken by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> at <hi>Liparae,</hi> and had lost all by the right of War, yet by the favour of Fortune recovered all, and was again created Consul. Who would have thought he should have been brought from the Fasces to the Fetters of the <hi>Carthaginians?</hi> Who would have thought again, that from the <hi>Punic</hi> chains he should have advanc'd himself to the highest degrees of Honour? But yet he was from a Consul made a Captive, and from a Captive became Consul.</p>

He had the same repulses when he stood for the Tribuneship and Aedileship in the Field of <hi>Mars.</hi> Standing for the Praetorship, he carried the lowest degree, which notwithstanding he obtain'd with great difficulty; for being accus'd for bribing Voices, he was hardly acquitted by the Judges. Yet from that <hi>Marius,</hi> so meanly born at <hi>Arpinum,</hi> so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised at <hi>Rome,</hi> and so abhorr'd a Candidate, sprung that <hi>Marius</hi> who subdu'd <hi>Africa,</hi> drove King <hi>Iugurth</hi> before his Chariot in Triumph, who utterly subdued the Armies of the <hi>Tentons</hi> and <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> whose two Triumphs were beheld in the City, and whose seaven Consulships were register'd in the Annal-Books; who had the luck to be created Consul returning from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and to proscribe his Proscriber.

                     <p n="1">1. We have been intent in relating our own, let us be more succinct in the repetition of Forreign Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. <hi>Polemo,</hi> a young <hi>Athenian</hi> Gentleman, but infinitely debauch'd, and one that gloried in his shame, rising from a Banquet, not after Sun-set, but after Son-rising, as he went home saw <hi>Xenocrates</hi> the Philosopher's door standing wide open. Drunk as he was, richly perfum'd, gayly clad, and with his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land upon his Head, he enter'd the School, that was full of Grave and Learned Men; and nothing asham'd of the manner of his entry, he sate down to throw his drunken Jests upon the noble Disputes and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Precepts that were then utter'd. The company being offended, <hi>Xenocrates</hi> kept his temper, and began to dispute of Modesty and Temperance. The Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of whose Speech causing <hi>Polemo</hi> to repent, he first threw his Garland to the ground, presently after he withdrew his arms (<hi>a token of Modesty among the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians) under his Cloak; shortly after he left his feasting Mirth; and lastly, laid aside all his Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and being cur'd with the wholesome Medicine of one Oration, of an infamous Glutton became a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Philosopher. For his minde was only a Pilgrim in wickedness, not an Inhabitant.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It troubles me to remember <hi>Themistocles</hi> in his Youth; whether I consider his Father that disinherited him, or his Mother that hang'd herself to see the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked course of life her Son led; when he himself after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became the most famous person that ever <hi>Greece</hi> brought forth; and was the pledge either of hope or despair between <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> For the one had him the Patron of her Safety, the other entertain'd him as the Surety of Victory.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:60321:158"/>3. <hi>Cimon</hi> in his youth was look'd upon as a fool; but the <hi>Athenians</hi> found the benefit of his foolish commands: Compelling them to condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of stupidity, who had accus'd him of Folly.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Two distinct Fortunes, shar'd <hi>Alcibiades</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. The one, that assign'd him a splendid Nobility, vast Wealth, Beauty incomparable, strength of Body, a most piercing Wit, and the passionate love of his Countrey-men: The other, that inflicted upon him Condemnaton, Banishment, Sale of his Estate, Poverty, the hatred of his Countrey, and a violent Death. Neither the one nor the other altogether, but by intermission, like the ebbing and flowing of the Sea.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Polycrates,</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Samos,</hi> lived in such a prodigality of Fortunes savours, that he was admir'd even to Envy, not without cause; his endeavors all prosper'd; his hopes reap'd the fruit of what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired; his wishes were no sooner nam'd than granted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To desire, and be able to perform, was the same thing. Once only Fortune chang'd her countenance, when he threw a Ring, which he highly esteem'd, into the Sea, that he might not be said to have undergone no misfortune; which however he presently recover'd, the fish being taken that had swallowed it. But he could not always hold this prosperous course of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that swell'd his full fails: For <hi>Orontes,</hi> one of <hi>Darius</hi>'s Commanders, having taken him, caus'd him to be crucified upon the highest top of the <hi>Mycalensian</hi> Mountain. From whence the City of <hi>Samos,</hi> long oppressed by his severe Tyranny, with the joyful eyes of freemen beheld his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tyranny of <hi>Sicily,</hi> by his Fathers Will, the Lord of a vast Wealth, a Captain of Armies, an Admiral of a Navy, potent in Horse, yet was forced to teach School at <hi>Corinth,</hi> for his livelihood: And at the same time, of a Tyrant being now become a School-master, he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n'd his Elders by such a change, how little they were to trust to Fortune.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Next to him follows <hi>Syphax</hi> the King, who underwent the same severity of Fortune; to whom however at the same time, <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Scipio, Carthage</hi> by <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> made their addresses for his Friendship. But while he stood thus courted, that he seem'd to be an Arbiter of Victory between the greatest and most potent People in the world; In a short time after, he was brought chain'd by <hi>Laelius</hi> to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and now lyes prostrate at the feet of him, whom he thought it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour enough before, as he sate upon his Throne, to take by the hand. Thus meerly vain, and fragil, and like the baubles Children play with, are those great things which we call Human Power and Wealth: On a suddain they abound, and vanish as soon: In no place or person fix'd upon a stable foundation; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She married him Three Daughters, whose Issue he received into his ownbosom: And among all these Children born, so many Youths coming to age, so many Nuptial Torches, such an abundance of Honour, Empire and Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, not one Funeral, not one Tear, or the least

Nor was his end unlike the course of his Life. For after he had liv'd a fair age, an easie Death carried him off from the last farewels and embraces of his dearest Pledges; and he was carried to his Funeral-Pile upon the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his Sons and Sons-in-Law through the City.</p>

He was the poorest of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> but the elder of the two: one that never had increas'd the bounds of his own land; contented with the Income of a poor Farm. But <hi>Apollo</hi> meant the true, not the obscure end of a happy Life: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave that answer to one that insolently gloried in the splendour of his fortune, That he rather approv'd a Cottage in a calm security of content, than the cares and anxieties of a Court; a few clods of earth void of fear, than all the fertile Acres of <hi>Lydia</hi> incumber'd with continual dread; and one or two yoak of Oxen easily maintain'd, than Armies of Horse and Foot, burthensome even to vast expences; and a small Barn subject to no mans Envy, than Exchequers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the coverous desires and rapacious violence of all men.

For that Errour is never to be retriev'd, that is committed in the heat of War. The same person denied that an Enemy was to be fought with, but only when there was a kind opportunity, or a pressing necessity. Both prudently said. For to omit an opportunity of acting with success, is the greatest madness in the world: And he that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to a necessity of giving Battle, yet abstains from fighting, shews a piece of sloath of a pestiferous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.

And it hapned so, whether by Chance or by divine Providence, that the first Dart which was thrown by the Enemy, hit the Impostors Breast, and struck him dead.

to make them friends, that they might not neglect the publick for their private dissentions. For unless there be a true concord in such Commands, there is a greater desire to keep another from doing good, than to act well themselves: But where there is an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Hatred, they are greater Enemies to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than the Adversary they go to fight with. Those very men being accused by <hi>Cn.

                  <p>How prudently did the Senate behave themselves to King <hi>Massinissa!</hi> For when they had experienc'd the faithful and ready service which he had done them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> they made a Law, whereby they gave <hi>Massinissa</hi> a freedom absolute from the power of the People of <hi>Rome.</hi> By which act, they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reclaim'd the kindness of a person, who had so well deserv'd of them, but secur'd themselves from the barbarity of the <hi>Numidians, Mauritanians</hi> and other Nations adjoyning, who before would never rest at peace.</p>

                  <p>THere is another sort of saying and doing, declining from Wisdome to the name of Cunning: which

                  <p n="1">1. In the reign of <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> a certain Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord in the <hi>Sabine</hi> Territories had a Cow of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary bigness and beauty. Which certain Authors of the Oracles said was sent into the world by the Immortal Gods, to the end that whoever offer'd it to <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Aventinum,</hi> his Countrey should obtain the Empire over the whole World. The Master re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing to hear such tydings, drave the beast with all speed, and presented it before the Altar of <hi>Diana</hi> in <hi>Aventinum,</hi> desirous to give the Honour of Supreme Empire to the <hi>Sabines.</hi> Of which the President of the Temple having notice, put it into the Owner's head, that before he slew the Sacrifice, he should wash himself in the water of the next River: who for that reason hastening to <hi>Tybur,</hi> while he was gone, the chief Priest offer'd the beast, and by a pious the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. For which sharpness of Wit, <hi>Iunius Brutus</hi> is in the first place to be commended. For when he found all the Promising Nobility to be cut off by King <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinius</hi> his Uncle, and that his Brother was by him put to death, because of the forwardness of his Wit, counterfeited himself to be a Fool; and by that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy conceal'd his own vast parts. Going also to the Oracle of <hi>Delphos</hi> with the Sons of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> whom their Father sent thither with rich Presents and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in honour of <hi>Pythian Apollo,</hi> he carri'd Gold as a Present to the Deity, hid in a hollow s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:60321:166"/>
an open Liberality. After that, the Young-men, having performed their Father's commands, consulted <hi>Apollo,</hi> which among them all should be the person that should reign in <hi>Rome.</hi> The God made answer, <hi>That he should obtain the Sovereignty, that gave his Mother of the first kiss.</hi> Then <hi>Brutus</hi> threw himself so down, as if he had fallen by chance, and kiss'd the Earth, the common Mother of all things. Which crafty Kiss given to the Earth, gave Liberty to our City, and the first place in our Annals to <hi>Brutus.</hi>

For of all the young Gentlemen, which were the noblest and the richest, that he carried with him out of <hi>Sicily</hi> unarm'd, he choose out Three Hundred, whom he order'd to furnish themselves with gay Weapons and select Horses, as if he intended to carry them along with him to the storming of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</hi> Who obeying his command, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5. Now are we to excuse <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> who said, <hi>That he never publish'd any Oration, to the end that if any Iudgment of his formerly given should chance to hinder him that he should next defend, be might aver that he never spake it.</hi> Which seem'd a reasonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for a fact hardly allowable.

                     <p n="4">4. The safety of the City of <hi>Lampsacum</hi> consisted by one act of Subtlety: For when <hi>Alexander</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nothing but the destruction of it, and saw his Master <hi>Anaximenes</hi> coming towards him without the Walls; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="5">5. The Cunning of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> was also a notable help to a young Maid, who had received Money to keep from two Guests, upon that condition, that she should restore the Money when they came both together. After some time, one of them in a Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Habit, as if his Friend had bin dead, comes and receives the whole Money: Which when she had paid, the other comes and demands his share. The poor Maid was at a loss, as well for the Money, as for Money to defend the Suit; and thought of nothing but hanging herself. But opportunely <hi>Demosthenes</hi> undertaking her Cause, <hi>The woman,</hi> said he, <hi>is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to pay the Money deposited in her custody; but unless you can bring the other person along with you, 'tis not for her to do it by the contract.

hated by all people, being to plead for his Life before them, upon a suddain began to demand the greatest employment of the Magistracy among them. Not that he thought to obtain his desire; but that the People might have wherewithal to blunt the edge of their first Anger, which is usually the sharpest. Nor did his Policy deceive him: for when the People had spent their malice in hissing him out the Assembly, and had disgrac'd him by laying him aside, when he came to plead for his Life, their malice turn'd into compassion, as if they had done enough against him before. For if he had ventur'd his life among them while they were thirsting after Revenge, he had found their Ears stopp'd against all Mercy.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Like to this was the following piece of Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The Elder <hi>Hannibal</hi> being overthrown by <hi>Dui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> in a Sea-fight, and fearing the loss of his Head for the loss of his Fleet, by an admirable act of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y mitigated his crime: For before the news of his Overthrow got home, he sends one of his Friends to <hi>Carthage</hi> in a gentile Habit. Who coming into the Senate House; <hi>Hannibal,</hi> said he, <hi>has sent me to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise with you, Whether, if he meet the</hi> Roman <hi>Admiral and finde him too numerous, he shall fight or no?</hi> When the whole Senate were unanimously for fighting; <hi>Then,</hi> said he, <hi>he has fought, and is overcome.</hi> And then it was too late to condemn the fact, which they themselves had approv'd.</p>

The other <hi>Hannibal</hi> finding <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi>'s delay so prejudicial to his Victories, to render him suspected of spinning out the War, while he wasted all other parts of <hi>Italy</hi> with Fire and Sword, he only spar'd his Farm. And the crafty act of kindness had taken effect, had not the piety of <hi>Fabius</hi> and the wily tricks of <hi>Hannibal</hi> bin too well known to the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>

For when by their frequent Rebellions they merited the total destruction of their City, and that <hi>Furius Camillus</hi> was sent for the same purpose with a very powerful Army, they all came forth to meet him in their Gowns, bringing him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, and offering him all other acts of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="10">10. But wicked was the counsel of <hi>Tullus,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Volsci</hi>; who being eager to make War upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> finding after the loss of several Battles, that his own People began to encline to Peace; by a subtile way of reasoning, made 'em do what he pleased. For it happening that a great multitude of the <hi>Volsci</hi> went to <hi>Rome</hi> to behold the Publick Shews, he told the Consuls, he was afraid they would contrive some mischief, being so numerous; advis'd them to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and presently left the Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By which contempt the <hi>Volsci</hi> incensed were easily induced to Rebellion. Thus with a Lye, mask'd in Kindness, did a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Captain deceive two Nations: The <hi>Romans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved to abuse the Innocent, and the deceived <hi>Volsci</hi> to revenge the injury.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Fidene,</hi> a City that kept the growing infancy of our City waking, and nourishing her Vertue with neighbouring Trophies and Triumphs, taught her to aspire farther, was assail'd by <hi>Tullus Hostilius</hi> with all his forces. At that time <hi>Metius Suffetius,</hi> in the field, when the Battles were ready to joyn, discover'd the falsity of his heart, which he had a long time kept conceal'd. For leaving the wing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, he drew off to a Hill, where he resolv'd to be a Spectator ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than an Assistant; intending either to triumph over the vanquish'd, or to fall upon the weary Victors. No question but it discourag'd our Souldiers to see themselves forsaken by their Allies, at the very time when they were going to fight their Enemies. To prevent which, <hi>Tullus</hi> riding swiftly about the Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, cryed out, <hi>That</hi> Metius <hi>had a drawn off by his
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:60321:170"/>
command, and that he was to fall upon the back of the</hi> Fidenates <hi>when he gave the signe.</hi> And by that cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an expert General, he chang'd their Fear into Confidence, and fill'd their breasts with Chearfulness instead of Consternation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And that I may not pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sently leave our Kings; <hi>Sextus Tarquinius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> fretting to see that the <hi>Gabii</hi> could not be taken by his Father's Army, found out a trick more powerful than Weapons themselves, whereby he over-reach'd the Town, and joyn'd it to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. For he betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the <hi>Gabii,</hi> counterfeiting himself to be fled from his Fathers stripes and severity. After that, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the good will of every one by his kind and winning behaviour, when he had won that, he sent his Servant to his Father, to tell him how he had every thing in his hands, and to desire him to know what he should do. The old mans Craft was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the youngs mans subtilty. For <hi>Tarquin</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the news, yet not confiding in the Messenger, return'd no answer, but carrying him into the Garden, strook of the heads of the highest and biggest Poppies, with his Cane. The young man understanding his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and what he had done, concluded there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning in the thing: which was, that he should either banish or put to death all the Chief Heads of the <hi>Gabii.</hi> Whereby he deliver'd up the City empty of defenders, and yet the peoples hands were not tyed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Prudently also and prosperously was it provided by our Ancestors, when our City being taken, the Capitol was besieg'd by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who despair'd of taking it any other way than by famishing the besieg'd. For by how cunning an act of deliberation did they deprive the Victors of their only motive to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy, by casting Loaves of Bread out of the Capitol
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:60321:171"/>
into several parts of the Besiegers Line! At which sight they were so amaz'd and thought us to be so well stor'd that they were constrain'd to raise their Siege, Certainly <hi>Iupiter</hi> himself took compassion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Courage, which then borrow'd assistance from craft; seeing them in the height of want, to waste the support of Life: And therefore he prosper'd the cunning Stratagem with a prosperous event.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The same <hi>Iupiter</hi> afterwards became propitious to the crafty Councils of our Captains. For when <hi>Hannibal</hi> harrassed one side of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Asdrubal</hi> had invaded the other; that the conjoyned forces of two Brothers might not too heavily and sorely oppress the already-too-weak condition of our affairs, here <hi>Claudius Nero</hi> supply'd his vigorous Counsel, there <hi>Livius Salinator</hi> providently provided. For <hi>Nero</hi> curbing <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the Province of the <hi>Lucans,</hi> making a shew of still attending the Enemy (for so the reason of War requir'd) with long and speedy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at his suddain coming, willingly redeem'd their own security by the safety of the enemy; So that it was agreed, that at the same time <hi>Africa</hi> should be freed from the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> from the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi> For had he persever'd to preserve the Walls of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> they had been still vex'd with the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

In the first place he took care to get the Sun and Wind, and so to secure himself from the flying of the Dust. Then in the very time of fight, he caus'd great part of his Army to counterfeit a flight; which when the <hi>Roman</hi> Legion follow'd, as it was divided from the rest of the Army, he provided that they should be cut to pieces by the Ambush which he had laid to entrap them.

Could the people then deny the Consulship to him, to whom they owed, or were likely to owe two most famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces? And yet that act made him a better Citizen; for he thought he was to carry himself the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously in that Consulship which he found so hard to be obtain'd.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Who more powerful, who more opulent than <hi>L. Sylla?</hi> He dispos'd of Empires and Kingdomes; he abrogated old Laws, and made new; and yet in that field of which he was afterwards Master, he lost the Praetorship which he stood for.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But to relate the greatest crime of the Elections, <hi>M. Portius Cato,</hi> who was more likely to grace the Praetorship with the gravity of his manners, than to receive addition of splendour from it, could not once obtain it at the peoples hands. Voices of Madmen, how well were they paid for the errour they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted! For the honour which they denied to <hi>Cato,</hi> they were forced to give to <hi>Vatinius.</hi> And therefore to speak the truth, the Praetorship was not then denied to <hi>Cato,</hi> but <hi>Cato</hi> was denied to the Praetorship.</p>

Which being reported by the Tribunes to the people, three persons were chosen out to buy four and twenty thousand Servants; who swearing them to be true, faithful and courageous, while the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> continued in <hi>Italy,</hi> sent them away to the Camp. Out of <hi>Apulia</hi> also and the Territories of <hi>Fidicule</hi> two hundr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d and seventy Horsemen were bought to supply the Horse. How great is the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of bitter Chance! That City which till that
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:60321:174"/>
time loath'd to have Souldiers whose heads were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tax'd, that very City is now constrain'd to hale the bodies of Slaves from their servile dens, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from the Cottages of Shepherds, to be the chief strength of their Army. Generous spirits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must sometimes give way to convenience, and submit to the power of Fortune, where he that choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses not the safest Counsel, yields to him that follows the most specious Advice. But the slaughter of <hi>Cannae</hi> so amaz'd our City, that by the industry of <hi>Marcus Iunius,</hi> then ordering the affairs of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth as Dictator, the spoils of the Enemies fix'd in the Temples consecrated to the Gods, were taken down for the service of the Wars, and the youth of the Nobility were forced to take Arms; and six Thousand condemn'd persons were also listed out of necessity. Which things consider'd in themselves, seem to look somewhat odly; but weighed in the balance of necessity, they appear to be helps fit for the severity of the times. By reason of the same Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, the Senate wrote back in answer to <hi>Otacilius</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Mammula,</hi> the one Propraetor of <hi>Sicily,</hi> the other of <hi>Sardignia,</hi> who both complain'd that they had neither Money nor Provisions for their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, That they had not Money in the Treasury for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant expences, and therefore bid them take the best course they could to provide for themselves. Whereby the Senate put the Government quite out of their own hands, and abandon'd <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sardignia,</hi> two the kindest Nurses of our City, the strength and support of their Wars, subdu'd with so much blood and sweat, in a few words, to the severe command of Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Casilinates</hi> wanting Victuals, and being closely besieg'd by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> took all the Leathern Thongs from their necessary uses, and the Leather
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:60321:175"/>
Covers from their Targets, and boyling them in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were forc'd to feed upon them. Consider but the bitterness of the Calamity, and what could be more miserable? If you consider their Constancy, what greater mark of Fidelity? Who rather than they would desert the <hi>Romans,</hi> maintain'd themselves with such a sort of Diet, when such fat Fields, and such a fertile Soyl, joyn'd so close to their Walls.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When that Town was so besieg'd, and so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully held out, it hapned that one among Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Praenestines</hi> having taken a Mouse, would rather fell it for Two Hundred <hi>Denaries,</hi> than eat it himself, notwithstanding the famishing condition he was in. But Providence allotted both to the Buyer and the Seller, the end which they both deserv'd. For the covetous person being starv'd to death, enjoy'd not the spoils of his Avarice; but he that was at so great an expence for his own preservation, though he bought it dear, yet since it was out of Necessity, liv'd.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the Consulship of <hi>C. Marius</hi> and <hi>Cn. Carbo,</hi> who contended in a Civil War with <hi>Sylla,</hi> and at what time the Commonwealth did not seek for Victory, but that the Publick was to be the Victors reward; by a Decree of the Senate, the Gold and Silver Ornaments of the Temples were melted down, to pay the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. For it was a worthy contention, whether the one should be permitted to satiate his Cruelty with the banishment of the Citizens, or whether the Immortal Gods should be rob'd. But it was not the will of the Conscript Fathers, but thine, Dire Necessity, that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd that order to be made.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When the divine <hi>Iulius</hi>'s Army besieged <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and that they wanted ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ter to raise their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, that they made up the height, which they wanted, with the Bodies of dead Men. And because they wanted Stakes, they drave in their Piles, and French-Darts
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:60321:175"/>
to strengthen 'em, Necessity teaching them a new way of Fortification.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And that I may adde the heavenly mention of the Son, to the remembrance of the celestial Father; when <hi>Phraates</hi> King of the <hi>Parthians</hi> threatned to break in upon our Provinces, and that the adjoyning Regions were terrified at the news of their coming, there was such a Famine in the Region of <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> that the Souldiers exchang'd so many Slaves for a single Vessel of Oyle, and so many Slaves for a Bushel of Wheat. But the care of <hi>Augustus,</hi> under whose Protection the world then was, soon provided a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for that Calamity.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>FORRAIGNERS.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Cretans</hi> had no such help: who being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged by <hi>Metellus,</hi> and reduced to the utmost Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, rather tormented than quench'd their thirst with their own and the Urine of their Cattle. For fearing to be overcome, they suffer'd that, which the Victors would not have forced them to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Numantines</hi> being besieged by <hi>Scipio,</hi> when they had consum'd all other things, at length were constrain'd to feed upon Mans-flesh. So that when their City was taken, there were many found with the joynts and members of the slain in their bosomes. But Necessity has no excuse for this, for there was no necessity for them to live, to whom it was so lawful to dye.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But the horrid impiety of the <hi>Calagurritans</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the obstinacy of the former: who to the end they might appear the more faithful to the ashes of the slain <hi>

upon their Wives and Children. And to the end the Armed Youth might nourish their Bowels with their own bowels the longer, they were not afraid to salt up the unfortunate remainders of the dead bodies. Think you it would be an exhortation prevalent enough in the field, to exhort such Souldiers to fight for the safety of their Wives and Children? It had bin more proper for so great a Captain to have punisht such an Enemy, than to seek for Victory. For Revenge would have purchased them more Liberty, than Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory could win them Honour; in comparison of whom Serpents and wild beasts were gentle and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful creatures. For those dear pledges of Life, dearer to them than their lives themselves, were the Dinners and Suppers of the <hi>Catagurritans.</hi>

                  <p>Let us now go to that sort of business, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the actions of Men, is the last thing done, and their chiefest care: And let us consider, what Wills have bin cancell'd after they were legally made; or might have bin cancell'd when they stood firm, and transferr'd the honour of Inheritance to others than those that expected it.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:60321:176"/>1. Which that I may do according to the order which I have proposed, I will begin with the Father of a certain Souldier, who hearing a false report of the death of his Son from the Camp, made other Heirs in his Will, and died. The Youngman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home after the war Was ended, found the dores shut against him, by the errour of his Father, and the impudence of his Friends. For how could they shew themselves more shameless than they did? The Souldier had spent the flower of his youth in his Countries Service, had undergone most dreadful Labours and Dangers, shewed the Wounds which he had received in Battle, and only begg'd that lazy Drones, a very burthen to the very City it self, might not possess his Ancestors Inheritance. Therefore laying aside his Armes, he was forced to commence a Gown-war in the Court of Justice. A hard case, while he is forc'd to contend for his Fathers estate with wicked Heirs before the <hi>Centumviri</hi>; though they could not choose but give their Opinions for him, while the Sentence of the Court gave him the day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Marcus Anneius</hi> the Son of <hi>M. Carseolanus,</hi> a famous <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, adopted by <hi>Sufenas</hi> his Uncle, cancell'd his Fathers Will, who had left him out of it, by the Sentence of the <hi>Centumviri,</hi> before whom he tryed the Cause; though <hi>Tullianus,</hi> the familiar Friend of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, who was a witness to it, were made Heir. Therefore he had more to do with the power of a person potent in Court, than with the ashes of his Father. Yet though both did what they could to hinder him, he obtain'd his fathers Goods. For <hi>L. Sextilius,</hi> and <hi>P. Popilius,</hi> whom <hi>M. Anneius,</hi> as being his nearest Relations, had made Heirs of the same part which was given to <hi>Tullianus,</hi> durst not contend by their Otahs with the young man. Though they might have bin sent for at that time by the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:60321:177"/>
highest Authorities then in being, to have defended the Will. And it was some pretence of the Heirs, that <hi>M. Auneius</hi> was translated into the Family of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenas.</hi> But the strong tye of procreation overcame both the Fathers Will, and the Authority of so great a Personage.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>C. Tettius,</hi> an Infant born of <hi>Petronia</hi> the Wife of <hi>Tettius</hi> as long as he liv'd, being disinherited by his Father, was restored to his Inheritance by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the divine <hi>Augustus,</hi> doing like a Father of his Countrey: In regard that <hi>Tettius</hi> had so unjustly abrogated the paternal Name, by giving away his estate from a Son, so legally born to his own Right.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Septicia</hi> also, the Mother of the <hi>Trachali</hi> of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> being angry with his Sons, out of spite when she was now past child-bearing married <hi>Publicius</hi> an old man, and left both her Children out of her Will.

                  <p>HAving contended our selves with these Examples of cancell'd Wills, let us give a hint upon those that have remain'd confirm'd, when there was cause enough for them to have bin cancell'd.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How publickly and scandalously was <hi>Tuditanus</hi> noted for a madman! being one that threw his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney among the People, and trayl'd his Cloak after him in the <hi>Forum,</hi> as if it had bin the garment of a Tragedian; so that he was the laughter of all that beheld him, besides many other pranks of the same nature which they beheld. He made his Son Heir by his Will: which <hi>T. Longus</hi> by the Judgment of the <hi>Centumviri</hi> in vain endeavour'd to have disannull'd, as being next of kin. For the <hi>Centumviri</hi> thought it more proper to consider what was written in the Will, than who had wrote it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The conversation of <hi>Tuditanus</hi> was Frantick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>Aebucia,</hi> who was the wife of <hi>L. Menenius Agrippa.</hi> made a Will that as Madness it self. For having two Daughters of equal vertue, <hi>Plaetoria</hi> and <hi>Afrania,</hi> through the inclination of her own minde, rather
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:60321:178"/>
than for any offence or miscarriage, she only made <hi>Plaetoria</hi> her Heir: and to the Children of <hi>Afrania,</hi> out of her vast Patrimony, she left only twenty thousand pieces of Money. However <hi>Afrania</hi> would not contend by Oath with her Sister, rather choosing patiently to honour her Mothers Will, than to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it in Court; shewing her self thereby so much the more unworthy the Injury done her, by how much the more patiently she bore it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Q. Metellus</hi> committed a womanish errour, less to be admir'd, For he, though there were several eminent and famous young men, of the same name, living in our City at the same time, and that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Claudii,</hi> to whom he was most nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, were then very numerous, left <hi>Corinates</hi> onely his Heir; neither did any one attempt to question his Will.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Pompeius</hi> also <hi>Rheginus,</hi> a <hi>Tramontane,</hi> being by his Brother left out of his Will, and that to prove his Injustice, he had in a full Assembly of both Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders recited two former Wills made and testified in the publick place of Elections, by which this Brother was made Heir of the greatest part, only there was premis'd to him the summ of an hundred and fifty Sesterces; after he had long complain'd to his Friends that sooth'd his indignation, took a resolution not to trouble the ashes of his Brother in a Court of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature. Yet they, whom he had made his Heirs, were so far from being so near a kin by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Fathers side, that they were not the next to him; but stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and poor. So that the Silence seem'd to be wicked, and the Pride contumelious.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Happy in their Impunity, but whether these Wills were not worse in offending, is the Question. <hi>Quintus Caecilius</hi> by the diligent endeavour and great Liberalitie of <hi>L. Lucullus,</hi> having attain'd to a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:60321:179"/>
some degree of Dignity, and an ample Patrimony when he had fully resolv'd that he alone should be his Heir, and on his Death-bed had given him his Rings from off his Fingers; yet by his Will adopted <hi>Pomponius Atticus,</hi> and made him Heir to all his Estate. But the <hi>Roman</hi> People tying a Halter about the neck of the Carcass of that deceitful and falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious person, dragg'd him along the High-way. Thus the wicked wretch had a Son and Heir, such as he desir'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a Funeral and a Grave, such as he deserv'd.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Neither was <hi>T. Marius Vrbinas</hi> worthy of any other; who by the favour of the divine <hi>Augustus</hi> the Emperour, being rais'd from the lowest condition of a common Souldier, to the highest commands in the Camp; and being by them enrich'd, not onely at other times declar'd, that he would leave his fortunes to him that had bestow'd them on him, and but the day before he died protested the same thing to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> himself; when as he had not so much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd his name in his will.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Lucius Valerius,</hi> whose sirname was <hi>Hepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chordus,</hi> having experienc'd the enmity of <hi>Cornelius Balbus</hi> in Court, as being plagued by his advice and management with several private Suits, and at length by a suborned witness being by him accus'd of a Capital Crime, leaving out his Advocates and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, left him sole Heir; cow'd by such a dread, as turn'd his resolutions topsie turvie. For he lov'd his Ignominie, lov'd the dangers, and seem'd to wish he had bin condemn'd: being so kind to the authour of those mischiefs, and hating his defenders.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>T. Barrulus</hi> open his Death-bed deliv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r'd his Rings to <hi>Lentulus Spinther,</hi> whose kindness and friendship he had felt, as to his only Heir; yet left him nothing at all. How strangely at that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:60321:179"/>
of time (if it be of that force which we believe it to be) did Conscience punish that abominable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! For between the very thoughts of his Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Fallacy, he yielded up his last breath, as if some Tormenter had crucified his soul within him. For he knew that his passage from life to death was hateful to the Gods, and would be detested by the Infernal Spirits.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Marcus Popilius</hi> upon his death-bed beheld <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius Gallus</hi> a Senator, with whom he had been fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar from his youth, as the Laws of antient friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship requir'd, and gave him the most loving words imaginable. For be thought him only worthy, of all that stood by him, of his last embrace and kiss: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he deliver'd him his Rings, to ensure him of that Inheritance which he was never likely to enjoy. Which Rings laid up in his Purse, and assigned to him by those that were present, <hi>Oppius,</hi> (a diligent man, but a mere mock of his dying friend) disinherits himself, and returns them diligently to his Heirs. What could be more dishonest or more unseasonable at this time and place? That a Senator of the <hi>Roman</hi> people, just ready to die, not only as a man to the world, but also as a publick person to the Senate-house, should have such a trick put upon him, against all the sacred Laws of friendship, when his eyes were set in his head, and he drawing his last breath?</p>

                     <p>NOw that the doubtful motions of Judgments may more easily be endured, let us relate for what causes they that laboured under Envy, were either acquitted or condemned.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="347" facs="tcp:60321:180"/>1. <hi>M.

The one was incens'd by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Cruelty of the Murther, the other by the reason of the fact enclin'd to Mercy: believing the immature love of the Virgin more severely than impiously pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd. And thus the brothers arm being sav'd by so stout a correction, reap'd as much honour from the blood of his near relation, as from the blood of an enemy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Before the <hi>Roman</hi> people shewed themselves fierce preservers of Chastity; afterwards more mild Judges than Justice it self required. For when <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Galba</hi> was severely accused by <hi>Libo,</hi> a Tribune of the People, for that being a Praetor in <hi>Spain,</hi> he had put to death a great number of the <hi>Luft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>anians,</hi> contrary to his Faith given them; and that <hi>Cato,</hi> at that time very aged, in an Oration upon publick Record, had made good what the Tribune had done; so that the party accused had not a word to say for his own defence; yet when with tears in his eyes he only recommended to the Assembly his little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the young Son of <hi>Sulpitius Gallus,</hi> neerly related to him, he so appeas'd the wrath of his Judges, that he, who was but just now ready to be condemn'd by the Vote of all, had hardly in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant one Vote to his prejudice. Pitie, not Equity, rul'd that Inditement; since that Absolution that could not be granted to Innocency, was given out of respect to the Children.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Like to this was that which follows. <hi>Aulus Gabinius,</hi> in the height of Infamy, being by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of <hi>C. Memmius</hi> expos'd to the suffrages of the People, seem'd to be past all hope. For the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement was full, the Defence weak, and his Judges such as with a precipitate malice desired his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:60321:181"/>
The Officers and Imprisonment hovered before his eyes, and yet all vanished away by the interposition of propitious Fortune. For <hi>Sisenna,</hi> the Son of <hi>Gabinius,</hi> by an impulse of consternation, throwing himself a Suppliant at the feet of <hi>Memmius,</hi> besought there some asswagement of the Tempest, where the whole fury of the Storm first arose. Whom the Victor beholding with a stern countenance, and tearing his Ring from his finger, suffer'd for some time to lye groveling upon the ground. Which sad spectacle wrought that effect, that <hi>Laelius</hi> the Tribune by a general consent order'd the prisoner to be set at liberty. Teaching us, that no man ought insolently to abuse the successes of Prosperity, nor over-weakly to be cast down by Adversity.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Which is made manife<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t by the next Example. <hi>Publius Claudius,</hi> I cannot tell whether to the greater detriment of Religion or his Countrey (in regard he contemn'd the antient Customes of the one, and lost a noble Navy of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>other) being expos'd to the anger of the People; when it was thought he could no way avoid the punishment that he deserv'd, saved himself from Condemnation, by the benefit of a suddain storm. By which means the Trial being laid aside, it pleased the People never to bring it on again, as if the Gods themselves had forbid it. Thus was he saved by a Land-storm, whom a Sea-tempest had like to have brought to condemnation.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. By the same sort of assistance the Chastity of <hi>Tuccia,</hi> a <hi>Vetal</hi> Virgin, and accu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For, snatching up a sieve, Vesta, said she, <hi>If I have always attended thy Rites with clean and chast hands, grant that I may take up water out of</hi> Tiber <hi>in this, and carry it
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:60321:181"/>

                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Lucius Piso</hi> also being accused by <hi>Claudius Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>or having done great and intolerable injuries to the <hi>Roman</hi> Alties, by a lucky chance escaped the fear of an unquestioned ruine: For at the same time that they were about to give severe Judgment against him, there fell a sudden shower, which filled his mouth full of du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t, as he lay prostrate at the feet of his Judges. Which Spectacle changed the whole Trial from Severity into Pity and Clemency: For they believ'd he had given full satisfaction to their Allies, by being compell'd to prostrate himself so submissively, and rise again with so much deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. I will adde two that escaped by their Accusers own fault. <hi>Quintus Flavius</hi> the Augur was accused by <hi>Valerius</hi> the Aedil, and proved guilty to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and being condemn'd by the Votes of fourteen Tribes, cryed out he was innocently condemn'd.

He had cast his enemy: when he certainly thought him ruin'd, he restor'd him; and lost the victory, even in the victory it self.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>C. Cosconius</hi> sound guilty by the <hi>Servilian</hi> Law, and for many evident and notorious crimes condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was sav'd by one Verse recited in the Sessions-House by <hi>Val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Attilius Calati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> being condemn'd for having betrayed the Town of <hi>Sora,</hi> and a person otherwise infamous, only a few words of <hi>Q. Maximus,</hi> his Father-in-law, sav'd from the threatning danger: wherein he affirmed, that if he sound him guilty of that crime, he would break off his affinity. Presently the People yielded up their own to the judgment of one man; believing it an unworthy thing, not to believe his Testimony, whom they had entrusted in the greatest Dangers of the Commonwealth.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>M. Aemilius Scourus</hi> also guilty of Bribery, made so lame and pitiful defence at his Trial, that his Accuser said openly, that he should have liberty to name an hundred and twenty witnesses for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and that he would be content to have the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner acquitted, if he could produce so many in the Province, from whom he had never taken any thing. Yet, though he could not make use of so fair a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was freed for the sake of his Nobility, and the fresh memory of his Father.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. But as the Fame of Great men has prevailed to protect the Guilty, so has it as little avail'd to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press them: rather it has bin a safeguard to them in the height of Prosecution. P. <hi>Scipio Aemilianus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused <hi>L. Cotta</hi> to the Praetor; whose cause, though it were full of deep crimes, was seven times delayed, and the eighth judgment acquitted him. For those wise men were loath it should be thought that his Condemnation had bin, because his Accuser was so great a person. And therefore I believe they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd thus amongst themselves: We must not admit
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:60321:182"/>
him that seeks the life of another, to bring Triumphs, Trophies and Spoils to the seat of Judgment: Let him be terrible to his Enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but let not a Citizen, trusting to his high Merits and great Honour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute a Citizen.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Not more eager were those Judges against a most noble Accuser, than these were mild toward a Criminal of a far lower degree. <hi>Callidius</hi> of <hi>Bononia,</hi> being taken by night in the Husbands Bed chamber, being brought to answer for the Adultery, he buoyed himself up among the greatest and most violent waves of Infamy, swimming like corn in a Shipwrack, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold upon a very flight kind of defence. For he pleaded, that he was carried thither, for the Love of a Servant-boy. The place was suspected, the time suspitious, the Mistress of the house was suspected, and his Youth suspected: But the confession of a more intemperate Lust, freed him from the Crime of Adultery.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The next is an example of more concernment. When the two Brothers of <hi>Cloelius</hi> were brought to answer for Parricide, whose Father was kill'd in his bed, while the Sons lay asleep in the same Chamber, and neither Servant nor Freed-man could be found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom to fasten the suspicion of the Murther: They were both acquitted, only for this reason, that it was made appear to the Judges, that they were both found fast asleep with the door open. Sleep, the certain mark of innocent security, sav'd the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate. For it was adjudg'd impossible, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving murthered their Father, they could have slept so securely over his wounds and blood.</p>

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:60321:183"/>
things beside the question did more harm, than their own Innocency did good. L. <hi>Scipio,</hi> after a most noble Triumph over King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> was condemned for taking Money of him. Not that I think he was brib'd to remove beyond the Mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> him that was lately Lord of all <hi>Asia,</hi> and just going to lay his victorious hands upon <hi>Europe.</hi> But being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a man of a most upright l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e, and free far enough from any such suspicion, he could nor resist the <hi>envy</hi> that haunted the two famous Sirnames of the two Brothers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Scipio</hi> was a person of high splendour. But <hi>Decianu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Furius,</hi> a man of a lewd life, because that in some part of his Declamation he ventured to complain of the Death of <hi>Saturninus,</hi> did not only not condemn the Guilty, but suffered the Punishment appointed for him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The same case overthrew <hi>C. Titius.</hi> He was innocent, and in favour with the People, for the <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Law. But because he had the statue of <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi> in his house, the whole College of Magistrates with one general consent ruined him.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. We may pass to those whom the violence of Condemnation snatched away for flight causes. <hi>M. Mulvius, Cn. Lollius, L.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Claudius Centumalus</hi> being commanded by the Augurs to pull down some of the height of his House, which he had built upon the <hi>Caelian</hi> Mount, because it hindered them from observing their Auguries from the Tower, sold it to <hi>Calpurnius Lanatius,</hi> concealing the command of the Augurs. By whom <hi>Calpurnius</hi> being compelled to pluck down his House, brought <hi>Marc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Porcius Cato,</hi> father of the famous <hi>Cato,</hi> to <hi>Claudius</hi> as an Arbitrator, and the form of Writing, <hi>Whatever he ought to give him, or do in good Equity.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:60321:184"/>
Cato,</hi> understanding that <hi>Claudius</hi> had for the nonce supprest the Augurs Edict, presently condemned him to <hi>Calpurnius</hi>; with all the Justice in the world. For they that fell according to Conscience and Equity, ought neither to enhance the hopes of the Bargain, nor conceal the Inconveniencies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I have recited a Judgment famous in those times: Yet what I am about to relate, is not quite buried in silence. <hi>C. Visellius Varro</hi> being taken with a great fit of Sickness, suffered a Judgment of three thousand pieces of Money, as borrowed of <hi>Otacilia Laterensis,</hi> with whom he had lived as her Gallant: With this designe, that if he died, she might claim that sum of the Heirs; colouring the Liberality of his Lust, under the title of a Debt. After that, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellius,</hi> contrary to <hi>Otacilia's</hi> wishes, recovers. Who offended that she had lost her prey by his recovery, from a close Friend began to act like an open Usurer, challenging the Money, which as shamelesly as vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly she gap'd for by a void contract. Which <hi>Aquillius,</hi> a man of great authority and knowledge in the Civil Law, being chosen to be Judge of, consulting with the Principal Men of the City, by his Prudence and good Conscience foyled the woman. And if by the same form <hi>Varro</hi> might have been condemned, and the adversary absolved, no question but he would have willingly punish'd his soul and unwarrantable folly. Now he stifled the calumny of a private Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and left the crime of Adultery to publick Justice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Much more stoutly and with a souldierlike Gallantry did <hi>Marius</hi> behave himself in a Judgment of the same nature. For when <hi>T. Titinius</hi> of <hi>Minturnum</hi> married <hi>Fannia</hi> his wife, because he knew her to be unchast, and having divorc'd her for the same crime, would have kept her Dower: he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing chosen Judge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd having examined the business, took <hi>Titinius</hi>
                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:60321:185"/>
aside, and perswaded him to proceed no farther, but to return the woman her Dower; but finding that all his perswasions were in vain, and being forced to pronounce Sentence, he fin'd the woman for Adultery a Sesterce, and <hi>Titinius</hi> the whole summ of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Telling them, that therefore he had observed that method of judgment, because it seem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to him apparent, that he had married <hi>Fannia,</hi> whom he knew to be a lewd woman, that he might cheat her of her estate. This <hi>Fannia</hi> was she, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when <hi>Marius</hi> was proclaimed an Enemy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him into her house at <hi>Minturnum,</hi> all bedaubed with mud and durt, and assisted him what lay in her power; remembring that he had adjudged her for Unchastity, out of his rigorous manner of life, but that he had saved her Dower, out of his Religion and Piety.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That Judgment was also much talked of, by which a certain person was condemned for their, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause having borrowed a Horse to carry him to <hi>Aricia,</hi> he rode him to the furthermost cliff of that City. What can we do here but praise the Modesty of that Age, wherein such minute excesses from Honesty were punished?</p>

                  <p n="1">1. IT follows that I relate pertinent Examples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Witnesses. <hi>Cneus</hi> and <hi>Servilius Caepio,</hi> born both of the same Parents, and having mounted through all the degrees of Honour to the height of Greatness: Also the two Brothers <hi>Q.</hi> and <hi>L. Metellus,</hi> of the Consular and Censors Dignity, and the other that had triumphed, giving in severe testimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Q. Pompey A. F.</hi> who stood accused of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery: the credit of their testimony was not quite
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:60321:187"/>
abrogated, by the acquittal of <hi>Pompey</hi>; but it was done so, that an Enemy might not seem to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by power.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>M. Aemilius Scaurus,</hi> Prince of the Senate, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted <hi>C. Memmius</hi> for Bribery, with smart testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. He followed <hi>Flavius,</hi> accused by the same Law, with the same fierceness; he profestly endeavoured to ruine <hi>C. Norbanus,</hi> for Treason put to the publick rack: yet neither by his Authority, which was very great, nor by his Piety, of which no man doubted, could he do any of them any harm.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>L. Crassus</hi> also, as great among the Judges, as <hi>Scaurus</hi> among the Conscript Fathers: For he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned their Opinions and Judgments by the potent and happy salaries of his Eloquence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prince of the Court of Judicature, as the other of the Senate: Yet when he shot a Thunderbolt of Testimony against <hi>Marcellus,</hi> it fell heavy indeed, but vanished in smoak.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Again, there was <hi>Q. Metellus</hi> the holy, the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culli,</hi> the <hi>Hortensii, M. Lepidus,</hi> what weight did they not onely lay upon the lite of <hi>C. Cornelius</hi> accused of Treason, but also denied that the Commonwealth could stand, so long as he were safe? All which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the City, it shames me to relate it, were all kept off by the shield of Justice.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What! <hi>M. Cicero,</hi> who by the warfare of the Law attained to the highest Honours and the noblest place of Dignity, was he not as a witness thrown out of the very Camp of his Eloquence, while he swore that <hi>Clodius</hi> was at his house in <hi>Rome?</hi> for by that one argument of his absence, the Prisoner fended off the villany which he had committed. And so the Judges rather chose to acquit <hi>Clodius</hi> of the Incest, than <hi>Cicero</hi> of the Infamy of Perjury.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Among so many Witnesses of high degree, I
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:60321:187"/>
will relate one, whose authority is confirmed by a new manner of reasoning in Court. <hi>Publius Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> a Consul, a Censor, a Triumpher, who added the name of <hi>Isauricus</hi> to that of his Ancestors, when walking by the Court he saw several Witnesses pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced against a Criminal, he placed himself among the Witnesses, and to the great admiration of the Parties Friends and Accusers, thus began: <hi>This person,</hi> said he, <hi>most reverend Iudges, that pleads, what Countrey be is of, or what course of life he leads, or whether he be deservedly or wrongfully accused, I know not: But this I know, that meeting me once in the</hi> Laurentine <hi>Way, as I was travelling along, in a very narrow passage, he would not alight from his horse; which whether it belong to your cognizance, I know not, do you consider that; I thought it not sit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal this matter.</hi> Presently the Judges condemned the Party, scarce hearing any other Witnesses. For the Grandeur of the Speaker prevailed with them, and his Indignation at the contempt of his neglected Dignity; believing that he, that scorn'd to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Princes, would not stick to run into any wickedness.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>C. Marius</hi> had acted the part of a great and faithful Citizen, in ruining of <hi>L.

But when <hi>Sylla</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the City with his Army, he himself fled to the assistance of the Slaves, by holding forth the Cap, as the other had done.

                  <p>WHerefore do I delay to commemorate the force of Industry? By whose active spirit the Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends of Warfare are corroboraetd, and the glory of the Forum is enflamed; all Studies are cherished in her faithful breast: Whatever is performed by the Hand, by the Minde, by the Tongue, by her is added to the heap of applause; which being an admirable vertue, strengthens her self yet more by her own Constancy.</p>

                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:60321:189"/>1. <hi>Cato</hi> in the fourscore and sixth year of his age, while he persists with a youthful vigour in defending the Commonwealth, accused of a Capital Crime by his Enemies, pleaded his own Cause: Yet no man ever observed so large a Memory, a greater strength of Body, or less hesitation of Speech. Because he kept all those things in equal condition, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exercised by Industry. And at the very conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his laborious life, he opposed his own most eloquent Defence to the Accusation of <hi>Galba</hi> touching <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same person desired to learn the <hi>Greek</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: How late, we may thence guess, in that he was an old man before he learnt to read <hi>Latine.</hi> But when he had won great Honour by his Eloquence, he did it to make himself skilful in the Civil Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whose wonderful Offspring, nearer to our age, <hi>Cato</hi> also, burn't with such a desire of learning, that in the very Court it self, before the Senate fill'd, he would be reading <hi>Greek</hi> Books. By which Industry he shewed that some want time, others have more than they need.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But <hi>Terentius Varro,</hi> an Example of Humane Life, and one that might be truly call'd, <hi>A space of years</hi>; not so much for his years, which were equal to an Age of Time, as for the vivacity of his Style. For in the same Bed his Breath, and the course of his egregious Works expired.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Livius Drusus,</hi> a man of the fame perseverance, who defective in vigour of Age and Eye-sight, most bountifully interpreted the Civil Law to the People, and composed most profitable Monuments for them that desire to learn it. For though Nature might make him old, and Fortune blind, yet neither could prevent him from being vigorous and quick-sighted in minde.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:60321:189"/>5. But <hi>Paulus</hi> the Senator, and <hi>Pontius Lupus</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, famous Pleaders in their times, having both lost their sight, with the same Industry conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued at the Bar. Therefore were they also more frequently heard, amid the concourses of some that were delighted with their Wit, and of others that admir'd their Constancy. For they that are disheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by such Misfortunes, generally desire dismission, adding voluntary to fortuitous darkness.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now <hi>P. Crassus,</hi> when he came Consul into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> against King <hi>Aristonicus,</hi> with so much care he comprehended in his minde the knowledge of the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, that he understood it, though divided into five Dialects, in all its parts and quantities. Which mightily won him the love of the Allies, while he answered every one in the Language wherein they made their requests before his Tribunal.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Let not <hi>Roscius</hi> be left out, a notable Example of Theatrical Industry, who never exposed to the People any other Action or Gesture, but what he had studied before at his own house. Therefore did not the Art of Playing make <hi>Roscius</hi> esteemed, but <hi>Roscius</hi> made the Art of Playing esteemed; whereby he obtained not onely the favour of the people, but the familiarity of Princes. These are the rewards of an intent, anxious, and never-ceasing Study: For which reason the person of a Player is not impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inserted among the praises of so many great men.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Grecian</hi> Industry also, because it was very advantageous to ours, ought to receive the fruit which it deserved from the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue. <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> upon the mentioning of whose name arises in the

thoughts of the hearers the perfection of the greatest Eloquence, when in his youth he could not pronounce the first Letter of the Art which he so much affected, with so much labour vanquished the defect of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, that no man ever pronounced it naturally more freely. Then again, having a shrill squeaking Voice, harsh to the ear, he brought it at length to a grave and acceptable Tone. Then being but a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, he borrowed from labour and practice, that strength of Body which nature had denied him. For he comprehended several Sentences in one breath, and pronounced them walking up hill with a swift pace. And standing upon the Sea-side, made his Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the roaring of the Waves, that he might enure his ears with patience to the clamours and noises of tumultuous Assemblies. He is reported also to have accustomed himself to speak much and long with stones held in his mouth, that he might speak with more freedom when it was empty. He warred against Nature, and came off Victor; with a most obstinate strength of minde overcoming her malignity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And that we may ascend to a more antient act of Industry, <hi>Phythagoras,</hi> a most perfect work of a wisdome from his Childhood, and inflamed with a desire of understanding all Honesty and Vertue, went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where being accustomed to the language, he search'd the Commentaries of all the antient Priests, and brought away the Observations of innumerable Ages. Then travelling into <hi>Persia,</hi> he delivered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up to be taught by the exact prudence of the <hi>Magi</hi>: From whom he treasur'd up in his docible minde the Motions of the Stars; their Courses, their Effects, Properties, and Force, being courteously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to him.

Whose burning Funeral-Pile <hi>Metaponius</hi> beheld with eyes full of veneration: A Town more famous for <hi>Pythagoras</hi> Tomb, that the monument of its own ashes.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Plato</hi> having <hi>Athens</hi> for his place of Nativity, and <hi>Socrates</hi> for his Master, both place and man fertil in Learning; fraught also himself with a celestial abundance of Wit, when he was accounted the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of all Mortals, to that degree, that if <hi>Iupiter</hi> should descend from Heaven, he could not make use of a more elegant or happier Eloquence; yet for all this he travell'd to <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he learnt from the Priests of that Nation, he manifold secrets of <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,</hi> and the reason of their Celestial Observations. And at the same time that the studious Gentlemen of <hi>Athens</hi> sought for <hi>Plato,</hi> whom every one strove to have his Tutor, he by visiting the riddle-like Banks of Nile, and vast Regions, extended Barbarisme, and the winding Canals of a strange Countrey, of an Ancient Master became a Scholar. No wonder then that he travell'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> there from <hi>Archytas</hi> of <hi>Tarentum, Timaeus, Arion</hi> and <hi>Caetus</hi> of <hi>Locri,</hi> to learn the precepts of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> For so great a plenty, so great an abundance of Learning was every where to be collected, that it might easily be disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from one place to another, through the whole world.

Then abiding at <hi>Athens</hi> for several years, spending all his time in gaining and practising learning, he liv'd unknown in the City, as he testifies in a certain Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume.

For when <hi>Syracuse</hi> was taken, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> was sensible that his Victory was much delayed by his Engines, yet infinitely taken with the Prudence of the person, he commanded the Souldiers to spare his Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> assuming perhaps almost as much glory in saving <hi>Archimedes,</hi> as in destroying <hi>Syracuse.</hi> But while <hi>Archimedes</hi> was making Figures with his minde and eyes fixed upon the ground, a Souldier, that was broken into his house to plunder, with his drawn Sword asked him who he was. The Philosopher was so intent, that he return'd him no direct Answer, but parting dust with his finger, <hi>Have a care,</hi> said he, <hi>of spoyling this Circle.</hi> Thereupon, as one that slighted the Victor of the Empire, the Souldier cut off his Head, and blended his blood with the Lineaments of his Art.

                  <p>BUt the Ornaments of Eloquence consist in apt Motion of the Body, and due Pronuntiation: Wherewith when she has furnished her self, she assails men three ways; by invading their Mindes, and delivering up the ears of the one and the eyes of the other to over-persuasion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But to make this good in famous men; <hi>C. Gracchus,</hi> more happy in his Eloquence than his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, because he strove with a turbulent Wit rather to disturb than defend the Commonwealth, as often as he spoke to the People, had a Servant that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>Music</hi> behinde him, who with an Ivory Pipe regulated the tone of his Voice, raising the note when it was too low, and pitching it lower when it was too high and eager: Because heat and violence of action, did not suffer him to be a true Judge of the equality.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Quintus Hortensius</hi> thinking there was very much to be ascribed to a decent and comly motion of the Body, spent more time in practising that, than in
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:60321:195"/>
studying for Eloquence. So that it was hard to know, whether the Concourse were greater to hear or see him; So mutually did his Aspect serve his words, and his words his Aspect. And therefore it is certain, that <hi>Roscius</hi> and <hi>Aesopus,</hi> the most skilful Actors in the world, would be always in Court when <hi>Hortensius</hi> pleaded, to carry away his postures to the Stage.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now as for <hi>M. Cicero,</hi> he has himself declar'd, how great a value he set upon both these things, of which we have discours'd, in his Oration for <hi>Gallius,</hi> reproaching <hi>Callidius</hi> the Accuser, that when he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd that he would prove by Witnesses, Writings, and Examinations, that the Party accus'd had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared poyson for him, he did it with a smooth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, a faint Voice, and a calm manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby he detected as well the fault of the Orator, as the argument of his weak cause, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thus; <hi>Couldst thou do thus,</hi> M.

                     <p n="1">1. Consentaneous to this was the judgment of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> who being ask'd what was the most efficacious part that belong'd to speaking, answered, <gap reason="foreign">

touching the Course of the Sun and Moon: nor did he permit his fellow-Citizens to tremble any farther with vain fear.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How great was the honour that <hi>Alexander</hi> the King gave to Art, who would not suffer himself to be painted by any other but <hi>Apelles,</hi> nor to be cast in Plaister by any other than <hi>Lysippus?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Vulcan</hi> of <hi>Alcamenes,</hi> made with his own hands, fixes the eyes of all <hi>Athens</hi> upon it. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the rest of the foregoing marks of curious Workmanship, they admire also this, that he stands with one foot, hiding under his garment his dissembled Lameness: artificially signifying not the deformity, but the certain and proper mark of the God.</p>

For why should we wonder to see irrational Creatures deceived by Art, when we finde a sacrilegious Desire in Man rais'd up at the sight of a dumb stone?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But Nature as she suffers Art sometimes to emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late her works, so sometimes she dismisses it, quite tir'd with labour in vain; which the hands of the famous Artist <hi>Euphranor</hi> experimented: For when he painted twelve Gods at <hi>Athens,</hi> he finished the Picture of <hi>Neptune</hi> with the most Majestick Colours he could invent, intending yet to have outdone that in the Picture of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> But all his Invention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exhausted in the former work, his last endeavours could not come near his expectation.</p>

                        <pb n="411" facs="tcp:60321:197"/>6. What shall we say of that other famous Painter, who representing the doleful Sacrifice of <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> when he had placed about the Altar <hi>Calebas</hi> sad, <hi>Vlysses</hi> sorrowful, and <hi>Menelaus</hi> lamenting, by wrapping up of <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s face did he not confess, that the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the height of grief could not be exprest by Art? Therefore his Picture moisten'd with the tears of the Southsayer, her Friends and Brother, he left it to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to judge of the Father's Grief.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And that I may adde one Example of the same Art; A famous Painter had painted a Horse, new coming from being hard exercis'd, so rarely, that all that could be said was, that the Horse was not alive. But when he came to adde the froath to his Nostrils, so great an Artist spent many days without any satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to himself. At length, vexed to see himself disappointed, he took up a Spunge that lay next him bedaub'd with all sorts of Colours, and went about to rub out his own work. But Fortune directing his hand first to the Nostrils of the Horse, the Spunge did that by chance, which all his Art could not effect. So that what his own Shadows could not, Chance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. I will adde the thirst of <hi>Aristotle</hi> after Honour, as great as that of a King and a young man. For he had given certain Books of Oratory to <hi>Theodectes</hi> his Disciple, to put forth in his own name: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards vex'd that he had let go the Title to another, insisting upon some things in his own Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, he addes, that he had discoursed more plainly of them in the Books of <hi>Theodectes.</hi> Did not the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty of so great and so diffusive a Science withhold me, I would say, he was a Philosopher, whose great parts ought to have been delivered to a Philosopher of a nobler Soul. But Honour is not contemn'd by thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> that desire to introduce the Contempt of it, For to those very Volumes they diligently set their Names, that what they take away by Profession, they may attain by Usurpation of Memory. But this dissimulation of theirs, whatever it be, is more to be endur'd than the purpose of those, who while they labour for eternal Memories, strive to become famous by wickedness.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Among which I know not whether <hi>Pausanias</hi> may not be first mentioned; for when he had ask'd <hi>Hermocrates</hi> how he might suddenly become famous, and that the other had answered, By killing some great person, presently went and slew <hi>Philip.</hi> And indeed what he covered he had; for he render'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as infamously famous for the Murther, as <hi>Philip</hi> was eminent for his Vertue to Posterity.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. To <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> the Consulship was granted long before his time. To whom what was assign'd him in his life-time, would be too long to relate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are many; and not necessary, as being in part already related. And therefore I will adde what is at this day eminent. He has an Image placed in Great <hi>Iupiters</hi> Temple, which when there is any Funeral of the <hi>Cornelian</hi> Family, is fetch'd from thence: So that to that onely Image is the Capitol like a Porch, or place where those Images are usually placed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As truly as was the Senate-House it self to the Elder <hi>Cato</hi>'s Image, from whence it is brought forth upon the same occasions of that Family. A Grateful Order, that would have so profitable a Member al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways dwell with them, wealthy in all the Gifts of Vertue, and great rather by his own Merit, than by the benefit of Fortune; by whose counsel <hi>Carthage</hi> was ruin'd, before it was laid waste by the Sword of <hi>Scipio.</hi>

A rare Example of Honour arises also from <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio Nasica.</hi> For by his Hands, and into his House, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was yet a Questor, the Senate by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Pythian Apollo,</hi> would have the <hi>Mother of the gods</hi> received and entertained, when recalled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And again, when he went into the field to the Election of the Questors, to give his voice for <hi>Q. Fabius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Maximus</hi>'s Brother, they brought him home a Consul. To the same person the Senate gave a Province with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Lot, first <hi>Africa,</hi> then <hi>Spain.</hi> And these things neither to an ambitious Senator nor Citizen; as the most severe course of his Life, and his clandestine Death, being slain by treachery, decla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Damasippus</hi> had no praise; and therefore his memory may be the more severely prosecuted: by whose commands the Heads of the principal Men of the City were mingled with the heads of the Sacrifices; and the headless Body of <hi>Carbo Arvina</hi> carried about, nail'd to the Gallows. So that the Pretorship of a most licentious man could do much, or the Authority of the Commonwealth nothing.</p>

exercis'd his savage Cruelty after a most truculent manner. For after he had kill'd all the Citizens which he thought well affected to <hi>Caesar,</hi> he threw them headlong from the Walls. He also murder'd the Women, calling their Husbands first that were in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Camp to the walls, to the end they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the slaughter of their Wives. Nor did he spare the Children laid upon their Mothers laps; suffering the tender Infants to be some dash'd against the stones, others to be thrown up and to fall upon the stakes. Which things, intolerable to be heard, were executed by <hi>Lusitanians,</hi> at the command of a <hi>Roman</hi>; by whose assistance, <hi>Flaccus</hi> well fortified, withstood the divine Labours of <hi>Caesar,</hi> with a doting obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Let us pass to those, for which though there be the same grief, yet there is not the same reason for our City to blush. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> put <hi>Attilius Regulus</hi> to death after a doleful manner. For having cut off his Eye-brows, and shut him up in a little wooden case, wherein there was nothing but sharp nails, they suffer'd him to linger with continual watching, and in a long series of pain. A kind of Torment not worthy him that suffer'd, but becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authors of it. The same Cruelty they used toward our Souldiers, whom being taken in a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fight, they fasten'd under the bottom of their Ships, that being crush'd to death by the weight of the Reel, they might satiate their barbarous ferity, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual kinde of death.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Their Captain <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whose chiefest Vertue consisted in Cruelty, made a Bridge over the River <hi>Vergellus</hi> with the bodies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and so led
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:60321:211"/>
over his Army, that the Earth might experiment the wickedness of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Land-forces, as the Sea had beheld the barbarity of their Mariners. Those whom he had taken prisoners, picking out the nearest of Kin that he could, he compell'd to fight by pairs, till he made them destroy one another. Those that were tir'd he lest upon the Road, with the lower part of their Feet cut off. Deservedly therefore, though too slow the punishment were, the Senate forced him, when a Suppliant to King <hi>Prusias,</hi> to a voluntary Death.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As truely had they reason to abominate <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi> who with one Epistle slew fourscore thousand <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, dispers'd over <hi>Asia</hi> as Merchant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, defiling the hospitable Gods of so large a Province, with blood unjustly shed, though not unrevenged. For which intolerable torment, at length he compell'd that Vital Spirit to submit, that contended with the poyson. Thereby attaining those torments, which he had made his own friends to suffer at the beck of <hi>Gaurus</hi> his Eunuch, to whom his obedient Lust could deny nothing.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Numulizinthis Diogiris</hi> the King of <hi>Thrace</hi>'s Daughters Cruelty, though not so much to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd, considering the Barbarity of the Nation, yet the horridness will not let it be pass'd in silence: who held it not unlawful to cut living men in two in the middle, or for Parents to feed upon the bodies of their Children.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Again <hi>Ptolomey Physcon</hi> comes upon the stage; a little before, a most dreadful Example of lastful Madness, now of Cruelty. For what more horrid than this? He caus'd his own Son <hi>Menephites,</hi> whom he had got upon <hi>Cleopatra</hi> his Sister and Wife, a lovely and hopeful Youth, to be kill'd in his presence; and sent the Head, Feet and Hands cut off, and put into
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:60321:211"/>
a Chest, cover'd over with the Child's Garment, as a Birth-day Gift to the Mother. As if altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the mischief he had done, and never the more unfortunate, for having render'd <hi>Cleopatra</hi> miserable in the loss of Children common to both, and himself odious to all. With so blinde a fury doth the height of Cruelty rage, when she thinks to strengthen her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by her own acts! For when he understood how he was hated by his people, he sought a remedy for his fear in wickedness; and that he might raign more safely when the people were murder'd, he surrounded the <hi>Gymnasium,</hi> full of young people, with fire and sword, and slew, partly by the flame, and partly by sword, every individual person of the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But <hi>Ochus,</hi> who was afterwards call'd <hi>Darius,</hi> bound to the <hi>Persians</hi> by a most bloody Oath, that he should not put to Death either by Sword, Poyson, Starving, or any other manner of violente, any of those that had conspir'd with him against the Seven <hi>Magi,</hi> found out a way of Death, by which means he might rid himself of those persons that were burthensome to him, and yet save his Oath. For he fill'd a place, made up with high walls, full of Ashes, and putting a leaning rafter underneath, he placed them in it, after he had highly feasted them; so that when sleep should seize them, they might fall into that insidiary heap.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. More open, but more horrid, was the Cruelty of <hi>Ochus Artaxerxes,</hi> who buried his Sister and Mother-in-Law <hi>Ocha</hi> alive: and stab'd his Uncle to Death with Darts, after he had deprived him of an hundred Sons and Nephews; for not the least injury done him, but because they had the highest applause among the <hi>Persians</hi> for Probi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="8">8. Guided by the same wicked Suspition, the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:60321:212"/>
of <hi>Athens,</hi> by a Decree unworthy their Honour, cut off the Thumbs of the <hi>Aeginensian</hi> Youth; that a People potent in Shipping, might not be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with them at Sea. I cannot pardon the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> borrowing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="9">9. Cruel also was that Inventor of the Brazen Bull, wherein when poor Creatures were lock'd, and fire put under it, they seem'd in the midst of their long and tedious torments to low like the beast, that their lamentations and howlings express'd in Humane Sounds, might not reach the ears of <hi>Phalaris</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to move his compassion. Which because he would be wanting to the miserable, the first Authour deservedly experimented the torment of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Nor were the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> a little cruel in the Invention of Punishment, who tying the bodies of the living back to back, and face to face together, so that part might answer part, suffer'd them to lye till they were putrified to Death. Most bitter Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters of Life and Death at once.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Like those Barbarians, who are reported to set men in heaps of the Bowels and Entrails of kill'd beasts, and there to feed and keep them alive, till being putrified within, they might be eaten up by the Vermine that breed in putrified bodies. Can we complain of Nature, for having made us lyable to many and dire inconveniencies of Sickness; or take it ill, that Celestial Strength should be denied to humane condition, when Mortality hath invented so many Torments to ruine it self, by the impulse of Cruelty?</p>

                  <p>ANger and Hatred stir up great Commotions in the breasts of Men. This swifter in its motion, the other more obstinate in the desire of Mischief. Both affections full of Consternation, and never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the violent torment of themselves: For it suffers pain to inflict mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. When <hi>Livius Salicator,</hi> waging war with <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal,</hi> was about to leave the City, being admonish'd by <hi>Fabius Maximum</hi> that he should not fight before he understood the courage and force of the Enemy, made answer, that <hi>He would not refuse the first opportunity of fighting:</hi> And being ask'd by the same person, why he would needs be so hasty; <hi>That assoon as may be,</hi> said he, <hi>I may either win honour by the overthrow of the
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:60321:213"/>
Enemy, or rejoyce in the ruine of my Fellow-Citizens.</hi> Anger and Vertue divided his speech between them. The one remembring an unjust rebuke, the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon the honour of Triumph. But I cannot tell whether it were the same thing to say this, and to overcome in the same manner.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thus far Passion carried a man of a fierce Soul and accustom'd to War. But <hi>C. Figulus</hi> a most milde man, famous for his learning in the Civil Law, was thereby render'd forgetful both of Prudence and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. For being provok'd by being repuls'd from the Consulship, so much the rather, because it had been twice given his Father; when many came to him the next day for counsel, turn 'em all out a doors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Are ye ready at asking Counsel,</hi> said he, <hi>and know not how to make a Consul?</hi> Smartly and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly spoken: Yet it had been better not spoken. For what wise men could be angry with the People of <hi>Rome?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor are they to be approved, though protected by the splendour of their Nobility, who being often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded because that <hi>Cn. Flavius,</hi> a man of mean extract, was made Praetor, took off their Gold Rings and Trappings from their Horses, and threw them away; shewing the impotency, not the strife of vexation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. These were the motions of Anger in single or but few persons against a Commonwealth: There are also the same in the Multitude against the Princes and Captains. <hi>Manlius Torquatus</hi> returning after a most r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His equals compassionated his too severe punishment. Nor do I defend the Act, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew the force of Anger, that could divide the

Ages and Affections of a whole City.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So much could it prevail, that it detain'd and kept back all the foot of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, sent by <hi>Fabius</hi> the Consul to pursue the Enemy, when they might easily have ruin'd and cut them off, when they call'd to minde tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he had put a stop to the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law. The same passion rendring the Army offended with <hi>Appius</hi> their Captain useless, (whose Father standing for the Nobility,, oppos'd the conveniences of the Commonalty) by a voluntarily flight they turn'd their back to the Enemy, because they would not suffer their Captain to triumph. How often the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisher of Victory? despising its congratulation in <hi>Torquatus</hi>; in <hi>Fabius,</hi> omitting the greatest part; in <hi>Appius,</hi> preferring shameful flight besore it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. How violently it carried it self in the breast of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, at that time when the Dedication of the Temple of <hi>Mercury</hi> was granted to <hi>M. Plaeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> a Centurion, by their Suffrages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Consuls being also terrified; <hi>Claudius,</hi> because he withstood the relief of his Debts; and <hi>Servilius,</hi> because he had but weakly defended their cause which he undertook. Can Anger be denied to be of force, when it sets the Souldier above the General?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It hath not only pull'd down Authority, but commanded as disorderly. For when <hi>Q. Metellus,</hi> first as Consul, then for the Consul, had subdued almost all <hi>Spain,</hi> and understood that <hi>Pompey</hi> the Consul, his enemy, would be sent to succeed him; he dismissed all that pretended to be acquitted from service; gave licence to the Souldiers to go take their pleasure, heyer setting any time for their coming again. He left the Magazines upon the Borders free to the plunder of the Enemy: He ordered the <hi>Cretans</hi> Bows and Arrows to be broken and thrown into the River: He sorbid any Victuals to be given to the Elephants. By which acts
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:60321:214"/>
as he gratified his Passion, so he sufficiently sullied the glory of his great Deeds: and lost the honour he had won, being a greater Vanquisher of the Enemy, than of his own Passion.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. What became of <hi>Sylla,</hi> too obedient to this Vice! After he had shed the blood of others, did he not shed his own? For burning with indignation at <hi>Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">1. The Sedition of Citizens is to be detested; but if we look into the Camp, an equal indignation will arise. When the Province of <hi>Asia</hi> was, by the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pician</hi>

Law, decreed to <hi>C. Marius</hi> a private person, to prosecute the War against <hi>Mithridates,</hi> the Souldiers slew <hi>Gratidius,</hi> sent by him to <hi>L. Sulla</hi> the Consul, to receive the Legions from him. Offended, without doubt, that they were to be commanded by a person of no Honour, that had served under a person of the highest Dignity.

                     <p n="2">2. That in the behalf of a Consul so violently acted; this against a Consul. For when <hi>Q. Pompey</hi> Collegue of <hi>Sylla</hi> ventured to contend with <hi>Cn. Pompey,</hi> being sent to the Army by the command of the Senate, the Souldiers corrupted by the delusions of an ambitious Captain, fell upon him, as he was beginning to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and slew him, as if he himself had been the Victime. And the Court, forced to give way to the Camp, durst not revenge so great a Crime.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Army also was wickedly violent who kill'd <hi>C.

                  <p>SUddain also and vehement are the Instigation of Rashness; by the stroaks whereof the minds of men are disorder'd, not being able to foresee their own dangers, nor prosecute the facts of others with a due consideration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For how rashly did the Greater <hi>Africanus</hi> cross the <hi>Sea</hi> out of <hi>Spain,</hi> with two Gallies of five Oars. to <hi>Syphax</hi> the King, trusting his own and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries safety in the faithless breast of one <hi>Numidian!</hi> So that in one moment it was a doubtful question, whether <hi>Scipio</hi> should be the Captive or the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Syphax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The doubtful attempt also of <hi>C. Caesar</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the Heavens. For impatient of the Legions crossing from <hi>Brundusium</hi> to <hi>Apollonia,</hi> leaving the Banquet, out of a pretence of being sick, he went aboard a small Ship, and in a most rigorous Tempest steers out of the River into the very mouth of the <hi>Adriatic</hi> Sea; and commanding the Ship to keep her course, long tossed by contrary Waves, at length he was forced to return.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now what a most execrable Rashness was that of the Souldiers? For they were the cause that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus,</hi> a person famous for his Nobility, Conditions,

                     <p n="1">1. Therefore I wonder the less, that the severe and cruel <hi>Hannibal</hi> would not admit the guiltless Pilot to make his defence; who returning out of <hi>Italy</hi> from <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>ERrour is next to Rashness: as equally prejudicial, so to them also it least knows: because it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits mistakes not willingly, but out of false imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: which being far spread in the breast of men, if I should omit it, I should be guilty of the Errour which I blame. Therefore let us recite a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>C. Helvius Cinna,</hi> Tribune of the People, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home from <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Funeral, was torn by the hands of the People, mistaken for <hi>Cornelius Cinna,</hi> upon whom they thought to have sent their rage; provoked against him, because that being <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Kinsman, he had made an abusive Oration against him that was impiously slain. And so far irritated they were by the same Errour, that they carried the Head of <hi>Helvius,</hi> as if it had been the Head of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> fix'd upon a Pole, about the Funeral-pile of <hi>Caesar.</hi> A cruel expiation of Duty and Mistake.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For Errour caused <hi>C. Cassius</hi> to punish himself. For in the midst of that various and unknown event to the Captains themselves, of the fight of four Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at <hi>Philippi; Titinius</hi> the Centurion being sent by him in the Night to see in what condition <hi>Brutus</hi> was, while he fetch'd several compasses about, because the darkness of the Night did not suffer him to know
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:60321:221"/>
whether he met Foes of Friends, it was long before he return'd. <hi>Cassius</hi> therefore believing him to have been taken by the Enemy, and that they were abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Masters of the field, hasten'd to end his life, when <hi>Brutus</hi>'s forces were in part safe, and Masters of the Enemies Camp. But the Courage of <hi>Titinius</hi> is not to be forgot, who stood a while astonish'd at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected sight of his Captain wallowing in his own blood, then bursting into tears; <hi>Though impruden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. But certainly Mistake did a great injury to the family of <hi>Lartis Talumnius</hi> King of the <hi>Veie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe Stings of Revenge as they are sharp, so they are just, while they meditate to repay received Injuries. Of which a few Examples will serve.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>M. Flavius,</hi> Tribune of the People, reported to the People against the <hi>Tusculans,</hi> that by their advice the <hi>Privernates</hi> and <hi>Veliterni</hi> would rebel.

                     </gap> manner, with their Wives and Children, it hapned that all the rest of the Tribes being Mercy, the <hi>Polian</hi> Tribe alone gave judgment that they should be first whipp'd, and then put to death; and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Women and Children to be sold for Slaves. For which reason the <hi>Papyrian</hi> Tribe, in which the <hi>Tuscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans</hi> being received into the City, had a strong Vote, never made afterwards any Candidate of the <hi>Polian</hi> Tribe a Magistrate; that no Honour might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. But this Revenge both the Senate and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all men approved. For when <hi>Adrianus</hi> had

                     </gap>t alive; the matter was never question'd in the City, nor any complaint made against it.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>FORREIGNERS.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. Famous Examples of Revenge were both Queens: <hi>Thamyris,</hi> who having caused the Head of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to be cut off, commanded it to be thrown into a Tub of humane Blood; upbraiding him with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable thirst after Blood, and revenging upon him the Death of her Son, who wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> slain by him. And <hi>Berenice,</hi> who taking heavily the loss of her Son, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped by the snares of <hi>Laodice,</hi> got arm'd into her Chariot, and following the King Life-guard-man that had done the Mischief, after she had miss'd him with her Spear, she <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>'d him with a Stone; and driving her Horses over his Body, rid directly through the bands of the adverse party to the house where she thought the body of the slain Child lay.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is a hard thing to judge whether a just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge or not were the ruine of <hi>Iason</hi> of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> preparing to make war against the King of <hi>Persia.</hi> For he gave leave to <hi>Taxillus</hi> the Master of his Games, complaining that he had been abused by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain young men, that he should either require thirty Drachma's from them, or to give them ten Stripes. Which last revenge when he used, they that were lash'd, kill'd <hi>Iason,</hi> valuing the measure of the punishment by the pain of the Minde, and not of the Body. Thus by a small provocation of ingenious Shame, a great Undertaking was subverted. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that in the opinion of <hi>Greece,</hi> there was as much expected from <hi>Iason,</hi> as from <hi>Alexander.</hi>

Who, when her Charioteer, as she was riding in her Chariot, stopp'd his Horses; upon her enquiry finding that the dead body of her Father, <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> lay in the way, caus'd the Charioteer to drive over it; that she might hasten to the embraces of <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> who had slain him.
