            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Exceeding true Newes from <hi>HULL</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is a horrible thing for us that are Subjects to the King of <hi>England,</hi> we that have lived so many yeares under a peaceable government, and enjoyed the fruits of our Vinyard, yea all the blessings that could be heaped upon a Nation, to make it happy, that now after these Halcion daies, a storme threating so much danger should eclipse the Sunne and usher on destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what greater terrour can there be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined to fall upon a Kingdome (so great) as Civill Warres, the King against his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Sonne against his Father, when blood, revenge, and slaughter will tryumph
<pb facs="tcp:112733:3"/>
and revell in our Cities, our Wives and Children ravished and destroyed before our faces, we our selves spectators of such horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unhumane Tragedies, being in no waves able to helpe or defend them; these are the effects of Civill discords, and have we not just cause to feare that such will be the event of these Distractions, for these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents betweene the King and Parliament, vomited by the malignant party hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wrought a sad effect.</p>
            <p>For His Majesty hath declared his irefull Resolution, conceiving all those that have opposed him, and that shall oppose him, by whose hand or by whose directions soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was done in both cases, by the helpe of God, for he will have justice, or else loose his owne life in the requiring of it.</p>
            <p>Likewise his Maiesty declares, that if it be possible for his Subjects to beleeve that such a defence of himselfe with the utmost power he can make, <hi>Be raising Warre against the Parliament,</hi> he doubts not (howsoever it shall please God to deale with him in this
<pb facs="tcp:112733:3"/>
contention) but that the justice of his cause will at last prevaile against all those that have for their owne ends corrupted the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the people.</p>
            <p>Likewise it is apparent that his Majesty intends to put this his resolution in speedy execution, For the King is gone to <hi>Hull,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the Prince, with about 400 horsemen and 700 footmen musketieres, but the Inhabitants of <hi>Hull</hi> having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of their intended purpose, forthwith raised 1000 men well armed to stand upon their guard, to prevent ensuing dangers; there is two Ships lately come from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> being in one, and the Earle of <hi>Danbie</hi> in another, and many other Lords besides, and they came both to the mouth of <hi>Humber,</hi> but there arose a great wind, insomuch that they were forthwith driven from the shore, and disperst at Sea from each other, but one of them comming up very boldly towards <hi>Hull,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> made shot at them, and beate them to
<pb facs="tcp:112733:4"/>
other side of <hi>Humber,</hi> whereas yet they lye and have drawne certaine of the chiefest of their Ordnance a shore, and have raised cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Batteries, and mounted their Ordnance thereon, against Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> and all the Souldiers aforementioned, accompanied with the Prince, are gone to aid and assist him against the Towne, and they have brought with them great store of Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beside 300 thousand pounds of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, so that the King, and the Prince, is gone to meet them with a strong Guard of Souldiers for his owne defence.</p>
            <p>Upon Thursday last, beeing the 7. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the King summoned all the Gentry and Commonalty of <hi>Yorkeshire,</hi> that are Protestants to attend his Commands, where there was assembled great multitudes of Protestants, and many others that are favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Malignant Party, and many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Papists which were there (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Maiesties command to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) from which we may inferre, that they that doe presume to meet in a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb facs="tcp:112733:4"/>
manner, contrary to his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties command, while Warre is but in agitation. will be much boulder, and contest with that command, were War put in execution.</p>
            <p>Likewise the Cavalieres commit outrages of all sorts, dreading nothing, neither Law, nor Authority, being countenanced by some great men that are too neare the King in power, and Authority, so that we are not certaine to enjoy any thing but by their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nay they are so confident, that they will not sticke to sweare, that they will teach us new obedience, and many other reproachfull and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous words.</p>
            <p>Likewise in the neare adjoyning Counties, as <hi>Leicestershire, Lancashire.</hi> and other parties, the Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hastings,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Aston,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others Commissioners of <hi>Array,</hi> have made great disturbances in those parts to the terrour of the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:112733:5"/>Also it is feared that the Lord <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie</hi> is secretly landed and both endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to raise men in <hi>Dorsetshire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These disturbances the Parliament having seriously considered of and found the great detriment that these evill affected persons may doe to the Subjects under their authority of the Commission of <hi>Array,</hi> they have thought good to declare, that the Commission of <hi>Array</hi> is against Law, and that all those that are Actors in putting the Commission of <hi>Array</hi> in execution, shall be esteemed disturbers of the Peace of the Kingdome, and destroyers of the the Liberties of the Subject.</p>
