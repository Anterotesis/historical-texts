         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, that <hi>Magus</hi> is a name ſometime of him that is a god by nature, &amp; ſomtimes of him that is in the ſervice of God: in which latter ſence it is taken in <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 1, 2. when the wiſe men came to worſhip Jeſus, and this is the firſt and higheſt kinde, which is called divine Magick; and theſe the Latines did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title <hi>ſapientes,</hi> or wiſe men: for the feare and worſhip of God, is the beginning of knowledge. Theſe wiſe-men the Greeks call <hi>Philoſophers;</hi> and amongſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians they were termed <hi>Prieſts:</hi> the Hebrews term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them <hi>Cabaliſtos,</hi> Prophets, Scribes and Phariſees; and amongſt the Babylonians they were differenced by the name of <hi>Caldeans;</hi> &amp; by the Perſians they were called <hi>Magicians:</hi> and one ſpeaking of <hi>Soſthenes,</hi> one of the ancient Magicians, uſeth theſe words: <hi>Et verum Deum merita majeſtate proſequltur, &amp; angelos miniſtros Dei, ſed veri ejus venerationi novit aſsiſtore; idem daemonas prodit terrenos, Vagos; humanitatis inimices; Soſthenes</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth the due Majeſty to the true God, &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that his Angels are miniſters and meſſengers which attend the worſhip of the true God; he alſo hath delivered, that there are devils earthly and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, and enemies to mankind.</p>
            <p>So that the word <hi>Magus</hi> of it ſelf imports a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templator of divine &amp; heavenly Sciences; but under the name of <hi>Magick,</hi> are all unlawful Arts compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; as Necromancy and Witchcraft, and ſuch Arts which are effected by combination with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and whereof he is a party.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55919:3"/>
Theſe Witches and Necromancers are alſo called <hi>Malefici</hi> or <hi>venefici</hi> ſorcerers or poiſoners; of which name witches are rightly called, who without the Art of Magicke do indeed uſe the helpe of the devill himſelfe to do miſchiefe; practiſing to mix the powder of dead bodies with other things by the help of the devill prepared; and at other times to make pictures of wax, clay; or otherwiſe (as it were <hi>ſacr amentaliter)</hi> to effect thoſe things which the devil by other means bringeth to paſs. Such were, and to this day partly, if not altogether, are the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which have made odious the very name of Magick, having chiefly ſought, as the maner of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures is, to counterfeit the higheſt and moſt noble part of it.</p>
            <p>A ſecond kind of Magick is Aſtrologie, which judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the events of things to come, natural and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane by the motions and influences of the ſtars upon theſe lower elements, by them obſerv'd &amp; underſtood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> affirmeth, that by this part of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick or Aſtrologie, together with the motions of the Stars and other heavenly bodies, <hi>Abraham</hi> found out the knowledge of the true God while he lived in <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, Qui Contemplatione Creatur arum, cognovit Creatorem</hi> (ſaith <hi>Damaſcen)</hi> who knew the Creator by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the creature. <hi>Joſephus</hi> reporteth of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he inſtructed the Egyptians in Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick and Aſtronomy; who before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them, knew none of theſe Sciences.</p>
            <p>

<pb facs="tcp:55919:4"/>
then the Phoenicians, laſtly the Egyptian Prieſts, Aſtrologie and Divine knowledge.</p>
            <p>Without doubt, <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus,</hi> that divine Magician and Philoſopher, who (as ſome ſay) lived long before <hi>Noah,</hi> attained to much Divine knowledg of the Creator through the ſtudie of Magick and Aſtrologie; as his Writings, to this day extant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, teſtifie.</p>
            <p>The third kinde of Magick containeth the whole Philoſophy of Nature; which bringeth to light the inmoſt vertues, and extracteth them out of Natures hidden boſome to humane uſe: <hi>Virtutes in centre centri latentes;</hi> Vertues hidden in the centre of the Centre, according to the Chymiſts: of this ſort were <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Arnoldus de villa nova, Raymond, Bacon,</hi> and others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Magick theſe men profeſs'd, is thus defined. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia eſt connexio a viro ſapiente agentium per natur am cum patientibus, ſibi, congruenter reſpondentibus, ut inde opera prodeant, non ſine corum admiratione qui cauſam ignorant.</hi> Magick is the connexion of natural agents and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, anſwerable each to other, wrought by a wiſe man, to the bringing forth of ſuch effects as are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to thoſe that know not their cauſes.</p>
            <p>In all theſe, <hi>Zoroaster</hi> was well learned, eſpecially in the firſt and the higheſt: for in his Oracles he confeſſeth God to be the firſt and the higheſt; he believeth of the Trinity, which he would not inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigate by any natural knowledge: he ſpeaketh of Angels, and of Paradiſe; approveth the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſoul; teacheth Truth, Faith, Hope, and Love, diſcourſing of the abſtinence and charity of the <hi>Magi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55919:4"/>
Of this <hi>Zoroaſter, Euſebius</hi> in the Theologie of the Phoenicians, uſing <hi>Zoroaſter</hi>'s own words: <hi>Haec ad verbum ſcribit</hi> (ſaith <hi>Euſebius) Deus primus, incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilium, ſempiternus, ingenitus, expers partium, ſibiipſi ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millimus, bonorum omnium auriga, munera non expectans, optimus, prudentiſsimus, pater juris, ſine doctrina juſt iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am perdoctus, natura perfectus, ſapiens, ſacrae naturae uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus inventor,</hi> &amp;. Thus ſaith <hi>Zoroaſter,</hi> word for word: God the firſt, incorruptible, everlaſting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begotten, without parts, moſt like himſelf, the guide of all good, expecting no reward, the beſt, the wiſeſt, the father of right, having learned juſtice without teaching, perfect, wiſe by nature, the onely inventor thereof.</p>
            <p>So that a Magician is no other but <hi>divinorum cultor &amp; interpres,</hi> a ſtudious obſerver and expounder of divine things; and the Art it ſelf is none other <hi>quam Naturalis Philoſophiae abſoluta conſummatio,</hi> then the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perfection of Natural Philoſophy. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs there is a mixture in all things, of good with evil, of falſhood with truth, of corruption with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The good, the truth, the purity, in every kinde, may well be embraced: As in the ancient worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God by Sacrifice, there was no man knowing God among the Elders, that did for bear to worſhip the God of all power, or condemn that kinde of Worſhip, becauſe the devil was ſo adored in the Image of <hi>Baal, Dagon, Aſtaroth, Chemoſh, Jupiter, Apollo,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>Neither did the abuſe of Aſtrology terrifie <hi>Abraham,</hi> (if we believe the moſt ancient and religious Writers) from obſerving the motions and natures of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies. Neither can it dehort wiſe and learned
<pb facs="tcp:55919:5"/>
men in theſe days from attributing thoſe vertues, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, and inclinations, to the Stars and other Lights of heaven, which God hath given to thoſe his glorious creatures.</p>
            <p>I muſt expect ſome calumnies and obtrectations againſt this, from the malicious prejudiced man, and the lazie affecters of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, of whom this age ſwarms: but the voice and ſound of the Snake and the Gooſe, is all one.

Now we proceed to declare with what Planets theſe Figures are diſtributed; for hereupon all the propriety and nature of Figures and the judgement of the whole Art dependeth: Therefore the greater and leſſer Fortune are aſcribed to the Sun; but the firſt or greater Fortune is when the Sun is diurnall, and poſited in his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; the other, or leſſer Fortune is when the Sun is nocturnall, or placed in leſſe dignities: <hi>Via,</hi> and <hi>Populus</hi> (that is, the Way, and People) are referred to the Moone; the firſt from her begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and encreaſing, the ſecond from her full light and quarter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing; <hi>Acquiſitio,</hi> and <hi>Laetitia</hi> (which is Gaine, Profit; Joy and Gladneſs) are of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> But the firſt hath <hi>Jupiter</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fortune, the ſecond the leſſe, but without detriment: <hi>Puella,</hi> and <hi>Amiſſio</hi> are of <hi>Kenus;</hi> the firſt fortunate, the other (as it were) rettograde, or combuſt: <hi>Conjunctio</hi> and <hi>Albus</hi> are both Figures of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and are both good; but the firſt the more Fortunate: <hi>Puer,</hi> and <hi>Rubius</hi> are Figures aſcribed to <hi>Mars;</hi> the firſt whereof hath <hi>Mars</hi> benevolent, the ſecond malevolent: <hi>Carter,</hi> and <hi>Triſtitia</hi> are both. Figures of <hi>Sataru,</hi> and both evill; but the firſt of the greater detriment: the Dragons head, and Dragons tayle doe follow their owne natures.</p>
            <p>And theſe are the infallible compariſons of the Figures, and from theſe wee may eaſily diſcerne the equality of their ſignes; therefore the greater and leſſer Fortunes have the ſignes of <hi>Leo,</hi> which is the Houſe of the Sun: <hi>Via</hi> and <hi>Populus</hi> have the ſigne of <hi>Cancer,</hi> which is the Houſe of the Moone: <hi>Acquiſitio</hi> hath for his ſigne <hi>Piſces;</hi> and <hi>Laetitia Sagitary,</hi> which are both the Houſes of <hi>Jupiter: Puella</hi> hath the ſigne of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Amiſſio</hi> of <hi>Libra,</hi> which are the Houſes of <hi>Venus: Conjunctio</hi> hath for its ſigne <hi>Virgo,</hi> and <hi>Albus</hi> the ſigne <hi>Gemini,</hi> the Houſes of <hi>Mercury: Puella</hi> and <hi>Rubeus</hi> have for their ſigne <hi>Scorpio,</hi> the Houſe of <hi>Mars: Carcer</hi> hath the ſigne <hi>Capricorne,</hi> and <hi>Triſtitia Aquary,</hi> the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Saturne:</hi> The Dragons head and taile are thus divided, the head to <hi>Capricorne,</hi> and the Dragons taile adhereth to <hi>Scorpio;</hi> and from hence you may eaſily obtaine the triplicities of theſe ſigns after the manner of the triplicities of the ſignes of the Zodiack: <hi>Puer</hi> therefore, both Fortunes, and <hi>Latitia</hi> do govern the fiery tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity; <hi>Puella, Conjunctio, Carcer,</hi> and the Dragons head the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55919:11"/>
earthly triplicity: <hi>Albus, Amitia,</hi> and <hi>Triſtitia,</hi> doe make the Airy triplicity: and <hi>Via, Populus,</hi> and <hi>Rubeus,</hi> with the Dragons taile, and <hi>Acquiſitio</hi> do rule the watry triplicity, and this order is taken according to the courſe or manner of the ſignes.</p>
            <p>But if any one will conſtitute theſe triplicities according to the natures of the Planets, and Figures themſelves, let him obſerve this Rule, that <hi>Fortuna major, Rubeus, Puer,</hi> and <hi>Amiſſio</hi> doe make the fiery triplicity: <hi>Fortuna minor, Puella, Latitia,</hi> and <hi>Conjunctio</hi> triplicity of the Ayre: <hi>Acquiſitio,</hi> the Dragons taile, <hi>Via,</hi> and <hi>Populus</hi> doe governe the watry triplicity; and the earthly tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is ruled by <hi>Carcer, Triſtitia, Albus,</hi> and the Dragons head. And this way is rather to be obſerved then the firſt which we have ſet forth; becauſe it is conſtituted according to the Rule and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the ſignes.</p>
            <p>This order is alſo far more true and rationall then that which vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly is uſed, which is deſcribed after this manner: of the Fiery triplicity are, <hi>Cauda, Fortuna minor, Amiſſio,</hi> and <hi>Rubeus:</hi> of the Airy triplicity are, <hi>Acquiſitio, Laetitia, Puer,</hi> and <hi>Conjunctio:</hi> of the watry triplicity are, <hi>Populus, Via, Albus,</hi> and <hi>Puella:</hi> And <hi>Caput, Fortuna major, Carcer,</hi> and <hi>Triſtitia</hi> are of the earthly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.</p>
            <p>They doe likewiſe diſtribute theſe Figures to the twelve ſignes of the Zodiack, after this manner, <hi>Acquiſitio</hi> is given to <hi>Aries; Fortuna,</hi> both <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> to <hi>Taurus; Latitia</hi> to the ſigne <hi>Gemini; Puella</hi> and <hi>Rubens</hi> to <hi>Cancer; Albus</hi> is aſſigned to <hi>Leo, Via</hi> to <hi>Virgo;</hi> the Dragons head, and <hi>Conjunctio</hi> to <hi>Libra; Puer</hi> is ſubmitted to <hi>Scorpio; Triſtitia</hi> and <hi>Amiſſio</hi> are aſſigned to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitary;</hi> the Dragons taile to <hi>Capricorne; Populus</hi> to <hi>Aquarius;</hi> and <hi>Carcer</hi> is aſſigned the ſigne <hi>Piſces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we come to ſpeake of the manner of projecting or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe theſe Figures, which is thus; that we ſet downe the points according to their courſe in four lines, from the right hand towards the left, and this in foure courſes: There will therefore reſult unto us foure Figures made in foure ſeverall lines, according to the even or uneven marking every ſeverall line; which foure Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures are wont to be called <hi>Matres:</hi> which doe bring forth the reſt, filling up and compleating the whole Figure of Judgement,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55919:12"/>
an example whereof you may ſee heere following.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>Of theſe foure <hi>Matres</hi> are alſo produced foure other ſecondary Figures, which they call <hi>Fili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> or Succedents, which are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together after this manner; that is to ſay, by making the foure <hi>Matres</hi> according to their order, placing them by courſe one after another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; then that which ſhall reſult out of every line, maketh the Figure of <hi>Fili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> the order whereof is by diſcending from the ſuperior points through both <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to the loweſt: as in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <figure>
               <p>Matres.</p>
               <p>Filiae produced.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55919:12"/>
And theſe 8 Figures do make 8 Houſes of Heaven, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by placing the Figures from the left hand towards the right: as the foure <hi>Matres</hi> do make the foure firſt Houſes, ſo the foure <hi>Filia</hi> doe make the foure following Houſes, which are the fift, ſixt, ſeaventh, and eighth: and the reſt of the Houſes are found af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner; that is to ſay, out of the firſt and ſecond is derived the ninth; out of the third and fourth the tenth; out of the fifth and ſixth the eleventh; and out of the ſeventh and eighth the twelfth: By the combination or joyning together of two Figures according to the rule of the even or uneven number in the remaining points of each Figure. After the ſame manner there are produced out of the laſt foure Figures; that is to ſay, of the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth, two Figures which they call <hi>Coadjutrices,</hi> or <hi>Teſtes;</hi> out of which two is alſo one conſtituted, which is called the Index of the whole Figure, or thing Queſited: as appeareth in this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple following.</p>
            <figure>
               <head>A Theme of Geomancy.</head>
               <p>Filiae.</p>
               <p>Matres.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55919:13"/>
And this which we have declared is the common manner obſerved by Geomancers, which we do not altogether reject neither extoll; therefore this is alſo to be conſidered in our judgements: Now therefore I ſhall give unto you the true Figure of Geomancy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the right conſtitution of Aſtrologicall reaſon, which is thus.</p>
            <p>As the former <hi>Matres</hi> doe make the foure Angles of an Houſe, the firſt maketh the firſt Angle, the ſecond the ſecond Angle, the third maketh the third Angle, and the fourth the fourth Angle; ſo the foure <hi>Filiae</hi> ariſing from the <hi>Matres,</hi> doe conſtitute the foure ſuccedent Houſes; the firſt maketh the ſecond Houſe, the ſecond the eleventh, the third the eighth, and the fourth maketh the firſt Houſe: the reſt of the Houſes, which are Cadents are to be calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated according to the Rule of their triplicity; that is to ſay, by making the ninth out of the fourth and fifth, and the ſixth out of the tenth and ſecond, of the ſeventh, and eleventh the third, and of the fourth and eighth the twelfth.</p>
            <p>And now you have the whole Figure of true judgement conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted according to true and efficatious reaſons, whereby I ſhal ſhew how you ſhall compleat it: the Figure which ſhall bee in the firſt Houſe ſhall give you the ſigne aſcending, which the firſt Figure ſheweth; which being done, you ſhall attribute their ſignes to the reſt of their Houſes, according to the order of the ſignes: then in every Houſe you ſhall note the Planets according to the nature of the Figure: then from all theſe you ſhall build your judgement ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſignification of the Planets in the ſignes and Houſes wherein they ſhall be found, and according to their aſpects among themſelves, and to the place of the querent and thing queſited; and you ſhall judge according to the natures of the ſignes aſcending in their Houſes, and according to the natures and proprieties of the Figures which they have placed in the ſeverall Houſes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the commiſture of other Figures aſpecting them: The Index of the Figure which the Geomancers for the moſt part have made, how it is found in the former Figure.</p>
            <p>But here we ſhal give you the ſecret of the whole Art, to find out the Index in the ſubſequent Figure, which is thus: that you num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all the points which are contained in the lines of the projections,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55919:13"/>
and this you ſhall divide by twelve: and that which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth project from the Aſcendent by the ſeveral Houſes, and upon which Houſe there falleth a final unity, that Figure giveth you a competent Judgement of the thing queſited; and this together with the ſignifications of the Judgements aforeſaid. But if on either part they ſhall be equal, or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, then the Index alone ſhall certifie you of the thing queſited. The Example of this Figure is here placed.</p>
            <figure>
               <p>There remains out of the diviſion of the projections 6 points; wherefore <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the 6 Houſe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Index.</p>
            </figure>
            <p>It remaineth now, that we declare, of what thing and to what Houſe a Queſtion doth appertain. Then, what every Figure doth ſhew or ſignifie concerning all Queſtions in every Houſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore we ſhall handle the ſignifications of the Houſes; which are theſe.</p>

The fifth Houſe giveth judgement of Legats, Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, Rumours, News; of Honour, and of accidents after death: and of Queſtions that may be propounded concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning women with childe, or creatures pregnant.

In the eleventh Houſe, he maketh many friends; but ſuch as are poor and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and not able to relieve thy neceſſities: it ingratiates you with Princes, and giveth great hopes, but ſmall gains; neither long to continue in any benefice or offices beſtowed by a Prince.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N our Books of Occult Philoſophy, we have not ſo compendiouſly, as copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, declared the principles, grounds, and reaſons of Magick it ſelf, and after what maner the experiments thereof are to be choſen, elected, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, to produce many wonderful effects; but becauſe in thoſe books they are treated of, rather Theorically, then Practically; and ſome alſo are not handled compleatly and fully, and others very figuratively, and as it were Enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically and obſcure Riddles, as being thoſe which we have attained unto with great ſtudy, diligence, and very curious ſearching and exploration, and are heretofore ſet forth in a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55919:25"/>
more rude and unfaſhioned maner. Therefore in this book, which we have compoſed and made as it were a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Key of our other books of Occult Philoſophy, and of all Magical Operations, we will give unto thee the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments of holy and undefiled verity, and Inexpugnable and Unreſiſtable Magical Diſcipline, and the moſt pleaſant and delectable experiments of the ſacred Deities. So that as by the reading of our other books of Occult Philoſophy, thou maiſt earneſtly covet the knowledge of theſe things; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo with reading this book, thou ſhalt truely triumph. Wherefore let ſilence hide theſe things within the ſecret cloſets of thy religious breaſt, and conceal them with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Taciturnity.</p>
            <p>This therefore is to be known, That the names of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent preſidents of every one of the Planets are conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after this maner: that is to ſay, By collecting together the letters out of the figure of the world, from the riſing of the body of the Planet, according to the ſucceſſion of the Signes through the ſeveral degrees; and out of the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, from the aſpects of the Planet himſelf, the calculation being made from the degree of the aſcendant. In the like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are conſtituted the names of the Princes of the evil ſpirits; they are taken under all the Planets of the preſidents in a retrograde order, the projection being made contrary to the ſucceſſion of the ſignes, from the beginning of these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>th Houſe. Now the name of the ſupreme &amp; higheſt intelligence; which many do ſuppoſe to be the ſoul of the world; is collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the four Cardinal points of the figure of the world, after the maner already delivered: &amp; by the oppoſite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way, is known the name of the great <hi>Daemon,</hi> or evil ſpirit, upon the four cadent Angles. In the like maner ſhalt thou underſtand the names of the great preſident in ſpirits ruling in the Air, from the four Angles of the ſuccedant Houſes: ſo that as to obtain the names of the good ſpirits, the calculation is to be made according to the ſuccession of the signes, beginning from the degree of the aſcendant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and to attain to the names of the evil ſpirits, by working the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55919:26"/>
contrary way.</p>
            <p>You muſt alſo obſerve, that the names of the evil ſpirits are extracted, aſwel from the names of the good ſpirits, as of the evil: ſo notwithſtanding, that if we enter the table with the name of a good ſpirit of the ſecond order, the name of the evil ſpirit ſhall be extracted from the order of the Princes and Governours; but if we enter the table with the name of a good ſpirit of the third order, or with the name of an evil ſpirit a Governour, after what maner ſoever they are extracted, whether by this table, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, the names which do proceed from hence, ſhall be the names of the evil ſpirits, the Miniſters of the inferiour order.</p>
            <p>It is further to be noted, That as often as we enter this table with the good ſpirits of the ſecond order, the names extracted are of the ſecond order: and if under them we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the name of an evil ſpirit, he is of the ſuperiour order of the Governours. The ſame order is, if we enter with the name of an evil ſpirit of the ſuperiour order. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we enter this table with the names of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

            <p>But many Magicians, men of no ſmall Authority, will have the tables of this kinde to be extended with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> letters: ſo that by the ſame tables alſo, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the name of any office or effect, might be found out the name of any ſpirit, aſwel good as evil, by the ſame maner which is above delivered, by taking the name of the office or of the effect, in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne of letters, in their own line, under their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. And of this practice <hi>Triſmegistus</hi> is a great Author, who delivered this kinde of calculation in Egyptian letters: not unproperly alſo may they be referred to other letters of other tongues, for the reaſons aſſigned to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ignes; for truly he only in extant of all men, who have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:55919:26"/>
Therefore the force, ſecrecy and power, in what maner the ſacred names of ſpirits are truly and tightly found out, conſiſteth in the diſpoſing of vowels, which do make the name of a ſpirit, and wherewith is conſtituted the true name, and right word. Now this art is thus perfected and brought to paſs: firſt, we are to take heed of the placing the vowels of the letters, which are found by the calculation of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial figure, to finde the names of the ſpirits of the ſecond order, Preſidents and Governours. And this in the good ſpirits, is thus brought to effect, by conſidering the ſtars which do conſtitute and make the letters, and by placing them according to their order: firſt, let the degree of the eleventh Houſe be ſubſtracted from the degree of that ſtar which is firſt in order; and that which remianeth thereof, let it be projected from the degree of the aſcendent, and where that number endeth, there is part of the vowel of the firſt letter: begin therefore to calculate the vowels of their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, according to their number and order; and the vowel which falleth in the place of the ſtar, which is the firſt in order, the ſame vowel is attributed to the firſt letter. Then afterwards thou ſhalt finde the part of the ſecond letter, by ſubſtracting the degree of a ſtar which is the ſecond in order from the firſt ſtar; and that which remaineth, caſt from the aſcendant. And this is the part from which thou ſhalt begin the calculation of the vowels; and that vowel which falleth upon the ſecond ſtar, the ſame is the vowel of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond letter. And ſo conſequently maiſt thou ſearch out the vowels of the following letters alwaies, by ſubſtracting the degree of the following ſtar, from the degree of the ſtar next preceding and going before. And ſo alſo all calculations and numerations in the names of the good ſpirits, ought to be made according to the ſucceſſion of the ſignes. And in calculating the names of the evil ſpirits, where in the names of the good ſpirits is taken the degree of the eleventh Houſe, in theſe ought to be taken the degree of the twelfth Houſe. And all numerations and calculations may be made with the ſucceſſion of the ſignes, by taking the beginning from the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55919:27"/>
degree of the tenth Houſe.</p>
            <p>But in all extractions by tables, the vowels are placed after another maner. In the firſt place therefore is taken the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of letters making the name it ſelf, and is thus numbred from the beginning of the columne of the firſt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or whereupon the name is extracted; and the letter on whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h this number falleth, is referred to the firſt letter of the name, extracted by taking the diſtance of the one from the other, according to the order of the Alphabet. But the number of that diſtance is projected from the beginning of his columne; and where it endeth, there is part of the firſt vowel; from thence therefore thou ſhalt calculate the vowels themſelves, in their own number and order, in the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne; and the vowel which ſhall fall upon the firſt letter of a name, the ſame ſhall be attributed to that name. Now thou ſhalt finde the following vowels, by taking the diſtance from the precedent vowel to the following: and ſo conſequently according to the ſucceſſion of the Alphabet. And the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that diſtance is to be numbered from the beginning of his own columne; and where he ſhall ceaſe, there is the part of the vowel ſought after. From thence therefore muſt you calculate the vowels, as we have aboveſaid; and thoſe vowels which ſhall fall upon their own letters, are to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto them: if therefore any vowel ſhall happen to fall upon a vowel, the former muſt give place to the latter: and this you are to underſtand only of the good ſpirits. In the evil alſo you may proceed in the ſame way; except only, that you make the numerations after a contrary and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward order, contrary to the ſucceſſion of the Alphabet, and contrary to the order of the columnes (that is to ſay) in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending.</p>
            <p>The name of good Angels, and of every man, which we have taught how to finde out, in our third book of Occult Philoſophy, according to that maner, is of no little Authority, nor of a mean foundation. But now we will give unto thee ſome other ways, illuſtrated with no vain reaſons. One where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, by taking in the figure of the nativity, the five places
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55919:27"/>
of Hylech: which being noted, the characters of the letters are projected in their order and number from the beginning of <hi>Aries;</hi> and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe letters which fall upon the degrees of the ſaid places, according to their order and dignity diſpoſed and aſpected, do make the name of an Angel. There is alſo another way, wherein they do take Almutel, which is the ruling and governing ſtars over the aforeſaid five places; and the projection is to be made from the degree of the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; which is done by gathering together the letters falling upon Almutel: which being placed in order, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their dignity, do make the name of an Angel. There is furthermore another way uſed, and very much had in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from the Egyptians, by making their calculation from the degree of the aſcendant, and by gathering together the letters according to the Almutel of the eleventh Houſe; which Houſe they call a good <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>on:</hi> which being placed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their dignities, the names of the Angels are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted. Now the names of the evil Angels are known after the like maner, except only that the projections muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed contrary to the courſe and order of the ſucceſſion of the ſignes, ſo that whereas in ſeeking the names of good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, we are to calculate from the beginning of <hi>Aries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, in attaining the names of the evil, we ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from the beginning of <hi>Libra.</hi> And whereas in the good ſpirits we number from the degree of the aſcendant; contrarily, in the evil, we muſt calculate from the degree of the ſeventh Houſe. But according to the Egyptians, the name of an Angel is collected according to the Almutel of the twelfth Houſe, which they call an evil ſpirit. Now all thoſe rites, which are elſewhere already by us dilivered in our third book of Occult Philoſophy, may be made by the characters of any language. In all which (as we have aboveſaid) there is a myſtical and divine number, order and figure; from whence it cometh to paſs, that the ſame ſpirit may be called by divers names. But others are diſcovered from the name of the ſpirit himſelf, of the good or evil, by tables formed to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:55919:28"/>
Now theſe celeſtial characters do consiſt of lines and heads: the heads are ſix, according to the ſix magnitudes of the ſtars, whereunto the planets alſo are reduced. The firſt magnitude holdeth a Star, with the Sun, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a Croſs. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond with Jupiter a circular point. The third holdeth with Saturn, a ſemicircle, a triangle, either crooked, round, or acute. The fourth with Mars, a little ſtroke penetrating the line, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſquare, ſtraight, or oblique. The fifth with Venus and Mercury, a little ſtroke or point with a tail, aſcending or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending. The ſixth with the Moon, a point made black. All which you may ſee in the enſuing table. The heads then being poſited according to the ſite of the Stars in the figure of Heaven, then the lines are to be drawn out, according to the congruency or agreement of their natures. And this you are to underſtand of the fixed Stars. But in the erecting of the Planets, the lines are drawn out, the heads being poſited according to their courſe and nature amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>When therefore a character is to be found of any celeſtial
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55919:28"/>
Image aſcending in any degree or face of a ſigne, which do conſiſt of Stars of the ſame magnitude and nature; then the number of theſe Stars being poſited according to their place and order, the ſines are drawn after the ſimilitude of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ſignified, as copiouſly as the ſame can be done.</p>
            <p>But the Characters which are extracted according to the name of a ſpirit, are compoſed by the table following, by giving to every letter that name which agreeth unto him, out of the table; which although it may appear eaſie to thoſe that apprehend it, yet there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> herein no ſmall difficulty; To wit, when the letter of a name falleth upon the line of letters or figures, that we may know which figure or which letter is to be taken. And this may be thus known: for if a letter falleth upon the line of letters, conſider of what number this letter may be in the order of the name; as the ſecond, or the third; then how many letters that name containeth; as five or ſeven; and multiply theſe numbers one after another by themſelves, and treble the product: then caſt the whole (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added together) from the beginning of the letters, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſucceſſion of the Alphabet: and the letter upon which that number ſhall happen to fall, ought to be placed for the character of that ſpirit. But if any letter of a name fall on the line of figures, it is thus to be wrought. Take the number how many this letter is in the order of the name, and let it be multiplied by that number of which this letter is in the order of the Alphabet; and being added to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, divide it by nine, and the remainder ſheweth the figure or number to be placed in the character: and this may be put either in a Geometrical or Arithmetical figure of number; which notwithſtanding ought no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the Characters which are underſtood by the revelation of Spirits, take their vertue from thence; becauſe they are, as it were, certain hidden ſeals, making the harmony of ſome divinity: either they are ſignes of a Covenant entred into, and of promiſed and plighted faith, or of obedience. And thoſe Characters cannot by any other means be ſearched out.</p>
            <p>Moreover, beſides theſe Characters, there are certain fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Figures &amp; Images of evil Spirits, under which forms they are wont to appear, and yield obedience to them that invoke them. And all theſe Characters or Images may be ſeen by the table following, according to the courſe of the letters conſtituting the names of Spirits themſelves: ſo that if in any letter there is found more then the name of one Spirit, his Image holdeth the pre-eminence, the others imparting their own order; ſo that they which are the firſt orders, to them is attributed the head, the upper part of the body, according to their own figure: thoſe which are the loweſt, do poſſeſs the thighs and feet; ſo alſo the middle letters do attribute like to themſelves the middle parts of the body, or give the parts that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. But if there happen any contrariety, that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is the ſtronger in the number ſhall bear rule: and if they are equal, they all impart equal things. Furthermore, if any name ſhall obtain any notable Character or Inſtrument out of the Table, he ſhall likewiſe have the ſame character in the Image.</p>
            <p>We may alſo attain to the knowledge of the dignities of the evil Spirits, by the ſame Tables of Characters and Images: for upon what ſpirit ſoever there falleth any excellent ſigne or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument out of the Table of Characters, he poſſeſſeth that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. As if there ſhall be Crown, it ſheweth a Kingly dignity; if a Creſt or Plume, a Duke dome; if a Horn, a County; if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Laſtly, they which bear an humane ſhape and figure, have greater dignity then thoſe which appear under the Forms and Images of Beaſts; they alſo who ride, do excel them which appear on foot. And thus according to all their commixtures, you may judge the dignity and excellency of Spirits, one before another. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, you muſt underſtand, that the Spirits of the inferiour or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of what dignity ſoever they be, are alwaies ſubject to the Spirits of the ſuperiour order: ſo alſo, that it is not incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for their Kings and Dukes to be Subject and Miniſter to the preſidents of the ſuperiour order.</p>

               <p>But we now come to ſpeak of the holy and ſacred Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Sigils. Now theſe pentacles, are as it were certain holy ſignes preſerving us from evil chances and events, and helping and aſſiſting us to binde, exterminate, and drive away evil ſpirits, and alluring the good ſpirits, and reconciling them unto us. And theſe pentacles do conſiſt either of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the good ſpirits of the ſuperiour order, or of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred pictures of holy letters or revelations, with apt and fit verſicles, which are compoſed either of Geometrical figures and holy names of God, according to the courſe and maner of many of them; or they are compounded of all of them, or very many of them mixt. And the Characters which are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us to conſtitute and make the pentacles, they are the Characters of the good Spirits, eſpecially and chiefly of the good ſpirits of the firſt and ſecond order, and ſometimes alſo of the third order. And this kinde of Characters are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be named holy; and then thoſe Characters which we have above called holy. What Character ſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this kinde is to be inſtituted, we muſt draw about him a double circle, wherein we muſt write the name of his Angel: and if we will adde ſome divine name
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55919:33"/>
congruent with his Spirit and Office, it will be of the greater force and efficacy. And if we will draw about him any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular figure, according to the maner of his numbers, that alſo ſhall be lawful to be done. But the holy pictures which do make the pentacles, are they which everywhere are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto us in the Prophets and ſacred Writings, as well of the old as of the new Teſtament. Even as the figure of the Serpent hanging on the croſs, and ſuch-like; whereof very many may be found out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore when any picture is poſited of any of theſe holy Images, let the circle be drawn round about it on each ſide thereof, wherein let there be written ſome divine name, that is apt and conformed to the effect of that figure, or elſe there may be written about it ſome verſicle taken out of part of the body of holy Scripture, which may deſire to aſcertain or deprecate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired effect. As, if a pentacle were to be made to gain vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory or revenge againſt ones enemies, aſwel viſible as inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, The figure may be taken out of the ſecond book of the <hi>Macchabees:</hi> that is to ſay, a hand holding a golden Sword drawn, about which let there be written the verſicle there <note place="margin">Accipe gladium ſanctum, munus à Deo, in quo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarios populi mei Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</note> contained; To wit, <hi>Take the holy Sword, the gift of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou ſhalt ſtay the adverſaries of my people Iſrael.</hi> Or alſo there may be written about it a verſicle of the fifth <hi>Pſalm: In this is the ſtrength of thy arm: before thy face there is death;</hi> or ſome other ſuch-like verſicle. But if you will write any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine name about the figure, then let ſome name be taken that ſignifies Fear, a Sword, Wrath, the Revenge of God, or ſome ſuch-like name congruent and agreeing with the effect deſired. And if there ſhall be written any Angular figure, let him be taken according to the reaſon and rule of the numbers, as we have taught in our ſecond book of Occult Philoſophy, where we have treated of the numbers, and of the like operations. And of this fort there are two pentacles of

ſublime vertue and great power, very uſeful and neceſſary to be uſed in the conſecration of experiments and Spirits: one whereof is that in the firſt chapter of <hi>Apocalypſe;</hi> To wit, a figure of the Majeſty of God ſitting upon a Throne, having in his mouth a two-edged Sword, as there it is written, about which let there be written, <hi>I am Alpha &amp; Omega, the beginning</hi>

               <p>There is another pentacle, the figure whereof is like unto <hi>a Lambe ſlain, having ſeven eyes, and ſeven horns, and under his feet a book ſealed with ſeven ſeals,</hi> as it is in the 5. <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> Whereabout let there be written this verſicle: <hi>Behold the Lion hath overcome of the Tribe of Judah, the root of David.

               <p>But thoſe Pentacles which are thus made of figures and names, let them keep this order: for when any figure is poſited, conformable to any number, to produce any certain effect or vertue, there muſt be written thereupon, in all the

ſeveral Angles, ſome Divine name, obtaining the force and efficacie of the thing deſired: yet ſo nevertheleſs, that the name which is of this ſort do conſiſt of juſt ſo many letters, as the Figure may conſtitute a number; or of ſo many letters of a name, as joyned together amongſt themſelves, may make the number of a Figure; or by any number which may be divided without any ſuperfluity or diminution. Now ſuch a name being found, whether it be onely one name or more, or divers names, it is to be written in all the ſeveral Angles in the Figure: but in the middle of the Figure let the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the name be whole and totally placed, or at leaſt principally.</p>
               <p>Oftentimes alſo we conſtitute Pentacles, by making the revolution of ſome kinde of name, in a ſquare Table, and by drawing about it a ſingle or double Circle, and by writing therein ſome holy Verſicle competent and befitting this name, or from which that name is extracted. And this is the way of making the Pentacles, according to their ſeveral diſtinct forms and faſhions, which we may as we pleaſe either multiply or commix together by courſe among themſelves, to work the greater efficacie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> extenſion and enlargement of force and vertue.</p>
               <p>As, if a deprecation ſhould be made for the overthrow and deſtruction of ones enemies, then we are to minde and call to remembrance how God deſtroyed the whole face of the earth in the deluge of waters; and the deſtruction of Sodom and Gomorrha, by raining down fire and brimſtone; likewiſe, how God overthrew Pharaoh and his hoſt in the Red-Sea: and to call to minde if any other malediction or curſe be found in holy Writ. And thus in things of the like ſort. So likewiſe in deprecating and praying againſt perils and dangers of waters, we ought to call to remembrance the ſaving of Noah in the deluge of waters, the paſſing of the children of Iſrael thorow the Red-ſea; and alſo we are to minde how Chriſt walked upon the waters, and ſaved the ſhip in danger to be caſt away with the tempeſt; and how he commanded the windes and the waves, and they obeyed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55919:34"/>
him; and alſo, that he drew <hi>Peter</hi> out of the water, being in danger of drowning: and the like. And laſtly, with theſe we invoke and call upon ſome certain holy names of God, God; to wit, ſuch as are ſignificative to accompliſh our deſire, and accommodated to the deſired effect: as, if it be to overthrow enemies, we are to invoke and call upon the names of wrath, revenge, fear, juſtice, and fortitude of God: and if we would avoid and eſcape any evil or danger, we then call upon the names of mercy, defence, ſalvation, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, goodneſs, and ſuch-like names of God. When alſo we pray unto God that he would grant unto us our deſires, we are likewiſe to intermix therewith the name of ſome good ſpirit, whether one onely, or more, whoſe office it is to execute our deſires: and ſometimes alſo we require ſome evil ſpirit to reſtrain or compel, whoſe name likewiſe we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingle; and that rightly eſpecially, if it be to execute any evil work; as revenge, puniſhment, or deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if there be any Verſicle in the Pſalms, or in any other part of holy Scripture, that ſhall ſeem congruent and agreeable to our deſire, the ſame is to be mingled with our prayers. Now after Prayer hath been made unto God, it is expedient afterwards to make an Oration to that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner whom in our precedent prayer unto God we have deſired ſhould adminiſter unto us, whether one or more, or whether he be an Angel, or Star, or Soul, or any of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Angels. But this kinde of Oration ought to be compoſed according to the Rules which we have delivered in the ſecond book of Occult Philoſophy, where we have treated of the manner of the compoſition of Inchantments.</p>
               <p>You may know further, that theſe kinde of bonds have a threefold difference: for the firſt bond is, when we conjure by Natural things: the ſecond is compounded of Religious myſteries, by Sacraments, Miracles, and things of this ſort: and the third is conſtituted by Divine names, and holy Sigils. And by theſe kinde of bonds, we may binde not onely ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but alſo all other creatures whatſoever; as animals, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Incendia;</hi> Envie and Malice.</note> burnings, floods of waters, and the force and power
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55919:35"/>
of Arms. Oftentimes alſo we uſe theſe bonds aforeſaid, not onely by Conjuration, but ſometimes alſo uſing the means of Deprecation and Benediction. Moreover, it conduceth much to this purpoſe, to joyn ſome ſentence of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, if any ſhall be found convenient hereunto: as, in the Conjuration of Serpents, by commemorating the curſe of the Serpent in the earthly Paradiſe, and the ſetting up of the Serpent in the wilderneſs; and further adding that Verſicle, <hi>Thou ſhalt walk upon the Aſp and the Baſilisk,</hi> &amp;c. Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Super aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidem &amp; baſiliſcum ambulabis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> alſo is of much prevalency herein, by the tranſlation of ſome Sacramental Rites, to binde that which we intend to hinder; as, the Rites of Excommunication, of Sepulchres, Funerals, Buryings, and the like.</p>
               <p>And now we come to treat of the Conſecrations which men ought to make upon all inſtruments and things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be uſed in this Art: and the vertue of this Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moſt chiefly conſiſts in two things; to wit, in the power of the perſon conſecrating, and by the vertue of the prayer by which the Conſecration is made. For in the perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating, there is required holineſs of Life, and power of ſanctifying: both which are acquired by Dignification and Initiation. And that the perſon himſelf ſhould with a firm and undoubted faith believe the vertue, power, and efficacie hereof. And then in the Prayer it ſelf by which this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration is made, there is required the like holineſs; which either ſolely conſiſteth in the prayer it ſelf, as, if it be by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration ordained to this purpoſe, ſuch as we have in many places of the holy Bible; or that it be hereunto inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted through the power of the Holy Spirit, in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church. Otherwiſe there is in the Prayer a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimony, which is not onely by it ſelf, but by the commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of holy things; as, the commemoration of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, Hiſtories, Works, Miracles, Effects, Graces, Promiſes, Sacraments and Sacramental things, and the like. Which things, by a certain ſimilitude, do ſeem properly or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to appertain to the thing conſecrated.</p>
               <p>There is uſed alſo the invocation of ſome Divine names,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55919:35"/>
with the conſignation of holy Seals, and things of the like ſort, which do conduce to ſanctification and expiation; ſuch as are the Sprinkling with Holy-Water, Unctions with holy Oyl, and odoriferous Suffumigations appertaining to holy Worſhip. And therefore in every Conſecration there is chiefly uſed the Benediction and Conſecration of Water, Oyl, Fire, and Fumigations, uſed everywhere with holy Wax-lights or Lamps burning: for without Lights no Sacrament is rightly performed. This therefore is to be known, and firmly obſerved, That if any Conſecration be to be made of things profane, in which there is any pollution or defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then an exorciſing and expiation of thoſe things ought to precede the conſecration. Which things being ſo made pure, are more apt to receive the influences of the Divine vertues. We are alſo to obſerve, that in the end of every Conſecration, after that the prayer is rightly performed, the perſon conſecrating ought to bleſs the thing conſecrated, by breathing out ſome words, with divine vertue and power of the preſent Conſecration, with the commemoration of his vertue and authority, that it may be the more duely perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and with an earneſt and intentive minde. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will here lay down ſome examples hereof, whereby the way to the whole perfection hereof may the more eaſily be made to appear unto you.</p>
               <p>So then, in the conſecration of water, we ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate how that God hath placed the firmament in the midſt of the waters, and in what maner that God placed the fountain of waters in the earthly Paradiſe, from whence ſprang four holy rivers, which watered the whole earth. Likewiſe we are to call to remembrance in what manner God made the water to be the inſtrument of executing his juſtice in the deſtruction of the Gyants in the general deluge over all the earth, and in the overthrow of the hoſt of Pharaoh in the Red-ſea; alſo, how God led his own people thorow the midſt of the Sea on dry ground, and through the midſt of the river of Jordan; and likewiſe how marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly he drew forth water out of the ſtony rock in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55919:36"/>
and how at the prayer of Samſon, he cauſed a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of running water to flow out of the cheek-tooth of the jaw-bone of an aſs: and likewiſe, how God hath made waters the inſtrument of his mercy, and of ſalvation, for the expiation of Original ſin: alſo, how Chriſt was baptized in Jordan, and hath hereby ſanctified and cleanſed the waters. Moreo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er, certain divine names are to be invocated, which are conformable hereunto; as, that God is a living fountain, living water, the fountain of mercy; and names of the like kinde.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe in the conſecration of fire, we are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate how that God hath created the fire to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to execute his juſtice, for puniſhment, vengeance, and for the expiation of ſins: alſo, when God ſhall come to judge the world, he will command a conflagration of fire to go before him. And we are to call to remembrance in what manner God appeared to Moſes in the burning buſh; and alſo, how he went before the children of Iſrael in a pillar of fire; and that nothing can be duely offered, ſacrificed, or ſanctified, without fire; and how that God inſtituted fire to be kept continually burning in the Tabernacle of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and how miraculouſly he re-kindled the ſame, being extinct, and preſerved it elſewhere from going out, being hidden under the waters: and things of this ſort. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Names of God are to be called upon which are conſonant hereunto; as, it is read in the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that God is a conſuming fire: and if there be any of the Divine names which ſignifies fire, or ſuch-like names; as, the glory of God, the light of God, the ſplendor and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe in the conſecration of Oyl and Perfumes, we are to call to remembrance ſuch holy things as are perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to this purpoſe, which we read in <hi>Exodus</hi> of the holy anoynting oyl, and divine names ſignificant hereunto, ſuch as is the name Chriſt, which ſignifies anoynted: and what myſteries there are hereof; as that in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> of the two Olive-trees diſtilling holy oyl into the lamps that burn
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55919:36"/>
before the face of God: and the like.</p>
               <p>And the bleſſing of the lights, wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and lamps, is taken from the fire, and the altar which containeth the ſubſtance of the flame: and what other ſuch ſimilitudes as are in myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; as that of the ſeven candleſticks and lamps burning before the face of God.</p>
               <p>Theſe therefore are the Conſecrations which firſt of all are neceſſary to be uſed in every kinde of devotion, and ought to precede it, and without which nothing in holy Rites can be duely performed.</p>
               <p>In the next place now we ſhall ſhew unto you the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of Places, Inſtruments, and ſuch-like things.</p>
               <p>Therefore when you would conſecrate any Place or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, you ought to take the prayer of Solomon uſed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Temple: and moreover, you muſt bleſs the place with the ſprinkling of Holy-water, and with Fumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; by commemorating in the benediction holy myſteries; ſuch as theſe are: The ſanctification of the throne of God, of mount Sinai, of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, of the Holy of holies, of the temple of Jeruſalem. Alſo, the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification <note place="margin">Sanctum ſanctorum.</note> of mount Golgotha, by the crucifying of Chriſt; the ſanctification of the Temple of Chriſt; of mount Tabor, by the transfiguration and aſcenſion of Chriſt: and the like. And by invocating divine names which are ſignificant here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; ſuch as the Place of God, the Throne of God, the Chayr of God, the Tabernacle of God, the Altar of God, the Habitation of God, and ſuch-like divine names of this ſort; which are to be written about the Circle or place to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated.</p>
               <p>And in the conſecrations of inſtruments, and of all other things whatſoever that are ſerviceable to this Art, you ſhall proceed after the ſame manner, by ſprinkling the ſame with Holy-water, perfuming the ſame with holy Fumigations, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynting it with holy Oyl, ſealing it with ſome holy Sigil, and bleſſing it with prayer; and by commemorating holy things out of the ſacred Scriptures, Religion, and Divine names
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55919:37"/>
which ſhall be found agreeable to the thing that is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated: as for examples ſake, in conſecrating a ſword, we are to call to remembrance that in the Goſpel, <hi>He that hath</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Qui habet duas tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>two coats,</hi> &amp;c. and that place in the ſecond of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> That a ſword was divinely and miraculouſly ſent to <hi>Judas Macchabew.</hi> And if there be any thing of the like in the Prophets; as that place, <hi>Take unto you two-edged Swords,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Accipte vobis gladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os bis acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In like maner you ſhall conſecrate experiments and books, and whatſoever of the like nature, as is contained in writings, pictures, and the like, by ſprinkling, perfuming, anointing, ſealing, and bleſſing with holy commemorations, and calling to remembrance the ſanctifications of myſteries; As, the ſanctifying of the Tables of the ten Commandments, which were delivered to <hi>Moſes</hi> by God in Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> The ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Teſtaments of God, the Old and New; The ſanctification of the Law, and of the Prophets, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are promulgated by the holy Ghoſt. Moreover, there is to be commemorated ſuch divine names as are fit and convenient hereunto; as theſe are: The Teſtament of God, The book of God, The book of life, The knowledge of God, The wiſdom of God; and the like. And with ſuch kinde of Rites is the perſonal conſecration performed.</p>
               <p>There is furthermore, beſides theſe, another Rite of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, of wonderful power, and much efficacy; And this is out of the kindes of ſuperſtitions: That is to ſay, when the Rite of conſecration or collection of any Sacrament in the Church is transferred to that thing which we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate.</p>
               <p>It is to be known alſo, that Vowes, Oblations, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, have the power of conſecration, aſwel real as perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and they are as it were certain covenants and conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between thoſe names with which they are made, and us who make them, ſtrongly cleaving to our deſire and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed effect: As, when we dedicate, offer, and ſacrifice, with certain names or things; as, Fumigations, Unctions, Rings, Images, Looking-glaſſes; and things leſs material, as Deities, Sigils, Pentacles, Inchantments, Orations, Pictures, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55919:37"/>
Scriptures: of which we have largely ſpoken in our third book of Occult Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>There is extant amongſt thoſe Magicians (who do moſt uſe the miniſtery of evil ſpirits) a certain Rite of invocating ſpirits by a Book to be conſecrated before to that purpoſe; which is properly called, <hi>A book of Spirits;</hi> whereof we <note place="margin">Liber Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituum.</note> ſhall now ſpeak a few words. For this book is to be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, a book of evil ſpirits, ceremoniouſly to be compoſed, in their name and order: whereunto they binde with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain holy Oath, the ready and preſent obedience of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit therein written.</p>
               <p>Now this book is to be made of moſt pure and clean pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that hath never been uſed before; which many do call <hi>Virgin-paper.</hi> And this book muſt be inſcribed after this maner: that is to ſay, Let there be placed on the left ſide the image of the ſpirit, and on the right ſide his character, with the Oath above it, containing the name of the ſpirit, and his dignity and place, with his office and power. Yet very many do compoſe this book otherwiſe, omitting the characters or image: but it is more efficacious not to neglect any thing which conduceth to it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there is to be obſerved the circumſtances of places, times, hours, according to the Stars which theſe ſpirits are under, and are ſeen to agree unto, their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ite, rite, and order being applied.</p>
               <p>Which book being ſo written, and well bound, is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, garniſhed, and kept ſecure, with Regiſters and Seals, leſt it ſhould happen after the conſecration to open in ſome place not intented, and indanger the operator. Furthermore, this book ought to be kept as reverently as may be: for irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of minde cauſeth it to loſe its vertue, with pollution and profanation.</p>
               <p>Now this ſacred book being thus compoſed according to the maner already delivered, we are then to proceed to the conſecration thereof after a twofold way: one whereof is, That all and ſingular the ſpirits who are written in the book, be called to the Circle, according to the Rites and Order
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55919:38"/>
which we have before taught; and the book that is to be conſecrated, let it be placed without the Circle in a triangle. And in the firſt place, let there be read in the preſence of the ſpirits all the Oathes which are written in that book; and then the book to be conſecrated being placed without the Circle in a triangle there drawn, let all the ſpirits be compelled to impoſe their hands where their images and characters are drawn, and to confirm and conſecrate the ſame with a ſpecial and common Oath. Which being done, let the book be taken and ſhut, and preſerved as we have before ſpoken, and let the ſpirits be licenſed to depart, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to due rite and order.</p>
               <p>There is another maner of conſecrating a book of ſpirits, which is more eaſie, and of much efficacie to produce every effect, except that in opening this book the ſpirits do not always come viſible. And this way is thus: Let there be made a book of ſpirits as we have before before ſet forth; but in the end thereof let there be written Invocations and Bonds, and ſtrong Conjurations, wherewith every ſpirit may be bound. Then this book muſt be bound between two Tables or Lamens, and in the inſide thereof let there be drawn the holy Pentacles of the Divine Majeſtie, which we have before ſet forth and deſcribed out of the <hi>Apocalypſe:</hi> then let the firſt of them be placed in the beginning of the book, and the ſecond at the end of the ſame. This book being perfected after this maner, let it be brought in a clear and fair time, to a Circle prepared in a croſs way, according to the Art which we have before delivered; and there in the firſt place the book being opened, let it be conſecrated to the rites and ways which we have before declared concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Conſecration. Which being done, let all the ſpirits be called which are written in the book, in their own order and place, by conjuring them thrice by the bonds deſcribed in the book; that they come unto that place within the ſpace of three days, to aſſure their obedience, and confirm the ſame, to the book ſo to be conſecrated. Then let the book be wrapped up in clean linen, and buried in the middle of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55919:38"/>
Circle, and there faſt ſtopped up: and then the Circle being deſtroyed, after the ſpirits are licenſed, depart before the riſing of the ſun: and on the third day, about the midd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of the night, return, and new make the Circle, and with bended knees make prayer and giving thanks unto God, and let a precious perfume be made, and open the hole, and take out the book; and ſo let it be kept, not opening the ſame. Then you ſhall licenſe the ſpirits in their order, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Circle, depart before the ſun riſe. And this is the laſt rite and maner of conſecrating, profitable to whatſoever writings and experiments, which do direct to ſpirits, placing the ſame between two holy Lamens or Pentacles, as before is ſhewn.</p>
               <p>But the Operator, when he would work by the book thus conſecrated, let him do it in a fair and clear ſeaſon, when the ſpirits are leaſt troubled; and let him place himſelf towards the region of the ſpirits. Then let him open the book un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a due Regiſter; let him invoke the ſpirits by their Oath there deſcribed and confirmed, and by the name of their character and image, to that purpoſe which you deſire: and, if there be need, conjure them by the bonds placed in the end of the book. And having attained your deſired effect, then you ſhall licenſe the ſpirits to depart.</p>
               <p>And now we ſhall come to ſpeak concerning the invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirits, as well of the good ſpirits as of the bad.</p>
               <p>The good ſpirits may be invocated of us, divers ways, and in ſundry manners do offer themſelves unto us. For they do openly ſpeak to thoſe that watch, and do offer themſelves to ourſight, or do inform us in dreams by oracle of thoſe things which are deſired. Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would call any good ſpirit, to ſpeak or appear in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight, it behoveth them eſpecially to obſerve two things: one whereof is about the diſpoſition of the invocant; the other about thoſe things which are outwardly to be adhibited to the invocation, for the conformity of the ſpirits to be called. It behoveth therefore that the invocant himſelf be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55919:39"/>
diſpoſed for many days to ſuch a myſtery. In the firſt place therefore, he ought to be confeſſed and contrite, both inwardly and outwardly, and rightly expiated, by daily waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with holy water. Moreover, the invocant ought to conſerve himſelf all theſe days, chaſte, abſtinent, and to ſeparate himſelf as much as may be done, from all perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of minde, and from all maner of forraign and ſecular buſineſs. Alſo, he ſhall obſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e faſtings all theſe days, as much as ſhall ſeem convenient to him to be done. Alſo, let him daily between ſun-riſing and ſun-ſetting, being clothed with a holy linen garment, ſeven times call upon God, and make a deprecation to the Angels to be called according to the rule which we have before taught. Now the number of days of faſting and preparation, is commonly the time of a whole Lunation. There is alſo another number obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Caballiſts, which is fourty days.</p>
               <p>Now concerning thoſe things which do appertain to this Rite of Invocation, the firſt is, That a place be choſen, clean, pure, cloſe, quiet, free from all maner of noiſe, and not ſubject to any ſtrangers ſight. This place muſt firſt be exerciſed and conſecrated: and let there be a table or altar placed therein, covered with clean white linen, and ſet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eaſt: and on each ſide thereof, let there be ſet two conſecrated wax-lights burning, the flame whereof ought not to go out all theſe days. In the middle of the altar, let there be placed Lamens, or the holy paper which we have before deſcribed, covered with pure fine linen; which is not to be opened until the end of theſe days of the Conſecration. You ſhall alſo have in readineſs a precious perfume, and pure anointing oyl; and let them be both kept conſecrated. There muſt alſo a Cenſer be ſet on the head of the altar, wherein you ſhall kindle the holy fire, and make a perfume every day that you ſhall pray. You ſhall alſo have a long garment of white linen, cloſe before and behinde, which may cover the whole body and the feet, and girt about you with a girdle. You ſhall alſo have a veil of pure clean linen,

and in the fore-part thereof let there be fixed golden or gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Lamens, with the inſcription of the name <hi>Tetragramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> all which things are to be ſanctified and conſecrated in order. But you muſt not enter into the holy place, unleſs it be firſt waſhed, and arayed with a holy garment; and then you ſhall enter into it with your feet naked. And when you enter therein, you ſhall ſprinkle it with holy water: then you ſhall make a perfume upon the altar, and afterwards with bended knees pray before the altar as we have directed.</p>
               <p>But in the end of theſe days, on the laſt day, you ſhall faſt more ſtrictly: and faſting on the day following, at the riſing of the ſun, you may enter into the holy place, uſing the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies before ſpoken of, firſt by ſprinkling your ſelf, then with making a perfume, you ſhall ſigne your ſelf with holy oyl in the forehead and anoint your eyes; uſing prayer in all theſe Conſecrations. Then you ſhall open the holy Lamen, and pray before the altar upon your knees, as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: and then an invocation being made to the Angels, they will appear unto you, which you deſire; which you ſhall entertain with a benign and chaſte communication, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe them to depart.</p>
               <p>Now the Lamen which is to be uſed to invoke any good ſpirit, you ſhall make after this maner; either in metal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable, or in new wax, mixt with ſpecies and colours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable: or it may be made in clean paper, with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent colours: and the outward form or figure thereof may be ſquare, circular, or triangular, or of the like ſort, according to the rule of the numbers: in which there muſt be written the divine names, as well the general names as the ſpecial. And in the centre of the Lamen, let there be drawn a chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of ſix corners; in the middle whereof, let there be <note place="margin">Hexagonus</note> written the name and character of the Star, or of the Spirit his governour, to whom the good ſpirit that is to be called is ſubject. And about this character, let there be placed ſo many characters of five corners, as the ſpirits we would call <note place="margin">Pentagonus</note> together at once. And if we ſhall call onely one ſpirit, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs

there ſhall be made four Pentagones, wherein the name of the ſpirit or ſpirits, with their characters, is to be written.

               <p>And this is the way of making the general Table, ſerving for the invocation of all good ſpirits whatſoever.

                  </gap> another Rite more eaſie to perform this thing: that is to ſay, Let the man that is to receive any Oracle from the good ſpirits, be chaſte, pure, and confeſs'd. Then a place being prepared pure and clean, and covered everywhere with white linen, on the Lords day in the new of the moon let him enter into that place, clothed with clean white garments; and let him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcize the place, and bleſs it, and make a Circle therein with a ſanctified cole; and let there be written in the vttermoſt part of the Circle the names of the Angels, and in the inner part thereof let there be written the mighty names of God: and let him place within the Circle, at the four angles of the world, the Cenſers for the perſumes. Then let him enter the place faſting, and waſhed, and let him begin to pray to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eaſt this whole Pſalm: <hi>Beati immaculati in via,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way,</hi> &amp;c. by perfuming; and in the end deprecating the Angels, by the ſaid divine names, that they wil daign to diſcover and reveal that which he deſireth: and that let him do ſix days, continuing waſhed and faſting. And on the ſeventh day, which is the Sabbath, let him, being waſhed and faſting, enter the Circle, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume it, and anoint himſelf with holy anointing oyl, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing his forehead, and upon both his eyes, and in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55919:40"/>
palms of his hands, and upon his feet. Then upon his knees let him ſay the Pſalm aforeſaid, with Divine and Angelical names. Which being ſaid, let him ariſe, and let him begin to walk about in a circuit within the ſaid Circle from the eaſt to the weſt, until he is wearied with a dizzineſs of his brain: let him fall down in the Circle, and there he may reſt; and forthwith he ſhall be wrapt up in an ecſtaſie, and a ſpirit will appear unto him, which will inform him of all things. We muſt obſerve alſo, that in the Circle there ought to be four holy candles burning at the four parts of the world, which ought not to want light for the ſpace of a whole week. And the maner of faſting muſt be ſuch, that he abſtain from all things having a life of Senſe, and from thoſe things which do proceed from them: and let him onely drink pure run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning water: neither let him take any food till the going down of the ſun. And let the perfume and the holy anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oyl be made, as is ſet forth in <hi>Exodus</hi> and the other holy books of the Bible. It is alſo to be obſerved, that always as often as he enters into the Circle, he have upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head a golden Lamen, upon which there muſt be written the name <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> as we have before ſpoken.</p>
               <p>But natural things, and their commixtures, do alſo belong unto us, and are conducing to receive Oracles from any ſpirit by a dream: which are either Perfumes, Unctions, and Meats or Drinks: which you may underſtand in our firſt book of Occult Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>But he that is willing always and readily to receive the Oracles of a Dream, let him make unto himſelf a Ring of the Sun or of Saturn for this purpoſe. There is alſo an Image to be made, of excellent efficacie and power to work this effect; which being put under his head when he goeth to ſleep, doth effectually give true dreams of what things ſoever the minde hath before determined or conſulted on. The Tables of Numbers do likewiſe confer to receive an Oracle, being duly formed under their own Conſtellations. And theſe things thou mayſt know in the third book of Occult Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:55919:41"/>
Holy Tables and Papers do alſo ſerve to this effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpecially compoſed and conſecrated: ſuch as is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madel of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the Table of the Revolution of the name <hi>Tetragrammaton.</hi> And thoſe things which are of this kinde, and written unto theſe things, out of divers figures, numbers, holy pictures, with the inſcriptions of the holy names of God and of Angels; the compoſition whereof is taken out of divers places of the holy Scriptures, Pſalms, and Verſicles, and other certain promiſes of the divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Prophecies.</p>
               <p>To the ſame effect do conduce holy prayers and impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as well unto God, as to the holy Angels and Heroes: the imprecations of which prayers are to be compoſed as we have before ſhewn, according to ſome religious ſimilitude of Miracles, Graces, and the like, making mention of thoſe things which we intend to do: as, out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the dream of <hi>Jacob, Joſeph, Pharaoh, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> if out of the New Teſtament, of the dream of <hi>Joſeph</hi> the husband of the bleſſed virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> of the dream of the three Wiſe-men; of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt ſleeping upon the breſt of our Lord: and whatſoever of the like kinde can be found in Religion, Miracles, and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as, the revelation of the Croſs to <hi>Helen,</hi> the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, therevelations of <hi>Brilges, Cyril, Methodius, Mechtild, Joa him, Merhir,</hi> and ſuch-like. According to which, let the deprecations be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, if when he goeth to ſleep it be with a firm intention: and the reſt well diſpoſing themſelves, let them pray devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without doubt they will afford a powerful effect.</p>
               <p>Now he that knoweth how to compoſe thoſe things which we have now ſpoken of, he ſhall receive the moſt true Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of dreams. And this he ſhall do; obſerve thoſe things which in the ſecond book of Occult Philoſophy are directed concerning this thing. He that is deſirous therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Oracle, let him abſtain from ſupper and from drink, and be otherwiſe well diſpoſed, his brain being free from turbulent vapours; let him alſo have his bed-chamber fair
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55919:41"/>
and clean, exerciſed and conſecrated if he will; then let him perfume the ſame with ſome convenient fumigation; and let him anoint his temples with ſome unguent efficacious hereunto, and put a ring upon his finger, of the things above ſpoken of: let him take either ſome image, or holy table, or holy paper, and place the ſame under his head: then having made a devout prayer, let him go unto his bed, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating upon that thing which he deſireth to know, let him ſo ſleep; for ſo ſhall he receive a moſt certain and undoubted oracle by a dream, when the Moon goeth thought that ſigne which was in the ninth Houſe of his nativity, and alſo when ſhe goeth through the ſigne of the ninth Houſe of the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of his nativity; and when ſhe is in the ninth ſigne from the ſigne of perfection. And this is the way and means whereby we may obtain all Sciences and Arts whatſoever, ſuddenly and perfectly, with a true Illumination of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; although all inferiour familiar Spirits what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever do conduce to this effect; and ſometimes alſo evil Spirits ſenſibly informing us Intrinſecally or Extrinſecally.</p>
               <p>But if we would call an evil Spirit to the Circle, it firſt behoveth us to conſider, and to know his nature, to which of the Planets it agreeth, and what Offices are diſtributed to him from that Planet; which being known, let there be ſought out a place fit and proper for his invocation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of the Planet, and the quality of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the ſaid Spirit, as near as the ſame may be done: as, if their power be over the Sea, Rivers or Flouds, then let the place be choſen in the Shore; and ſo of the reſt. Then her there be choſen a convenient time, both for the quality of the Air, ſerene, clean, quiet, and fitting for the Spirits to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume bodies; as alſo of the quality and nature of the Planet, and of the Spirit, as to wit, on his day, or the time wherein he ruleth: he may be fortunate or infortunate, ſometimes of the day, and ſometimes of the night, as the Scars and Spirits do require. Theſe things being conſidered, let there be a Circle in the place elected, aſwel for the defence of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

the Circle it ſelf there are to be written the divine general names, and thoſe things which do yeild defence unto us; and with them, thoſe divine names which do rule this Planet, and the Offices of the Spirit himſelf; there ſhall alſo be written therein, the names of the good Spirits which bear rule, and are able to binde and conſtrain that Spirit which we intend to call. And if we will any more fortifie and ſtrengthen our Circle, we may adde Characters and Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles agreeing to the work; then alſo if we will, we may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within or without the Circle, frame an angular figure, with the inſcription of ſuch convenient numbers, as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruent amongſt themſelves to our work; which are alſo to be known, according to maner of numbers and figures: of which in the ſecond book of Occult Philoſophy it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſpoken. Further, He is to be provided of lights, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, unguents and medicines, compounded according to the nature of the Planet and Spirit; which do partly agree with the Spirit, by reaſon of their natural and coeleſtial ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and partly are exhibited to the Spirit for religious and ſuperſtitious worſhip. Then he muſt be furniſhed with holy and conſecrated things, neceſſary aſwel for the defence of the Invocant, and his fellows, as alſo ſerving for bonds to binde and conſtrain the Spirits; ſuch as are either holy Papers, Lamens, Pictures, Pentacles, Sword, Scepters, Garments of convenient matter and colour, and things of the like ſort.

               <p>And after all the courſes are finiſhed, then ceaſe a little; and if any Spirit ſhall appear, let the Invocant turn himſelf towards the Spirit, and courteouſly receive him, and earneſtly intreating him, let him firſt require his name, and if he be called by any other name: and then proceeding further, let him ask him whatſoever he will: and if in any thing the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhall ſhew himſelf obſtinate or lying; let him be bound by covenient conjurations: and if you doubt of any lye, make without the Circle with the conſecrated Sword, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a triangle or <note n="*" place="margin">A Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with five cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note>

that you have erred in any thing, then that you ſhall amend, by adding or diminiſhing; for the conſtancy of Reiteration doth often increaſe your authority and power, and ſtriketh terror into the Spirits, and humbleth them to obey.</p>

               <p>This alſo we are to take notice of, That when no Spirits will appear, but the Maſter being wearied hath determined to ceaſe and give over; let him not therefore depart without licenſing the Spirits: for they that do neglect this, are very greatly in danger, except they are fortified with ſome ſublime defence.</p>

                  </gap>imes alſo the Spirits do come, although they appear not viſible, (for to cauſe terror to him that calls them) either in the things which he uſeth, or in the operation it ſelf. But this kinde of licenſing is not given ſimply, but by a kinde of diſpenſation with ſuſpenſion, until in the following terms they ſhall render themſelves obedient. Alſo without a Circle theſe Spirits may be called to appear, according to the way which is above delivered about the conſecration of a book.</p>
               <p>But when we do intend to execute any effect by evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, where an Apparition is not needful; then that is to be done, by making and forming that thing which is to be unto us as an inſtrument, or ſubject of the experiment it ſelf; as, whether it be an Image, or a Ring, or a Writing, or any Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, Candle, or Sacrifice, or any thing of the like ſort; then the name of the Spirit is to be written therein, with his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, according to the exigency of the experiment, either by writing it with ſome blood, or otherwiſe uſing a perfume agreeable to the Spirit. Oftentimes alſo making Prayers and Orations to God and the good Angels before we invocate the evil Spirit, conjuring him by the divine power.</p>
               <p>There is another kinde of Spirits, which we have ſpoken of in our third book of Occult Philoſophy, not ſo hurtful, and neereſt unto men; ſo alſo, that they are effected with humane
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55919:43"/>
paſſions, and do joy in the converſation of men, and freely do inhabit with them: and others do dwell in the Woods and Deſarts; &amp; others delight in the company of divers domeſtique Animals and wilde Beaſts; and otherſome do inhabit about Fountains and Meadows. Whoſoever therefore would call up theſe kinde of Spirits, in the place where they abide, it ought to be done with odoriferous perfumes, and with ſweet ſounds and inſtruments of Muſick, ſpecially compoſed for the buſineſs, with uſing of Songs, Inchantments and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Verſes, with praiſes and promiſes.</p>
               <p>But thoſe which are obſtinate to yeild to theſe things, are to be compelled with Threatnings, Comminations, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, Deluſions, Contumelies, and eſpecially by threatning them to expel them from thoſe places where they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant.</p>
               <p>Further, if need be, thou maiſt betake thee to uſe Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes; but the chiefeſt thing that ought to be obſerved, is, conſtancy of minde, and boldneſs, free, and alienated from fear.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, when you would invocate theſe kinde of Spirits, you ought to prepare a Table in the place of invocation, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with clean linen; whereupon you ſhall ſet new bread, and running water or milk in new earthen veſſels, and new knives. And you ſhall make a fire, whereupon a perfume ſhall be made. But let the Invocant go unto the head of the Table, and round about it let there be ſeats placed for the Spirits, as you pleaſe, and the Spirits being called, you ſhall invite them to drink and eat. But if perchance you ſhall fear any evil Spirit, then draw a Circle about it, and let that part of the Table at which the Invocant ſits, be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Circle, and the reſt of the Table without the Circle.</p>
               <p>In our third book of Occult Philoſophy, we have taught how and by what means the Soul is joyned to the Body; and, what hapeneth to the Soul after death.</p>
               <p>Thou maiſt know further, That thoſe Souls do ſtill love their relinquiſhed Bodies after death, as it were a certain
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55919:44"/>
affinity alluring them; ſuch as are the Souls of noxious men, which have vio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ently relinquiſhed their Bodies, and Souls wanting a due burial, which do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill wander in a liquid and turbuient Spirit about their dead carkaſſes; for theſe Souls by the known means by which heretofore they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ned to their Bodies, by the like vapors, liquors, and ſavours, are eaſily drawn unto them.</p>
               <p>From hence it is, that the Souls of the dead are not to be called up without blood, or by the application of ſome part of their rei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t Body.</p>
               <p>In the raiſing up of theſe ſhadows, we are to perfume with new Blood, with the Bones of the dead, and with Fleſh, Egges, Milk, Honey and Oile, and ſuch-like things, which do attribute to the Souls a means apt to receive their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be underſtood, That thoſe who are deſirous to raiſe up any Souls of the dead, they ought to do it in thoſe places, wherein theſe kinde of Souls are moſt known to be converſant, or for ſome alliance alluring thoſe ſouls into their forſaken Body; or for ſome kinde of affection in times paſt, impreſſed in them in their life, drawing the ſaid Soul to certain places, things, or perſons; or for the forcible nature of ſome place fitted and prepared for to purge or puniſh theſe Souls. Which places for the moſt part are to be known by the experience of viſions, mighty incurſions, and appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſuch-like prodigies ſeen.</p>
               <p>Therefore the places moſt fitting for theſe things, are Church-yards. And better then them, are thoſe places wherein there is the execution of criminal judgements. And better then theſe, are thoſe places, in which of late yeers there have been ſome publike ſlaughters of men. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, that place is better then theſe, where ſome dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſs, that came by a violent death, is not yet expiated, nor ritely buried, and was lately buried; for the expiation of thoſe places, is alſo a holy Rite duly to be adhibited to the burial of the bodies, and oftentimes prohibiteth the ſouls to come unto their bodies, and expelleth them far off unto the places of judgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:55919:44"/>
And from hence it is, That the Souls of the dead are not eaſily to be raiſed up, except it be the Souls of them whom we know to be evil, or to have periſhed by a violent death, and whoſe bodies do want a right and due burial.</p>
               <p>Now although we have ſpoken concerning ſuch places of this kinde, it will not be ſafe or commodious to go unto them; but it behoveth us to take to what place ſoever is to be choſen, ſome principal part of the body that is relict, and therewith to make a perfume in due maner, and to perform other competent Rites.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be known, That becauſe the Souls are certain ſpiritual lights, therefore artificial lights, eſpecially if they be framed out of certain competent things, compounded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a true rule, with congruent inſcriptions of Names and Seals, do very much avail to the raiſing up of departed Souls.</p>
               <p>Moreover, theſe things which now are ſpoken of, are not alwaies ſufficient to raiſe up Souls, becauſe of an extranatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral portion of underſtanding and reaſon, which is above, and known onely to the Heaven and Deſtinies, and their power.</p>
               <p>We ought therefore to allure the ſaid Souls, by ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and coeleſtial powers duely adminiſtred, even by thoſe things which do move the very harmony of the Soul, aſwel imaginative, as rational and intellectual; as are Voices, Songs, Sound, Inchantments: and Religious things; as Prayers, Conjurations, Exorciſmes, and other holy Rites, which may very commodiouſly be adminiſtred hereunto.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former book, which is the fourth book of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> it is ſufficiently ſpoken concerning Magical Ceremonies, and Initiations.</p>
            <p>But becauſe he ſeemeth to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the learned, and well-experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in this Art; becauſe he doth not ſpecially treat of the Ceremonies, but rather ſpeaketh of them in general, it was therefore thought good to adde hereunto the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Elements of <hi>Peter de Abano:</hi> that thoſe who are hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55919:46"/>
ignorant, and have not taſted of Magical Superſtitions, may have them in readineſs, how they may exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therein. For we ſee in this book, as it were a certain introduction of Magical vanity; and as if they were in preſent exerciſe, they may behold the diſtinct functions of ſpirits, how they may be drawn to diſcourſe and communication; what is to be done every day, and every hour; and how they ſhall be read, as if they were deſcribed ſillable by ſillable.</p>
            <p>In brief, in this book are kept the principles of Magical conveyances. But becauſe the greateſt power is attributed to the Circles; (For they are certain fortreſſes to defend the operators ſafe from the evil Spirits;) In the firſt place we will treat concerning the compoſition of a Circle.</p>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Of the Circle, and the compoſition thereof.</head>
               <p>THe form of Circles is not alwaies one and the ſame; but uſeth to be changed, according to the order of the Spirits that are to be called, their places, times, daies and hours. For in making a Circle, it ought to be conſidered in what time of the year, what day, and what hour, that you make the Circle; what Spirits you would call, to what Star and Region they do belong, and what functions they have. Therefore let there be made three Circles of the latitude of nine foot, and let them be diſtant one from another a hands breadth; and in the middle Circle, firſt, write the name of the hour wherein you do the work. In the ſecond place, Write the name of the Angel of the hour. In the third place, The Sigil of the Angel of the hour. Fourthly, The name of the Angel that ruleth that day wherein you do the work, and the names of his miniſters. In the fifth place, The name of the preſent time. Sixthly, The name of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ruling in that part of time, and their Preſidents, Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The name of the head of the Signe ruling in that part of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55919:46"/>
time wherein you work. Eighthly, The name of the earth, according to that part of time wherein you work. Ninthly, and for the compleating of the middle Circle, Write the name of the Sun and of the Moon, according to the ſaid rule of time; for as the time is changed, ſo the names are to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And in the outermoſt Circle, let there be drawn in the four Angles, the names of the preſidential Angels of the Air, that day wherein you would do this work; to wit, the name of the King and his three Miniſters. Without the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, in four Angles, let <hi>Pentagones</hi> be made. In the inner Circle let there be written four divine names with croſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed in the middle of the Circle; to wit, towards the Eaſt let there be written <hi>Alpha,</hi> and towards the Weſt let there bewritten <hi>Omega;</hi> and let a croſs divide the middle of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. When the Circle is thus finiſhed, according to the rule now before written, you ſhall proceed.</p>

               <head>Of the names of the hours, and the Angels ruling them.</head>
               <p>IT is alſo to be known, that the Angels do rule the hours in a ſucceſſive order, according to the courſe of the heavens, and Planets unto which they are ſubject; ſo that that Spirit which governeth the day, ruleth alſo the firſt hour of the day; the ſecond from this governeth the ſecond hour; the third, the third hour, and ſo conſequently: and when ſeven Planets and hours have made their revolution, it returneth again to the firſt which ruleth the day. Therefore we ſhall firſt ſpeak of the names of the hours.</p>
