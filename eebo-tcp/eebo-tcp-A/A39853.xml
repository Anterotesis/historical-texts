            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that are there already, ſo as to prevent the danger of thoſe diſtempers lately raiſed amongſt them,) are ſuch as we are and have beene very ſenſible of and exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſſed with the conſideration of them.</p>
            <p>Yet the care the Houſes have ſo many wayes expreſt for providing a preſent ſupply of monyes, in relation to all theſe affaires, have made us hitherto ſilent as to that point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in expectation to have found ere this time an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable effect thereof in actuall ſupplyes. But finding that notwithſtanding all their care, yet through the neglect or delay of thoſe on whom the Houſes have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in that particular, there is little or nothing hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto effected therein, and eſpecially conſidering the delayes made by the Lord Mayor Aldermen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Councell of the City of <hi>London,</hi> in the advancing of that ſumme which the Houſes have demanded of them upon the ſecurity of the Arreares (ſo long ſince) due from the City to this Army, and for that tax where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all or moſt other places have long ſince payd in their proportions.) We are enforced to make this preſent addreſſe to the Houſes in relation thereunto.</p>
            <p>Firſt we cannot but conſider the notorious readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that Court to the advancing of farre greater ſummes for the raiſing of a new Warre and proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the late miſchievous practiſes and deſignes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament and Army. And that as their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate forwardneſſe therein, was the occaſion of the Armyes comming into theſe parts: ſo their backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the raiſing or advancing of the money now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52431:4"/>
for the ſervice of the Parliament and ſupply of the Army, hath beene and is the occaſion of the Armyes continuance here: And therefore we cannot but offer it as what we humbly conceive moſt juſt and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>That for what time their default or delayes have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned and ſhal further occaſion the Armyes ſtay here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts (ſo much to the burden and oppreſſion of theſe parts) the charge thereof ſhould ſome way be layd upon them and their adherents in and about the City, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with thoſe perſons from whom the ſaid arreares are due, and thoſe in whoſe default it lyes that they have hitherto beene either not aſſeſſed or not collected. And for that purpoſe that at leaſt in caſe the ſumme required be not payd in at the time limmitted by the Houſes. There may be a proportionable penalty impoſed by way of daily increaſe of the ſumme required for ſo long time as the payment thereof ſhall be further delayd. Next for aſ much as the Lord Mayor Aldermen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Councell, may perhaps conceive themſelves not ſo much obliged (either to execute the authority given them by the Parliament for leavying of money upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or to advance it themſelves by way of loane in behalfe of others untill it can be leavyed) as they would be to provide what ſhould juſtly be charged upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: We therefore humbly offer (at leaſt) in caſe the ſumme required upon the arreares be not paid in by the time limited.</p>

            <p>And all theſe things we deſire the rather, becauſe we have grounds both of reaſon and evidence from the ſpeeches of many in the City, to believe that in this long witholding of mony, the deſignes and hopes of the Parliaments and our enemies, are to raiſe the Army into diſtempers, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about us into a flame, whereby at leaſt to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and interrupt all proceedings to the execution of Parliamentary juſtice, or ſettlement of the Kingdom, and to expoſe the Parliament again into tumultuous violence, of all which the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evident and imminent, if not ſpeedily prevented by ſome ſuch vigorous and effectuall remedies as aforeſaid.</p>
