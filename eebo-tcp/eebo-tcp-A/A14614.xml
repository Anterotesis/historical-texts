         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

these Papers to your Highnes,

There is nothing can see the light, which

vnto you there, in case you had
giuen way to the propounding them, are
in these Letters charitably and calmly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
Betweene a couple of friends, bred
in the same Colledge (that of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sir WALTER MILDMAY of
blessed memorie, whom with honor and
thankfulnesse I name) chosen his Schollers
at the same election, lodged in the same
Chamber, after Ministers in the same Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.
And that they might bee matchable
abroad as well as at home, attendants in the

to see you there, not more I am sure,

then the other was solicitous to misse you
here. These passages betweene vs I haue
hitherto forborn to divulge, out of the hope
of further answer from Master <hi>Wadesworth</hi>
according to his promise; though since
the receipt of my last (being silent to my
selfe) he excused him in sundrie his Letters
to others by his lack of health. Nor should
I haue changed my resolution, but that I
vnderstand that presently after your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
departure from Spaine, hee departed
this life. Which newes though it grieue
me as it ought in respect of the losse of my

the Church of England to be a true Church:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

needes peruse the <hi>Originall quotations and Texts of

themselues which were alleadged on both parts, to
see if they were truely cited, and according to the

and of trauell sometime to finde the Books, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> I found much <hi>fraud</hi> committed by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants;

that the <hi>Centurists</hi> are faine often to censure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect

for who are they to controll the Fathers?</p>
               <p>There are indeede some <hi>few places</hi> in Authors,

euasion by <hi>Inuisibility of their Church:</hi> For

inuisible, or how should Strangers, and Pagans, and
others, be conuerted vnto her? or where should any
finde the Sacraments, if inuisible?</p>
               <p>Also the true Church in all places and all ages, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/>
holds one <hi>vniformitie</hi> and concord in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Faith,</hi> though not in all matters of <hi>ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or gouernment:</hi> But the Protestants Church hath

not in all ages, nor in all places such vniforme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
no not in one age, as is manifest to all the world,

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> Againe, by that saying, <hi>Haereses ad originem reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casse

rancour against the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> his disobedience
and contempt of his former Superiours, his vowe
breaking, and violent courses, euen causing rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against the <hi>Emperour,</hi> whom he reuiles, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

disobedience, scisme, and rebellions, had no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

<hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi> and to restore <hi>Queene Mary;</hi>
to hang Catholiques for traitors, and to burne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
for heretiques, to destroy <hi>Monasteries,</hi> and to
pill Churches: were these fit beginnings for the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of Christ? I pray was this man a good <hi>head of
Gods Church?</hi> for my part, I beseech our Lord blesse
me from being a member of such a head, or such a
Church. I come to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> where you
know by the <hi>Hugenots</hi> and <hi>Geuses all Caluinistes,</hi>
what ciuill wars they haue raised, how much bloud
they haue shed, what rebellion, rapine, and desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they haue occasioned principally for their new
Religion, founded in bloud like <hi>Draecos</hi> lawes: But I
would gladly know whether you can approue such
bloudy broiles for Religion, or no? I know Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
<hi>de facto,</hi> doe iustifie the ciuill warres of <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Holland</hi> for good against their Kings, but I could
neuer vnderstand of them <hi>quo lure:</hi> if the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
be Rebels (as they are) why did we support them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
if they be no rebels, because they fight for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
liberty of their ancient priuiledges, and for
their new Religion; we see it is an easie matter to
pretend liberties, and also why may not others as
as well reuolt for their old Religion: Or I beseech
you, why is that accounted <hi>treason against the State</hi>
in <hi>Catholiques,</hi> which is called <hi>reason of State</hi> in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants?</hi>
I reduce this argument to few words,
<hi>That Church which is founded and begun in ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ice
disobedience, passion, bloud, and rebellion, cannot be
the true Church:</hi> but it is euident to the world that
<hi>the Protestant Churches in Germanie, Franc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Geneua, &amp;c. were so founded,</hi> and in <hi>Geneua</hi> and
<hi>Holland</hi> are still continued in rebellion: <hi>ergo, they
are not true Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> Furthermore, where is not <hi>Succession</hi> both of
true Pastors and of true Doctrine, there is no true
Church: But among Protestants is no succession of
true Pastors, (for I omit here to treate of Doctrine)
<hi>ergo,</hi> no true Church. I prooue the <hi>minor:</hi> where
is <hi>no consecration nor ordination of Bishops and Priests,</hi>
according to the due forme and right intention re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
necessarily by the Church and ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
there is no succession of true Pastors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Protestants the said due forme and right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
are not obserued, <hi>ergo,</hi> no succession of true
Pastors. The said due forme and right intention are
not obserued among Protestants in <hi>France, Holland,</hi>
nor <hi>Germanie,</hi> where they haue no <hi>Bishops,</hi> and
where Lay men doe intermeddle in the making of
their Ministers. And for <hi>England,</hi> whereas the
Councels require the <hi>ordines minores</hi> of <hi>Subdeacon
and the rest,</hi> to goe before Priesthood; your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are made <hi>per saltum</hi> without euer being Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons.
And whereas the Councels require three
Bishops to assist at the consecration of a Bishop, it is
certaine that <hi>at the Nags-head in Cheap-side</hi> where
consecration of your first Bishops was attempted
but not effected (whereabout I remember the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
you had with one) there was but one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and I am sure there was such a matter: and
although I know and haue seene the Records them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
that afterward there was a consecration of
<hi>Doctor Parker at Lambeth,</hi> and three Bishops na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19974:12"/>
                  <hi>viz. Miles Couerdall of Exceter,</hi> one <hi>Hodges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin
Suffragan of Bedford,</hi> and another whose name
I haue forgotten, yet it is very doubtfull that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerdall</hi>
being made Bishop of <hi>Exceter</hi> in <hi>King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
time (when all Councels and Church Canons
were little obserued) he was neuer himselfe Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
consecrated; and so if he were no Canonicall
Bishop, he could not make another Canonicall: and
the third vnnamed, as I remember (but am not sure)
was onely a <hi>Bishop Elect,</hi> and not consecrated, and
so was not sufficient. But hereof I am sure, that they
did consecrate <hi>Parker</hi> by vertue of a Breue <hi>from the
Queene as Head of the Church,</hi> who indeed being no
true Head and a Woman, I cannot see how they
could make <hi>a true consecration grounded on</hi> her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.
Furthermore, making your Ministers you
keepe not the <hi>right intention;</hi> for neither doe the
Orderer nor the Ordered giue nor receiue the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<hi>as a Sacrament;</hi> nor with any intention of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing.</hi>
Also they want the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme</hi> with
which according to the Councels and Canons of
the Church holy Orders should be giuen; namely
for the <hi>matter,</hi> Priesthood is giuen <hi>by the deliuerie of
the Patena</hi> with <hi>bread,</hi> and of the <hi>Chalice</hi> with <hi>wine:</hi>
Deaconship by the deliuerie of the <hi>booke of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels;</hi>
and Subdeaconship by the deliuerie of the
<hi>Patena</hi> alone, and of the <hi>Chali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e</hi> emptie. And in the
substantiall forme of Priesthood you doe faile most
of all, which forme consists in these wordes, <hi>Accipe
potestatem offerendi sacrificium in Ecclesia pro viuis
&amp; mortuis,</hi> which are neither said no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> done by you,
and therefore well may you bee called <hi>Ministers,</hi> as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19974:13"/>
also Lay men are, but you are no <hi>Priests.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I conclude, wanting <hi>Subdeaconship,</hi> wanting
vndoubted Canonicall <hi>Bishops,</hi> wanting <hi>right inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
wanting <hi>matter</hi> and due <hi>forme,</hi> and deriuing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
that you seeme to haue from <hi>a Woman</hi> the <hi>Head
of your Church,</hi> therefore you haue <hi>no true Pastors,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> and consequently <hi>no true Church.</hi> And so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
and not to wearie my selfe and you too much,
being resolued in my vnderstanding, by these and
many other Arguments, <hi>that the Church of England
was not the true Church,</hi> but that <hi>the Church of Rome
was and is the onely true Church,</hi> because it alone is
<hi>Ancient, Catholique,</hi> and <hi>Apostolique,</hi> hauing <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
Vnitie,</hi> and <hi>Visibilitie,</hi> in <hi>all ages</hi> and <hi>places;</hi>
yet what <hi>agonies</hi> I passed with my will, here I will
ouer-passe. Onely I cannot pretermit to tell you,
that at last hauing also mastered and subdued my
will to relent vnto my vnderstanding, by meanes of
prayer, and by God Almighties grace principally,
I came to breake through many tentations and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments,
and from a troubled vnquiet heart to a
fixed and peaceable tranquilitie of minde, for which
I doe most humbly thanke our sweet Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<hi>Iesus,</hi> before whom with all reuerence I doe
auouch <hi>and sweare</hi> vnto you, as I shall answere it in
the dreadfull day of iudgement when all hearts shal
be discouered, that <hi>I forsooke Protestant Religion for
very feare of damnation;</hi> and became a Catholique
with <hi>good hope of saluation;</hi> and that in this hope
I doe continue and increase daily: and that I would
not for all the world become a <hi>Protestant</hi> againe.
And for this which here I haue written vnto you in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19974:13"/>
great haste, I know there bee many <hi>Replyes</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynders</hi>
wherewith I could neuer be satisfied; nor
doe I desire any further Disputation about them,
but rather to spend the rest of my life in <hi>deuotion;</hi>
yet in part to giue you, my deare good friend, some
<hi>account</hi> of my selfe, hauing now so good an occasion
and fit a messenger, and by you if you please to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a reason of my Faith to Master <hi>Hall,</hi> who in his
said <hi>printed Epistle</hi> in one place desires to know the

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19974:15"/>
therein to be called vpon <hi>for debt;</hi> who haue euer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured
to liue by that rule of the Apostle; <hi>Owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to any man.</hi> Yet not so much for that which you
must vrge the debt of loue, sith by that Text it appears,
that it can neuer be so discharged, as there should not be
more behinde to pay. And your selfe who challenge this
of me, doe owe me as much or well more. For let me tell
you, I haue the aduantage of you herein by my profession,
for where your loue is to me as to a man, or to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man, nor can by your present perswasion goe any
further, I can and doe loue you as my deare brother,
and fellow member in the mysticall body of our Lord
Iesus Christ. And from this ground (to his knowledge
I doe appeale) I doe heartily pray for you, and beare
with you, and as the Apostle enioynes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 7. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
you with a true brotherly affection. I am not
therefore ashamed of this debt, but doe reioyce as much
in the owing of it, as in the payment. But my shame
growes from the being behinde with you in <hi>the office
of writing.</hi> Wherein yet heare my honest and true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse.
Neither will I goe about to set off one debt with
another. For you may remember how at our parting
you promised to write to me <hi>touching the state of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
there, which if wee shall make out a perfect
reckoning, I account to be a good debt still. But this I
say, when your Letters of the first of April, 1615<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> came
to my hands, I purposed to returne answere by the same
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arer, who as hee told mee, was to returne about the
Midsommer following. But I had a sodaine and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie
iourny which came betweene, and kept me
from home till after the Commencement, so as that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
was lost. Besides, vpon the reading of your
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19974:15"/>
Letters, I perceiued your intention was to haue them
imparted to Doctor <hi>Hall,</hi> expecting in a sort some <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi>
from him. To him threfore did I send them.
After some moneths I receiued this answere, which
though I had once purposed to conceale, as not willing
to be the meane of any exasperation betweene you, yet
now hoping of your wisedome and patience I send you
inclosed, that it may be some euidence of my true excuse.
Vpon the receipt of it, I began to frame an answere to
the points of your Letter, according to your desire,
<hi>full,</hi> and <hi>in friendly termes.</hi> I had well-nigh finished
it, when I was presented to this Benefice, and thereby
entered into a world of distractions. These, together
with the labour of writing it ouer, and vncertaintie of
safe conueighing my Letters to you, did make mee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crastinate
my payment, till now to my shame you should
neede to demand it. And that I may by the more sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
my selfe obtaine a more easie penance from you;
I confesse to you, I was sometime halfe in the minde
(hauing especially differred it so long) to suppresse it
altogether. First, out of mine owne naturall disposition,
who haue euer abhorred contention: and whereas in
matters of Religion there ought to be the fairest wars,
I could neuer yet meete with any of that side of so pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
a minde, but by opposition he would be vnsetled.
For your selfe, though I knew your former moderate
temper, and (as I remember I wrote to Doctor <hi>Hall</hi>)
beleeued you in that which you protest, that out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
you were such as you professe; yet me thought I
perceiued by your quick manner to him, and some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
in the conclusion of your Letter, you were rather
desirous to enioy the quiet possession of your owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19974:16"/>
then come to any fur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her disputation whose is
the right. And in truth the time of that triall had
beene proper, before your departure: nor you had to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
farre engaged your selfe; and were to iustifie by your
constancie, the wisedome of your change. Besides, since
the sum of the errour of that side, as I haue euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
it, is beleeuing rather too much, then failing in
any point necessary to saluation, that notable place of
the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. came to my minde, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after that I had once occasion to preach of it, where
<hi>he forbids controuersies of disputations with those
that are infirme in faith. Who art thou</hi> (saith he)
<hi>that iudgest another mans seruant? he standeth or
falleth to his owne Master.</hi> Why should I grieue you,
and perhaps <hi>make my friend mine enemy (as Saint</hi>
Paul <hi>the</hi> Galathians) by saying the truth. The world
is full enough of contentious writings, which as by
your letter appeares you had seen ere ye resolued. If those
had not satisfied you, what could I hope to adde to them?
These things <hi>moued</hi> me; but as <hi>you say,</hi> they did not yet
<hi>satisfie</hi> me. For all men are interessed in the defence of
truth, how much more he that is called to be a Preacher
of it? All Christians are admonished by Saint <hi>Iude, to
fight for the faith once giuen to the Saints;</hi> how
much more those that are leaders in this warfare: How
could I say I loued our Lord Iesus Christ, if his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
being questioned I should be silent? How could I
approue to mine owne soule that I loued you, if I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered
you to enioy your owne error, suppose not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Besides that, you and perhaps others also might be
confirmed in it, perhaps interpreting my silence for a
confession that your <hi>Motiues</hi> were vnanswerable. But
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19974:16"/>
therein I was not onely resolued selfe to the contrary,
but thought it so easie to resolue any indifferent minde,
as me thought it was more shame not to haue done it at
the first, then praise to doe it at the last. As for the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of my endeauour, I was to leaue it to God. Many
and secret are the wayes of his Prouidence, which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
it selfe sometimes euen of our errours, to the safer
conduct of vs to our finall happinesse. Some I had known,
and heard of more, who being at first carried away with
the shewes of <hi>Vnity, Order, Succession, Infallabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
when they found them emptie of <hi>Truth,</hi> and the
cloakes of <hi>Pride, ambition, coue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with an <hi>obstinacie</hi> to defend all <hi>corruptions</hi> how pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
so euer, by finding the difference of these Hulles
from their Fathers Table, had with the prodigall Son
returned home againe. To conclude, I accounted my
selfe still <hi>in debt,</hi> and was I confesse to you unwilling to
die in it; and somtimes vowed to God, in the middest of
my troubles, if I might once see an end of them, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
to discharge it. And now hauing by his mercy
not onely attained that, but a new occasion presented
me presently thereupon, by your calling for satisfaction
to pay it, and meanes offered me to send it safely: I take
this motion to proceede from God, and doe humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
his Maiesty to turne it to good. It remaines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
good Master <hi>Wadesworth,</hi> that I doe intreat your
pardo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of that slacknesse that is past, and gentlenesse to
take it as I shall be able to pay it. My employments both
ordinary and extraordinary are many: the bulke of it
is to great to conuey in one Letter, consisting of sundry
sheetes of paper; and at this present there lies an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
taske vpon me, so as I cannot presently writ
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19974:17"/>
it out. I doe therefore no more now but <hi>acknowledge
the debt,</hi> and promise speedy paiment. Vnlesse I shall
adde this also, that I doe vndertake to <hi>pay interest</hi> for
the forbearance; and according as I shall vnderstand
by Master <hi>Austen</hi> shall be fittest, and safest, to send it in
parts, or all at once. To the conclusion of your last Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherein you professe your desire <hi>to spend the rest
of your life rather in the heate of deuotion, then
of disputation, desiring pardon of coldenesse that
way, and of all other your sinnes, and that it would
please God to guide and keepe me in all happinesse
as your selfe, through the redemption of our sweete
Sauiour, and by the intercession of his holy mother
and all Saints.</hi> I doe most thankefully and willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<hi>Amen:</hi> returning vnto you from my heart your

               </opener>
               <p>I Was exceeding glad to perceiue by your kinde,
modest, and discreete Letters of 5. of <hi>August</hi>
last, that you are still permanent in your own good
nature, and constant in your loue to me: not like
Master <hi>Ioseph Hall,</hi> neither bitterly reuiling nor flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
impertinently. Vnto whom I pray you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
his scoffing railing Letter, with these few
marginall noates. I pray God forgiue him, and
make him a more humbler and meeker man. And
I for my part doe freely pardon all his foule tearmes
against me. And though in gratitude and iustice I
am bound and so doe loue and respect you more
then him, for your greater curtesie to me, and for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19974:18"/>
your better value in your selfe; yet euen him I can
and doe and am bound to loue not onely as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
or a creature of God, or as I doe you for
an honest, morall, good, discreete man, but euen
further and beyond that which you seeme to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that we cannot by our doctrine proceede
in loue: <hi>viz.</hi> as men hauing soules for whom our
Sauiour hath died; and so as possible members
though indeede not actuall branches of his misti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
body: yea for such as may come to be ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and beare fruite in him, when we may be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
cut off, or fallen away. As for your serious
<hi>Apologie</hi> and excuse for not answering my first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
all this while, I doe easily admit it, and assure
my selfe that all the circumstances, impediments,
and occasions were such, as you affirme: nor did I
expect, nor vrge, in my first nor second Letters any
answere about <hi>Controuersies</hi> in Religion (for I euer
said we could say nothing of substance which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had not beene said) but onely gaue you by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<hi>Hals</hi> occasion some few reasons of my faith,
wherein still I protest I had rather be deuout then be
troubled to dispute, not for feare or doubt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I am so fully resolued in my selfe, and do think
it a very superfluous labour <hi>toties &amp; melius ab alijs

curtesie then of controuersie, which now by Master

               <p>YOur Letters of the 26. of October (beloued Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Waddesworth</hi>) were long vpon the way and
came not to my hands till the 23. of May. In them I
receiued your curteous acceptation of my excuse for
my former silence, &amp; censure of Doctor <hi>Hall</hi> Letter
with the profession of your loue to me and him, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then I accounted you could by your Doctrine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19974:19"/>
                  <hi>viz. as redeemed by Christ,</hi> and <hi>possible
members of his mysticall body.</hi> Truely Sir, I will
not change words with you here abouts, but I account
still to be <hi>an honest man,</hi> restraineth from that, <hi>to
be redeemed</hi> by our Sauiour, since that is as large as
<hi>humane nature,</hi> this is giuen to fewer, of whom a
man may say as our Lord doth of one in the Gospell,
that <hi>they are not far from the Kingdome of God.</hi>
Howsoeuer, I haue still my intention that <hi>wee out of
our profession may loue you better then you can
vs:</hi> since it is more to be an <hi>actuall,</hi> then a <hi>possible</hi>
member of Christ; and the <hi>Communion of Saints</hi>
is a staighter bond, then <hi>Redemption</hi> by Christ, and
possibilitie of being ingrafted and bearing fruite in
his mysticall body. And I would to Christ that of
all other Controuersies this were the vehementest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
vs, <hi>which should loue each other most.</hi>
Wherein although I would striue and doe my best to
haue the better, yet see how equally I would contend.
For both I would acknowledge freely, my selfe farre
short of that which I may by my profession doe in this
kinde, and perswade my selfe better of your secret af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to vs, then you may by your pofession expresse.
I will not easily beleeue that you can finde in your heart
to count that man a Dogge, and out of the Church,
and in state of damnation, that <hi>stedfastly beleeueth
in our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> and by him in the B.
<hi>Trinitie;</hi> that confesseth <hi>all the Doctrine of holy
Scriptures,</hi> the summe whereof is in the <hi>Creede;</hi>
that lastly, with a <hi>charitable</hi> affection embraceth all
that hold this faith, throughout the world, yea euen
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19974:19"/>
those that hate and persecute him to the death.
Wherein I forbeare for the present to enlarge, because
I speake more of it in my answere to your first Letters;
which Master <hi>Aston</hi> giues me hope that himselfe
ere long will consigne into your hands. Now by his
direction, I send you onely aduice of the receipt of
your last, with heartie thankes for them, desirous
not to runne further in arrerages with you in this
office of writing. This one thing I adde, that where
you write <hi>you are glad I doe subscribe to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
by the Saints,</hi> wishing me <hi>fully to extend
it to inuocation of Saints as Intercessors,</hi> though
not as <hi>Redeemers;</hi> I should be very glad if I could
as well content you in all other points, as that one:
comming thus prepared in all controuersies with you,
and all men, to <hi>yeelde whatsoeuer I may, sauing
the truth.</hi> But as I conceiue it, there is great oddes
betweene these two. <hi>To desire God to grant vs this
or that good thing by the intercession of the
Saints;</hi> and, <hi>To vse inuocation of themselues.</hi>
The one supposeth onely that <hi>the Saints in glory ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
knowing the warfare of those on earth, are
carefull for them,</hi> and omit not this act of <hi>neuer fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
charitie to pray for them.</hi> These praiers it
hopes, and desires of God may be helpefull to vs, by
the onely merit of our Lord Iesus Christ; in the same
sort as those of the Saints wheresoeuer <hi>on earth;</hi> as
2 <hi>Cor. 1. 10. 11. Ephes. 6. 1. Philem. ver.</hi> 22. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that <hi>the Saints departed know our wants, and
states in particular, and heare our prayers,</hi> and by
consequent <hi>know our hearts:</hi> which is flatly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19974:20"/>
to the Scriptures 2 <hi>Chron. 6. 30. Esay</hi> 63. 16. To
omit now that you doe not onely <hi>desire them to pray
for you,</hi> but <hi>aske at their hands grace and glory,
trust in them, vow to them, sweare by them, offer
and receiue the sacrifice of the New Testament to
their honour and glory, and desire it may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by their patronage.</hi> Wherefore as I am glad
to perceiue that you doe reuerse those blasphemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
<hi>Salua me Saluatrix; Redime me Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix;</hi>
and will not subscribe to those words of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,

Letter of yours since my receipt of it, hath beene a
traueller, further then you or I; which being some
moneths since returned into <hi>England,</hi> I returne to
you that it may relate what entertainment it hath
found in forraine parts. It is now a yeare and more
that I receiued a Letter from Master <hi>Waddes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
challenging an old debt of me, an answere
to his Letters which occasioned this of yours. I wrote
backe, and among other things enclosed this your
Letter, which he hath censured as you see. His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
by reason of the sicknesse of the Gentleman that
brought it, first at <hi>Paris,</hi> and after at <hi>Bruxels</hi> came
not to me till the latter end of May, and now lately
another I receiued from him, wherein he desires a
Copie both of your <hi>Text</hi> and his <hi>Glosse,</hi> as he cals
it, as hauing reserued none for haste. I haue not yet
sent him my answere to his <hi>Motiues</hi> which hath long
layen by me for lacke of leisure to copie it out, and
meanes safely to conuey it, being well towards a
quire of Paper. My auncient fault, tediousnesse. But
the Gentleman that brought me his former Letter,
hath vndertaken ere long to consigne it into his
hands. Therein I endeauour to vse him with the
best respect I can deuise, onely oppugning the Papacy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19974:23"/>
and Court of Rome. Now Sir, that which I would
entreate of you, is this: You know the Precept of the
Apostle touching them that are fallen, lend me your
hand to set him in ioynt againe. And be pleased not
onely not to reflect vpon the weakenesse of his Glosse,
but not so much as vpon the strength of his stomacke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <head type="sub">Salutem in Christo Iesu.</head>
               <p>SIr, I receiued by Master <hi>Fiston</hi> your letters of the
eight of Iune, and as I hope ere this time you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
the former which I mention in them: to
which I wrote in answere, and deliuered the same to
Master <hi>Aston</hi> the 15. of the same Moneth. Doctor
<hi>Hals letter</hi> with your <hi>marginall Notes</hi> which in
your last you require, I send you herein enclosed.
Though if I may perswade or intreate you both, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should the <hi>Text</hi> nor <hi>Glosse</hi> make you multiply
any more words thereabout. Vpon the receipt of your
Letter I spake with Master <hi>Aston,</hi> who told me that
he held his resolution for <hi>Spaine,</hi> whereupon I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
also to send by him mine answer to your first:
as thinking it better to doe it more safely, though a
a little later, then sooner, with lesse safetie. And here
Sir at length you haue it. Wherein as to my <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
for the manner, I hope you shall perceiue that
setting aside our difference in opinion, I am the same
to you that I was when we were either <hi>Schollers</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in <hi>Emmanuell Colledge,</hi> or <hi>Ministers in
Suffolke.</hi> For the <hi>substance,</hi> I doe endeauour still
to write to the purpose, omitting nothing materiall
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19974:24"/>
in your Letters. If sometimes I seeme ouerlong, and
perhaps to digresse somewhat from the principall
point more then was necessary, I hope you will pardon
it, sith you required a <hi>full answere,</hi> and the <hi>delay</hi> it
selfe had neede to bring you some <hi>interest</hi> for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance.
And because you mention the vehemencie
of <hi>discreete Lawyers</hi> (although me thinkes we are
rather the <hi>Clients</hi> themselues, that contend, since our
faith is our owne and our best <hi>freehold</hi>) let me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
of you this ingenuitie) which I protest in the
sight of God I bring my selfe.) Let vs not make head
against euident reason, for our owne credit, or fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and factions sake, as <hi>Lawyers</hi> sometimes are wont.
<hi>Neither let vs thinke we loose the victory, when
truth ouercomes.</hi> We shall haue part of it rather,
and the better part, since errour the common enemy
to vs both, is to vs more dangerous. For truth is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
and impregnable; we, if our Errour be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
must remaine <hi>seruants to corruption.</hi> It is
<hi>the first praise,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> to <hi>hold the
true opinion, the next to forsake the false.</hi> And
surely that is no hard masterie to doe, when both are
set before vs, if we will not be either retchlesse, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate.
From both which our Lord of his mercy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore
helpe vs, and bring vs to his euer lasting
Kingdome. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>I thanke you also, that your ancient loue towards mee,
hath (to vse that word of the Apostle) now flourished a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
in that after so many yeeres, you haue found oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
to accomplish your promise of writing to mee:
though not as ye vndertooke of the state of Religion there,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19974:26"/>
yet which I confesse I no lesse desired, the Motiues of the
forsaking that you had professed here. Whereof since it
hath pleased you, as yee write, <hi>now to giue mee an account,
and by me to Master Doctor Hall,</hi> with some expectation
also as it appeares of reply from one of vs, I will vse the
libertie which you giue me, and as directly as I can for the
matter, and in Christian termes for the manner, shew you
mine opinion of them, wherein I shall endeauour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
that Precept of the Apostle; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

it be to be interpreted, <hi>louing sincerely,</hi> or <hi>seeking truth
louingly.</hi> Neither soothing vntruth for the dearnesse of
your person, nor breaking charitie for diuersitie of opinion.
With this entrance, my louing friend, and if you refuse not
that old Catholike name, my deare brother, I come to your
Letter. Wherein though I might well let passe that part
which concernes your quarrell with Master Doctor <hi>Hall,</hi>
with <hi>aetatem habet;</hi> yet thus much out of the common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of charitie, which thinkes not euill, giue mee
leaue to say for him, I am verily perswaded he neuer meant
to charge you with Apostasie in so horrible a sense as you
count, <hi>viz. a totall falling from Christian Religion, like that
of</hi> Iulian, <hi>an obstinate pertinacy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n denying the principles of the
Faith necessarie to saluation, or a renouncing your Baptismee</hi>
The terme <hi>Apostasie,</hi> as you know, doth not alwaies sound
so hainously. A Monke forsaking his Order, or a Clerke
his habit, is in the Decretals stiled an Apostata. <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis</hi>
saith not vntruly, that euery deadly sinne is a kinde
of Apostasie. The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs
times, saith, there must come an <hi>Apostasie</hi> before
Christs second comming: and how this shall be he shewes
elsewhere. <hi>Men shall giue heede to spirits of error, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Deuils, and such as speake falsehood in hypocrisie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi>
Whereby it seemes that Antichrist himselfe shall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
renounce Christ and his Baptisme. His Kingdome
is a mysterie of iniquitie; a reuolt therefore, not from the
outward profession, but inward sinceritie and power of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19974:26"/>
Gospel. This kinde of Apostasie might bee that which
Master <hi>Hall</hi> was sory to finde in you, whom hee thought
fallen from the truth, though not in the principles of
Christian doctrine, yet in sundry conclusions which the
reformed Churches truely out of them maintaine. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
our common education in the same Colledge,
our common oath against Popery, our common calling
to the same sacred function of the Ministery, he could not
imagine vpon what reasons you should reuerse these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings.
And certainly, how weightie and sufficient so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
they be, wee are not taught by our Catholicke religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to reuenge our selues, and render reproch for reproch
with personall termes; much lesse to debase and auile the
excellent gifts of God, as is Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

These courses are forbidden vs when wee are reiled vpon,

France, Holland, and Geneua.</hi> And Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth in

to be matters of Faith, not Schoole questions of opinion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
Here indeed there is fault on all sides in this Age, that
we cannot be content with the bounds which the ancient
Church hath set, but euery priuate opinion must be straight-wayes
an Article of Faith. Euery decision of a Pope, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Decree of a Councell. And then as men are easily ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored
of their owne conceits, and as <hi>Gerson</hi> wisely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
that of the Poet, <hi>Qui amant sibi somnia fingunt;</hi> as
if the very marrow of Religion consisted in those points,
those that thinke otherwise are Heretikes, and in state of
damnation. The Roman faction goes further, to Fire and
Faggot, and all exquisite torments, as if those things that
make against the Papacie, were more seuerely to bee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19974:29"/>
then the blasphemies of the Iewes, or Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
it selfe. I doe not excuse the reformers of this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse,
wherein after your departure out of England, my
namelesse Aduersarie that vnder-tooke Master <hi>Alablasters</hi>
quarrell, giuing me ouer in three of his demands, ran riot
in the first, about this point of <hi>opposition among our selues,</hi>
and raked together all the vehement speeches of <hi>Luther,</hi>
and some of his followers, against those whom they call
<hi>the Sacramentaries.</hi> Why, who will vndertake to defend
<hi>Lutbers</hi> speeches, or all that falls from contentious pens?
But euen out of those testimonies, which himselfe brings
for the worst that hee could on the contrarie part; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
this eagrenesse is not mutuall. And in truth, both
we in <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Helue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ians,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> doe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a brotherly affection towards them of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> how
spitefully soeuer some of them write of vs. And euen of
those whom he calls <hi>Lutherans,</hi> as I perceiued while I was
at <hi>Norimberg,</hi> the moderater sort are alike affected towards
vs. But as touching the auouching our opinions to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith (which exception is common to you with
him) that which I should haue answered him, if I had
found in him any thing but spite and scorne, I will say
now to you. Verily in some sort euen the least conclusions
in Diuinitie are <hi>matters of Faith.</hi> For both Faith hath to
doe with them, and they are fetched by discourse, from the
first Principles holden by Faith, whence our whole Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is called by Saint <hi>Iude, the Faith</hi> once deliuered to the
Saints. And the least error in them, by consequence ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes
the same principles whence they are deduced.
That makes some, to mooue attention in their Readers to
say, <hi>The questions are not about small matters, but of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Articles of Religion, euen about the foundation.</hi> As <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aeus</hi>
whom he cites, saith, the question is of two <hi>Articles
of Faith.</hi> First, <hi>of that which teacheth that in Christ two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are vnited.</hi> Secondly, <hi>of the Article, He ascended into
Heauen.</hi> Why? doe not both sides agree to these? Yes.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19974:30"/>
But one side fetches arguments against vbiquitie from these
places, and thereupon saith, the question is about these
Articles; perhaps also chargeth the other to denie them.
Hee cites <hi>Pappus</hi> writing thus, <hi>Agitur inter nos de Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentia
Dei, &amp;c. The controuersie betwixt vs, is about the
Omnipotencie of God. The personall vnion of the two natures in
Christ. The communication of properties. The glorious body
of our Sauiour, &amp;c.</hi> Loe againe, euery place of argument or
defence is made the matter of Controuersie. Out of these
and such like confessions on either side, my namelesse Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie
will needes enforce, with great pompe and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph;
what thinke yee? <hi>That such sanctified men</hi> (this is
his scoffing language) <hi>goe not together by the eares for Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine
in the water.</hi> Againe, <hi>That all those Myrmidonian fights
and bloudie encounters bee not de lanâ Caprinâ aut de vmbrâ
asini—</hi>Why, who said they were? I will set downe here
my wordes, that you may iudge of the conscience of this
man, and haue with all the substance of my answere to
this obiection. <hi>And what if some outragious spirits on each
side, trans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ported with passion in their oppositions, haue vsed most
bitter and vnbeseeming speeches to their Aduersaries, and
sometimes haue shewed each other small humanitie; are you
so simple as not to discerne betweene the choller of some few opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionate
men, and the consequence of their opinions? Haue you
forgotten Saint</hi> Hierome <hi>and</hi> Ruffinus <hi>deadly foe-hood, which
was rung ouer the world? or</hi> Epiphanius <hi>and</hi> Chrysostomes,
<hi>or</hi> Victors <hi>and the Greeke Bishops? which proceeded so farre
about a trifle, that hee excommunicated them; which is little
lesse I thinke then to condemne to the pit of Hell. And yet if I
should put it to your iudgement, I am perswaded you would
grant they held all truth necessarie to saluation. For you must
remember Pope</hi> Boniface <hi>had not yet coyned the new Article of
the Faith, that I mentioned before. What shall I speake of Saint</hi>
Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>which grew to such bitternesse, and that
about a very little question of conueniency, that though they were
sent out together by the Holy Ghost, they brake off companie.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19974:30"/>
These be humane passions, which wisedome would we should pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
when they grow to such extremities, vpon so small cause;
rather then from their outrage to gather there is iust cause to
encrease. Doe we not see that euen naturall brethren doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
defie one another, and vse each other with lesse respect
then strangers? Now from hence would you conclude they bee
not brethren; and hearten them on, and say to the one, that
sith his halfe brother is not so neere to him, as he with whom he
is thus at oddes, hee must fall out worse with him. You should
well so deserue the hate of God, for a make-hate betweene bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
These were all my wordes set downe in answere to

I say then first, that to make this your motiue of any
moment, it must be shewed, that God hath appointed such
a Iudge in his Church. Let that appeare out of some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of holy Scripture. For your conceit or desire that such
a Iudge there should be, to whom you might in conscience
obey, and yeeld your selfe, because he could not err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, doth
not proue it. You would know the Truth, onely by the
authoritie, and sole pronouncing of the Iudges mouth. A
short and easie way, which to most men is plausible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it spares the paines of studie and discourse. To such
especially, as either out of weaknesse dare not trust their
owne iudgement, or account it shall haue the merit of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie,
to bee led by their Teachers. But what now if
God will haue you <hi>call no man your Father vpon earth?</hi> If he
will send you to his Word? and after you haue receiued the
Faith by the Churches testimonie out of the easie and
plaine places thereof, bid you <hi>search the Scriptures,</hi> to finde
the Truth in the remnant, and pick it out by your owne
industrie.<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> The rich man being in hell torments (in whose
wordes I doubt not but our Sauiour doth impersonate and
represent the conceits of many men liuing in this world)
presumes that if one were sent from the dead his Kinsmen
would hearken to him, but he is remitted <hi>to Moses and the
Prophets.</hi> The <hi>Iewes</hi> as I perceiued by speech with some of
them at <hi>Venice,</hi> make it one of their motiues, that our
Lord Iesus is not the Christ. <hi>He should not,</hi> say they, <hi>haue
come in such a fashion, to leaue his owne Nation in doubt and

Let vs therefore consider the necessitie of this
Iudge. Where I beseech you consider (for I am sure you
cannot but know it) that <hi>all things necessary to saluation are
euidently set downe in holy Scripture?</hi> This both the Sciptures
themselues doe teach, and the Fathers auouch, namely
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> and Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and others. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to set downe their words, or further to confirme this
<hi>Lemma,</hi> which I proued at large against another aduersarie,
and shall at all times make good if it be questioned. Besides
these points, there are a great manie other though not of
such necessitie, yet euidently laid downe also in the same
Scriptures, by occasion of them. Manie by iust discourse
may be cleared from these, and the former. If any thing
yet remaine in suspence, and vnknowne, yea or if you will
erred in, so it be not wilfully and obstinately, yet shall it
be euer without perill of damnation to him that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> receiueth
what the holy Ghost hath plainely deliuered. What ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
then of your imaginarie Iudge? Yes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Vnitie is
a goodly thing, not onely in matters necessarie, but vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally
in all. Controuersies must not bee endlesse. But
how comes it to passe then that your Iudge, whosoeuer hee
be, doth not all this while decide the question touching the
Conception of the Blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> that is betweene the
<hi>Dominicans,</hi> and <hi>Franciscans,</hi> nor that betweene the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans</hi>

Church beene in possession of so easie and sure a Court to

Withall I must tell you thus much, that this preparation
of minde in a Scholler, as you are, in a Minister, yea in a
Christian, that had but learned his Creed, much more
that had from a childe knowne the holy Scriptures, that

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>at length you heard a sound of harmony and consent,
that in the Catholike Church, as in Noahs Arke was infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19974:35"/>
and possibilitie of saluation; which occasioned you to seeke
out, and to enter into this Arke of Noah.</hi> The sound of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and infallibilitie is most pleasing and harmonious,
and vndoubtedly euer and onely to bee found in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Church, to wit, in the rule of Faith, and in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures, and such necessarie doctrine as perfectly
concordeth with the same. But as in song many discords
doe passe in smaller notes, without offence of the eares, so
should they in smaller matters of opinion in the Church,
without the offence of iudicious and charitable mindes.
Which yet I speake not to iustifie them; nay, I am verily
of the minde, that this is the thing that hath marred the
Church musicke in both kindes, that too much libertie is
taken in descant to depart from the gound, and as one

perhaps thinke this proceeds from an affectation of

seemes to bee embased by alledging reason, or Scripture,

wherein Gods Word is written; all which are necessarie
to an able Interpreter. And therefore it is a wise reserued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in them, not to intermedle with that wherein they

What followes in conclusion? <hi>Ergo, No true Church.</hi>
This shortnesse in suppressing the verbe, would make a
man thinke you ment to couer the fault of your discourse.
And indeede you might by that meanes easily beguile ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but I cannot be perswaded you would willingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
your selfe. Sure you were beguiled, if you ment it
thus. <hi>Ergo, it is no true Church.</hi> See your Argument in the

may lye by his owne grant. <hi>Ergo,</hi> no faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
He that stands vpright cannot fall: but you <hi>Master
Waddesworth</hi> by your owne grant may fall, <hi>Ergo,</hi> stand not
vpright. Perhaps your meaning was, <hi>Ergo, it may become no
true Church,</hi> to wit, when it shall so erre damnably. But
then it followes not, <hi>There is now no saluation in it, and
therefore come out of it now.</hi> When you shew that, I shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
you haue done wisely to goe out of it. Shew that in
anie one point, and take me with you. In the meane while,
for my part, I shall sooner trust that chapman that shall say
to me, Loe here is a perfect yard, I will measure as truely
as I can, and when I haue done take the yard and measure
it your selfe; then him that shall say here is thus much, yee
shall not neede to measure it, but take it on my word: yea
though one of his Apprentices should stand by and say, he
could not deceiue mee though hee would; as <hi>Benedictus a

non potes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where you relate, <hi>your endeauour to defend the Church of
England, and tell of the Puritanes reiecting those Arguments
you could vse from the authoritie of the Church, and of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Doctors interpreting Scriptures against them, flying to their
owne arrogant spirit:</hi> I cannot excuse them for the former,
nor subscribe to your accusation in the latter. Perhaps you
haue met with some more fanaticall Brownists or Anadap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
whom here you call Puritans. But these that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
so called, which differ from the Church of England
about Church gouernment and ceremonies onely, giue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19974:43"/>
to little to the authoritie of men, how holy, learned,
or ancient soeuer. Which is their fault, and their great fault,
especially in matters of this nature; yet they flye not to
their owne spirit as you charge them.</p>
               <p>That which you adde <hi>that you perceiued the most Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
did frame the like euasions when you came to answere the
Arguments against them on the other side;</hi> when you shall
shew this in particulars, I shall beleeue it. In the meane
while I beleeue you thought so; for commonly mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are aggrauated with the hatred, &amp; slandered with the
names of both extreames. But in the question betweene
the Popish faction and vs, you might easily haue discerned
why the argument from <hi>bare authoritie,</hi> is not of such vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie.
For ceremonies and matters of order may be ordered
by wise men, &amp; are not the worse, but the better if they be
ancient, yea if they be common to vs with Rome, which
Puritans will by no meanes allow. In doctrin, if holy men,
yea <hi>if an Angell from heauen</hi> shall innouate any thing, wee
are not to admit it. Now the controuersies betweene the
Romanists and vs, are most about doctrine, and they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
as much in extolling the authoritie of the ancients in
their priuate opinions and incommodious and strained
speeches, as the Puritans in depressing them. We hold the
meane, and giue as much to the authoritie and testimonies
of the Fathers, as may stand with the truth of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and as themselues deferre to the writing of others, or
require to be giuen to their owne.</p>
               <p>Next you tell, of your <hi>following their opinion who would
make the Church of England and the Church of Rome still to
be all one in Essentiall points, and the differences to be acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.
Confessing the Church of Rome to be a true Church, though
sicke, or corrupted, and the Protestants to be derined from it, and
reformed.</hi> This opinion is not onely as you write <hi>fauoured
of many great Schollers in England,</hi> but is the common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the best Diuines of the reformed Churches that
are or haue beene in the world, as I shewed in part of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19974:44"/>
worke, which as I remember you had a sight of. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
yet I feare you mistake the tearme, <hi>accidentall,</hi> which
doth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> import that our differences are but sleight and of
small confideration, but that all those opinions and abuses
which we reforme and cut off, are not of the Faith, but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oraine, yea hurtfull and noisome to it, as the
weedes are to the corne, which ouer-grow and choake it.
And to follow this similitude, the state of the Church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Romane obedience, and that part which is refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
is like a field ouergrowne all with weedes, thistles,
tares, cockle: some part whereof is weeded and clensed,
some part remaines as it was before; which makes such a
difference to the view, as if it were not the same corne. But
being better considered, it will be found all the difference
is, from the weedes, which remaine there, and here are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away. Yet neither here perfectly, nor all where a like,
but ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ording to the industrie of our weeders, or conuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of the worke, with care of the safetie of the good corne.
By this Parable, you may see what is to be hoped of <hi>your
labour to reconcile most of our particular controuersies.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I doubt not but in some it may be performed,
where the difference is rather <hi>verball</hi> then <hi>reall;</hi> and in the
manner of teaching, rather then in the substance of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And if moderate men had the matter in handling
the flame of contention in a great many more might be
troden downe and slaked, suppose the sparkes not all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct;
yet in some other, it is as possible to make the weede
and corne-friends, as your and our opinions; where there is
none other remedy but that of our Sauiour, <hi>Euery plant that
my heauenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted out.</hi> Neither
doth this impossibilitie arise more out of the nature of the
things, then the affection of the persons. For the Pope and
the Court of Rome, which are those that domineere on
that side, doe no lesse out of the feare of their owne ruine
deadly detest all reformation, then the reformed out of
their present view and former feeling, the tyrannie of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19974:44"/>
Papacie, which they see doth excommunicate, and put to
cruell death all that are of this way. And which is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
thing, where they tolerate the blasphemous and
professed enemies of Christ, euen with allowance of the
publike exercise of their Religion, there doe they burne
men professing Christs religion, according to the ancient
and common rule thereof, with that vprightnesse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that if they had as many liues as there be Articles
thereof, they would giue them all rather then renounce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Protestants making the Pope Antichrist,</hi> I know
it is a point that inrageth much at Rome. But if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> if Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Reuelation, describe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
so, as they that doe but looke vpon the Pope well,
must be forced to say as the people did of the blinde man
in the Gospell, some, <hi>this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himselfe and his flatterers doe, and speake such things, as if
all others should hold their peace, doe in a sort proclaime, <hi>I
am he;</hi> what can the Protestants doe with the matter? I
will take the liberty here to relate to you, what I saw
while I was in <hi>Venice,</hi> the rather because it is not imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to our present purpose. And though perhaps you
may haue heard somewhat of it, yet the particulars are I
suppose vnknowne in those parts. And yet it doth more
import they were knowne there then otherwhere, being
occasioned by a subiect of the Crowne, though of a name
and family whereto it is not much beholding.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1608. <hi>F. Thomas Maria Carafa,</hi> of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19974:45"/>
included in the forme of a Tower, and dedicated with an
Epistle to the present Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> the fift, to whose armes
alluding he saith, <hi>idem Draco biceps qui vtrumque polum am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexus

Hesperidum hortos peruigil excubat, nullius Herculis vim me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuens,

was this representation curiously and largely cut. An
Altar, with two Columnes, and their ornaments, according
to the rules of Architecture. In the middest for the Altar
peece was the Popes picture, very liuely portraied to the
breast. Ouer his head was the word, <hi>Vultu portendebat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium.</hi>
Aboue on the toppe of the front, in three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiments
his armes thus. On the one side the spread
Eagle alone, the word <hi>Ipse mihi fert tela pater.</hi> On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Dragon, and by it <hi>Meliora seruo.</hi> In the middest both
together in one scutchion with the crosse Keyes and triple
crown in the crest. On either side of these colums were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
Crownes and Scepters, whereof sixe were on the
right hand after the Christian fashion. The Imperial aboue,
other vnderneath, and lowest the <hi>Corno of the Duke of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
so they call a certaine Cap the Prince vseth to weare
being of Gold Embroderie, and somewhat resembling a
horne. There were also Turkish <hi>Turbanes,</hi> and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dems
of diuers fashions, as many on the left side. By
these on either side of the columnes, were two of the foure
parts of the world. <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Afrike</hi> on the one, <hi>Asia</hi>
and <hi>America</hi> on the other, in the habite of Ladies sitting
vpon their proper beasts couchant, each offering vnto him
that was aboue the Altar of their commodities, Corne,
Fruits, Incense, &amp;c. On the base of the columne on the
Christian and Europaean side, was the word, <hi>Et erunt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
nutritij tui.</hi> On the other, <hi>Vultu in terram demisso pulue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
pedum tuorum lingent, Esai.</hi> 49. Agreeable whereto
there was made flying ouer their heads two Angels, on

the picture of the Pope, on the foreside of the <hi>Altar,</hi>
was this inscription, PAVLO V. VICE DEO CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIANAE
REIP. MONARCHAE INVICTIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIMO
ET PONTIFICIAE OMNIPOTENTIAE
CONSERVATORI ACERRIMO. The Copies of
these <hi>Theses</hi> were sent as Nouelles from <hi>Rome,</hi> and did the
more amuse men at <hi>Venice,</hi> because of the controuersie that
State had with the Pope a little before, and the seeing their
Dukes <hi>Corno</hi> hanged vp among his Trophees, vnder all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes Crownes. But most of all the new title <hi>Vice-Deo,</hi>
and the addition of <hi>Omnipotencie</hi> gaue matter of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
The next day it was noised about the Citie, that this

and shamelesse a flatterie to come forth, with publike

to the ouer-sight of the Writers or Printers. Thirdly, if it bee

by them that were appointed to ouer-see and correct it, what
maruell if one word escaped them, through negligence, or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse,

But the Pope, such is his modestie, neuer vsurped this

this, let it first bee considered, that the Censors of such

Babes, as not to know what will please or displease his
Holinesse. Especially in writings dedicated to himselfe, a

and after some exception and scandal taken at it, but what

Towne of Bologna, and when his Chaplaine could not bee
allowed to print it at home. But to let all these goe; wee
may haue a more sensible proofe how the Pope tastes these
Titles. That which hee rewards hee approues: <hi>Benedictus</hi>

the matter being come to the knowledge of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants

Amongst them there is one said to be a <hi>true Relation of the

Roman faith,</hi> indited as it is said and subscribed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
before his death. In which by a certaine Father of the

was vsed, as it is said, to him. <hi>That hee should consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
well, that he and other Protestants did not denie that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
might be saued in their faith, whereas all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
that either liued at the present, or euer were, hold it as a
most certaine Article of Faith, that the Protestants and other
heretickes cannot be saued out of the Catholicke Church; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if he should become a Catholike, he should enter into that way
which was safe, by the consent of both parts. This consideration
be saith moued him not much then. But after praying to God, as
he was also aduised by that Father, to direct him into the right
way, if hee were out of it, suddenly hee saw a certaine light very
clearely before his eyes in forme of a crosse. Whereupon inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
there was offered vnto him such a heape of reasons and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
by which was shewed that the Catholike faith is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way of saluation, and that of the Protestants on the contrarie
most absurd and abominable, that most euidently he was conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
without any the least doubt.</hi> And <hi>these reasons which then
offered themselues to him, were for the most part such as hee did
not remember that he had euer heard them in all his life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
with vnspeakeable ioy he called backe the Father, told him
what had hapned, praied him to heare his confession, and he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
him vpon all the heads of the Catholike religion, which
he most firmely and entirely beleeued, heard his confession, &amp;c.</hi>

I tell you here what I haue heard from the mouth of one

the truth of this matter, and had no reason to tell me a lye,

sure; you haue iustified the cause of the Protestants in
the maine question, which is the better religion. For
whatsoeuer a Protestant holds, as of Faith, you cannot
deny to bee good and Catholike, nor any Christian man
else. For hee binds him to his Creed, to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and goes no further: and in these he hath your te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
for him. But hee denies many things which you
beleeue, and accounts them forreine, yea repugnant to
Faith, as <hi>the Popes infallibilitie, Transubstantiation, Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
worshipping of Images, inuocation of Saints.</hi> In all these
you speake onely for your selues, in some of these you
haue not vs onely, but all other Christians your oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,
to say nothing of the Iewes and Turkes, whom I
might as well chocke you withall, as you doe the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
with Anabaptists. So by this reason our profession
is more safe and secure, and questionlesse is more <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>
then yours. Neither haue wee in this discourse the

               <p>This to the proposition. Let vs come to the Assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where you mince too much the Protestants opinion
touching the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when you make them say,
<hi>It is peraduenture faultie in some things:</hi> Nay without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture,
they say, It is corrupt in doctrine, superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Idolatrous in religion, tyrannicall in gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

defiled in manners, from the crowne of the head to

is false in the assumption, that <hi>the Puritans denie the Church
of England to bee a true Church.</hi> Vnlesse the Puritans and
Brownists bee with you all one, which you haue made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Sects aboue, and then are you to blame as to multiply
names (whereof I haue told you) before, so now againe to
confound them.</p>
               <p>What is now the Conclusion? <hi>It would be more safe and
secure to become a Roman Catholike.</hi> But the Proposition wil
not inferre thus much simply, but onely in this respect.
For Topicall arguments (as you know) hold onely, <hi>caeteris
paribus.</hi> We must then inquire if there be no other intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
arguments by which it may bee discerned, whether
cause bee the better, whether pretence to the Church and
Truth, more iust, more euident. Whether it may bee war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
to returne to Babell, because God hath some people
there; when as he commands those that are there to come
out of it. How safe it may bee willingly to ioyne with
that part of the Church, which is more corrupt in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Manners, when wee may continue with that
which is reformed. These points were to haue been scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
ere you concluded and executed as you did.</p>
               <p>And such Arguments there want not. Christ our
Lord hath giuen vs amongst others, two infallible
Notes to know his Church. <hi>My Sheepe,</hi> saith hee,<note place="margin">Iob 10. 27.</note>
                  <hi>heare my voice:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 13. 35.</note> and againe, <hi>By this shall all men knowe
that yee are my Disciples if yee loue one another.</hi> What
shall wee stand vpon coniecturall Arguments from that
which men say? We are partiall to our selues, malignant
to our opposites. Let Christ bee heard who bee his, who
not. And for <hi>the hearing of his voice,</hi> O that it might be the
issue! But I see you decline it, Therefore I leaue it also for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19974:51"/>
the present. That other is that which now I stand vpon:
<hi>the badge of Christs sheepe.</hi> Not a likelihood, but a certaine
<hi>token,</hi> whereby <hi>euery man</hi> may know them. <hi>By this,</hi> saith
he, <hi>shall all men know that yee are my Disciples, if yee haue
charitie one towards another.</hi> Thanks be to God: This marke
of our Sauiour is in vs, which you with our Schismatikes,
and other enemies want. As <hi>Salomon</hi> found the true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by her naturall affection, that chose rather to yeeld to
her Aduersaries plea clayming her childe, then endure it
should bee cut in peeces, so may it soone bee found at this
day, whether is the right Mother. Ours, that saith, <hi>giue
her the liuing child, and kill him not;</hi> or yours, that if shee
may not haue it, is content it bee killed, rather then want
of her will. <hi>Alas,</hi> saith ours, euen of those that leaue her,
<hi>these be my children, I haue borne them to Christ in Baptisme, I
haue nourished them as I could with mine owne breasts his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments.
I would haue brought them vp to mans estate, as
their free birth and parentage deserues. Whether it bee their
lightnesse or discontent, or her enticing wordes and gay shewes,
they leaue me, they haue found a better Mother. Let them liue
yet, though in bondage. I shall haue patience; I permit the
care of them to their Father; I beseech him to keepe them that
they doe none euill; if they make their peace with him, I am sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
they haue not hurt me at all. Nay but,</hi> saith yours, <hi>I sit
alone as Queene and Mistris of Christs family;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reuel. 18. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>hee that hath
not me for his Mother, cannot haue God for his Father. Mine
therefore are these, either borne or adopted: and if they will not
bee mine they shall bee none.</hi> So without expecting Christs
sentence, shee cuts in peeces with the temporall sword,
hangs, burnes, drawes those that shee perceiues inclined
to leaue her, or haue left her alreadie. So shee kils with the
spirituall sword, those that subiect not to her, yea thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands

how easily may testimonies bee alleaged cleane besides the

Too much heat in contention, and desire of victorie, blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the iudgement, and maketh a man heedlesly lay hold
vpon any thing, that hee thinkes may serue his turne. As
wee see sometimes in the writings of the Fathers, which
had to deale with ancient Heretikes, alleaging the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
themselues besides the purpose. Sometimes haste and
desire of contracting makes one cut off some wordes, and

besides these thirtie, noted so many other plaine false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
and manifest wilfull lies, as might well double the
former number. And by Arithmetick hee multiplies this
number with the number of the leaues, the number hee
saith will rise to 30000. by which <hi>Iohn Fox</hi> his booke will
as much exceede <hi>Iohn Sleidans</hi> storie in number of lies (in
which were found onely 11000) as it doth in bulke and
bignesse. This manner of writing of these men, brings to
my minde that which Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> writes of <hi>Tyndals
New Testament,</hi>

The language is like, and the cause is the same. Men were
loath these bookes should be read. The substance of them
was such as could not be controlled; the next remedie was
to forestall the Readers mindes with a prejudice of falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that so they might not regard them, but cast them
out of their hands of their owne accord. The Vulgar sort
would be brought out of conceit at the first hearing, with
vehement accusation. Euen wise men would suppose
though there should not bee any thing neere so many wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
faults, yet surely there must needes bee a very great
number, and that could not happen but with a very bad
meaning; this admitted, who would vouchsafe them the

without any <hi>multiplication</hi> or other <hi>Arithmeticke,</hi> in the fift
page of that Relation of his, in the seuen first lines are foure
notorious, I will not say <hi>lies</hi> or <hi>falsifications,</hi> but falshoods
by tale. The first: <hi>That the triall being begun vpon the first
place, that was found false.</hi> The French discourse printed at
Antwerp <hi>cum priuilegio,</hi> and approbation of the Visitor of
bookes, saith: <hi>And as to the said first Article, nothing was
iudged thereabout by the said Commissioners, nor pronounced by
my said Lord the Chancellor, and the King said that it should be
remitted to another time to deliberate thereabout.</hi> The second:
<hi>Hee</hi> (that is, <hi>Plessis) would haue passed to the second, but the
Bishop refused so to doe, except the Ministers and Protestants
there present would first subscribe and testifie that this first
place was falsified.</hi> Hee said in the page before, that <hi>Plessis
appeared at last with some foure or fiue Ministers on his side.</hi>
There were no Ministers appeared with him on his side.
No Protestants, no creature did subscribe, or was required
so to doe. The third: <hi>Which at length they did, viz.</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe,
this place was falsified. A vtter vntruth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there is not a word in the said printed Narration. The
fourth: <hi>as well in this as in all the rest.</hi> There was no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
as I said, at all. The Commissioners were all of
the Roman profession, sauing <hi>Causabon;</hi> and he no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
They neuer pronounced, much lesse subscribed that
any of those places examined were <hi>falsified.</hi> Of the first
place of <hi>Scotus</hi> they pronounced nothing. Of the second,
of <hi>Durand, That the opposition of Durand was alleaged for
the resolution.</hi> And this they would haue remitted also as
the former to another time, saue that the Bishop insisted,
saying, <hi>it was in vaine to dispute if they would not iudge,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
his speech diuers times to the King, to the intent
hee should signifie his pleasure to the Commissioners; and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19974:53"/>
then his Maiestie drawing neere to them, they gaue their
opinions vpon that Article as before. This was that which
F. <hi>Parsons</hi> stumbled at when hee wrote, <hi>The Ministers and
Protestants there present subscribed and testified, that it was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified,
and so all the rest.</hi> For being ouerioyed with this
newes which hee did not well vnderstand (to thinke the
charitablest of him) hee thought the Commissioners had
beene part at least Protestants, and Ministers: and had
subscribed, whereas they pronounced their sentence <hi>viua
voce,</hi> by the mouth of the Chancellour, neuer vsing the
tearme <hi>falsification;</hi> yea in some of the rest they acquited
the L. of <hi>Plessis,</hi> as in <hi>the passage of P. Crinitus</hi> though they
said <hi>Crinitus</hi> was deceiued. In that of <hi>Bernard, that it had
beene good to distinguish the two passages of Saint Bernard out
of the same booke with an et caetera.</hi> Not to stand now vpon
that, that in the rest of the places he hath a reasonable and
iust defence with indifferent men, for the omissions he was
charged with in <hi>Chrysostome, Hierome, Bernard,</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorit:</hi>
and in that of <hi>Cyril,</hi> the King himselfe said aloud,
that <hi>both sides had reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but F. <hi>Parsons</hi> not hauing as it

of this affaire, was so hastie to write according to the

himselfe in the same kinde, that hee imputes to another.
And if he should meete with some seuere aduersarie, that
would multiplie his falsehoods by his leaues and lines, as
he dealeth with Master <hi>Fox,</hi> and then extend by proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his pamphlet to the bignesse of Master <hi>Fox his Booke of
Martyrs,</hi> he would finde, that he prouides very ill for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
that is to rigorous and censorious to other men.</p>
               <p>But I leaue him, and come to the fidelitie of the Popish

about 300. yeares after Christ are counterfeited.</hi> The Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
not <hi>Latine</hi> but lead of the stile, and the likenesse of
them all one to another, the deepe silence of antiquitie
concerning them; the Scriptures alleadged after <hi>Hieromes</hi>
translation, doe conuince them of falshood. And by whose
practice and procurement we cannot doubt, if wee aske

That the authoritie promised by our Sauiour Christ to Saint
Peter vnder the metaphor of the Keyes is meerely spirituall. <hi>For

the authoritie of the highest Bishop is ouer sinne and ouer soules

whereunto all comes at last, but no voyce must be

is, that <hi>Bertramus Presbyter</hi> is appointed by your Spanish

is, <hi>and that purp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For my part, I cannot say that I haue spent many houres
in the triall of this point, nor haue I had ancient Copies
thereto requisite. But I will intreat you to consider with
mee one example, or rather two or three in one Father,
and in the matter that I named, whereby you may ghesse
at the rest. In Saint</hi> Cyprians <hi>Workes imprinted at Rome,
by</hi> P. Manutius, sent for to Venice by Pius the Fourth, to set
forth the Fathers, as himselfe saith, most perfectly clensed from
all spots, <hi>the Epistle of</hi> Firmilianus Bishop of Caesarea, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi>
Accepimus per Rogatianum, <hi>is wholly left out;
and</hi> Pamelius <hi>thinkes purposely, and addes,</hi> perhaps it had
beene more wisdome it had beene neuer set out at all. <hi>Saint</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian
<hi>was not of that minde, who translated it into Latin,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19974:56"/>
as the stile it selfe witnesses, and</hi> Pamelius <hi>also is enforced
to confesse. The matter is, it is to quicke and vehement
against</hi> Stephanus <hi>Bishop of Rome. Hee saith</hi> hee is moued
with iust indignation, at the manifest folly of Stephanus, that
boasting so much of the place of his Bishopricke, and that hee
hath the succession of Peter, vpon whom the foundations of the
Church were set, brings in many other Rockes, &amp;c. Hee saith
hee hath stirred vp contentions and discords throughout the
Churches of the whole world. Bids him not deceiue himselfe, he
hath made himselfe a Schismaticke, by separating himselfe from
the Communion of the Ecclesiastical vnity, for while he thinks he
can separate all from his communion, he hath separated himselfe

and in those vessels, neither was the Lords true body, nor
yet the mystery thereof.</hi> Well, if they be not to the purpose,
if they speake of the vessells of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple, let them
stand in the Text still. What need yee purge them out of
the newer editions at Antwerpe, and Paris. Belike Father
<hi>Iohn Matthews</hi> saw further into this matter then <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
for hee casts out this sentence with the dregs of the
Arians, although there bee no Arianisme in it that I can
perceiue. The truth is, the Author speakes of the Vessels
vsed in the Lords Supper in his owne time. For those
wordes, <hi>sicut docet Balthasar, &amp;c.</hi> are brought in by the
way, for a confirmation from a like example, the sense
hanging in the meane while, which is resumed againe
when hee goes on, <hi>Si ergo haec vasa,</hi> as any indifferent
Reader may perceiue. Yea, take away these words, &amp; the
sinewes of the sentence are cut, for the force of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lies in the comparison of the prophaning of the holy
vessels, and of our bodies; That is a sin, yet Christs body
is not contained in them, but the mystery therof: but God
himselfe dwels in these.</p>
               <p>These examples, to omit some other, doe make mee
thinke, that howsoeuer the corrupting of the texts of the

not slipped. And who knowes not, that sometimes the

So for proofe of the veritie of Christs Bodie and Bloud in

if he be of a plyable disposition, or loath to bee counted

               <p>As touching that which you say <hi>of the Centurists often

any fault, it is, that they are to rigid and strict, referring
into this Catalogue, euery improper and excessiue speech,
which being seuered from the rest of the discourse, may
often seeme absurd: as it may also seeme strange that our
Sauiour should teach a man <hi>to hate his Father and Mother,</hi>
or <hi>pull out his eyes,</hi> or <hi>giue him his cloake that hath bereaued
him of his coate.</hi> Whereas these and the like haue in the
place where they stand, admirable force and grace, being
taken with an equall and commodious interpretation. But
it is are cleare as the noone day, that sundry such errors
and singular opinions there be in the Fathers, as cannot

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rptures. <hi>II.</hi> He interprets the place of
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> touching the trying of euery mans worke by fire, of
the fire of tribulation, through which as well he that builds gold
and siluer, that is, mindes the things of God, as he that builds
hay and stubble, that is, too much mindes the things of this life
must passe. <hi>III.</hi> He saith that it is not incredible, that some
such thing is done after this life also; and whether it be so or not,
may be enquired of. <hi>IIII.</hi> But whether it be found or no, that
some faithfull people, according as they haue more or lesse, loued
these perishing things, are later or sooner saued: yet not such as
of whom it is said, that they shall not possesse the Kingdome of
God, vnlesse repenting as they ought, they obtaine forgiuenesse;
as for the purpose, be fruitfull in almes; which yet will not serue
to purchase a licence to commit sinne. <hi>V.</hi> That the daily and
lighter sinnes, without which we are neuer in this life, are blotted
out by the Lords Prayer. And so the greater also, if a man
leaue them, and forgiue others his enemies; which is a worthy
kinde of almes: but the best of all is a sinners amending of his life.
<hi>Loe how plainly Saint</hi> Augustine <hi>auo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cheth Purgatorie,
Of which he doubts whether any such thing can be found
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19974:62"/>
or no. Expounds that Scripture that seemes most strong
for it, all otherwise, and so as it cannot agree thereunto. If
it be found, is sure it will not serue for greater sinnes. And
for lesser defects, yea the greatest shewes, another a surer
remedy, which intruth makes Purgatory superfluous. In
this doctrine,</hi> Danaeus <hi>is so farre from controuling Saint</hi>
Augustine, <hi>that he applauds him; and saith,</hi> that declaring
his owne opinion of Purgatorie, he pronounceth plainely, that the
whole defining of this matter is vncertaine, doubtfull, and rash;
which since that <hi>Augustine</hi> wrote being now an old man, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
it cannot be doubted but that hee did altogether reiect
Purgatorie: yea and he shewes this fire it selfe to be vnprofitable.
<hi>Thus</hi> Danaeus <hi>there. But the censure that was in your
minde, I beleeue is that vpon another passage of Saint</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
<hi>in the same Booke, where hee treates,</hi> whether the
soules of the dead are eased by the pietie of their friends that are
liuing. <hi>And thus he determines it.</hi> That when the Sacrifices
either of the Altar, or of whatsoeuer almes are offered for all
such as are deceased after Baptisme, for such as are very good
folke, they are thankesgiuings; for such as are not very euill, they
are propitiations: for those that are very euill, though they be
no helpes to the dead, yet they are consolations, such as they be to
the liuing. And to such as they are profitable vnto, it is either
that they may haue full remission, or that their very damnation
may be more tollerable. <hi>Vpon this Chapter thus saith</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>The title of the Pope is here to bee noted.</hi> And indeed,

<hi>hee is a God.</hi> The word <hi>scilicet</hi> might haue taught them
thus much. Yea, the title <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> which in
those dayes, and almost two ages after, was a Pagan
terme, neuer attibuted to a Christian Bishop, first laid
downe by <hi>Gratian</hi> the Emperour, as <hi>Baronius</hi> also notes,
in the yeere of our Lord, 383. because it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Heathenish superstition, though it had beene, as a title of

<hi>Tertullians</hi> meaning; vnlesse the immoderate desire of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting
the Papacie did so blind their eyes, that seeing,
they saw, and yet perceiued not. In the same character,

saith, <hi>hee speakes here of those Bishops that were in the
Councell of Carthage; and that the Bishop of Rome is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in that sentence, who is indeed Bishop of Bishops.</hi> What!
and doth hee tyranniously inforce his Colleagues to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
also. For it is plaine that <hi>Cyprian</hi> ioynes these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19974:64"/>
the one as the presumptuous title, the other as the
iniurious act answering thereto, which hee calls plaine
<hi>tyranny.</hi> And as plaine it is out of <hi>Firmilianus</hi> Epistle, which
I vouched before, that <hi>Stephanus</hi> Bishop of Rome heard
ill for his arrogancie and presuming vpon the place of his
Bishopricke, <hi>Peters Chaire,</hi> to seuer himselfe from so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Churches, and breake the bond of peace, now with
the Churches of the East in <hi>Asia,</hi> now of the South in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke.</hi>
And hee was in as ill conceit with <hi>Cyprian</hi> for his
breaking good order, and communicating with <hi>Basilides</hi>
and <hi>Martialis</hi> iustly depriued in Spaine; as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>
was with him, when he stiled him, <hi>a false Christ,</hi> and <hi>a false
Apostle.</hi> But the holy Martyr was of a more patient and
calme spirit, then to be moued with such reproaches; nay,
hee tooke occasion, as it should seeme, thereby to write <hi>of
patience.</hi> From this mildnesse it was, that hee so closely
taxed the presumption of him, that made himselfe Bishop
of Bishops, and by terror (which what it was <hi>Firmilianus</hi>
Epistle shewes, threatning Excommunication) would
compell his Colleagues to his owne opinion. <hi>None of vs</hi>
saith he, <hi>doth thus.</hi> As the Apostle, <hi>we preach not our selues;
we commend not our selues; Wee are not as many, that adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

the promise made to this Church, <hi>of victory against the

<hi>the body of Christ, his Doue, his vndefiled,</hi> are not verified of
this Church in the whole visible bulke of it, but in those
that are called according to Gods purpose, giuen to
Christ, and kept by him to bee raised vp to life at the last

                  </gap>,
which it would bee too tedious to set downe at large. In
his third booke, <hi>De doctrina Christiana,</hi> among the rules of
<hi>Tychonius,</hi> there is one which hee corrects a little for the
tearmes, <hi>De Domini corpore bipertito;</hi> which he saith, ought
not to haue beene called so, <hi>for in truth that is not the Lords
body, which shal not be with him for euer, but he should haue said
of the Lords true body and mixt, or true and fained, or some
such thing. Because not onely for euer, but euen now, hypocrites
are not to be said to be with him, though they seeme to be in his
Church.</hi> Consider those resemblances taken out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture, <hi>wherein that godly Father is frequent, of chaffe
and wheat in the Lords floore, of good and bad fishes in the net,
of spots and light in the Moone. Of the Church carnall and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19974:65"/>
of the wicked multitudes of the Church, yet not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
in the Church. Of the lilly and the thornes; those that
are marked which mourne for the sinnes of Gods people, and the
rest which perish, which yet beare his Sacraments.</hi> Consider
the last Chapter of the booke, <hi>De Vnitate Ecclesiae,</hi> and
that large Treatise which he hath of that matter, <hi>Epist.</hi> 48.
The place is long, which deserues to bee read, for the
obiection of the Vniuersality of Arianisme (like to that of
Papisme in these last ages) which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres

Gods purpose, of whom it is said, The Lord knoweth who are his,

Out of these and many more like places, which I forbeare
to mention, it appeares, that albeit the true Catholike
Church is such as cannot bee hid, yet considering that it
consists of two sorts of people, the one, which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part, who doe not indeed properly belong to it: the
other, the fewer, truely and properly so called, to whom all
the glorious things spoken of the Church doe agree. The
face therefore of the mixt Church may be ouer-run with
scandals,<note place="margin">De Vnitate Eccl. <hi>c.</hi> 24. Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. in Psal. 103. com. 1.</note> as in all times almost. The greatest number may

teachers, as the Priests and Prophets in <hi>Ieremies</hi> time: the

<hi>before I come to answere your Argument shortly
coucht in forme, I must endeuour to reforme your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in sundrie points of storie, wherein partly you are
misse-led and abused by</hi> Parsons <hi>and others of that spirit,
partly you haue mistaken some particulars, and out of a
false imagination framed a like discourse. First for</hi> Luther,

those affaires, it is acknowledged, that at the first, and for
a good time he shewed all obedience, and reuerence to the
Pope. The new</hi> Historie of the Councell of Trent, <hi>written
by an</hi> Italian <hi>a subiect and part of the Church of Rome, as
should appeare by the Epistle Dedicatorie of the</hi> Reuerend
and learned Archbishop of Spalato, <hi>prefixed to his Maiestie,
speaketh thus of the matter.</hi> Questo diede occasione, &amp;c.
This gaue occasion to <hi>Martin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> to passe from Indulgences to the
authoritie of the Pope, which being by others proclaymed for the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19974:67"/>
highest in the Church, by him was made subiect to a Generall
Councell lawfully celebrated. Whereof hee said that there was
neede in that instant, and vrgent necessitie. And as the heat of
disputation continued, by how much the more the Popes power
was by others exalted, so much the more was it by him abased,
yet so as <hi>Martin</hi> contayned himselfe within the termes of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
modestly of the person of <hi>Leo,</hi> and sauing sometimes his
iudgement.<note place="margin">Pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Againe,</hi> After his departure from the presence of
Cardinall <hi>Cajetan</hi> at Augusta, <hi>hee saith,</hi> hee wrote a letter to
the Cardinall, confessing that hee had beene too vehement, and
excusing himselfe by the importunitie of the Pardoners, and of
those that had written against him, promising to vse more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie
in time to come, to satisfie the Pope, and not to speake any
more of Indulgences, prouided that his aduersaries would doe
the like. <hi>This was</hi> Luthers <hi>manner at the first, till the Bull
of Pope</hi> Leo <hi>came out, dated the ninth of Nouember,</hi> 1518.
Wherein he declared the validitie of Indulgences, and that hee
as <hi>Peters</hi> Successor and Christs Vicar had power to grant them
for the quicke and dead; that this is the doctrine of the Church
of Rome, the Mother and Mistris of all Christians, and ought
to bee receiued of all that would bee in the Communion of the
Church. <hi>From this time forward</hi> Luther <hi>began to change
his stile,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

reserued the person and iudgement of the Pope, so after this
Bull he resolued to refuse it, and thereupon put forth an Appeale

Princes of Almaine before they tooke armes against the
Emperour, demanded of</hi> Martin Luther <hi>if it were lawfull. He
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19974:68"/>
answered freely that it was not lawfull, whatsoeuer tyrannie, or
impietie were pretended. He was not beleeued; so the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was miserable, and drew after it the ruine of great and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
houses of Germanie.</hi> As for <hi>the warre in Germanie</hi> it
began not till after <hi>Luthers</hi> death, neither was it a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of the Protestants; the truth is they stood for their
liues. The Emperour with the helpe of the Popes both
mony and armes, intended to roote them out; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
at the first the Emperour did not auow his raysing
armes against them to be for Religion, yet the Pope in his
Iubilee published vpon this occasion, did not let to declare
to the world, that <hi>himselfe and Caesar had concluded a league
to reduce the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Church, and therefore all should pray for the good successe of
the warre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Luther</hi> euer <hi>reuiled the Emperour,</hi> I did neuer till
now heare or reade, and therefore would desire to know
what authors you haue for it. Touching other Princes,
namely, King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eighth, I will not defend him,
who condemned himselfe thereof. It is true that he was
a man of a bold and high stomacke, and specially fitted
thereby through the prouidence of God, to worke vpon
the heauie and dull disposition of the <hi>Almaines,</hi> and in so
generall a <hi>Lethargie,</hi> as the world then was in, hee carried

               <p>As to his <hi>Vow-breaking</hi> lastly, if that Vow were foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly
made and sinfully kept, it was <hi>iustly</hi> broken: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

touching his <hi>rancour against the Dominicans,</hi> for it is his

very phrase. But Master <hi>Harding</hi> both in this, and many
things else discouereth his passion, and lack of true infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in this affaire. When with one breath he affirmeth,
that, first, it was <hi>a Pardon of a Croisade against the Turkes</hi>
which was preached whereas it was <hi>an Indulgence to those
that should put their helping hands for the building of Saint
Peters Church at Rome,</hi> as the Articles of this Pardon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in English, one of the Copies whereof I haue my selfe,
doe shew. Secondly, next hee saith the preaching hereof
was granted <hi>to Friar Iohn Tetzet.</hi> It was Friar <hi>Iohn Thecel,</hi>
or <hi>Tecel.</hi> Thirdly, hee saith, <hi>the Elector of Mentz</hi> Albert
<hi>granted this to</hi> T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecel <hi>and the Dominicans,</hi> whereby <hi>Luther
was bereft of the gaine hee exspected.</hi> The truth is, it was
<hi>Aremboldus</hi> a Bishop liuing at the Court of Rome, whom
(hauing before been a Merchant of Genoa) <hi>Magdalen</hi> the
Popes sister put in trust with this merchandize, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the <hi>Dominicans</hi> to bee the retaylers of these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons.
The Archbishop of <hi>Mentz</hi> had nothing to doe with
it, otherwise then to allow and suffer it, which occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Luther</hi> to write to him, as to the Bishop of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
and to <hi>Leo</hi> himselfe, to represse the impudence of
the Pardoners. And <hi>Luther</hi> saith further in one place, that
the Archbishop vndertooke to giue countenance to this
businesse, with that condition, that the halfe of the prey
should goe to the Pope, and himselfe might haue the other
halfe to pay for his Pall. By these errors hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is, for any that liued at that day to set downe what was in
<hi>Luthers</hi> heart, what were his hopes, his desires, rancour,
and spleene; much more for Master <hi>Harding,</hi> most of all
for you and mee. When the actions of men haue an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of good, Charitie would hope the best, Pietie
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19974:69"/>

               <p>Let vs come <hi>to Caluin,</hi> touching whom I maruell not
much that <hi>you say nothing of all that which Bolseck brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

discouereth as I remember in the verie enetance, that
hee was requested <hi>by some of his good Masters to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him.</hi> I once saw the book while I liued in <hi>Cambridge;</hi>
it hath no shew of probabilitie that <hi>Caluin</hi> would goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to worke a miracle to confirme his doctrine, who
teacheth that miracles are no sure and sufficient proofe of
doctrine. I maruell rather that euen in reading Doctor

since, <hi>Sleidan, Bodine, Caluins</hi> Epistles, and life, but set down

speaking of <hi>Caluin. Hee fell at length vpon Geneua, which
Citie the Bishop and Clergie thereof, had a little before, as some
doe affirme, forsaken, being of likelyhood frighted with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
sudden attempt for the abolishment of Popish Religion.</hi> And
a little after. <hi>At the comming of Caluin thither, the forme of
their Regiment was popular, as it continueth at this day, &amp;c.</hi>

Doctor <hi>Bancroft. The same yeere that Geneua was assaulted
viz.</hi> by the Duke of Sauoy, and the Bishop, as he had said
before, Page 13.) <hi>which was Anno 1536. Master Caluin
came thither.</hi> If <hi>Caluin</hi> at his comming found the forme of
the gouernment popular, If hee came thither the same
yeere that the Bishop made war vpon Geneua to recouer
his authoritie, being indeede either affrighted, or hauing
forsaken the Towne before, how could <hi>Caluin</hi> expel him?
And in truth <hi>Bodine</hi> in his second Booke, <hi>De Rep.</hi> Chapter
sixt, affirmeth, <hi>That the same yeere Genoa was established in a
State Aristocraticall, which was, hee saith, Anno 1528. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua
was changed from a Monarchy Pontificall, into an Estate
Popular, gouerned Aristocratically, although that long before
the Towne pretended to bee free, against the Earle, and against
the Bishop, &amp;c.</hi> What <hi>Sarauia</hi> hath written touching this
point I cannot tell, as not hauing his Booke. But in <hi>Beza</hi>
his answere to him, there is no touch vpon any such thing.
He ioynes with his complaint, <hi>of the sacrilegious vsurping
Ecclesiasticall goods,</hi> in answere to his Proême. He dissents
in that <hi>Sarauia</hi> accounts the <hi>Seniors of the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
like to that kinde which Saint Ambrose speakes of, brought
in out of wisdome onely, to rule the disorderly. Beza</hi> saith, they
were not <hi>introducti,</hi> but <hi>reducti, Cap.</hi> 12. For the rest in all
that answere there is nothing of <hi>Caluin,</hi> or any such <hi>reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing</hi>
of the state as you accuse him of. Which makes mee
thinke, that herein your memorie deceiued you. It may
be that in your younger time, falling vpon these Authors,
by occasion of the question of Discipline, which was then
much tossed, ere euer your iudgement were ripened, you
formed in your minde a false impression of that which
they say of <hi>Caluin.</hi> You conceited them out of your zeale
in the cause, to say more then they do, &amp; thus possible vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares
receiued the seeds of dislike of the <hi>doctrine of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi>
as well as <hi>his discipline,</hi> which haue since taken root in
you. But you shall doe well to remember, the difference
you put a little before of these two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christian <hi>doctrine</hi> is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19974:70"/>
vniforme and euer the same; <hi>gouernment</hi> is changeable in
many circumstances, according to the exigence of times
and persons. And euen the same men that write some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
eagerly against Master <hi>Caluin,</hi> yet giue him the
pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se <hi>of wisdome</hi> to see what for that time and state was
necessarie. Master <hi>Hooker</hi> saith of him, <hi>That he thinkes him
incomparably the wisest man that euer the French Church did
enioy since the houre it enioyed him,</hi> and of his platforme of
discipline, after hee hath laid downe the summe of it.
<hi>This deuice I see not how the wisest at that time liuing could
haue bettered, if wee duely consider what the present state
of Geneua did then require.</hi> But bee it (and for my part I
thinke no lesse) that herein hee was mistaken, to account
this to bee the true forme of Church policie, by which all
other Churches, and at all times ought to bee gouerned;
let his error rest with him, yea, let him answere it vnto his
Iudge; but to accuse him of ambition, and sedition, and
that falsly, and from thence to set that brand vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
whereof he was a worthy instrument (though
not the first either there, or any where else) as if it could
not bee from God, being so founded; for my part I am
afraide you can neuer bee able to answere it, at the same
Barre; no, nor euen that of your owne conscience, or of
reasonable and equall men.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>stirres, broiles, seditions, and murthers in Scotland,
which you impute to Knox and, and the Geneua Gospellers,</hi> they
might be occasioned perhaps by the reformers there, as
the broiles which our Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

set in the world by the Gospell. Possible also, that good
men out of inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>siderate zeale, should do some things rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And like enough the multitude which followed them,
as being foreprepared with a iusthatred of the tyrannie of
their Prelates, and prouoked by the opposition of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse

further then either wise men could foresee, or tell how to
restraine them. Which was applauded and fomented by
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19974:70"/>
some politicke men, who tooke aduantage of those mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to their owne ends. And as it happens in naturall
bodies, that all ill humors runne to the part affected, so
in ciuill, all discontented people when there is any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
runne to one or other side; and vnder the shew of
common griefes, pursue their owne. Of all which distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
there is no reason to lay the blame vpon the seekers
of reformation, more then vpon the Phisitians, of such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
as happen to the corrupted bodies which they
haue in cure. The particulars of those affaires are as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
alike vnknown to vs both, and since you name none,
I can answere to none. For as for the <hi>pursuing our King
euen before his birth,</hi> that which his Maiestie speakes of
<hi>some Puritans,</hi> is ouer-boldly by you referred to Master
<hi>Knox and the Ministers,</hi> that were authors of Reformation
in Scotland. Briefely, consider and suruey your owne

First, from the inconsiderate courses of some to plant the
pretended <hi>Discipline</hi> in Scotland, to conceiue amisse of the
<hi>Doctrine</hi> also. Then to draw to the encreasing of your ill
conceit thereof, what you finde reported of any of the

of any faction is the slander of all, yea of <hi>the Gospell</hi> it selfe,

               <p>From <hi>Scotland</hi> you come to <hi>England.</hi> Where because
you could finde nothing done by popular tumult, nothing
but by the whole state in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and Clergie in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,</hi>
you fall vpon <hi>King Henries passions,</hi> you <hi>will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist

one member of your induction, though it matters little
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19974:71"/>
whether you doe or no, since F. <hi>Parsons</hi> will needes auerre
that hee liued and died of your religion. Here first you
mention, his <hi>violent diuorcing himselfe from his lawfull wife.</hi>
Wee will not now debate the question how his Brothers
wife could bee his lawfull wife: you must now say so.
Whatsoeuer the Scriptures, Councels, almost all Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Christendome determined. Yet mee thinkes it
should moue you that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> himselfe had consig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Cardinal <hi>Campegius</hi> a <hi>Breue</hi> formed to sentence for
the King, in as ample manner as could be, howsoeuer vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the successe of the Emperours affaires, in Italie and his
own occasions, he sent a special messenger to him to burn
it. But what violence was this that you speake of? The

<hi>Canterbury</hi> with the assistance of the learnedest of the

is more to be maruelled at, what <hi>moued him to fall out
with the Pope</hi> his friend in whose quarrell he had so far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
himselfe, as to write against <hi>Luther,</hi> of whom also
he was so rudelie handled as you mention before; hauing
receiued also for some part of recompence, the title of <hi>the
Defender of the Faith,</hi> hauing beene so chargeablie thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the Pope for it. All these things considered, it must
be said, this vnkindnesse and slipperie dealing of <hi>Clement</hi>
with him was from the Lord, that hee might haue an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
against the Pope, and that it might appeare that it
was not humane counsell, but diuine prouidence that
brought about the banishment of the Popes tyrannie
from among vs. His marriage with the Ladie <hi>Anne

abling or disabling her issue to inherit the Crown, I see not
what it makes to our purpose. <hi>The suppression of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,</hi>

and wholly,</hi> for religion. But the words going before, and
the exigence of your argument require, that your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

You bring to my minde a story, whether of the same <hi>Fim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria</hi>

<hi>Flanders,</hi> that those <hi>Geuses</hi> that you mention, were not all
Caluinists (as you are mis-informed) the chiefe of them
were Romane Catholikes; as namely, Count <hi>Egmond,</hi> and
<hi>Horne,</hi> who lost their heads for standing, and yet onely
by petition, against the new impositions, and the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

the people would by no meanes abide, but rose vp in
Armes to the number of 50000. which sedition could
not bee appeased, but by deliuering them of that feare.
The like resistance, though more quietly carried, was
made when the same Inquisition should haue beene put
vpon <hi>Millaine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1563.</note> sixteene yeeres after. Yet these people

are bound to giue their throates to bee cut by their
fellow subiects, or to their Princes at their meere wills
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19974:73"/>
against their owne Lawes and Edicts? You would know,
<hi>quo iure,</hi> the Protestants warres in France and Holland are
iustified. First, the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> which not onely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
but inclineth and inforceth euery liuing thing, to
defend it selfe from violence. Secondly, that of <hi>Nations,</hi>
which permitteth those that are in the protection of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to whom they owe no more but an honourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement,
in case they goe about to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
absolute Souereignes, and vsurpe their libertie, to
resist and stand for the same. And if a lawfull Prince
(which is not yet Lord of his Subiects liues and goods)
shall attempt to despoile them of the same, vnder colour
of red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the person of the Prince himselfe, ought alwaies to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
and inuiolable, as was <hi>Sauls</hi> to <hi>Dauid.</hi> Lastly, if the
inraged Minister of a lawfull Prince, will abuse his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
against the fundamentall Lawes of the Countrie, it is
no rebellion to defend themselues against force, reseruing
still their obedience to their Souereigne inuiolate. These
are the Rules of which the Protestants that haue borne
Armes in France and Flanders, and the Papists also both
there and elsewhere, as in <hi>Naples,</hi> that haue stood for the
defence of their liberties, haue serued themselues. How
truely I esteeme it hard for you and mee to determine, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we were more throughly acquainted with the Lawes
and Customes of those Countries, then I for my part am.
Once for <hi>the Low-Countries,</hi> the world knowes that the
Dukes of <hi>Burgundy</hi> were not Kings or absolute Lords of
them, which are holden partly of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi>
and partly of the Empire. And of Holland in particular
they were but Earles. And whether that title carries with
it such a Souereigntie, as to bee able to giue new Lawes,
without their consents, to impose tributes, to bring in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19974:73"/>
of strangers, to build Forts, to assubjects their honors
and liues to the dangerous triall of a new Court, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>without forme or figure of iustice,</hi> any reasonable man
may well doubt; themselues doe vtterly denie it.</p>
               <p>Yet you say boldly <hi>they are Rebels,</hi> and aske <hi>why wee did
support them?</hi> It seemes to some that his <hi>Catholike Maiestie</hi>
doth absolue them in the treatie of the Truce, <hi>An.</hi> 1608.
of all <hi>imputation of rebellion.</hi> And if they were Rebels, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for heresie, why did the most Christian King sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them? As for Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> if shee were aliue,
shee would answer your question with another. <hi>Why did
Spaine concurre in practice and promise aide to that detestable
conspiracie that was plotted against her by Pius V.</hi> as you may
see at large in his life, written by <hi>Girolamo Catena?</hi> It is,
you say, <hi>an easie matter to pretend priuiledges.</hi> But it is no
hard matter to discerne pretended priuiledges from true,
and <hi>Treason</hi> from <hi>Reason</hi> of State, and old corruptions
from <hi>old Religion.</hi> But to take armes to change the Lawes
by the whole Estate established, is treason whatsoeuer the
cause or colour be: and therefore is was treason in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire in King <hi>Henries</hi> dayes,
and in the Earles <hi>of the North</hi> in Queene <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> though
they pretended their old Religion: and the same must bee

Princes, as <hi>Parryes, Someruilles, Squires,</hi> against Queene

               <p>To your Argument therefore in forme, admitting <hi>that
it is no true Church, which is founded and begun in malice,
disobedience, passion, bloud, and rebellion,</hi> no nor yet a true
reformation of a Church (for in truth the Protestants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not to haue founded any.) The Assumption is denyed
in euery part of it. And here I must needes say you haue
not done vnwisely to leaue out the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as
against which you had no pretence, all things hauing been
carried orderly, and by publike counsell. But you haue
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19974:74"/>
wronged those which you name, and either lightly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
or vnjustly surmised your selfe, touching <hi>Luther, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,
Knox,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> when you make
them the <hi>raysers of rebellion and shedders of bloud.</hi> Whose
bloud hath beene shed like water in al parts of those coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
against all Lawes of God and Man against the Edicts
and publike Faith, till necessitie enforced them to stand
for their liues. Yet you presume that all this <hi>is euident</hi> to
the world, whereas it is so false and improbable, yea in
some parts <hi>impossible,</hi> as I wonder how your heart could as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
your hand to write it.</p>
               <p>Giue me here leaue to set down by occasion of this your
motiue, that which I professe next to the euidence of those
corruptions which the Court and faction of Rome main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes,

Your next is well worse, <hi>touching the Ordination at the
Nags-head, where the Consecration of our first Bishops, as
you say was attempted, but not effected. It is certaine, you say,
and you are sure there was such a matter, although you know,
and haue seene the records themselues, that afterward there was
a Consecration of Doctor Parker at Lambeth.</hi> Alas Master
<hi>Wadesworth,</hi> if you bee resolued to beleeue lies, not onely
against publike Acts, and your owne eye-sight, but
against all probabilitie, who can helpe it? I had well ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to haue found that ingenuitie in you, that I might
haue vsed your testimony vnto others of that side, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the vanitie of this fable, as hauing shewed you the
Copie of the record of Doctor <hi>Parkers</hi> consecration,
which I had procured to bee transcribed out of the Acts,
which your selfe also at your returne from <hi>London,</hi> told
mee you saw in a blacke Booke. Now I perceiue by your
perplexed writing, and enterlining in this part of your
Letter, you would faine discharge your conscience, and
yet vphold this lie, perhaps, as loth to offend that side
where you now are: and therefore you haue deuised this
temper, that the <hi>one was attempted,</hi> the other <hi>effected.</hi> But
it will not bee. For first of all, if that at the Nags-head
were but <hi>attempted,</hi> what is that to the purpose of our
Ordinations, which are not deriued from it, but from the
other, which as you say was <hi>effected</hi> at <hi>Lambeth?</hi> And are
you <hi>sure there was such a matter?</hi> How are you sure? Were
you present there in person, or haue you heard it of those
that were present? Neither of both I suppose: but if it
were so that some bodie pretending to haue beene there
present told you so much, how are you sure that hee lied
not in saying so; much more when you haue it but at the
third, or fourth hand, perhaps the thirtieth or fortieth. But
consider a little, is it probable that men of that sort, in an
action of that importance, and at the beginning of the
Queenes reigne, when especially it concerned both them
and her to prouide, that all things should bee done with
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:19974:77"/>
reputation, would bee so hastie and heedlesse, as to take a
Tauerne for a Church? Why might they not haue gone to
the next Church as well? They thought to make the old
Catholike Bishop drunken. Thus the <hi>Wisbich and Framyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
Priests</hi> were wont to tell the tale. Is it likely that
they would not forethinke that possible this good old
man would not drinke so freely as to bee drunken, and if
hee were, yet would not be in the humour to doe as they
would haue him? for who can make any foundation vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what another would doe in his cups? What a scorne
would this bee to them? Men are not alwaies so proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in their actions. True, but such men are not to bee
imagined so so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tish, as to attempt so solemne an action,
and ioyned commonly with some great feast, and as you
obserued well out of the Acts, with the Queens mandate
for the action to be done, and hang all vpon a drunken fit
of an old man. Besides, how comes it to passe that wee
could neuer vnderstand the names of the old Bishop, or
of those whom hee should haue consecrated, or which
<hi>consecrated themselues, when hee refused to doe it.</hi> For so doe
your men giue it out; howsoeuer you say, <hi>it was not there
effected.</hi> And in all the space of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reigne,
wherein so many set themselues against the reformation
by her established, is it possible wee should neuer haue

This proofe by <hi>Tradition</hi> as you know is of little credit
with Protestants, and no maruell: for experience shewes
that reports suffer strange alterations in the carriage, euen
when the reporters are not interessed. <hi>Iremeus</hi> relates from

                  <hi>which had seene Iohn the Disciple, and
the other Apostles of the Lord,</hi> and heard it from them, that
<hi>Christ our Sauiour was betweene fortie and fiftie yeeres of age
before his passion.</hi> I doe not thinke you are sure it was so.
For my part, I had rather beleeue. <hi>Irenaeus and those ancients</hi>
hee mentions, and the Apostles; then F. <hi>Haliwood</hi> and his
<hi>Confessors,</hi> and Master <hi>Neale.</hi> But possible it is, M. <hi>Neale</hi>
said, <hi>hee was present at Matthew Parkers ordination by Iohn
Scory.</hi> These <hi>Confessors</hi> being before impressed, as you are,
with the buzze of the ordination at the <hi>Nags-head</hi> made

and so was scandalized though causelesly, at that action.
Perhaps Master <hi>Neale</hi> neuer said any such word at all. To

duely and orderly done according to the Law or not, &amp;c.</hi> And
shortly to cut off <hi>F. Halywoods</hi> surmises, the case was
this, as may bee gathered by the bodie of the Statute.
Whereas in the fiue and twentieth of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight,
an Act was made for the <hi>electing and consecrating of Arch-bishops
and Bishops within this Realme.</hi> And another in the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19974:78"/>
third of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, <hi>for the ordering and consecrating

to such forme as by sixe Prelates, and sixe other learned
men in Gods Law to bee appointed by the King should
bee deuised, and set forth, vnder the great Seale of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
Which forme in the fifth of the same Kings reigne,
was annexed to the Booke of Common Prayer, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
and perfected; and both confirmed by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of Parliament. All these Acts were 1. <hi>Mariae &amp; 1.

These Acts of repeale in the 1. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were againe

That of 3. <hi>Edwar.</hi> 6. onely concerning the Booke of
Common Prayer, &amp;c. without any particular mention of
the booke or forme of ordering Ministers and Bishops.
Hence grew one doubt, whether ordinations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations
according to that forme were good in Law or
no. Another was, Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in her Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents

Thirdly, That all that haue beene <hi>ordered or consecrated
Archbishops, Bishops, Priests, &amp;c. after the said forme
and order, be rightly made, ordered, and consecrated, any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
Law, Canon, or other thing to the contrary notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi>
These were the reasons of that Act; which as you
see doth not make good the <hi>Nags-head</hi>-ordination as
<hi>F. Halywood</hi> pretends, vnlesse the same were according to
the forme in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth dayes. His next proofe is,
that <hi>Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er Bishop of London while hee liued, alwayes set light
by the Statutes of the Parliaments of Queene Elizaboth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging
that there wanted Bishops, without whose consent by
the Lawes of the Realme there can no firme Statuee bee made.</hi>
That <hi>Boner</hi> despised and set not a straw by the Acts of
Parliament in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, I hold it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
and yet there is no other proofe thereof, but his
bare word, and the ancient <hi>Confessors tradition,</hi> of which
we heard before. Admitting this for certaine, there might
bee other reasons thereof, besides the ordination at the
<hi>Nags-head.</hi> The stiffenesse of that man was no lesse in
King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, then Queene <hi>Elizabeths.</hi> And indeed
the want also of Bishops might be the cause, why he little
regarded the Acts of her first Parliament. For both much
about the time of Queene <hi>Maries</hi> death dyed also <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Poole,</hi> and sundry other Bishops: and of the rest some
for their contemptuous behauiour in denying to performe
their dutie in the Coronation of the Queene were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to prison, others absented themselues willingly.
So as it is commonly reported to this day, there was none
or very few there. For as for Doctor <hi>Parker</hi> and the rest,
they were not ordained till <hi>December,</hi> 1559. the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was dissolued in the <hi>May</hi> before. So not to stand
now to refute <hi>Boners</hi> conceit, that according to our
Lawes there could bee no Statutes made in Parliament
without Bishops (wherein our Parliament men wil rectifie
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19974:79"/>
his iudgement) <hi>F. Halywood</hi> was in this report twice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
or would deceiue his Reader. First, that he would
make that exception which <hi>Boner</hi> laid against the <hi>first Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, to be true of all the rest.
Then, that he accounts B. <hi>Boner</hi> to haue excepted against
this Parliament, because the Bishops there were no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
as not canonically ordained: where it was, because
there was no Bishops true or false there at all. His last
proofe is. That <hi>D. Bancroft being demanded of M. Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>blaster,
whence their first Bishops receiued their orders? answered, that
hee hoped a Bishop might bee ordained of a Presbyter in time of
necessity. Silently granting, that they were not ordained by any
Bishop:</hi> and therefore, saith he, <hi>the Parliamentary Bishops are
without order Episcopall, &amp; their Ministers also no Priests. For
Priests are not made but of Bishops, whence Hierome.</hi> Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit,
&amp;c. <hi>What doth a Bishop, sauing ordination, which a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doth not?</hi> I haue not the meanes to demand of D. <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaster,</hi>
whether this be true or not. Nor yet whether this
be all the answere he had of D. <hi>Bancroft.</hi> That I affirme,
that if it were, yet it followes not, that D. <hi>Bancroft silently
granted they had no orders of bishops.</hi> Vnlesse he that in a false
discourse, both where propositions be vntrue, denies the
Maior, doth silently grant the Minor. Rather he iested at
the futilitie of this Argument, which admitting all this ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Legend of the Nags-head, and more to; suppose <hi>no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
by any Bishops had beene euer effected,</hi> notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
shewes no sufficient reason why there might not be
a true consecration, and true Ministers made, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
a true Church in England. For indeed necessitie
dispences with Gods owne positiue Lawes,<note place="margin">Mark <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </note> as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
shewes in the Gospel much more then with mans:
and such by <hi>Hieromes</hi> opinion are the Lawes of the
Church, touching the difference of Bishops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and consequently touching their ordination by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
onely. Whereof I haue treated more at large in
another place, for the iustification of other reformed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19974:80"/>
Churches, albeit the Church of England needs it not. To
confirme this Argument, it pleaseth <hi>F. Halywood</hi> to add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>That King Edward the Sixth, tooke away the Catholike rite of
ordaining, and in stead of it, substituted a few Caluinisticall
prayers.</hi> Whom Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> followed, &amp;c. And this
is in effect the same thing which you say, when you adde,
<hi>that Couerdale being made Bishop of Exceter in King Edwards

it is very doubtfull hee was neuer himselfe canonically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated,

that King <hi>Edward</hi> tooke not away the Catholike rite of
ordaining, but purged it from a number of idle and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
rites prescribed by the Popish Pontifical. And the

deuising. To you, if you name what Councells and
Church Canons you meane, and make any certaine excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
either against Bishop <hi>Couerdale,</hi> or any of the rest
as not canonicall Bishops, I will endeauour to satisfie
you. Meane while remember I beseech you, that both
Law, and reason, and Religion should induce you in
doubtfull things to follow the most fauourable sentence,
and not rashly out of light surmises to pronounce against
a publike and solemne ordination, against the Orders
conferred successiuely from it, against a whole Church.

Chichester, and at the time of the said ordination <hi>Elect of

And these foure, if they were all ordained according

by two Bishops at least to the Archbishop, and of him
and them receiued imposition of hands, as in the said forme
is appointed.</p>
               <p>One scruple yet remaines which you haue, in <hi>that these
men did consecrate Doctor</hi> Parker <hi>by vertue of a Breue from
the Queene, as head of the Church who being no true head, and
a woman, you see not how they could make a true consecrationr
grounded on her authoritie.</hi> But to cleare you in this also,
you must vnderstand the <hi>Queenes mandate</hi> serued not to
giue power to ordaine (which those Bishops had before
in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to apply that power to the person named in that Mandate.
A thing, vnlesse I haue beene deceiued by reports, vsed in
other Countries, yea in the Kingdomes of his Catholike
Maiestie himselfe. Sure I am by the Christian Emperours
in the primitiue Church, as you may see in the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
histories, and namely, in the ordination of <hi>Nectarius,</hi>
that I spake of before. Yea, which is more in the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
of the Bishops of Rome, as of <hi>Leo</hi> VIII. whose
Decree, with the <hi>Synode</hi> at Rome touching this matter, is
set downe by <hi>Gratian, Dist. 63. c.</hi> 23. taken from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

                  <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, <hi>Ius &amp; potestatem eligendi Pontificem, &amp;
ordinandi Apostolicam sedom,</hi> as you may see in the Chapter
next before. See the same <hi>Dist. c. 16. &amp; 17. &amp;</hi> 18. and you
shall finde,<note place="margin">C. Lectis.</note> that when one was chosen Bishop of Reate,
within the Popes owne Prouince, by the Clergie and
people,<note place="margin">C. Reatina.</note> and sent to him by <hi>Guido</hi> the Count to be consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the Pope durst not doe it till the Emperours licence
were obtained. Yea, that hee writes to the Emperour for
Colonus,<note place="margin">C. Nobis.</note> 
                  <hi>that receiuing his licence hee might consecrate him
either there, or in the Church of Tusculum,</hi> which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon the Emperors bidding he performed.</p>
               <p>Yet another exception you take, to the making our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
that <hi>wee keepe not the right intention.</hi> First, <hi>because
we neither giue nor take Orders as a Sacrament.</hi> By that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
we should haue no true marriages amongst vs neither,
because we count not Matrimonie a Sacrament. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
depends vpon the <hi>definition of a Sacrament,</hi> which
if it be put to be <hi>a signe of a holy thing,</hi> these be both so, and
a many more then seuen. If <hi>a seale of the New Testament,</hi>
so are there but those two, which we properly call Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<note place="margin">Lib. 4. dist. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> In which last, as
to <hi>the intention of sacrificing,</hi> surely, if yee allow the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Master of the Sentences, that <hi>it is called a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
and Oblation, which is offered and consecrated by the
Priest, because it is a memorie and representation of the true
Sacrifice and holy immolation made on the Altar of the Crosse.</hi>
And, that <hi>Christ once dyed on the Crosse, and there was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp in himselfe, but is daily offered vp in a Sacrament,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>in the Sacrament there is a remembrance of that which

<hi>Churches intention,</hi> wee want not this intention of sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.
Adde to this the confession of <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> who
saith, the <hi>Lutherans doe not wholly denie the sacrifice, but grant
a Sacrifice of thanks giuing, which they call the</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">f. Fucharisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> 
                  <hi>Eucharist:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19974:81"/>
they will haue none for sinne which they call propitiatorie.</hi> If he
had put hereto, <hi>vnlesse it bee in a mysterie,</hi> hee had rightly
expressed the opinion of the Protestants.</p>
               <p>Thirdly yee object, wee <hi>want the matter and forme with
which orders should be giuen: namely, for the matter in Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
the deliuerie of the Patena with bread, and the Chalice
with wine: in Deaconship the deliuerie of the booke of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
&amp;c.</hi> By which reason the seuen first Deacons had no
true ordination, for then there was no Gospell written to
be deliuered them. Nor those Priests whom the Pope shall
make by his sole word, saying, <hi>Esto Sacerdos.</hi> Whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
sundrie famous Canonists hold to bee well
and lawfully ordained; and <hi>Innocentius</hi> himselfe saith,
that if these formes of Ordination were not found out, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Ordainer might in like manner make Priests,
with those words, or the like: for as much as these formes
were in processe of time appointed by the Church. And if
wee list to seeke for these Metaphysicall notions <hi>of matter
and forme,</hi> in Ordination, which at the most can bee but
by <hi>Analogie,</hi> how much better might wee assigne the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
deputed to sacred functions to be the matter (as those
that contract are by your selues made the matter in matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie)
and the imposing of hands, with the expressing the
authoritie and office giuen to bee the forme? In <hi>Dionysius</hi>
though falsly called the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> yet an ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
yee shall finde nothing else; nor which I may tell
you by the way, any other orders, saue Bishops, Priests,
and Deacons.</p>
               <p>And to come to that wherein you say wee faile most of
all, <hi>the substantiall forme of Priesthood,</hi> tell mee ingenuously,
good Master <hi>Wadesworth,</hi> how doe you know that our Lord
Iesus Christ made his Apostles, or they others Priests with
this forme, which hath no mention or footstep in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
or otherwhere in holy Scripture! Nor so much as in
the <hi>Councell of Carthage;</hi> that from whence the manner
of giuing other orders is fetched, nor in <hi>Gratian,</hi> nor in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19974:82"/>
other ancient Author that I can finde, saue in the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall</hi>
onely. And is the present Pontificall of such au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
with you, as the <hi>forme of Priesthood,</hi> the <hi>substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
forme,</hi> can subsist in no other wordes then those that
bee there expressed? To omit the late turkesing whereof,
consider what <hi>Augustinus Patritius</hi> writes in his Preface
before that which at <hi>Pope Innocent VIII.</hi> his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he patched together: <hi>That there were scarce two or
three bookes found that deliuered the same thing: Quot libri
tot varietates. Ille deficit, hic superabundat, alius nihil omnino
de eâre habet, raro ant nunquam conueniunt; saepe obscuri, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicati,
&amp; librariorum vitio plerung mendosi.</hi> And in truth
in this your <hi>essentiall forme of Priesthood,</hi> the old Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals
before that which he set forth, either had other words
at the giuing of the Chalice and Paten as may seeme; or
wanted both that forme and the matter also together.
The <hi>Master of the Sentences</hi> declaring the manner of the
Ordination of Priests, and the reason why they haue the
Chalice with wine, and Paten with hosts giuen vnto
them, saith it is, <hi>Vt per hoc sciant se accepisse potestatem pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabiles
Deo hostias offerendi. Hugo</hi> in like manner, <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt
&amp; Calicem cum vino, &amp; Patenam cum hostia de mann
Episcopi, quatenus potestatem se accepisse cognoscant, placabiles
Deo hostias offerendi. Stephanus Eduensis Episcopus,</hi> in the
same wordes: <hi>Datur eis Calix cum vino, &amp; Patena cum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia,
in quo traditur ijs potestas ad offerendum Deo placabiles
hostias.</hi> So <hi>Iohannes Ianuensis</hi> in his Summe, intituled, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicon,</hi>
verbo <hi>Presbyter.</hi> If yee ascend to the higher times
of <hi>Rabanus, Alcuinus, Isidorus,</hi> you shall finde that they
mention no such matter, of deliuering Chalice or Paten, or
wordes vsed at the deliuerie; and no maruell, for in the
Canons of the <hi>fourth Councel of Carthage</hi> they found none.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19974:83"/>
which the present Pontificall prescribes, consider with
me the words of <hi>Amalarius Bishop of Triers</hi> in his second
Booke <hi>de Ecclesiast. Offic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> where in the office of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon
thus hee writes; <hi>Miror quâ de re sumptus vsus in
Ecclesia, &amp;c. I maruell whence the vse was taken in our
Church, that very often the Subdeacon should reade the Lesson
at Masse, since this is not found committed vnto him, by the
Ministry giuen him in consecration, nor by the Canonicall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
nor by his name.</hi> And straight after, <hi>Nam primaro tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore;
For in ancient time the Deacon read not the Gospell
which was not yet written; but after it was enacted by our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that the Deacons should reade the Gospell, they appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
also that the Subdeacon should reade the Epistle or Lesson.</hi>
It appeares, then that in <hi>Amalarius</hi> time, who liued with
<hi>Charles</hi> the great and <hi>Lewes</hi> his Sonne, that ridiculous
fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>me was not in the Pontificall, where the Booke of the
Epistles is giuen to the Subdeacons, and power <hi>to reade
them in the holy Church of God, as well for the quicke as the
dead.</hi> The <hi>same Author</hi> comming to speake of Deacons,
telleth of their consecration by praier, and imposition of
hands, &amp; confuteth that in the present Pontificall (which
he saith he found in a little Booke of holy Orders) made
he knowes not by what Author, <hi>that the Bishop alone should
lay hands on the Deacon.</hi> At last he addes, <hi>There is one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie
added to the Deacon,</hi> viz. <hi>to reade the Gospell,</hi> which
he saith, <hi>doth well befit him, quia Minister est.</hi> But of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerie
of the Booke of the Gospels, with authoritie to
reade the Gospell for the quicke and dead, not one word.
In the next Chapter of Presbyters hee expounds their
name, and saith further, <hi>hunc morem tenent Episcopi nostri.</hi>
Our Bishoppes haue this fashion, <hi>they annoint the hands of
Presbyters with oyle,</hi> which ceremonie he declares; touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </gap>s to that
he said before in the Deacon. Then he shewes out of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
and <hi>Hierome, that these are all one Order with Bishops,
and ought to gouerne the Church in common, like Moses with
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19974:83"/>
the seuentie Elders:</hi> as for deliuerie of Chalice and Wine,
or Paten and Host, with power to sacrifice so well for
the quicke as the dead, he makes no mention. Iudge you
whether these were thought to be the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>essentiall</hi>
forme of Priesthood in his time. Yet one Author more wil
Iname in this matter, not onely because hee is a famous
Schooleman, and one of <hi>Luthers</hi> first aduersaries, and
therefore ought to be of more account with that side, but
because he professeth the end of his writing to be, <hi>circa
Sacramentum ordinis cautos reddere, ne pertinax quisquam
aut leuis sit circa modum tradendi aut recipiendi ordines.</hi> It is

1. <hi>If all be gathered together which the Pontificals, or
which reason or authoritie hath deliuered, the nature of all the
rest of the orders except Priesthood onely, will appeare very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine.
2. The lesser Orders and Subdeaconship according
to the Master of the Sentences, were instituted by the Church.
3. The Deacons instituted by the Apostles, Act. 6. were not Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
of the Altar, but of the Tables &amp; Widdowes. 4. In Deacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
there seemes to be no certain forme for according to the old
Pontificals, the laying of hands vpon the Deacon hath no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
forme of words, but that prayer.</hi> Emitte q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

S. Sauctum: <hi>which according to the new Pontificals is to be said
after the imposition of hands. For the giuing of the Booke of the
Gospels, hath indeede a forme of words, but that impresseth not
the Character for before any Gospell was written, the Apostles
ordained Deacons by imposition of hands. 5. In the Subdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conship
also there is no Pontificall which hath not the matter
without forme,</hi> viz. <hi>the deliuery of the emptie Chalice, &amp;c.</hi>
These things with more which hee there sets downe <hi>he
would haue to serue to the instruction of the learned touching
the vncertaintie of this whole matter to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sobrietie, that is, euery man to be content with the accustomed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19974:84"/>
Pontificall of the Church wherein he is ordained. And if
ought be omitted of those things which be added out of the new
Pontificals, as for example, that the Booke of the Epistles was
not giuen, with those words (Take authoritie to reade the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
as well for the quicke as the dead) there is no neede of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
this omission by a new ordination, for such new additions
make no new law.</hi> Learne then of your owne <hi>Caietane,</hi> that
the new additions <hi>of deliuery of the Chalice with wine, and
Paten with Hosts, and authoritie</hi> to <hi>offer sacrifice for the
quick and dead make no new Law.</hi> Learn to be content with
the Pontificall of the Church, wherein you were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Wherein first is <hi>verbatim</hi> all that which your Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificals
had well taken out of the holy words of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum quorum remisseris peccata
remittuntur eis &amp; quorum retinueris retenta sunt.</hi> Which me
thinkes you should rather account to containe the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
forme of Priesthood then the former, both because
they are Christs owne words, and ioyned with that cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of <hi>laying on hands,</hi> which anciently denominated
this whole action, and do expresse the worthiest and <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallest
part of your Commission,</hi> which the Apostle cals the
<hi>Ministry of reconciliation, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 18. 19. Then, because
this office is not onely deputed to consecrate the Lords
body, but also to preach &amp; baptize (which in your Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall
is wholly omitted) in a larger, and more conuenient
forme, is added out of Saint <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 4. 1. and be thou
a faithfull dispenser of the word of God and of his holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
In the name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to that you adde, that <hi>we offer no sacrifice for the quicke
and dead,</hi> and therefore well <hi>may be called Ministers, as
all lay men are, but are no Priests.</hi> I haue met with sundry
that pull this roape as strongly the other way, and affirme
that <hi>because by the very forme of your ordination you are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Sacrificers for the quicke and dead, well may ye be Masse-Priests
as ye are called, but Ministers of the New Testament,
after S.</hi> Pauls <hi>phrase ye are none.</hi> For that office stands prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19974:84"/>
in <hi>preaching the word,</hi> whereof in your ordination
there is no word said. And as little there is in Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ure
of your sacrifice, which makes Christ not to be a Priest
after the order of <hi>Melchisedech, &amp;c.</hi> with much more to
this purpose. Where my defence for your Ministrie hath
beene this, that the forme <hi>Receiue the holy Ghost, whose
sinnes ye remit they are remitted, &amp;c.</hi> doth sufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the authoritie of preaching the Gospell. Vse you
the same equitie toward vs, and tell those hot spirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, that stand so much vpon formalities of
words, that <hi>to be a dispenser of the word of God and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacraments,</hi> is all the dutie of <hi>Priesthood.</hi> And to you
I adde further, that if you consider well the words of the
Master of the Sentences which I vouched before, how
<hi>that which is consecrated of the Priest is called a Sacrifice and
oblation, because it is a memoriall and representation of the
true sacrifice and holy offering made on the altar of the Crosse,</hi>

and ioyne there to that of the Apostle, that <hi>by that one offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

as he saith in another place, <hi>through that bloud of his Crosse

you shall perceiue, that we do offer sacrifice for the quick
and dead, remembring, representing &amp; mystically offering
that sole Sacrifice for the quicke and dead, by the which
all their fins are meritoriously expiated, and desiring that
by the same, <hi>wee and all the Church may obtaine remission of

               </p>
               <p>To the <hi>Epilogue</hi> therefore of this your last motiue, I

shall answere at the dreadfull day of iudgement, I neuer saw,
heard, or read any thing, which did conuince me: nay, which did
not finally confirme me daily more and more, in the perswasion,
that in these differences it rests on our part.</hi> Wherein I haue
not followed <hi>humane coniectures from forraine and outward
things</hi> (as by your leaue mee thinkes you doe in these your

also much comforted and assured in the possession of the
truth) but <hi>the vndoubted voice of God in his word,</hi> which is
more to my conscience then a thousand <hi>Topicall</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
In regard whereof I am no lesse assured, that if I
should forsake it I should be renounced by our Sauiour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God and his Angels, then in the holding it be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
and saued; which makes me resolue, not <hi>onely for no
hope if it were of 10000. worlds, but by the gracious assistance
of God, without whom I know I am able to doe nothing, for
no terrour or torment euer to become a Papist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You see what a large distance there is betweene vs in

you, or anie other that doth not with an euill minde

differ from that which I am perswaded is the right.
I account we hold one and the same faith in our Lord and
Sauiour Iesus Christ, and by him in the blessed Trinitie. To
his iudgement we stand or fall. Incomparably more and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19974:86"/>
of more importance are those things wherein wee agree;

it. Satisfie your owne conscience, and our common
Lord and Master, and you shall easily satisfie me. Once yet

I hope you will not be stiffe, and persist in your errour, but
confesse and condemne it in your selfe: If (as I began to say)
you finde these things to be thus; giue glorie to God, that
