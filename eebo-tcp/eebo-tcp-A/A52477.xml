            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I'M sorry for't, and beg your Pardon, like a Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Complement of his Office: but you were doom'd to fall under the Fate of your Favours to Me, and a Dedication was to light upon you, one time, or other: since the sentence was past, I thought I cou'd not execute it, with a greater justice to the trust I am engag'd in, or with more favour to you, than by bringing You upon the Stage, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a Cause, which you may so Honourably maintain: besides the present Obligation of your very good <hi>Epilogue,</hi> if I had been inclining to be merciful, made it impossible to Reprieve You any longer.</p>
            <p>This Play was put into my hands by a Man of Quality; Sink, or Swim, his Fortune was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkt in this bottom; secure in the Reputation of very good Sense, he built for the Experiment, upon the Model of the Antients, and according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the <hi>French</hi> Stage: Here is their single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Action, which does not so well agree with our dispositions to variety: An Action too, that seems intended to Instruct, rather than to Please, which the greatest part of an Audience wou'd never be
<pb facs="tcp:96349:3"/>
in the humour to thank him for neither. What he design'd, he has Masterly perform'd. And if Love (which begets all the success of the Stage) had faln into his subject, he wou'd have recommended that Passion as engagingly to the Ladies, and drawn it as near their Wishes, as any thing in Picture cou'd do. The Author had his reasons for the choice of this Story; and I have many to convince Me, that he cou'd not have fail'd in any other. You will find it written, to be Envy'd, rather than Excell'd, and in some places, with an Elevation, above the pitch of the Stage. Some things will need your Patronage, but many will deserve it; so the pleasure will recompense the pains of defending them. Sir, I am satisfi'd I shou'd not pretend to guid you, who have so many Lights of your Own, who have not only a thorow insight to Poetry in general, and can try it by its own Laws, but examin it by the rules of other Arts too, for you can discover thro' the Perspective of <hi>Painting</hi> whether the Parts are in Proportion, or no. With these qualifications, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd with the Soul of Musick too, you must be allow'd a Judge of these performances; as such, in justice to this cause, you are appeal'd to by</p>

            <l>NEW Plays have been so frequent, all this Season;</l>
            <l>We must believe You'r tir'd, and you have Reason:</l>
            <l>Some, like Rich <hi>Timons</hi> Feasts, have pleas'd your pallates,</l>
            <l>Others have prov'd, damn'd <hi>Apemantus</hi> Sallates,</l>
            <l>What e're has hapned, or how e're disgract,</l>
            <l>We hope this night to put Your Mouths in taste:</l>
            <l>The Season of the Year our Rival grows,</l>
            <l>The Country, and the Park, are constant Foes,</l>
            <l>Which to our thoughts, like Blazing Stars appear,</l>
            <l>Foretelling our worst Fate, an Empty Theatre,</l>
            <l>Empty not only of our Noble Friends,</l>
            <l>Whom Love of Wit, or Beauty, hither sends,</l>
            <l>But ev'n our Gests o'th' Gallery will leave Vs:</l>
            <l>The Emperour of the Moon, will now deceave Vs.</l>
            <l>Nay, which is stranger yet (We han't forgot.)</l>
            <l>The very Masques, will tell you they're too hot:</l>
            <l>The Poets now Spurring their jaded Brains,</l>
            <l>Write not for Summer Lawrels, but Winter gains;</l>
            <l>Winter is their Campaign, as well as Ours:</l>
            <l>Give us the Profit, be the Pleasure yours.</l>
            <l>While thus We sigh, while thus your Absense mourn,</l>
            <l>Double our joys with Hastning your Return:</l>
            <l>Since we must soon, Wee'll strive to Leave you easy:</l>

            <l>'TIs sign the Poets young: is this an Age</l>
            <l>To teach you rigid Virtue on the Stage?</l>
            <l>In good Queen <hi>Besses</hi> days 'twas well enuff:</l>
            <l>But now 'tis more Ridiculous than a Ruff.</l>
            <l>Knav'ry is grown the Nations Darling Sin,</l>
            <l>And tho' a Thousand Foreign Modes comes in,</l>
            <l>Yet (like a Shirt) that's still worn next your Skin.</l>
            <l>Twas said, the French wou'd fain Invade the Nation,</l>
            <l>And here, and there made Mighty Preparation:</l>
            <l>'Tis ev'n so Bad, 'tis hardly Worth their having,</l>
            <l>At least the <hi>Beauxs</hi> wont think it Worth their Saving:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:96349:4"/>And We shou'd treat him, as an <hi>Innovator</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who wasts his brains, in Hopes to make it Better.</l>
            <l>Ladys confess the truth, you'd all be Loath</l>
            <l>To change your several Teas for <hi>Spartan</hi> Broath,</l>
            <l>And shou'd your Lovers be oblig'd to expose</l>
            <l>Themselves abroad against their Countrys Foes,</l>
            <l>The Nation were Vndone: there must be some</l>
            <l>To make the Money Circulate at home.</l>
            <l>Shou'd <hi>Spartan</hi> Laws prevail, I'm very certain</l>
            <l>Twou'd runie many an Honest Gentlemans Fortune.</l>
            <l>The Sharpers wou'd be Damnably unwilling</l>
            <l>To have an Act to Incourage General stealing.</l>
            <l>No, no, that wou'd their Property Invade:</l>
            <l>Ioynt-Stocks are best to Manage such a Trade.</l>
            <l>Let Vs be what we are: since 'tis our Curse,</l>
            <l>Ne're to have Chang'd but once—but for the worse:</l>
            <l>And ev'n then (Nature so much prevails)</l>
            <l>For Leeks, and Slavery, we wou'd truck Our Quails.</l>
            <l>Or else what mean Non-Swearing Pulpit-Praters?</l>
            <l>Protestant Popish Plots, and Non-Associators?</l>
            <l>Our honest <hi>Spartans</hi> shou'd not show their Faces,</l>

To quit Friendship in such a Case, were no more than to rifle the Temple and Debauch a pretty Priestress; and that I've done afore now.</p>
