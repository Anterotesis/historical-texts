            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the ſtraighteſt, and ſo the ſhorteſt Rule, to compoſe differences in <hi>wayes,</hi> is to agree of ends; for delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are not duly drawne up, when the deſigne is uncertaine. Hee that hath no certaine port, hath no certain winde: Therefore it were to bee wiſhed, before wee goe too farre in <hi>Collaterall heats,</hi> and divertive retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in diverſity of Projects, that we well underſtood what Reformation of our Church doth import in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſenſe: For untill that be fore-laid, and allowed by an Univerſall Vote, it will be very eaſie for the averſe partie to blaſt all bleſſed beginnings, and to raiſe rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh to become a Rocke, or at leaſt a <hi>Remora</hi> of our Reformation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the worke in hand is not planting of a Church, laying fundamentals, nor onely the reducing of practiſes to fore-laid principles, but the perfecting and improving, <hi>cum effictis,</hi> thoſe <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> that have beene either omitted or corrupted; and in the removin<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> what doth pregnantly produce ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97353:3"/>
That ſo wee may ſecure future Relapſes by reall Clauſes conſervative.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That though the rule of <hi>Supernaturals</hi> is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, nor difficult in the neceſſaries to the beeing or well beeing of the <hi>Catholique Church;</hi> yet in relation to the better being of particular Churches, there muſt be beating out of advantages by ſerious conſideration of conſequences; not as to ſingle ſalvation, but in reſpect of common edification, as we are collectively conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a viſible ſocietie: Now the fewer deductions that wee admit, the ſafer it is, both in relation to humane reaſon, and Antichriſtian Tyranny, which runnes up all into Authority; which is brought in not onely as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiliarie, but as authentique alſo in a concurrent way.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it is very ſafe, and ſavours of a prudent and peaceable ſpirit, not eaſily to conclude many things in Governement, <hi>Iure Divino;</hi> For as fundamentals in point of beliefe are few, and fully revealed, and ſoberly to be held without any <hi>ſupplementive additionals;</hi> and the admitting of more is the cauſe of all the miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous miſeries in the Church in point of Doctrine: ſo it ſets us at a diſtance from peace, at defiance amongſt our ſelves, and diſableth all accommodation, to pitch downe a Governement <hi>Iure Divino;</hi> yea, produces ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hard charges, prejudicating the truth of God; and gives ground plauſibly to arreſt and attaint Religion, for ſuſpition of diſturbance or incroachment, by ſuch fore-ſtalling the Civill State, and rendring the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Reformation for the future impoſſible.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That though in a degenerate time, and Church, it be well and wiſely done to diſcover as much as may
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97353:3"/>
be for <hi>Information,</hi> as neceſſary to <hi>Reformation;</hi> yet wee may doe as well to be wary, that we diſcard not all wee diſlike with the ſame degree of deteſtation: So that as we have cauſe not to bleſſe all that we would have, with a <hi>Iure Divine,</hi> ſo we may finde reaſon not to blaſt all that we deſire ſhould be removed, with an Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an brand: For we are firre from peace, while wee put ill-ſounding conſequences upon other mens opinions and practiſes, or by provoking parallels, or envious aggravations, repreſent them odious. This is very hardly to be avoyded, where affaires are carried with few heads and many hands; and when they take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive worke to be their way, and that to have moſt of Juſtice which hath moſt of Primitive proceedings in it. This courſe hath coſt Chriſtendome deare, for ſeldome any Councels but fell fowle upon opinions by extreame ſentences: Now though middle Councels are ſeldome ſafe in affaires of State, yet ſeldome hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in buſineſſe of the Church.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That though it be unpleaſing, and may prove pernitious, peremptorily to lay downe a way of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> to the decrying of all others in an excluſive way; yet it is very reaſonable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the principles of a Chriſtian Church, to propoſe the deſignes <hi>Iuris Divini,</hi> coaſting in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations cloſeſt, to that which is by divine permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of approbation; as what is moſt for Chriſtian peace, freeſt from ſcandall, fulleſt for edification, moſt for the glory of God: which Rules binde not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>written,</hi> but alſo becauſe they are <hi>reaſon.</hi> And in thus doing wee ſhall bee true to the end and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97353:4"/>
reaſon of the State, which is to be a moſt Chriſtian nationall Church.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That as change is no wiſe mans choice, but h<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d chance often puts him to yeeld to it, who would never poſitively have pitched upon it for a remedy; ſo it is reaſon in alterations to take care that ſome things which are mutable, as to their originall, be not too eaſily chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon colour of <hi>Inconvenience,</hi> without ſuch a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as is as eaſily diſcovered: For as it is dangerous <gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> venter upon the inconveniences of any great alteration, ſo it will be difficult to avoid the like grievances upon the ſame grounds, becauſe if we change now evill for good, upon mens advice, why may wee not change againe for the better; and ſo we ſhall alwayes be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under the conſideration of mending: and while we complaine of Innovations, wee ſhall doe nothing but innovate.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That we ſhall doe well to diſtinguiſh upon what is to be reformed, whether the corruptions be incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Cuſtome, have colour of Law, or are meere matter of Fact, which doe riſe and fall with a faction: Diſ-uſage to carry men off inſenſibly, may be ſafe in the firſt; over-ruling by interpretation in the ſecond; and exemplary diſcountenance in the third; for where ſuch men get no heat, they will take no cold. And ſo we ſhall appeare, ſuch as ſeeke more to remove what we feare then what we hate.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That as it is a ſlip in Judgement to confound <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>things, Fact</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> in a deſtructive way, ſo it may be an errour in good deſires; and ſomething daſh our deſigne to goe direct and downe-right wayes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97353:4"/>
though to upright ends in point of Edification, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allowance of due time for men to ſee reaſon in what is laid downe as a Rule: For all ſudden depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are dangerous and offenſive, as prodigious; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be a conſideration worthy the weighing, and will prove a great aſſurance of peace, to lay foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Governement at a good latitude, that the <hi>Reformation</hi> may bee of a <hi>growing conſtitution;</hi> and ſo may beare up againſt corruption; as well underlaid by its owne good temper, and not onely ſtand or fall by the temper or diſtempers of men.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That if it be not well to goe on in provoking wayes, when tis poſſible to pacifie and ſweeten, then it is not wiſe to ſtirre many matters at once, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matters engage many men; yea, many times move more than is fit to bee removed, or to bee diſcovered moveable: Therefore in puniſhing perſons, Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers ſhall doe well to be tender of <hi>the honour of Offices;</hi> and in diſcarding Superſtition in point of places, times, and performances, take heed of foſtering prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in any of thoſe reſpects, I confeſſe tis hardly to be avoyded, but that party which is to ſuffer Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt needs for the time be neare to ruine: for many that hate the Clergies Canons and Orders, love not Gods Commandements nor Ordinances.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That though Civill States may be free from temporall turnes and intereſts in the Reformation they deſigne on the Church, yet they ſhall hardly avoid the ſuſpition of it, if the <hi>Clergy</hi> be not reſpectively called to <hi>Conſultation:</hi> Therefore it may be well, and is expected that there bee communicating not onely in a private
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97353:5"/>
way with men, whoſe mindes they know afore-hand, and it may be, have already ſuggeſted their ſence; but with ſuch alſo as are diſ-ingaged and reſolved to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved untill ſuch a time, as a publique agitation may give ground to declare their judgements; this will be of no ill influence upon the whole worke in relation to the Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That ſeeing <hi>Politique Lawes</hi> ſhould be laid in with <hi>Morall poſsibility,</hi> and multiplicity of commands makes them impoſſible, as well as the difficulty of the duties; therefore it is beleeved a good courſe not to over-lay any State with poſitive penall Lawes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſarie Oathes, diſcovering Subſcriptions, or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Ceremonies; eſpecially a Church that hath the Law of God as a perfect rule of Doctrine, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and neceſſarie Diſcipline: But let the things be few that are required, and then let them bee ſtrongly commanded. For many indifferent things have coſt too deare, having beene put on too hard upon pious and peaceable men, without any accommodation or tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Thus without caſes reſerved to an arbirrarie power, conſcientious men may bee moderately dealt with, that they complaine not of a rigorous remedy as a grievance and perſecution of mankinde.</p>
