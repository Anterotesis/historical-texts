            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
LORDS Spiritual and Temporal
Assembled in
PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHile I am paying my Obedience to your
Lordships Commands for the Printing of
this <hi>Sermon,</hi> I humbly crave leave to say something
for the clearing of my self from a Prejudice, which,
if true, would render me unfit to be so far owned by
your Lordships, as to be admitted to Preach before
You; and having done it, to be commanded to Print
my <hi>Sermon.</hi> For I cannot but take notice, that both
before and since I received that Honour from you, I
have been tax'd as being not Protestant enough, on
account of a Book, called, <hi>Considerations touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the true way to suppress Popery in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How far I was concerned in that Treatise, the
Preface to it sufficiently declares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61301:3"/>
The Book it self was Publish'd in <hi>Michaelmas</hi>
Term<note n="*" place="margin">That is, in the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers style, 1677.</note> 1676. just two years before the Popish
Plot was discovered.</p>
            <p>The design of it was proposed to me as the likeliest
Remedy at that time against the same Disease under
which we are now labouring for Life, or Death: but
it was before things were come to such a dangerous
<hi>Crisis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I saw it was much the same Design that many of
the best and most eminent Protestants, particularly <hi>Q.
Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>K. James,</hi> had at several times
countenanced, and put in practice with very good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess:
they were, next to the uniting of Protestants,
for the dividing of Papists, whose chief advantage hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
has been their Union, such as it is, and our
needless Divisions. But at that time I thought it more
proper and seasonable than ever, upon the best Iudgment
that I could make of their and our Circumstances. And
I have some reason to think I was not mistaken in this.
For now I see that at the very time when this was
brought to me, and while I was forming my thoughts
upon it, the Papists themselves were in a great appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of this very thing, as being of all other ways
the most likely to blast their hopes, and to preserve us
from that Ruine which they were then bringing upon us.
Thus <hi>Coleman</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Aug. 30. 1675.</note> at that time wrote to the Popes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternuncio,

                  </hi> set out by order of the House of Commons.</note>
               <hi>There is but One thing</hi> (saith he) <hi>to
be feared, (whereof I have a great apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,)
that can hinder the success of our Designs;
which is, a Division among the Catholicks
themselves.</hi> How dividing them? It follows, by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
to the Parliament to accord their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
to those that require it,</hi>—on <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
prejudicial to the Authority of the Pope;</hi>—and
<hi>so to persecute the rest of them with more
appearance of Justice, and ruine the one half
of them more easily than the whole Body at
once.</hi> And to shew that <hi>Coleman</hi> was not singular
herein, Cardinal <hi>Howard</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">March 1676. <hi>Ibid</hi> p. 82.</note> delivers this as their
Iudgment at <hi>Rome,</hi> where, if any where, they are
Infallible; <hi>Division of Catholicks will be the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest
way for Protestants to destroy them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being said for the Design from so good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
I have this farther to say for my self, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the last part of that Book was my own, in which I
did justifie the Reformation of this Church; and what
I wrote in that part, I am sure no Papist can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
and I think no Protestant has cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of it.</p>
            <p>I thank God I have in this whole matter the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a goad Conscience; and I hope likewise your
Lordships good opinion of my honest zeal to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb facs="tcp:61301:4"/>

farther Testimony whereof, and in obedience to your
Lordships Commands, I humbly present this following

SERMON
ON</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM cxxiv. 1, 2, 3. Verses.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>1. If it had not been the Lord who was on
our side; now may Israel say;</p>
                  <p>2. If it had not been the Lord who was on
our side, when men rose up against us;</p>
                  <p>3. Then they had swallowed us up quick,
when their wrath was kindled against us.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT Deliverance it was, upon
which <hi>David</hi> made this Psalm,
at this distance of time we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
certainly know. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it was, this we find, it
was of the People of <hi>Israel:</hi> And whensoever
it happened, we see they remembred it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
It was the manner of Gods people to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61301:5"/>
remember a Deliverance, many years, and
ages, after they had received it; and when that
particular deliverance was forgotten, yet still
they kept up their Thanksgiving to God, in a
Psalm; which being once composed for that
former mercy, might be used ever after upon
any other like occasion.</p>
            <p>The Deliverance of our Fathers on this day
was as great as ever any was that God gave the
Jews; and we come now to celebrate it, not
many ages after, but while some are yet living
that remember it; and we that have been born
since, are as sure of it, as if we had been then
living our selves: and yet, for fear it should be
forgotten in our Age, God hath been pleased to
put us in remembrance, by suffering the same
Enemy to put us in fresh Dangers, and then
sending us new Deliverances. If all this will
not affect us with a sense of what we owe to
God for his mercy, we are so far from being
like Gods ancient People, that we deserve to be
given up to strong Delusions, to a belief of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Legends, of a <hi>Cecil's Plot,</hi> and such like
sensless Fictions; which none could give credit
to, that had not first subdued his understanding
to the belief of any thing, how incredible so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
by the belief of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61301:5"/>
But if we may give any heed to our senses,
and to our reason, if we may believe the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of all men then living, if we may
judge from our own experience of the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
since; (these I think are all the ways that
we have to come to the knowledge of such
things, and it were easie to shew that all these
ways we are sure of the Gunpowder-Treason.)
As we cannot but think with horror of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that the King and Kingdom were then in, so
we cannot reflect on their Deliverance but with
the greatest admiration: We cannot think of it,
especially on this day, without a thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
to God, in such words as his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
people have left us in this Text: <hi>If it had
not been the Lord who was on our side, now may Israel
say; If it had not been the Lord who was on our side,
when men rose up against us; then they had swallowed
us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are five things to be considered in
these words, which, when they are explained,
will all be found applicable to our case.</p>
            <p>Here is first, The wrath and malice of the
enemies of Gods people; and that against <hi>Israel,</hi>
as being the people of God. 'Tis exprest in the
last words of my Text, <hi>They were wrathfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
at us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61301:6"/>
Gods enemies are so at all times, never other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
but at some times they shew it more than
at other; and that is, when they are ready to
put their malice in execution; which is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
thing in my Text.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their Conspiracy, their attempt
to execute their malice, express'd in these words,
<hi>When they rose up against us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The extreme danger of Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at the time of such an attempt; which was
so great in the Israelites case, that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
if it had not been for God, <hi>they had been
swallowed up quick.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here used, is
either <hi>whole,</hi> or <hi>raw,</hi> or <hi>alive;</hi> and it is interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all these ways by the Jewish writers. They
had eaten us <hi>whole,</hi> without chewing, saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Melech.</hi>
They had devoured us <hi>raw,</hi> saith
<hi>David-Kinchi.</hi> They had swallowed us up <hi>alive,</hi>
saith <hi>Aben-Ezra,</hi> as the Earth swallowed up
<hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> that went down alive
into the Pit.</p>
            <p>This phrase, as it signifies the greatness, and
nearness, of that danger that comes sometimes
on Gods Church; so it signifies also the eager
passionate hopes of their enemies. <hi>They had
swallowed us up quick,</hi> (saith <hi>Israel</hi> in my Text:)
They were in great haste to have us in their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61301:6"/>
that they could not forbear us till we were
dead, as one of them renders it; that they fell
upon us <hi>raw,</hi> they could not stay the dressing of
us, saith another; that they were for swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us up <hi>whole,</hi> they had not patience for
chewing, saith a third. Surely, great was their
haste, when <hi>their wrath was</hi> thus <hi>kindled against
us;</hi> and great was our danger, <hi>If God had not
been on our side.</hi> That is the fourth thing to be
considered in these words.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is the providence of God, that
watches over his people, that takes part with
them against their implacable enemies, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
them from danger, even when things are
come to extremity.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Here is a due return to God of
Thankfulness from his people; which as they
have cause for at all times, so especially upon
such a deliverance, on every thought or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. <hi>Now may Israel say,</hi> with mouth and
heart; privately, and in the Congregation; <hi>If
the Lord had not been on our side,</hi> what would
have become of us? And <hi>Now,</hi> what shall we
render to him, for being thus on our side? <hi>Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
is put for Doing in Scripture-language; all
Gods words are actions, and he expects some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like this from us: He expects that our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61301:7"/>
actions should answer our words; that what
we say in our Thanksgivings, we should do like
it in all the course of our lives; and that we
<hi>glorifie God,</hi> not only by <hi>offering praise,</hi> but by
<hi>ordering our conversation aright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are five things observed. First, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of wicked men; they are always <hi>wrathfully
displeased at us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Their endeavours to execute it;
when <hi>they rise up against us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The danger of Gods people; that
they shall <hi>be swallowed up quick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Gods providence over them, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<hi>on their side.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, Their thankfulness to God in their
grateful acknowledgment of it.</p>
            <p>Of all these, there are two things chiefly to
be considered, which I have made choice of for
my subject at this time.</p>
            <p>The first is, The malicious designs of Gods
enemies for the destruction of his people.</p>
            <p>The second is, The providence of God,
watching over his people to deliver them from
his and their enemies.</p>
            <p>Both these I shall consider; First, in other
instances: and then in the Gunpowder-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
'Tis that which perhaps of all others is the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61301:7"/>
greatest that ever was; 'tis that which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
concerns us this day.</p>
            <p>I shall shew therefore; First, how great a
danger it was, how near the point of execution,
how then God appeared for our deliverance,
how wonderful a deliverance it was; and then,
how we ought to shew our sense of it, in our
zeal for that Religion which God was so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for, and in adorning it by a life that may
be exemplary to all other Christians.</p>
            <p>The first thing that I observe, is, the malice
and spitefulness of wicked men, the enemies of
God; their proneness to hurt, and to destroy,
his Church, and all true Members of it.</p>
            <p>This, as soon as I name it, is confest on all
hands. For all parties take themselves to be the
Church of God: and the worst Sects among
Christians (in my opinion) are they that take
themselves to be the only true Church. Grant
but this, that they are the only true Church, and
they will not stick with us for my Doctrine.
They will acknowledge it, and tell us we are
instances of it; that the enemies of God, hate
his Church, and endeavour to destroy it. But
because this will signifie nothing, till it appear
who are the Church of God, or at least who are
the enemies of it; I shall determine that by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61301:8"/>
bringing it to this issue; That they who are most
given to hate, and to destroy others, especially
those others who differ from them in Religion,
they are not the Church of God, or at least,
they are so far corrupt in that particular.</p>
            <p>I might say this of Men, without any relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Church: the worse they are in other
respects, the more prone they are generally to
hate those that are better than themselves; and
to shew it, by doing them all the mischief they
are able. Whereas on the other hand, Good
men are of gracious dispositions: They may
be displeased, but not <hi>wrathfully</hi> (as it is in my
Text:) They are not prone to do mischief, but
are ready to do good, even to enemies: And
the better they are, the more they excell in these
dispositions. A good man is the only true Image
of God, who <hi>is good, and does good</hi> to all his
Creatures, even to Sinners; who is so far from
willing the death of a Sinner, that he does <hi>not
willingly grieve the children of men.</hi> Whereas
on the other hand, it is the property of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
to hate, and to hurt, and to destroy all that
come in his way. He is therefore called <hi>Abad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
and <hi>Apollyon</hi> in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> He is truly
so. He was <hi>a Murderer from the beginning,</hi> and
will be so even to the end of the world. And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61301:8"/>
by these Characters of God, and the Devil, by
their proneness to do good on the one hand, by
their proneness to do mischief on the other; by
these we are to distinguish men (as the Apostle
tells us,) 1 John 3. 10. <hi>By this the children of God
are manifested, and the children of the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It holds, we see, in particular persons; but it
is much more visible in Societies. And to this I
come next; that, of Societies of men, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
of all other, are most averse from ways of
violence and blood; especially from using any
such ways upon the account of Religion: And
among Christian Churches, where they differ
among themselves, if either of them use those
ways upon the account of Religion, they
give a strong presumption against themselves
that they are not truly Christians.</p>
            <p>There is Reason for this, because, we know
that Christ gave Love for the character by which
his Disciples were to be known, John 13. 35.
<hi>By this shall all men know that you are my Disciples,
if you have love one to another.</hi> And left men
should unchristen others first, that they may
hate them, and destroy them afterwards; Christ
enlarged his Precept of Love, and extended it
even to enemies; and not only to ours, but to
the enemies of our Religion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 43, 44.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61301:9"/>
And to enable us to live according to this
Precept, he hath given us his Spirit, whereof
this is one of the Fruits. For among the <hi>Fruits of
the Spirit,</hi> is not only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
not only the love of the Brethren, but the love
of strangers, even of enemies; as the Apostle
shews, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. On the contrary, Hatred is
one of the <hi>works of the flesh:</hi> and they that
have not the Spirit of Christ to subdue it, are
said to be <hi>hateful, and hating one another,</hi> Tit. 3. 3.
Especially to his Disciples, Christ saith, <hi>The
world hates you,</hi> John 15. 19. <hi>You,</hi> particularly,
as being Christians. And even among Christians,
<hi>He that saith he is in the light and hates his Brother,</hi>
his fellow Christian, <hi>he is in darkness still,</hi> (saith
the Apostle) 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 9. He hath a great want
of that light which belongeth to a Christian.</p>
            <p>To see the use of this Character, let any one
consider, how the Christians were treated by
the enemies of their Religion; and then let
him consider, how they used their enemies,
when they were in power: he shall find that
darkness differs not more from light, than the
persecuting <hi>genius</hi> of those enemies, from the
calm gentle spirit of Christians. I say, when
they were in power; for there is the tryal.</p>
            <p>'Tis not much to be heeded, what men do,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61301:9"/>
when they are under Authority. When the Jews
had the power to wreak their malice upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
they both killed the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> and his
Apostles, and all Christians where they durst
for fear of the Romans; they never ceased, till
<hi>wrath come upon them to the uttermost:</hi> nor even
then, for their malice lasts still, it burns inward,
and they are not able to keep it from breaking
out, sometimes, as it did here very lately, upon
an occasion of which I shall say no more in this
place.</p>
            <p>The Heathens likewise shewed their malice
against Christians, in divers cruel bloody Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,
in the very infancy of our Religion;
and when, the Blood of Martyrs being the seed
of the Church, it grew up so wonderfully, and
was so vastly numerous, that it seemed an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
work to destroy it; yet there were those
Heathen Princes that despaired not of it, even
then: especially <hi>Diocletan,</hi> and his Colleague,
who killed many thousands of Christians, only
upon the account of Religion. When the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
changed, as it did in few years after
the last Persecution; and when Christianity
was come to be the Established Religion; there
was no Heathen put to death, nor no Jew,
upon the account of Religion; till Popery pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61301:10"/>
which was as bloody as Judaism or
Heathenism. This calm gentle temper of the
Primitive Christians, which so gloriously shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
forth when they came to be in Power, was
that which lay hid in them all the times of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.
Then, they could not shew it, but in
their Profession: and so indeed they always did,
as appears by <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others, who used to
fay, and glory in it, <hi>Christianus nullius hostis,</hi> a
Christian is no mans enemy, a Christian can be
no mans enemy: do what you will to him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
him, slander him, strip and torture him,
kill all others of his Religion before his eyes;
and then let him loose, and give him power,
place him in your circumstances, he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
himself upon you.</p>
            <p>What! that humane nature could bear such
things without any resentment! it was not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible;
their enemies could not believe this;
(none could believe it, that did not feel it in
himself) till they came to see it; and then all
men believed it, and acknowledged it to be the
singular excellency of the Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>But as our holy Religion excels all others in
this admirable temper; so by this we may usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
judge who they are that excel among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Churches, when there happens any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61301:10"/>
between them; whether touching the
Faith, or the terms of Communion. They that
were the more fierce, they generally had the
worst Cause. As when the difference was about
the keeping of <hi>Easter;</hi> it was chiefly between
the Roman and the Asian Churches: The Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were content, that every Church should
keep it at what time they pleas'd, so themselves
might be allowed to keep it as they had always
done; for they held the precise time to be (as
truly it was) an indifferent thing: The Romans
would not allow that, they were for imposing
on other Churches, and for breaking Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with them that would not receive their
Impositions; Which, as it argued in them a
proud and wrathful disposition; so even by
that it appeared they had the worst of the Cause.
In like manner, in that heat between <hi>Cyprian</hi>
and <hi>Stephen,</hi> where neither of them was right
in the Cause; for (as it commonly happens
when men contend) the Truth lay between
them; yet sure St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was in the right in
this, in holding that this cause was not sufficient
to break Communion between Churches: And
there Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> was in the wrong; for he did
break Communion about it; he denied <hi>jus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitii,</hi>
he would not receive a message, he would
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61301:11"/>
not hear of an Accommodation. I forbear to
repeat the ill terms he gave St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> you
may read them in the end of <hi>Firmilian</hi>'s Epistle.
We all allow that <hi>Cyprian</hi> was truly a Saint. 'Tis
well they own him such in the Roman Church.
But how they can make that Pope so too, I do
not understand; for it is plain, that to his death
he would not allow that Saint to be a Christian.</p>
            <p>The great power of Error, in moving mens
Passions, and enraging them against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of Truth; and the power of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
in composing mens Passions on the other
hand; both these did appear, as soon as ever a
Heresie came to have Publick Authority on
its side. It was the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie that was newly
broke forth before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and
that Council was called to suppress it; which
they did, by no other force, but putting <hi>Arians</hi>
out of their Bishopricks; They could not think
Hereticks fit to be trusted with the Cure of
Souls; But otherwise, as to Temporal things, I
do not find that they inflicted any kind of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment:
But when the <hi>Arians</hi> came to have
the Power in their hands, when theirs was come
to be the Imperial Religion; then, Depriving
was nothing, Banishment was the least that
they inflicted; In many places they proceeded
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61301:11"/>
to Blood, which was never drawn on the other
side by the Orthodox Christians; except once
in a popular Tumult in <hi>Alexandria;</hi> where
<hi>George</hi> the intruding Bishop was torn in pieces;
and yet that was rather by Heathens than by
Christians, as <hi>Ammian</hi> himself a Heathen Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
confesses.</p>
            <p>Except that, (if it need be excepted,) I do
not remember any other instance, of an <hi>Arian</hi>
that was put to death in those days upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Religion.</p>
            <p>And to shew that likewise in case of Schism,
the best Christians always kept the best tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
besides those instances I have already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which perhaps are not so proper to prove
this, because when they happened, Christianity
was not the established Religion: When it was
established by <hi>Law,</hi> then there happened that
famous Schism of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> which gave an
evident tryal of this.</p>
            <p>With what folly and fury did they break out
of the Church? With what insolence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness
did they behave themselves towards it?
What out-rages did they commit? nay, what
did they not commit? even to blood, in the
<hi>Circumcellions</hi> case; While the Catholicks on the
other hand, except in that case, which forced
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61301:12"/>
rigor from them in their own defence, treated
them with all calmness and gentleness.</p>
            <p>They called them <hi>Brethren</hi> in their Writings;
They wooed them to be Friends, and offered
them terms of Communion; such as none
would have offered, but passionate lovers of
peace; such as none would have refused, but
the obstinate enemies of it: and yet all this
while, the Catholicks had the Government on
their side; which since those Schismaticks could
not get from them, they took a course to destroy
it, by letting in the <hi>Vandals</hi> into the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>I have shewn so much of this Diabolical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
in every sort of the Enemies of the Church
of God; not only in Heathens and Unbelievers,
without; but also in Hereticks and Schismaticks
within: And I have shewn so much of the
Christian Spirit on the other hand, the great
patience and meekness of Gods people in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with all sorts of enemies: that considering
what advantage they have who lay about them
with rage, against those that stand still, and
are only ready to suffer, one would wonder,
that long since true Religion had not been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
or driven out of the world.</p>
            <p>But to this I have to answer, (and this is my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61301:12"/>
second Doctrine;) that notwithstanding all this
rage and malice of the Adversaries, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all this meekness of Christians;
yet still God is concerned for the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and he shews it by sending such season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Deliverances, as preserve it, often from
hurt, and always from utter destruction.</p>
            <p>Destroyed it shall never be. For so much
Christ declared before he built his Church: when
he promised to make his Apostles the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-stones
in it, saying to <hi>Peter</hi> in particular
<hi>Upon thee will I build my Church:</hi> He added this
promise, that the <hi>Gates of Hell</hi> should <hi>not
prevail against it.</hi> And so to all his Apostles at
parting, when he was about to be taken up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heaven; he promised, for all that, <hi>I will be
with you even to the end of the world.</hi> If Christ be
with his Church according to his promise, that
is enough to secure it against utter destruction.</p>
            <p>I speak now as to the Catholick, or Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Church; for there is no such Promise given
to particular Churches. They may be destroyed
and perish for their sins. We see many are so
already; almost all that were planted in the
Apostles times: The Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where
our Religion began; The Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
where we were first called Christians; the Six
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61301:13"/>
Churches, to which St. <hi>Paul</hi> writ his Epistles;
The Seven to which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> writ in his <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
where are they? scarce a remnant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains:
most of them are quite perished from
the Earth. This is Gods judgment upon them
for their sins: A Judgment which God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
long since, that if they did not repent, he
would <hi>take away their Candlestick</hi> from them: A
Judgment so dreadfully executed to warn us,
that <hi>unless we repent, we shall all likewise perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, if we do repent, we shall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish:
this we know, for an Exception strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
a Rule. We know that they which keep up
the Power of Religion, shall find it a strong
band between them and God; by which, as we
oblige our selves to him, not to leave him nor
forsake him; so he obligeth himself to us, that
he <hi>will not leave us nor forsake us.</hi> And therefore
howsoever, for our lesser transgressions, he may
<hi>punish our offences with a rod, and our sin with scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
nevertheless his loving kindness will he not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
take from us, nor suffer his truth to fail.</hi> Nay,
in this case, if he suffer his Church to be oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
his design may be not so much to punish,
as to purge them. He may run them through the
fire, to melt out their dross, to make them shine
more glorious, by having been for a while in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61301:13"/>
Persecution. But whatsoever his dealing may
be, (which we are to resign entirely to his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;)
whether he design to punish, or purge us,
or whether only to shew us the rod; we are sure
in all conditions to be under the good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God. If our <hi>ways please the Lord,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will <hi>make our enemies</hi> to be <hi>at peace</hi> with
us; or he will not let them be able to hurt us:
at least, they shall not have their will upon us,
they shall not say <hi>There, there, so would we have it;</hi>
They shall not be able to <hi>swallow us up quick,</hi>
though they are never so <hi>wrathfully displeased at
us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ways that God hath to deliver us, are
many more than I am able to reckon: and yet
I can reckon more than I can bring within my
time. But so the thing be done, what matter is
it, which way God uses? whether by destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his and our enemies; whether by breaking
their Combinations against us; or by other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
weakning their strength: whether by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuating
their Counsels, or discovering their
crafty designs: whether by raising us up friends,
or uniting us among our selves; and so making
us too many and too strong for them: whether
by giving means unexpected, or by blessing
what we have, above expectation? He can do
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61301:14"/>
what, and which way, he will; and we are sure
it is his will to deliver his People from their
enemies; for he is on their side, and will shew
it, wheresoever there is need, and when he sees
it the fittest time to deliver them.</p>
            <p>All that I have said hitherto, hath been only
upon such general heads, as are equally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by all sorts of Christians among us:
and for this agreement, we chiefly are under
God, to thank his Majesty, and this most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
Assembly: that have kept the Church
of <hi>England</hi> in that Power which it received
from their Predecessors, and not suffered it to
fall into any other hands. Neither our Religion,
nor our Church, is of a Persecuting Spirit. I
know not how it may be in particular persons.
But I say again, it is not in the <hi>genius</hi> of our
Church: She hath no Doctrine that teacheth
Persecution; She hath not practised it, as others,
when they were in Authority. I thank God for
it, and I hope, she will always continue in that
temper; which; being added to the other Marks
of a true Christian Church, may assure us, that
She is a Church according to the mind of Christ.</p>
            <p>But can all others say the same, that call
themselves Churches of Christ? or were they
so, when they had power in their hands? They
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61301:14"/>
that never were in Power, can never answer
this Question. Therefore none can answer it
so well as the Papists; and they tell us, Now,
they are as much against Persecution as any.</p>
            <p>But what would they be, if they were in
Power? God forbid we should ever live to see
the tryal of it. They have been tryed too much
already to be believed in this matter. We have
seen, we have felt, sufficient proofs of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
more proofs of that sort, to prove them a
false Church, than they can shew upon <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>'s
fifteen notes of a true one.</p>
            <p>I do not speak now of particular persons: I
believe there are many good People of that
Communion. I do not think that common
Reason, and that common Christianity, can
be wholly extinguished by the Principles of
their Religion. I doubt not but in some, I hope
in many, it prevails above their Religion;
otherwise I know there could not be good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of that Communion.</p>
            <p>For, take their Religion in it self, abstracting
from the common Christianity: and so there
is nothing else in it, but Superstition and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.
'Tis <hi>Lutum sanguine maceratum,</hi> Dirt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
with Blood, according to <hi>Nero</hi>'s Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.
'Tis a Religion so far from making men
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61301:15"/>
like God, that it makes them worse then men
would be without any Religion.</p>
            <p>There is a natural compassion in man, that
moves him at the sight of others sufferings; and
especially at the sight of great Cruelties, it turns
ones very Bowels within him: and 'tis no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
provocation, that can harden one against
this. But take this man, and throughly steep him
in Popery, he comes forth, without any compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
at all. He can not only see any Cruelty,
but act it: he can act it unprovoked, on any
person whatsoever, without remorse, yea with
Pleasure and Triumph, as an act of Religion,
and a good service to God.</p>
            <p>And to shew that this Religion is not the
common Christianity; he can do this upon
them who have that as well as himself. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
if it were only on the enemies of Christ,
then indeed it might be thought that Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
moved him to it. But he considers Christians
without Popery, no more than he doth Turks
or Infidels: which shews, that he is not moved
by common Christianity, but by that part of
his Religion which is properly Popery.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Religion (I am sorry we have no other
name to call it by) that vies Cruelty with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Judaism and Heathenism. If those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61301:15"/>
thousands of Christians in Primitive
times; Popery hath destroyed its ten thousands
of as innocent persons, and destroyed them
with as great Barbarity and Cruelty. I do not
think, there was ever such havock made upon
the Earth, of Humane Creatures, as was made
of millions of Heathens in <hi>America.</hi> There were
never greater Cruelties invented, than were
there used; and that not in anger, but in sport,
upon poor helpless innocent creatures. It would
make ones flesh tremble, to read them descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by their own Writers. And yet they that did
these things were very good Catholicks, as they
thought themselves; and they acted like Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks in it, for they had the Popes
Commission to go thither, and to Conquer that
Infidel People.</p>
            <p>But though this was done by Papists, yet
not upon the account of Religion. No? I know
not what should make them so Savage other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
But then what think you of the Wars in
the Holy-land? What think you of those
Slaughters of the Moors in <hi>Spain?</hi> and those
Butcheries of Jews in all Countries before the
Reformation? Those were cruel, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
without distinction of Age, or Sex; and it
cannot be denied, that those were upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61301:16"/>
But that might be the common Christianity,
and not Popery only, that they thought of: and
therefore I proceed to those Slaughters that
they made of Christians; by their own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
as good Christians as themselves, in
all other points except Popery.</p>
            <p>For, such were all those whom they were
pleased to call Hereticks in the third Canon of
the fourth <hi>Lateran</hi> Council. That Council, in
the year 1215. first made <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> an
Article of Faith, and made them Hereticks that
would not believe it: and having first provided
against their going to Heaven, as far as they
could, by declaring all damned that were not
of the Roman Faith, in all points, and that of
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> in particular; Then ordered
the destroying of them from the face of the
Earth; and so left them no place to go to, but
Hell: so great was their Charity. In the third
Canon of that Council, it was ordained, that
all Kings and Princes shall root out Hereticks,
and all that favour them, out of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys:
and if any do not execute this Canon,
the Pope is to take away his Country, and give
it to such Catholicks as will do it effectually.
This is still as good Law as any is now in the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61301:16"/>
Roman Church: and it was executed strictly
in all places before the Reformation.</p>
            <p>There were at first some Princes that lost
their Countreys by it, and the Pope did take the
Forfeiture for a warning to other Princes. But
who can number the poor Christians that lost
their lives by it? above a hundred thousand <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenses</hi>
in <hi>France;</hi> many thousands of the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses,</hi>
there, and in <hi>Italy;</hi> the like in <hi>Germany</hi> of
the <hi>Bohemians;</hi> besides what suffered in <hi>England</hi>
and other Countreys; and all put to the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
Deaths, on no other account, but their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Indeed for many of them, it was not so
evident, that they held any thing against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery:
But it was enough, if being taken upon
suspicion, they could not purge themselves of it.
The ways of purging wete different in divers
places. In some Countreys it was
by throwing them into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bernard.</hi> super <hi>Cant.</hi> Serm. 67.</note>
as some of late have tryed
Witches. In other places<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar. ab Heist.</hi> dist. 3. c. 16, 17.</note> the tryal
was by putting a Fire-coal in their hands, and
trying whether it would cleave to the flesh:
For if it did, then they concluded them Hereticks
all over, and their whole bodies fit to be burnt.</p>
            <p>I cannot pass by those two learned and good
men, as any were in that Age, if we may
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61301:17"/>
judge by their Writings, I mean <hi>Iohn Huss</hi> and
<hi>Ierom</hi> of <hi>Prague:</hi> They had to do with the most
sober piece of Popery, the Council of <hi>Constance;</hi>
which invited them thither to Dispute with
them for their Religion. But after all their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting,
instead of having leave to return, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Pass-port that brought them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
they were burned there, in the presence of
the Emperor, from whom they received it: And
not only that Cruelty, but that breach of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith, were owned and justified by the Pope
and his General Council.</p>
            <p>I may perhaps have been too large in things
so far off, and so long since; and therefore, for
the rest of my discourse, I shall confine it to
<hi>England,</hi> and to things done since the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>This Church was freed from thraldom by
King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; and was then Reformed
in King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. days, with no material dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
from what it is now at this present. Soon
after his death, under Queen <hi>Mary</hi> his Successor,
it came to have a through feeling of the Spirit of
Popery. Though she came in with the greatest
assurance, that she would make
no Change in<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr. Burnet</hi>'s Hist. of Reform. Part. 2.</note> Religion:
Though she promised it upon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61301:17"/>
her Royal word, to those Protestants, that brought
her to her Crown; though they deserved it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a promise, by venturing their lives for her
against a Protestant that was set up in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Yet she was no sooner setled upon her
Throne, but the Spirit of Popery quite cancell'd
all those Obligations. There were none that
durst appear for the Protestant Religion, but
were fain to fly their Countrey to save their lives,
or stayed and lost them with the cruellest
deaths. Of the last sort, were, the Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and divers Bishops, and other
eminent persons. Both they, and hundreds
more, of the Clergy and Commonalty, were
burnt alive, upon no other account but their
Religion. There was only one <hi>Flower,</hi> here at
<hi>Westminster,</hi> that was distracted, and wounded
a Priest at Mass, for which he was burnt among
the rest. Of all the other that suffered, there
was no other pretence against any, but only
upon the account of their Religion. Their
charge was for not going to Confession, or for
not going to Mass, or for denying Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation
when they were called to it. There
was nothing else in their Accusation, there was
nothing else in their Sentence, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else for which they suffered; It was meerly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61301:18"/>
for their not submitting to Popery; a sufficient
proof of the Spirit of that Religion.</p>
            <p>But soon after, when the Protestant Religion
came in again; see what a contrary Spirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
on the other side. When Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
came to Reign, and immediately declared
her Religion, and Established it in her first
Year, without any violence; from that day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
for ten years together, what one Papist
was there that suffered death for his Religion?
Though living in the midst of them, whose
dearest Friends and Relations they had murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and though those Protestants could say,
There goes he that burnt my Father, or he that
murdered my Brother, or that brought them to
that cruel Death; Though the Queen her self
could say, who they were, that in her Sisters
time dealt most insolently and barbarously with
her: (for they had taken away her Attendants,
and put her under a Guard of Souldiers, and
carried her Prisoner from place to place; and
that they had not murdered her too, she was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for it, Though not so
much to his Humanity, as his Policy; for if she
had been dead, the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who had
married the Dauphin, would have been the
next Heir to the Crown: But for her life she
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61301:18"/>
knew she owed no thanks to those Papists that
were now her own Subjects; (I mean, to those
of the English Nation:) yet when she came to
be their Queen, for ten years, she touched not a
hair of any of their heads. Only she kept them
from publick exercise of Popery, she required
them to come to Church every Lords-day, and
those that did not, she made them pay Twelve
pence a Sunday. This was all that they suffered
for ten years, after ours was the Established Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Was there ever so generous a revenge? so
much Cruelty requited with so much Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency?</p>
            <p>After that, the Pope (by an Authority he gives
himself) made bold to declare her uncapable to
Reign; because forsooth she was a Heretick;
and exhorted all her Subjects to depose her, and
to murder her, by a Bull that he gave out for
that purpose: This Bull being set up publickly
at noon-day by one of her own Subjects, and
he being taken and hanged for it, they had the
impudence to call him a Martyr; and he stands
the first Martyr in their Roll, among all them
that suffered in her Reign. So it was ten years
before any of them suffered, and then it was
for declaring her no Queen, and for posting up
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61301:19"/>
the Popes Bull, to make her Subjects depose her
and murder her.</p>
            <p>That Bull had such an effect upon many of
her Subjects, that they broke out into open
Rebellion against her. When that failed, they
betook themselves to private Conspiracie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
her, any way, by Assassination: Which
was proved time after time, as fully, and as
clearly, as ever any thing was proved under the
Sun. And it was proved that the first movers to
it were Popish Priests, and especially Jesuites,
who came over from beyond-Sea for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
This obliged her to make Sanguinary
Laws, to keep them out of the Kingdom;
which yet were rarely inflicted upon any, but
those that were found to have actually carried
on some design against her life: And there were
divers Penalties upon them of that Religion,
to make that uneasie to them, which was so
dangerous to her and to her Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time, it was almost
three years that he had reigned, before the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-Treason;
during all which time, there
was no Papist put to death, upon any of those
Laws: There was no Penalty inflicted upon
any of them, that could be pretended to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of Religion. But contrariwise,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61301:19"/>
they were remitted the arrears of all their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time: nay, more
than that, they were admitted to Court; they
were employed in Embassies; they had Honors
conferred upon them, as well as others: they
were debarred from nothing, but only the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Exercise of their Religion: and that was
provocation enough, to engage them into that
hellish Treason, which was to have been exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
as on this day.</p>
            <p>It was a Treason that shewed the Spirit of
that Faction, how fierce and implacable it was,
after so much experience of ours on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
It shewed how impossible it was to oblige
them: how impossible to keep them from doing
mischief; such a mischief, as none other could
have invented, none but would have abhorred
it, that had not been possest with the evil spirit
of that Religion.</p>
            <p>What! to murder their King, that had been
so gentle and easie to them? to murder the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
hopes of that Royal Family? to murder a
whole Nation together, in their Representative
then met in Parliament? All was struck at toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as if they had been but one person; as if
(according to <hi>Caligula</hi>'s wish,) they had but one
neck. They were for blowing them up, for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61301:20"/>
               <hi>swallowing them up</hi> at once, for overwhelming
all that was Venerable and Sacred in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for burying both our State and our Religion
in one heap of destruction and ruine. Good God!
<hi>If thou hadst not been on our side,</hi> what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of us, <hi>when men rose up against us, to swallow
us up quick?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men? Who would ever suspect men of such a
wickedness? We ought not to think that men
were capable of it; we ought not to entertain
so hard an opinion of Humane Nature. It was
something else that put them upon it. It was
something which they mis-call Religion, that
made them put off their Humanity. It was this
which transformed men into such monsters, that
brought them, not only to think of this, but to
design it. For their part it was actually done.</p>
            <p>I do not charge all of that Religion with this
Action: (Religion do I call it? I unwillingly use
so good a word on so ill an occasion; But since
they call it so, let it pass: I say then that all the
Authors were only of that Religion; and they
acted according to their own Principles, those
Principles which they received from their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Governors. Their Counsellors were of the
Governing Party: They were Jesuites, who had
their Superior in the Plot. I need not tell you,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61301:20"/>
of the malice, the closeness, the subtilty, the
rage and cruelty of that Faction; that hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently
appeared in a hundred other things: in
other Exploits they have out-done all other men;
but they out-did themselves, in this unhumane,
this Devilish Conspiracy. It was contrived with
such foresight, it was managed with such policy,
it was carried on with that closeness and secresie,
as not once to gather wind, in some years, till
they had brought all their business to perfection.
There was but a short time, but one night, but
half a night, between the Plot and the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if God had not miraculously interposed.</p>
            <p>The Vault was dug, the Magazine was laid
in, the Iron-bars were laid over, the Engineer
was at hand, the Match was laid, it was sized
for an hour, a fatal hour, of this morning, of the
Fifth of <hi>November:</hi> In a minute of which, in a
moment; all the governing part of this Nation,
and God knows who more, all that came within
reach, were to have been swallowed up quick.</p>
            <p>Lord! What a thunderclap had it been, to
this Nation, to this Church, to this Kingdom?
What an Earthquake it would have been? What
a <hi>Chaos</hi> it would have made? What a Tragical
day to every thing but Popery? Nay to Papists
themselves? I doubt not many would have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61301:21"/>
it; I am persuaded they would; many
would have abhorr'd their very Popery: But
they could not have remedied what was past,
nor have prevented the following miseries.</p>
            <p>Then this day had stood in red Letters in
their Almanacks, though some are pleased to
leave it out of ours. Then they must have kept
this a Holy-day, that cannot now afford it a
Thanksgiving. Then they must have gone to
Mass for it, that will not joyn with us now in
our Prayers; and some that will not now give a
Faggot, must then have lighted one.</p>
            <p>'Tis not in my power, nor words, nor in the
wit of man, to enumerate all the evils and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that would have come upon this Nation. It
could not have been otherwise, <hi>if the Lord had not
been on our side. If the Lord had not been on our side,</hi>
we had been gone, we had never been born, or
had cause to have wished we had never been.</p>
            <p>Oh! how are we bound to thank God, that he
was on our side on this day? How are we bound
to praise his name, for preserving us so many
times since? I need not reckon up to you the
particulars. I know of no great danger we have
been in, but hath more or less been occasion'd by
the same sort of men; or if they did not begin it,
they have struck in with it, and contributed to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61301:21"/>
carry it on all they could. And shall we tempt
God, by doing nothing to secure our selves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them? It is plain that this were contrary
to Gratitude. But what shall we do towards our
safety? there is nothing more worth our consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>But do I ask that?<note place="margin">The Bill against Popery, that has pass'd in the House of Lords.</note> when I know
what this August Assembly hath
judged? And if your judgment be
seconded, as I hope it will be, there
is no doubt his Majesty will assent to it: Then
we shall have no occasion for any more such
Miracle; there will be an ordinary way, to keep
us out of this danger.</p>
            <p>First, they will be obliged, all the Papists that
stay in <hi>England,</hi> at least for their own ease, if not
for the common security, to consider, whether
they are bound in Conscience to be still of that
Faction.</p>
            <p>That is more than we have been able to bring
them to for many years. They would rarely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
any of our Clergy to speak to them. They
had their ears stopt against us, for fear of better
information. If you can but bring them to hear
Truth, I am persuaded they cannot continue Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.
I know they cannot, if they have so much
sense in them, as to consider, how little reason
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61301:22"/>
they have for it. And for them that will not
hear nor consider, neither of themselves, nor
when Authority requires it, what can be more
reasonable than what you have judged? I think
none will judge otherwise, that will consider the
present case. This, I take it, is the present case
between them and us; our main difference is
in a plain point of practice, whose Subjects they
and we must be. They will needs be subject to
one that lives in <hi>Italy.</hi> If they will be so, who
can help it? Nay that will not content them, but
we must be his Subjects too: That is hard, when
we can see no reason for it. Nay, we must, or
we shall never be quiet otherwise. No? Cannot
we intreat them? Cannot be oblige them to be
quiet? We have endeavoured to do it, with all
possible Civility; and yet we cannot be quiet,
without being what we will never be. Then it
is time to part, if we cannot live together; that's
plain. But now the question is, Who shall go?
that would I, with all my soul, if Popery were
the Religion of <hi>England.</hi> I protest, I would not
stay in it.</p>
            <p>And yet I have done nothing to make my
Country afraid of me; and I have nothing but
my Religion to provoke any of them. I hate the
person of no Papist, or man in the world. I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61301:22"/>
would have no man punished for his Religion;
no not them that destroy men for Religion. I
would not punish them; but I would not live
with them, if I could help it. I know no Sect
among Christians that I would not live under ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Popery.</p>
            <p>But what matter is it for such a one as me? I
expect from them no regard to what I say. But
methinks they should have some regard for their
Country. I would tell them, if they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
your Country is afraid of you. She does as
it were beg you to be gone. For a hundred years
she hath been in danger of you. She hath not
suffered but some way or other on your account.
The Spanish Invasion was for Popery. The
Gunpowder-Treason was for Popery. One Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
War was in a great measure occasioned by
Popery. She is in danger of another Civil War
by Popery. I will not say what she hath suffered
abroad for your sakes. She hath suffered more
than she can well bear; and must she suffer still?
must she still be in fear for your sakes? Why
should you not be gone, and free her from her
fears? If they are true, that she may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed:
and if false, that she may not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in fear of you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61301:23"/>
But perhaps we cannot expect so much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
at their hands, and therefore we should
be the more careful for our selves. Let us do
what we can do, if we will, without them. We
need not fear them so much, if it were not for
our Divisions. That is the thing which makes us
most in danger of them. We divide, and subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide;
We take the way to make our selves
weak, and little, and indefensible. We promote
their design by it, to swallow us up. We should
not go down so easily whole, as we may do in
small pieces. We cannot but see this. Oh! that
we had hearts to consider it! that we would do
what we can to unite our selves! Surely we can,
if we will: we could, if we had but a real mind
to it. We will, and must very speedily do it;
or else, if we do not unite, do what we will
otherwise, we shall let in Popery, even by the
ways that we take to keep out Popery.</p>
            <p>Well! nothing can be too bad for us to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
upon the account of our sins: yet nothing
can be too good to expect, from that God,
who hath preserved us, and will preserve us,
if we are not wanting to our selves. If we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our lives according to our Religion; if
we eschew evil and do good, if we seek peace
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61301:23"/>
and ensue it; then we shall see good days,
then God will delight to dwell among us, he
will build us like <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> a City at unity
within it self, that shall stand fast for ever.</p>
            <p>The Lord grant it for his Mercy sake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
