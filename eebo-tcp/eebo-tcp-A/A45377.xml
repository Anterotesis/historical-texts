         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am not <hi>so wise,</hi> as to account your Book un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of Answer, as some <hi>too angrily</hi> do;
nor can esteem it <hi>weakness,</hi> but the contrary
rather a too great <hi>sturdiness</hi> and <hi>stoutness,</hi>
Christianly to have gone about, to shew you,
that you mistook the Ministers meaning; because I cannot
think <hi>so ill</hi> of your self, that you would <hi>wilfully</hi> go so farre
aside from their meaning, as I am confident you have done.
And I am of opinion that he himself, who hath thus forestald
other mens answers, as farre as he could, with such a <hi>censure,</hi>
should rather have <hi>civilly replied himself where he found
<pb facs="tcp:119266:3"/>
his Antagonist mistaken,</hi> which was but Christian duty, and
that which himself seems to acknowledge so, and promises in
another case. Yet I shall request of you, or any other of my
courteous Readers, to excuse what <hi>weakness</hi> they may find,
upon any other account, seeing this Answer was hasted, and
after twice reading of your Book only, presently and <hi>ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi>
poured forth, as you see. Ever since the Bishop of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maghs</hi>
recommending me to your acquaintance with such a
character; as he gave you, I have had a reverent opinion of
you, and found afterwards sufficient cause not to change it.
Wherefore I intreat you, Sir, that you will satisfie the world
candidly, whether you can now think, you mistook the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers,
or no; and to do them and the truth so farre right, as
to let it be seen, that you <hi>did not, nor will not intend any
thing against the truth, nor ingenuity of mind,</hi> but for
both; and you shall anew obliege,</p>

THE
PUBLICK DOCTRINE

CHURCH of ENGLAND.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WOuld to God, that many, who account themselves
the only loyaller, sounder, and orthodox Clergy,
and Divines of <hi>England,</hi> were of your mind, and
as heartily and earnestly desired a <hi>full union</hi> with
such persons, as those Ministers, who offer the
reasons, that you answer to, professe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be: to wit, <hi>Such as truly and unfeignedly will make
good, That it is farre from their thoughts to oppose, or disparage
orthodox Doctrine; a well composed Liturgie; Rites for Decency
and Order; Ordination of Ministers; Apostolical Episcopacy;
or due Rules of Discipline;</hi> because they are for all these, with
truth; and against rigid impositions, which may debar a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
of any liberty, allowed him by Christ: and that by their
<hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> as I take it, For if they will not <hi>truly</hi> and
<hi>unfeignedly</hi> make good all this, they are not worthy, with whom
you should desire a <hi>full union.</hi> You are much therefore to be
thanked, Sir, by all such men (a lover of whom I professe my
self to be, though one of the meanest) that you use your Pen
with such brotherly temper and Christian moderation, as that
there comes not from you any provocation, or the least reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
either upon their persons, their parties, or perswasions; but
that you apply your self wholly and solely to a due examination,
and orderly discussion of their reasons, weighing and trying
them, whether they have force to inferre their conclusion, and
in case they prove not of that validity, discovering and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the insufficiency and weakness of them: which all Writers
of controversies, especially Divines, if they behave themselves
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119266:4"/>
therein like Christians, should do; and which, by Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in this piece of mine, I intend towards you. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Sir, I hope you will with that same moderation and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that you have already shown to others, excuse me also, if I
am induced to think, that you have not fallen upon the best way
of satisfying the Ministers reasons, untill you better rectifie my
judgment, wherunto I promise that with all candor I wil be ready.</p>
            <p>For the conclusion propounded by the Ministers to be proved,
being this, [<hi>That there is a necessity of Reformation of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England.] This conclusion you
think <hi>not sufficiently proved,</hi> but the <hi>orthodox Doctrine of the
39. Articles disparaged,</hi> contrary to the Ministers profession,
<hi>That it was farre from their thoughts to disparage orthodox
Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. For (say you, <hi>pag.</hi> 2. §. 2.) after private satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of mine own conscience, entering into a further conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<hi>That it is an undoubted disparagement, to be in a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of being reform'd;</hi>—least people—might hereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
some sinister opinion of the Doctrine of <hi>our Church,</hi>
therefore you thought it not unfit to give a <hi>publick account of
your private thoughts,</hi> concerning this particular. What that
satisfaction of your own conscience and private thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this particular, was, you set down, <hi>pag.</hi> 1. §. 2. to
wit, <hi>That you found not any one reason, which could in the least
perswade you, [That there is any such necessity of a Reformation
of the publick Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England:] and that
consequently <hi>you did resolve,</hi> notwithstanding what was yet
brought to the contrary, <hi>to continue in the faith,</hi> which you
had hitherto professed, and not <hi>repent</hi> of your <hi>subscription to the
Articles of the Church of</hi> England: whereas I am confident it
was never their mind to put you <hi>to change your faith,</hi> which
you had hitherto professed, unlesse that had been <hi>Arminianism,</hi>
or an <hi>allay</hi> of <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I saw by this, that it was very like you mistook their
meaning, and differ'd from them in the <hi>state</hi> of the Question.
For about stating of the Question, or <hi>fixing the conclusion</hi> (as
your self speak, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. §. 2.) that you were to oppose; <hi>To
avoid all manner of misconception</hi> between you, you distinguish
between <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the publick Doctrine;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119266:4"/>
hinting withall, That they industriously confounded these in
their Treatise, contrary to what you conceived they should have
done; and therefore that you must as <hi>carefully</hi> distinguish them
in your answer. And accordingly you make your opposition
<hi>distinct</hi> in two Conclusions. 1. <hi>That there is no necessity of a
Reformation of the publick Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England,
<hi>pag.</hi> 4. The second is, <hi>That the Articles of Religion of the
Church of</hi> England, <hi>are established by the Law of</hi> England, <hi>p.</hi>
21, 22. In order to your fixing the first conclusion, for avoiding
of misconception still, you first lay down this <hi>assertion, [That
whether the publick Doctrine be established indeed by Law; or
whether it be reputed only to be established, there is no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Reformation of it.]</hi> This you briefly go about to prove,
and do it indeed, where you lay it down, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. §. 2. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as you consider <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to wit <hi>abstractedly</hi> from the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licknesse
of it,</hi> and from being the <hi>Confession</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England;</hi> that is, considering the <hi>Doctrine in its self,</hi> which I
humbly conceive you should not have done. For though for
my part, I think you deserve great praise and thanks for being
so <hi>distinct, candid,</hi> and <hi>cleer,</hi> in the way that you have taken,
yet I doubt whether that was the way, <hi>fully</hi> to oppose and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict</hi>
the Ministers <hi>meaning;</hi> you considering the Doctrine in
<hi>its self,</hi> and thereto applying a scholastical Dispute, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of their reasons, as if they were brought against that;
and they sufficiently <hi>disowning</hi> both, if I understand them right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Therefore partly your distinguishing, where they intended
no distinction; and partly your not distinguishing, where they
would most have had distinction, have been so farre from remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>misconception</hi> between you, that in my humble opinion, this
hath fixed a <hi>continued misconceiving</hi> almost through the whole
dispute.</p>
            <p>That this may appear, I shall humbly propose my judgement
to you, and them; and leave it to both to be considered of, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or both shall think it deserves in relation to truth and right,
which I only seek. 1. Then I conceive, that they speak of the
<hi>publick Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> not as in its self,
but as <hi>aggregated</hi> with the due qualifications of it; <hi>publicknesse,</hi>
and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Englands propriety</hi> in it; but not of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119266:5"/>
               <hi>considered in its self,</hi> and <hi>abstractedly</hi> from these, as you
do: because they held the Articles of Religion, as the <hi>publick</hi>
and <hi>national confession</hi> of the Religion of the <hi>Church of</hi> England;
according to the <hi>Stat.</hi> 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> speaking of the Articles of
Religion, as <hi>they concern the confession of the true Christian
faith, and the Dactrine of the Sacraments,</hi> i.e. as they hold
forth the <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>national confession of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>and her Doctrine of the Sacraments:</hi> And as thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
they held the Articles, rather to stand in need
of a Reformation, for their <hi>too much generalnesse</hi> (wherein
alwayes is included <hi>doubtfulnesse,</hi> as to determining of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
which the Ministers meant, according to that, <hi>Dolus
est in generalibus</hi>) and <hi>defectivenesse,</hi> to make a good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
enough <hi>confession of Faith</hi> for so famous a reformed Church
as <hi>England</hi> was, than for any <hi>unsoundnesse</hi> of them in themselves;
which they intended not to impugne. Secondly, they <hi>doubted</hi>
of the <hi>establishment of the Articles, as a sufficient enough confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Church of</hi> England; and in what <hi>notion</hi> the <hi>Church</hi>
was to be taken, when they are so call'd and accounted her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession:
which distinction of <hi>Church,</hi> that they desired, they
have not yet obtained; and so the <hi>doubtfulnesse</hi> of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
or at least the <hi>defectivenesse</hi> of them, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in the best and rightest
notion of it, is not yet removed. For a <hi>publick</hi> confession
of a National Church, is much concerned in the <hi>undoubted</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
it hath from a <hi>right</hi> and <hi>sufficient</hi> authority; and as
much concerned in the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>best notion</hi> of the Church,
whose confession it is said to be: and as long as the <hi>establishment
is doubtfull,</hi> or <hi>defective</hi> and <hi>insufficient,</hi> or the <hi>authority
doubtfull,</hi> or <hi>defective,</hi> and <hi>insufficient;</hi> so long must the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licknesse</hi>
of that confession, and so farre will it be <hi>doubtfull</hi> and
<hi>defective,</hi> or <hi>insufficient.</hi> And as long as the Church is <hi>doubtful</hi>
or <hi>defective,</hi> and not taken in a right enough <hi>notion,</hi> whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
it is said to be; so long will the confession be subject to
<hi>much imperfection,</hi> and but an <hi>individuum vagum,</hi> a <hi>vulgiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous</hi>
thing, that can lay no certain claim either to <hi>right father</hi>
or <hi>mother</hi> here below. For these therefore, and more particular
considerations, the Ministers thought it <hi>necessary to be reformed;</hi>
or <hi>in a state of necessity to be reformed.</hi>

By this time, Sir, I believe you perceive, how I think they
have stated the Question in their mind and meaning. Their sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Question appears to me by their Conclusion, which
they laid down, to be proved; and by their manner of proving
of it; and setting down their main scope, and work that they
intended. Their conclusion (which we have set down before)
we take in their meaning, to be equivalent to his; [<hi>It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that the Church of</hi> England <hi>have, and hold forth a more
distinct and perfect forme of her truely, and rightly so called,
Nationall confession of faith, and of her Doctrine of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
than the thirty nine Articles amount to.</hi>] Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of proving it will appear, when we answer your particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
from which for brevities sake, and avoiding repetitions,
we will abstaine here, and deferre to set down untill then. Their
<hi>main scope, and work,</hi> that they intended, they show not to
have been an <hi>opposing</hi> the Doctrine of the thirty nine Articles, <hi>as
considered in it self,</hi> seeing, 1. They told you, That the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
at <hi>Westminer</hi> approved that, <hi>as so considered, and thought
it fit to be retained;</hi> but with all to be more <hi>fully cleared, and
explained,</hi> for exclusion of <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> and other like er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;
and to have more added to it, which it should have had,
for bearing the reputation of a sufficient <hi>Nationall</hi> confession;
with pertinent Scripture-proofs, to manifest that <hi>the very Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
themselves, and all the rest, are all evidently grounded
upon the Word of God:</hi> whereas the Articles wanted these;
there being no Text of Scripture produced in them, to make out
any one of them. This is clear enough evidence, that the Ministers
intended not to impugne <hi>the Doctrine</hi> of the thirty nine Articles,
as in it self considered. See <hi>pag.</hi> 17. of their Book last Impres.
and §. 1, 2. at the end of each. 2. In their Epistle to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
They sufficiently told any, that they intended no such
opposition to the thirty nine Articles, while they professed their
<hi>work</hi> chiefly was, out of the <hi>Laws,</hi> which they, <hi>as Ministers
were bound to take speciall notice of;</hi> and out of <hi>the Books,</hi>
said to be by <hi>those Laws</hi> setled, to make good these two things.
1. That (so farre as they could apprehend) nether <hi>the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Religion, the Books of Common Prayer, or Ordination;
the Jurisdiction of Bishops claimed before 17<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Car. 1. nor so
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119266:6"/>
much as their being, as Bishops, sithence;</hi> nor the <hi>Canons so,
much contended for, are indeed established by Law.</hi> 2. <hi>That
none of these, as they now stand,</hi> (meaning of the Articles in
particular, as they are commonly held of themselves to be a
<hi>sufficient summe, or Confession publick,</hi> of the Doctrine of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi>) <hi>ought to be confirmed, and setled.</hi> But
all with submission, say they. And before immediately, they
seem sufficiently to insinuate, that they intended no impugnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> in the Articles, as <hi>in its self considered;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
say they, <hi>We offer no polemicall discourse, or theologicall
debates, proper for a Divinity-Schoole, or Synod; but only
what we humbly conceive more suitable to a Parliament.</hi> But
had that been their drift, <hi>theologically to impugne the Doctrine</hi>
of the thirty nine Articles, <hi>as in it self considered,</hi> and as you
take them to oppose it, and accordingly answer them, as if they
had; this could not have been true, which they here say.
Wherefore I conclude, that you state not the Question, as they
intended, nor answer them according to their meaning, and
therefore your resolved treating of <hi>No necessity of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as a Divine, to whom it properly appertains, to speak of
Theologicall Doctrines, and your earnest contending for the
faith of the Church, in that Scripturall sense (not ecclesiastick)
as you speak it, which you profess, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. §. 1. and which
takes up the most part of your Book, might wholly have been
spared, as not contradicting the Ministers, as you may see by
their plain and open profession to <hi>the Parliament.</hi> Yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
if you lookt only to the first Impression, which wanted the
Epistle to the Parliament, (as I take it, for I certainly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
not; nor have it now by me) their <hi>scope,</hi> and way that
they held, being thereby less clear, you were the more excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if you mistooke their meaning; they being nothing so clear
and accurate therein (if I have taken them right) as they might
have been: for which ingenuous and harmless freedome, I
hope both of you will pardon me, who truly love and honour
you both, as I think you well deserve.</p>
            <p>Their conclusion then to be proved, was this: <hi>There is a
necessity of Reformation of the publick Doctrine of the Church
of</hi> England. The appendage, as you call it, which they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119266:6"/>
added, I take to be an explication only of the <hi>publickness</hi> of
the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of</hi> England, as they conceived it
<hi>doubtfull</hi> and <hi>defective,</hi> for the <hi>establishment, and Authority e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablisher,</hi>
and the <hi>property and proprieter,</hi> or whose <hi>publick
Doctrine</hi> and confession it was; and for the <hi>too great generality</hi>
of it, and want <hi>of much that it should have,</hi> to sustaine the
<hi>name and nature</hi> of a <hi>sufficient publick Confession of faith,</hi> or
<hi>publick Doctrine,</hi> of so eminent a Church, as <hi>England</hi> is; and
therefore <hi>in these respects,</hi> and <hi>so farre</hi> to be reformed. I thus
therefore, according to the former stating of the question, forme
their argument.</p>
            <p>What is commonly received for the <hi>publick Doctrine,</hi> or
<hi>Confession of faith</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ought not to be
too <hi>generall and doubtfull,</hi> whether for <hi>exclusion of errours,</hi> or
for <hi>publick establishment, and authority establisher;</hi> or for the
<hi>owners, or those whose Confession it is cald;</hi> or defective and
imperfect, for want of ought, that it should have, for a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and creditable Confession of so eminent a Church, whether
in <hi>points, or heads of matter;</hi> or <hi>distinctness, definitness, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialty,</hi>
and <hi>clearness</hi> both of <hi>matter,</hi> and <hi>manner,</hi> or <hi>expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
or <hi>Scripturall proofs and evidences;</hi> but if it be doubtfull,
or defective in any, or all of these respects, in <hi>so farre</hi> it ought
to be reformed. But the Doctrine contained in the thirty nine
Articles, is commonly received for the <hi>publick Doctrine,</hi> or
<hi>Confession</hi> of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and yet is <hi>doubtfull</hi> and
<hi>defective</hi> in all, or most of the foresaid respects. Therefore the
Doctrine of the thirty nine Articles, commonly held to be the
publick Doctrine, or Confession of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
ought to be reformed in all the respects aforesaid. The major
proposition neither is, nor needed to be <hi>formally</hi> exprest; not
needed any thing to the probation of it, it is so clear in its self.
But if any part of it must needs be proved, it will be the last
clause; to wit, [<hi>but if it be doubtfull, or defective in any, or
all these respects, in so farre it ought to be reformed.</hi>] for
probation whereof, the next Section will suffice. The minor,
or assumption is fully enough exprest, though not <hi>formally,</hi> but
<hi>sparsedly;</hi> and the first part needs no probation, to wit, <hi>That
the Doctrine contained in the thirty nine Articles, is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119266:7"/>
received for the publick Doctrine, or Confession of Faith, of
the Church of</hi> England; not do you any way question it. But
if it needed proof, the Stature of 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> joyned to common
estimation, proves it enough. The second part of the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is also exprest; and as it only needed proof, so it is proved,
and to it only all the proofs directed. Yet before I show in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
how the proofs are pertinent and concludent; I think
needfull, to avoid repetition, to premise some generals once
for all.</p>
            <p>The difference being such as it is between you, in stating the
question, there must needs be difference also in sundry others
<hi>notions</hi> and <hi>things,</hi> between the <hi>Ministers and you.</hi> For they
have a farre other notion of <hi>reformation,</hi> of <hi>doubtfullness,</hi> of
<hi>defectiveness,</hi> of <hi>necessity</hi> of reformation, than you have, or use;
and therefore in these also you do not truely oppose one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
They mean but a <hi>reformation</hi> of the Doctrine, in as farre
as <hi>doubtfull</hi> and <hi>defective,</hi> or of the <hi>doubtfullness</hi> and <hi>defective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of it, as they understand them, and go about to prove them;
not as you take them. Again, A <hi>necessity</hi> of reforming, but
not <hi>so great, and internall</hi> to the Doctrine its self, as you
would put upon the Ministers, and make common to them with
Papists, somewhat <hi>invidiously</hi> I confess, but to be excused, as
unavoidably arising from your mistaking of their meaning; but
a <hi>necessity</hi> of precept or <hi>duty</hi> only (which binds us to reforme
the least things, that we know, or ought to know, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss)
to reforme the <hi>doubtfullness,</hi> and <hi>defectiveness</hi> of it, in
generall, and in particulars, as by them proved: which you
might well know, and understand, to have been the opinion of
many unconforme Ministers of sundry Counties of <hi>England,</hi> still
professing themselves Ministers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (and
not separating from it, as <hi>Brownists</hi> and <hi>Barrowists</hi> did) or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-separating
from her, (as <hi>semi-brownists</hi> and <hi>semi-barrowists,</hi>
the <hi>Independents</hi> did, and do; at least some of them) before
now, as well at this time, had you looked into their doings; as
it seems you did not, by what you profess, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. §. 1. of your
Book. Again, For <hi>defectiveness,</hi> they are farre from the <hi>notexs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of it, that you would put upon them; and so arguing, as you
present them. <hi>Defective</hi> to them is, not that, <hi>to which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119266:7"/>
may be added;</hi> but to <hi>which something should be added,</hi>
for the dignity, office, and end, or ends, that it sustains; or
that <hi>which wants something, that it ought to have,</hi> for the
foresaid respects, or the like: which is indeed the <hi>true notion</hi> of
it. For it is an undeniable maxime, or axiom, shining by its
own light, <hi>That whatsoever is defective, ought to be, or is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be reformed.</hi> And by these notions thus explained, and
rescued from misprision, the last part of the major proposition
is made undeniably clear. Therefore the major (as we said)
needed no proof, but a right taking, and understanding of these
termes.</p>
            <p>Here now I might stay, and needed not to answer any more,
where there is so wide a mistake, that runs through most of your
Book, and hinders it to meet with their meaning. Yet I will
show <hi>particularly</hi> how they prove their assumption; and at the
same time consider your observations, and answers in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
as much as shall seem needfull, where by their stating of
the question will also appeare, (as we marked before, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd
to this place to be observed) seeing it is to be supposed, that
their proofs were framed, according to the meaning of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
they had to inferre, if such application can be made of
them as here we show, that it not only can easily, but should
and must.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then in the first two Paragraphs, where they speak to the
<hi>doubtfullness</hi> of the <hi>publick establishment</hi> of the <hi>Articles</hi> by
<hi>Law</hi> only, though their proofs were so farre good, as to prove
a <hi>doubtfullness</hi> indeed of that <hi>establishment</hi> or <hi>confirmation,</hi> both
to themselves, and many others, had not you helped; yet I <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously</hi>
confess, that you have almost satisfied me in this, from
<hi>page</hi> 20. of your Book to the end; and therefore have nothing
to reply to this point, save what is said at the place that specially
concerns the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article, and in some measure the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and so the thirty fourth Article about the Homilies, nor
almost to any thing in all that space of your Book, but very little,
which will fall to be spoken, about their own objection and
answer to it; till when we referre it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the third Paragraph, and first sub-Paragraph, or sad
consequence, they so speak to the <hi>doubtfull generallness</hi> of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119266:8"/>
               <hi>Articles,</hi> as too much adhered to, and abused; and to the <hi>want</hi>
of a sufficient <hi>clearness, specially,</hi> and <hi>definiteness</hi> to exclude
<hi>Arminianism</hi> by, which most in the time <hi>Car.</hi> 1. would have
<hi>fastened upon them;</hi> and to the abusing and seducing of the
King, so far as to countenance this course, and discountenance
the opposers of it; that would have vindicated the Articles from
it, but were hindred by the Kings <hi>Declaration,</hi> and <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
that they indeed <hi>sufficiently conclude and prove a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi>
of the Articles being reformed after that, from such <hi>doubtfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>defectiveness,</hi> as made them <hi>unable readily and easily</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to <hi>exclude and condemn Arminianisme,</hi> and such like errors;
and fit to be made <hi>a snare</hi> of, for <hi>godly, orthodox,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Ministers and Preachers of the Truth: to which I find not,
that you have any way sufficiently answered. All the answer
you have given to this, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. of your Book, §. 2. is, That the
Ministers 3. §. only recite part of the Declaration of 10. <hi>Car.</hi> 1.
prefixed to the Articles: and that is there recited only (say
you) to shew the inconveniences supposed to flow from it. As
yet therefore there is nothing brought (say you) to manifest
the <hi>doubtfullness</hi> of the Doctrine, and if there shall appear to be
anything, it must be contained in the seven sad consequences,
which are <hi>mainly</hi> and <hi>directly</hi> intended <hi>against the Declaration</hi> of
that pious King—,but obliquely strike at the <hi>Articlse</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and the Doctrine contained in them. But by your good
leave, Sir, the Declaration is not recited there, only to show
the inconveniences supposed to flow from it; but chiefly from
the <hi>too great generallness, and doubtfullness</hi> of the Articles,
whereof the Bishops strove to make that <hi>advantage,</hi> or <hi>abuse,</hi>
to seduce the King, to father <hi>Arminianisme</hi> upon them, as their
<hi>true and genuine</hi> sense, and consequents. Nor is there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>main,</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> intention against the Kings Declaration
here, as is somewhat <hi>individuously</hi> again insinuated upon mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
of the Ministers, than there is against the Statute 13. of
<hi>Eliz.</hi> (which was none, nor do you there complain of any
such) as the Ministers own <hi>Prolepsis,</hi> and their answers make
clear. Also their words to the Parliament in their Epistle, shows
that their <hi>main and direct intention</hi> is rather against the
<hi>Books of Articles, Common Prayer, Ordination,</hi> &amp;c. than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119266:8"/>
the <hi>Laws,</hi> or <hi>Declarations,</hi> &amp;c. but indeed against
neither of these <hi>directly,</hi> and as <hi>in themselves;</hi> but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>publickness,</hi> or <hi>publique establishments of the Books,</hi>
as conceived to be given by those <hi>Laws, and Declarations,</hi> &amp;c.
but <hi>indeed not given,</hi> nor <hi>furnished</hi> to the Books by them,
as the Ministers think. And whereas you say, as yet there was
nothing brought to manifest the <hi>doubtfullness</hi> of the Doctrine,
you mean <hi>as considered</hi> in its self; which was not their intent to
do, further than we have shown, against the <hi>too great general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and indefinitenesse</hi> of them, and the like before rehearsed.
This Argument therefore of the Ministers is sufficiently conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of a <hi>necessity</hi> of reforming these Articles, as an <hi>imperfect
confession</hi> only, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and not answerable
to her <hi>worth and place,</hi> that she deserves amongst the reformed
Churches; and stands firme and unshaken for ought, that you
have replyed. For we cannot suspect that you so slightly past
it over, cunningly and upon design to favour <hi>Arminianisme,</hi>
and say nothing against it; but upon <hi>mistake,</hi> as we have said,
of the Ministers meaning; though some perhaps will be apt to
think that you favour <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> since in all your Book,
you have no expression <hi>disfavouring</hi> it, though you had often
occasion to open your mind.</p>
            <p n="3">Thirdly, Again, in the first and second <hi>Subparagraph</hi> or sad
consequences, the Ministers speak more to the unjust, and
too much urging of the <hi>generalnesse</hi> and <hi>doubtfulnesse</hi> of the
Articles, and show two or three absurds, or inconveniences,
that follow on it: whereby is sufficiently concluded a necessity
<hi>so farre</hi> to reform them, which you by your answers, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. §.
3. &amp; 4. no way remove or meet with; requiring the <hi>doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
of the Doctrine in <hi>its self</hi> to have been proved, as it <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracts</hi>
from this <hi>too much generality,</hi> which the Ministers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not; but you expresly professe to be that only you look to
<hi>pag.</hi> 8. and saying nothing to this <hi>doubtfulnesse</hi> by their <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
and unfitnesse to anticipate errours, to which only they
spake, and you should have answered, and shewed how by the
<hi>Articles,</hi> as influenc'd on by the Kings Declaration, <hi>Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi>
could be excluded. How they could be <hi>cleerer, certainer,</hi>
and <hi>more evident,</hi> than any <hi>part of Gods Word,</hi> or <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallest</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:119266:9"/>
Doctrine in it, which both <hi>needs, and admits interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and application,</hi> and rejects it not, as <hi>needlesse,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of its <hi>certainty, evidence, perspicuity.</hi> How the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
were not thus <hi>idolized</hi> in a sort, and prefer'd far to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
while no Minister shall have the liberty to interpret any
one of them, which is not only allow'd him, but requir'd of
him in his Ordination, to interpret Scripture it self withall: while
their Doctrine is supposed <hi>certainer, evidenter, persbicuouser,</hi>
than <hi>any fundamentall the certainest, evidentest, perspicuoufest
in all the Scriptures.</hi> The <hi>notoriousness</hi> of the proceeds menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
much concerned the Ministers proof, and <hi>doubtfullness of
Articles,</hi> which they meant, and not that which you <hi>miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>
they should have meant, and proved: and if their Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
had been <hi>false,</hi> it could no wayes have proved their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
What therefore you subjoyne, that the contrivance of
the Articles by such generality and indefiniteness, gives a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the great <hi>wisdome,</hi> and <hi>moderation</hi> of the Church,
which in points <hi>doubtfull,</hi> and <hi>controverted,</hi> hath propounded
only that, which with no sober man can be matter of doubt, or
subject of controversie; if you mean it, that they should not
be <hi>so farre reformed,</hi> as the Assembly of <hi>Westminster</hi> did, by
<hi>explication,</hi> and addition to them (though retaining themselves)
you thereby condemne the procedures of a <hi>wiser Church</hi> than
your own, the <hi>Church Universall,</hi> in her best oecumenick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of <hi>Nice, Chalcedone,</hi> &amp;c. which thus reformed the Apostles
(vulgarly so cal'd) Creed its self, by explaining it, and adding
to it their own, and <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s Creeds, to the exclusion of
<hi>Arrianisme,</hi> and other <hi>Heresies:</hi> and therefore it is meet,
you be desired to explaine your selfe about <hi>Arminianisme,</hi>
which you so farre <hi>obliquely</hi> at least, and <hi>afarre</hi> off pleade
for.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the third sub-paragraph or sad consequence, the <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness</hi>
of the generality and indefiniteness of the 20. Article is
spoken to, and of its <hi>publiqueness,</hi> 1. As it is cal'd the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>the Church,</hi> and yet what is meant by the Church, is
not in the Articles explained, but left <hi>generall</hi> and <hi>doubtfull;</hi>
(nor might it be inquired after, or laboured to be explained, as
the Articles were stated in their <hi>publiqueness</hi> by that <hi>Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:119266:9"/>
and <hi>Proclamation</hi> of the Kings) and therefore also all the
<hi>publiqueness,</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> that they could have from <hi>the
Church,</hi> must remain <hi>doubtfull,</hi> till it be known, whether it
came from the <hi>Church, habente potestatem,</hi> to give them <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liqueness</hi>
and <hi>authority;</hi> or from the <hi>right Church,</hi> having <hi>just</hi>
and <hi>undouted power to make and authorize</hi> with a sufficient
ecclesiastick <hi>publiqueness</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> such Articles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as a Confession of her faith. 2. For as much as it left <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
(beside the former respects influencing this part also) and
<hi>generall</hi> only, <hi>what rites she may ordain,</hi> suppose the Church
were distinctly explained, and set forth. And 3. How <hi>farre
her authority extends,</hi> in controversies of faith; with an absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
that follows upon adherence to, or urgeing that <hi>doubtfull
generality,</hi> and <hi>indeterminateness</hi> of the Articles, according to
considerations aforesaid. To all which you answer nothing,
but that the Doctrines of that Article, <hi>as considered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
are <hi>undoubted truths:</hi> Which is true enough, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to Rhombus, as we have often said. For the Ministers
speak of the <hi>doubtfullness</hi> as proceeding from their <hi>too great ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality,</hi>
and <hi>unfitness</hi> to exclude errors by; and of their
<hi>doubtfullness</hi> of <hi>publiqueness,</hi> and <hi>authority;</hi> and therefore
though the Article take not away the liberty of right interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in these respects, yet the <hi>publiqueness</hi> of it, as flowing
from that Declaration, and depending on it, doth: and the
the Article it self gives not that <hi>due sense</hi> of its self fully enough,
<hi>pro ratâ sùa portione,</hi> for its own ratable proportion, that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
for a present Confession of faith, and sufficient obviation of
errours; and therefore is so farre under a <hi>necessity</hi> of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and being supplyed. Thus also doth this Section of the
Ministers stand firm, against any thing that you have answered,
as I suppose, I have here sufficiently shown. But yet concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this 20. Article, I have this further to adde about the <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness</hi>
of it (and it may make the rest also the more <hi>suspected</hi>) that
when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Burton</hi> accused it, that it was <hi>interpolated,</hi> and a <hi>clause</hi>
added to it, that the <hi>true and best Copies</hi> had not; Bishop
<hi>Laud</hi> in the Star-chamber (when they were about to Pillory
<hi>Burton</hi>) in his speech, as I take it, <hi>June</hi> 14. 1637. could not
deny that some Copies wanted it; but saies, that he sent to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119266:10"/>
               <hi>publique Records</hi> in his Office; and had returned him under <hi>his
Officers</hi> hand, who was a <hi>publique notary,</hi> the 20. Article with
the <hi>affirmative clause</hi> in it, that other Copies wanted; and that
there also the whole body of the Articles, was to be seen. Then
he saies, it was likest that the <hi>pure faction</hi> themselves, (i.e. <hi>the
Puritans</hi>) did rather take away that clause from the Copies that
want it, because it is known (saith he) who did then <hi>ride the
Church;</hi> (meaning <hi>Leicester,</hi> as I think, a great favourer of <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists,</hi>
and a favorite of the Queens) rather than that any did
adde it to the Copies Recorded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But first, If the Articles
will not give us a good enough description of their <hi>Church,</hi>
Bishop <hi>Land</hi> will give us this; <hi>That she was one that might
be ridden by any great favorite of the Prince:</hi> and so neither
so <hi>respective to God,</hi> nor her <hi>King,</hi> whatever she pretended, as
<hi>Bucephalus</hi> was to <hi>Alexander,</hi> which neither of his greatest fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites
<hi>could ride,</hi> though the one was <hi>Philobasileus,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Philalexander,</hi> by <hi>Alexanders</hi> own Confession. 2. It hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
been found that Bishops, and their servants, or favourers,
have falsified Copies, and Records of that nature; witness the
Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> but never was proved, I think that <hi>Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi>
and <hi>Puritans</hi> did it. Moreover the Bishops reason failes
him, because this diversity <hi>of Printed Copies,</hi> as to that <hi>clause</hi>
controverted, was in the very year, wherein they were agreed
upon, that is, 1562. <hi>i. e.</hi> the 4. or 5. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> long before
<hi>Leicester</hi> could ride <hi>the Church,</hi> or any for him (so farre as I
can learn) in favours of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> as to that time. And is
it a thing likely, that so soon after the Convocation <hi>Puritans
durst,</hi> or <hi>would</hi> do such a thing, and pass so quietly away with
it, and without noise made by the Bishops, as that diversity of
Copies was past over, if the Bishops had not made the diversity
themselves, to their own advantage, or some of theirs for
them, by their <hi>privity</hi> and allowance? 3. Since the Act 13.
<hi>Eliz.</hi> or of <hi>Anno.</hi> 1571, referres only to a Printed Book of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
1562, the same year wherein they were agreed upon, but
specifies not what Printed Copy of that year; the <hi>Act</hi> leaves it
therefore <hi>doubtfull,</hi> whether it hath confirmed that <hi>affirmative
clause,</hi> which the Bishops said that his Records had, seeing in
that very year there were two printed Editions of the Articles,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119266:10"/>
one in English, and another in Latine, whereof the one had
the clause, and the other wanted it: and by this not specify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Impression that it follows, as <hi>undoubtedly uncorrupt,</hi>
it leaves some <hi>doubt</hi> upon the rest, that they might be <hi>corrupt,</hi>
as well as this, before that Act confirmed them. Yea, it leaves
a great doubt, whether there were any better Copy to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
than that they refer'd to, since it is not like the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would referre to a printed Copy, if they had known of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Autograph.</hi> And what if both the Bishop and his Officer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregiously
<hi>imposed</hi> upon the Star-chamber, and neither his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
nor he had any thing to show but that printed Copy which
<hi>Burton</hi> complained of, subscribed with the hands of the Bishops
and lower house of Convocation, at diverse times? I have
heard as much, and I believe some honest <hi>Puritans</hi> can and will
make it good, that during the long Parliament, and sitting of
the Assembly at <hi>Westminster,</hi> when that Office was searched,
That M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Selden</hi> imployed therein, could find no other.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the fourth Sub-Paragraph, or sad consequence, is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the <hi>doubtfullness</hi> of the 34. Article, both in respect of
the <hi>undefinite generallness</hi> of <hi>traditions,</hi> and what is meant
thereby; and what by <hi>Church,</hi> as before; and what by <hi>common
authority:</hi> as also in respect of the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of traditions, in
reference to the <hi>publiqueness,</hi> or <hi>authority</hi> of the Articles, laid
upon them by the Declaration, which the <hi>Convocation</hi> and <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
by the power granted to them, might <hi>absurdly</hi> abuse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
To this you answer nothing according to the Ministers
mind, saving that to me, you vindicate that Article <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,</hi>
frow the <hi>strangenesse</hi> of the expression, which they
glanced at.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In the fifth Sub-paragraph, is spoken to the <hi>doubtfull</hi>
and too <hi>generall,</hi> and <hi>indefinite</hi> allowance and admitting of
both Books of Homilies, to <hi>contain a godly and wholesome
Doctrine, necessary for the times</hi> by Article 35. whereby as
the <hi>Homilies,</hi> and all that is in them, is approved for <hi>godly</hi> and
<hi>wholesome</hi> Doctrine; so it is manifest that <hi>hereby</hi> men must <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to false Doctrines,</hi> as by two instances is proved at large.
Here, although you have made a long and learned defence of
the two Books of Homilies; yet, as it is clear, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119266:11"/>
understand that <hi>clause</hi> of the 35. Article far otherwayes,
than you do; so I am not fully satisfied by you, that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it amiss. For with them, <hi>To contain a godly and
wholesome Doctrine, necessary for the times;</hi> is all one, as to
<hi>contain nothing but godly and wholesome Doctrine, that is necessary
for the times,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein, because I am not fully enough resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on either side, I shall but Quaere from you as followeth.
When the Article saies, the Books of Homilies contain <hi>a godly
and wholesome Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>means</hi> it <hi>one particular</hi> and <hi>defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Doctrine only, or more?</hi> One can not be said; because it
is acknowledged by your self, that <hi>one part only</hi> of some of
them, contain two; and every Homily must at least contain
<hi>one.</hi> Besides, if <hi>one</hi> should be said, amongst so many contained
there, it could not be determined which is it. But if more than
one, whether <hi>all,</hi> or not? if not <hi>all, what,</hi> and <hi>how many</hi> are
excepted? but if <hi>all;</hi> how shall we know how many Doctrines
are contained in them? yea, <hi>how many Doctrines every Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
contains?</hi> and why not <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>every</hi> part of each of them,
that is <hi>assertive,</hi> and uttered by affirmation, or negation, is
not to be thought such a Doctrine, in the sense that the Article
speaks in, and the Ministers understand it? seeing, if it had not
spoken in this sense, but in that whereby you interpret it, it
would seem that it would not have then spoken in the <hi>singular,</hi>
but <hi>plurally,</hi> [<hi>godly and wholesome Doctrines,</hi> &amp;c.] your self
also makes a <hi>false Doctrine,</hi> and a <hi>false Assertion</hi> equivalent
terms. And if thus understood, doth not the Article call some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
a <hi>godly and wholesome Doctrine,</hi> which is, <hi>false Doctrines;</hi>
and doth it not bind Ministers <hi>to subscribe false Doctrines?</hi> But
if you will not understand the Article thus, but to speak of the
<hi>theames,</hi> or <hi>chief Subject,</hi> or <hi>Subjects</hi> only of Homilies,
how do you prove this to be the Articles meaning? the Act af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
the Articles, and by them the Homilies, expounds not the
Doctrine, nor distinguishes it thus; &amp; <hi>ubi lex non distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guit,
non est distinguendum.</hi> Doth not the Law therefore
leave this <hi>doubtfull?</hi> Yea, do not you your self <hi>prove de facto,</hi>
in your differing thus from the Ministers, and in understanding
so queintly by <hi>a godly wholesome Doctrine, many godly whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Doctrines,</hi> but not <hi>all</hi> that are in the Homilies, to be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119266:11"/>
such, that the Article in so farre is <hi>doubtfull</hi> in its self, and
<hi>needs an Explication or Reformation;</hi> since those words, though
few, are of great consequence, and bind to the subscription <hi>of
the whole two Books of Homilies?</hi> But thiswith submission to
such as shall shew me more light.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the sixt subparagrap, or sad consequence, they prove
more than <hi>doubtfulnesse,</hi> or a <hi>bare defectivenesse</hi> of the 37. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
<hi>not as in its self considered,</hi> but as <hi>influenc'd</hi> upon by
the Declaration, printed with the Articles that were only to be
used as the <hi>publick</hi> and authoriz'd ones; to wit, an absurd
<hi>impertinency,</hi> and unsuitablenesse to the time of his then Majesty
reigning, with as absurd consequences of it (so powerfull
were some then to abuse his Majesties goodnesse) while by the
Declaration, as that Article was thus printed [<hi>The Queens
Majesty hath the chief power in the Realm of</hi> England] so it
must still be read in the time of <hi>Car.</hi> 1. her Successour, and not
altered, by substituting [<hi>the Kings Majesty</hi>] in place of the
[<hi>Queens Majesty</hi>] or else the Minister reading [<hi>the Kings
Majesty</hi>] must be deprived; yea, if in reading it [<hi>the Queens
Majesty</hi>] he take it not in <hi>the sense of the very letter of it;</hi>
than which what could be more absurd? Since every Minister
was thus to read it after his <hi>induction,</hi> and well too if he escap'd
an <hi>Oath,</hi> whether he had in all points read it so, or no; and
whether he <hi>kept not to all the very words of the Articles,</hi> in
reading of them. Now what you answer to this, though it
be elaborate and learned, as considering the <hi>Articles,</hi> and the
<hi>Doctrine therein contained,</hi> in <hi>themselves onely,</hi> and not as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd</hi>
on by the Declaration aforesaid; yet because the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
consider them only here as so <hi>influenc'd</hi> in their <hi>publicknesse</hi>
and <hi>authority</hi> by the Declaration afore-mentioned, therefore
you may easily perceive how little you contradict them, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
their proofs of what they intended; namely, that the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
and <hi>Doctrine</hi> thereof, as to the <hi>publicknesse</hi> of their <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
and as to their <hi>authorization,</hi> were not only in a necessity
to be reformed from some <hi>doubtfulnesse</hi> and <hi>defectivenesse,</hi> that
became not a <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> of so eminent a Reformed
Church, as <hi>England;</hi> but also from <hi>impertinency</hi> and <hi>unsuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse</hi>
to the times that follow'd the Queens death. In the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119266:12"/>
end therefore of your Answer to this consequence, your desire
(<hi>That all the Ministers of</hi> England <hi>would acknowledge, That
it is the undoubted Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>That
to the Kings of</hi> England <hi>their heirs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>doth appertain,</hi> as the
37. Article expresseth it) might have been spared, and was no
wayes needfull, seeing this was by the Ministers no way que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned,
nor intended to be questioned, as <hi>your desire</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In the 7th and last subparagraph more is also proved, than
the <hi>doubtfulnesse</hi> of the Articles, or of <hi>the Doctrine in them;</hi>
Yet not <hi>as in themselves,</hi> but as <hi>influenc'd</hi> by that Declaration,
and the power in it given to the <hi>Bishops and Clergy in Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
to put what sense they should see meet upon the Articles, so
they could but perswade his Majesty thereto, by abusing his
goodnesse, as they did to the countenancing of <hi>Arminianisme,</hi>
directly contrary to his Father King <hi>Jameses</hi> mind, and the
Churches too in his time, and giving out of <hi>Arminianism</hi> for
the publick Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of the
Articles of Religion) even that thus we might either have <hi>no
setled Doctrine</hi> of the Church at all; or under the <hi>generality</hi> of
the Articles, and the <hi>goodness of the Prince</hi> abused, much
<hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>other errours</hi> brought in, as well as <hi>Arminianisme</hi>
was, the Doctrine being made variable by that Declaration
from time to time, as farre as the Bishops could perswade the
King, that their <hi>Novations</hi> were agreeable to the <hi>established
forme,</hi> as they had perswaded him that <hi>Arminianisme</hi> was,
though undoubtedly it was not to the <hi>established forme in King
James's time;</hi> and though <hi>Car.</hi> 1. professed in that same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
<hi>He would endure no varying or departing from the
established forme, in the least degree:</hi> so cunning and subtill
were they to impose upon his Majesty with their pretences. It
was not therefore the King, that is there suspected of <hi>unsetling
the Church,</hi> but the Bishops accused of <hi>abusing and deluding
him</hi> to the <hi>unsetling</hi> of the Doctrine <hi>before then established,</hi> or
<hi>thought to be established</hi> (and by your self proved to be so)
and the ingrafting upon it the <hi>new Doctrine of Arminianism</hi> (or
so much, if you will, and more, of <hi>older Lutheranisme,</hi> for
they were driving also at a Corporal Presence in the Sacrament,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119266:12"/>
as is well known) as it is <hi>notorious</hi> that they were doing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>known Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>meaning of the Articles,</hi> as
received by King <hi>James,</hi> and both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdome</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> in his time, notwithstanding any <hi>assurance</hi> the words
of that Declaration might seem <hi>in the word of a King</hi> to give
to the contrary. Therefore, Sir, without offence give me leave
to ask of you these few things, and to intreat your answer to
them. Whether in, and by these words of the Declaration
[<hi>The setled continuance of the Doctrine and Discipline of the
Church of</hi> England <hi>now established</hi>] or by any other part, or
all of that Declaration, <hi>you conceive that Arminianisme</hi> was
then included in the <hi>setled,</hi> or <hi>established forme of Doctrine</hi> of
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> or any part of <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> in any
part, or <hi>all of that Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>or
Articles, Homilies,</hi> &amp;c? If yea; then the King there promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<hi>by the word of a King,</hi> never to endure any <hi>varying,</hi> or
<hi>departing from Arminianism,</hi> in the least degree. And being it
is certain, that in King <hi>James</hi>'s time <hi>Arminianisme</hi> was no part
of the <hi>established Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> how
came it after that to be so, unlesse it were by this Declaration
its self? And if so, how cunningly was his Majesty deluded,
and what assurance did his <hi>word of a King give,</hi> whilst by the
<hi>very Declaration, and word of a King,</hi> whereby is promised
he would endure no <hi>varying,</hi> or <hi>departing from the established
forme,</hi> in the least degree: he did <hi>establish a varying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from it,</hi> in an high degree? But if you say, That at the
time, when this Declaration was emitted, <hi>Arminianisme</hi> was
not a part of the <hi>established Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
nor <hi>included in the meaning of it;</hi> then also, what assurance, I
pray you, did the <hi>Kings Declaration give,</hi> or <hi>his word of a
King,</hi> that he would endure no <hi>varying,</hi> or <hi>departiag from</hi> the
<hi>before setled and established Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(or so esteemed to be) <hi>in the least degree,</hi> when it is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,</hi>
that by that very Declaration, and a Proclamation of
the Kings, the Bishops were bringing in <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> as fast
as they could, and <hi>fathering it upon the Articles,</hi> and had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
the King to the countenancing of all this, and discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing
(to say no worse, whereas it might be call'd <hi>persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:119266:13"/>
all that opposed them, or would haue vindic ated the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
or other Books of the supposed Doctrine <hi>established</hi> of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> and from their
other innovations?</p>
            <p n="9">9. After this is moved an Objection by the Ministers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against what they had said to the <hi>doubtfulnesse</hi> of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
or other inconveniences of them, or by them, as <hi>influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd</hi>
or <hi>concerned</hi> by the Declaration afore-said in their <hi>publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
or <hi>publick establishment;</hi> to this sense, as I take it.
<q>What ever influence the Declaration may have upon the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralnesse,
doubtfulnesse,</hi> and <hi>drawablenesse</hi> of the Articles to
countenance <hi>Arminianism,</hi> or produce other sad consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesto
orthodox Ministers, or other absurdities and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies.
there is an easie cure for all this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> as follows in the
words set down by the Ministers themselves. This <hi>Ellipsis</hi> in
the Objection, which was not exprest, but implied, and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by what had been said before; being thus supplyed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,
it will easily appear, That the Ministers Answer to their
own Objection makes no wayes unnecessary, and of none effect,
all that they had said before to the <hi>doubtfulnesse</hi> of the Articles,
as influenc'd on by the Declaration: <hi>(for so did they speake,
and not against the Declaration its self)</hi> but leaves all that,
as it was, and finds out another cause also of much the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
for as much, as though that Declaration be taken away,
yet the Statute of the 13. of <hi>Elizab. requiring subscription,</hi>
leaves the case little better than the Declaration did, both as to
the <hi>doubtfulnesse</hi> and <hi>drawablenesse</hi> of the Articles, to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<hi>Arminianisme,</hi> or other such <hi>errours</hi> and <hi>innovations,</hi>
and to occasion and produce thereby, and other wayes <hi>much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,</hi>
and <hi>sad inconveniencies</hi> to orthonox Ministers, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
if subscription be still continued, and required to them.
Therefore the meaning of these words of theirs [<hi>This will
signifie nothing</hi>] ought not to be so farre strained, as you seem
to do; but this is the <hi>native</hi> and <hi>true</hi> import and meaning of
them: that the taking away of that Declaration, is nothing in
comparison of what is expected, and should be obtained, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the premisses, and considering that the <hi>Stat.</hi> of the 13.
of <hi>Elizab.</hi> is little better than the Declaration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119266:13"/>
Answer of theirs is largely proved. 1, In two Paragraphs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
following the Objection, not by arguing against the
judgement of two eminent Lawyers, as you suppose; but by
shewing that these eminent Lawyers prove this of the 13. Stat.
of <hi>Eliz.</hi> which they affirm of it; in the first of the two Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs
aforesaid, and then by other Arguments in the second of
them. 2. It is proved also in and by the proof of the <hi>defective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
of the Articles. For the inconvenience and mischief will
be the greater (say they) if we should be tied to those Articles
alone, though never so sound (to wit, as in themselves consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered)
that is, without other <hi>additions</hi> and <hi>supplies,</hi> which
<hi>they ought to have</hi> (not only <hi>may have,</hi> as you wrongly take
the Ministers) for taking away their <hi>general, doubtfull,</hi> and
<hi>indefinite uncertainty</hi> in many things, wherein they ought to be
more definite and certain, especially for a <hi>Confession</hi> of so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
a Church and Kingdome, amongst the Reformed, as
<hi>England</hi> is. And so much of the <hi>doubtfulnesse</hi> of the Articles,
as to their <hi>publicknesse,</hi> and as containing the <hi>publick Doctrine,</hi>
or <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which they
have proved <hi>firmly,</hi> as farre as we have shown, though not so
much the <hi>doubtfulnesse</hi> of the Articles in themselves (saving
as to their <hi>too great generality,</hi> and <hi>indefinitenesse,</hi> which both
may be called theirs, as <hi>in themselves;</hi> and theirs also, not
so much <hi>in themselves,</hi> as <hi>in reference to errours,</hi> and <hi>nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
that by them should be excluded) as in reference to
their <hi>publicknesse</hi> and <hi>establishment</hi> by publick Authority.
Here then let us esteeme, <hi>That the Ministers</hi> by way of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<hi>give</hi> the Articles, <hi>were confirm'd by this Statute,</hi> but
<hi>grant not that they are,</hi> and so do not contradict themselves,
nor give sufficient enough ground to argue against them, <hi>ad
hominem,</hi> or <hi>ad homines;</hi> though the <hi>legal establishment</hi> by
Law were proved, and so the <hi>undoubtednesse</hi> of the <hi>publick
authority;</hi> yet this is nothing to take away, but rather to
make worse the <hi>generalnesse,</hi> and <hi>doubtfulnesse</hi> of the Aritcles
thereby, and <hi>drawablenesse</hi> of them to countenance <hi>Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,</hi>
and like novations; and occasion mischief to ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Ministers, if subscription be still required.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:119266:14"/>10. Now though I have set down both their Arguments
(which you divide) in one compounded Syllogisme, concerning
both the <hi>doubtfulnesse,</hi> and <hi>defectivenesse</hi> of the Articles; and
that because themselves reduce their <hi>defectivenesse</hi> but to a
<hi>medium</hi> of proving their <hi>doubtfulnesse;</hi> yet because you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
one from the other, and that is not <hi>material</hi> to be stood
upon; I shall here set down their argument of the <hi>defective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
of the Articles, as I think themselves would have fram'd
it, had they divided it from the other, and as they would
have differed from you, in setting it down, thus. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
publick Doctrine commonly holden for the National
Confession of Faith of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> wants any
thing considerable, that it ought to have, whether in points,
and heads of matter; or sufficiently cleer, definit, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
explication of them, to exclude dangerous errours and
novations by, that have been, and may be still laboured to
be fastened upon it, as its true meaning; or in Scripturall
grounds and proofes of it; ought to be, or is in a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of being so farre Reformed. But the Doctrine contain'd
in the 39. Articles, is commonly holden for the <hi>publick
Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>National Confession</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and yet wants something considerable, which it ought to
have, or is defective in all the three foresaid respects.
Therefore the 39. Articles, or publick Doctrine contain'd
in them, <hi>ought to be,</hi> or is in <hi>a necessity of being reformed in all
the foresaid respects.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> neither is, nor needed to
be formally exprest, not yet any thing to be brought for
the proof of it, it is so manifest in its self, when thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
The <hi>Assumption</hi> is both exprest (though not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi>
yet materially enough) and proved also, as to the
second part of it, which onely needed proof, though you,
lay all the stresse upon the <hi>major,</hi> because you frame the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
otherwise, than they would have done. But of this
in the close.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Their first proof of <hi>defectivenesse,</hi> I think, concludes
strongly enough for a <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Articles, and for
an enumeration of the Canonical Books of the <hi>New,</hi> as well
as of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> because the <hi>description</hi> by you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119266:14"/>
and your reasons for it, is not sufficient enough to
excuse the want of an enumeration, because some of the
<hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> as <hi>Lutherans</hi> namely, have questioned,
and as I take, doe so still, some of the <hi>Epistles,</hi> which others
of the <hi>Evangelicks</hi> doe not. Neither ought the <hi>Councel</hi> of
<hi>Trents</hi> enumerating the Canonical Books of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
make us affect a <hi>needlesse differing</hi> from them in that,
wherein we differ not indeed; since it is no shame to <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi>
that which is <hi>truly laudable,</hi> even in our <hi>greatest oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,</hi>
but our duty rather to praise it, and to come up as
neer to them, as conveniently we can. It was more invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
therefore than <hi>material,</hi> to intreat the Ministers of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Counties, that they would not preferre the <hi>Councel</hi> of
<hi>Trent</hi> to the Articles of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>material</hi> could be objected to either: since the <hi>defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivenesses</hi>
that the Ministers desire to be reformed, though
not so <hi>material, weighty,</hi> and <hi>internal</hi> to the <hi>soundnesse,</hi> or
<hi>unsoundnesse</hi> of the Articles, as you would have them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to look at; yet both <hi>material,</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> enough
for the <hi>cleernesse, certainty,</hi> and <hi>specialnesse</hi> of a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Confession</hi> of a Reformed Church, when <hi>Reformed</hi> and
<hi>Evangelicks</hi> differ from them therein.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Their second proof concludes strongly a necessity of
reforming the Articles, at least so farre as the Assembly at
<hi>Westminster</hi> did. And in your Answer to this proofe, you
passe by the maine thing intended by the Ministers, and
insisted on, and lay hold onely on a word spoken but in
the by, and by way of amplification, and there you dwell,
without answering a word to the drift of the Argument.
It is certaine <hi>Arminianisme</hi> was a <hi>Novation</hi> and <hi>alteration</hi>
of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that was laboured to be defended by, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
upon the Articles, Homilies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as appeares by King <hi>James,</hi> and the Church of his times
opposing to it, and countenancing the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> and
its procedures and definitions against it. It is certaine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that considering what mischief this bred, it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>necessary,</hi> that the <hi>general,</hi> and <hi>doubtfull indefinitenesse</hi> of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119266:15"/>
the Articles, as to those <hi>Arminian Novations,</hi> matters so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiring
it, as they did then, should have been help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and supplied some way, as the Assembly of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
after did, with their honour preserved, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altered <hi>in corpore,</hi> or in themselves. Whence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That they were <hi>in a necessity of Reformation</hi> in this
sort at least; to which you answer nothing, and we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thereat; and hope it is not out of any favour to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. Neither am I satisfied with your answer to the Ministers
third proof of <hi>defectiveness,</hi> because you seem to me to strain
their words beyond their scope. For their meaning to me is
not, <hi>That the Articles have nothing at all of these;</hi> but not
enough, or sufficient of them, which is <hi>a nothing compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi>
to what they should have; because indeed they want
sundry heads of matter, or Doctrine sufficiently explained,
that they should have; nor have the Articles any proofs from
Scripture, which yet certainly they should have, as they
stand in the place <hi>of a Confession of Faith,</hi> unlesse the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
would have men to resolve their Faith into their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates,</hi>
or <hi>Articles;</hi> nor in the heads of matter, which they
have, have they sufficient <hi>Explication, definiteness,</hi> and <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialty,</hi>
to exclude contrary pernicious errors, that pretend
to impe themselves on their generality, and grow kindly,
and truely out of them. Secondly, When it is said, [<hi>All
which the Scripture teacheth, as necessary, as appears by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
most of them in the Apostles Creed,</hi>] the meaning is
not, 1. That those, that are comprized in the Apostles
Creed, vulgarly so cal'd, are comprized there with <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Explication,</hi> as they ought to be in the <hi>publick Doctrine,</hi>
or <hi>Confession</hi> of a Nationall Church, especially in these
times, and considering the weighty Controversies, that are
agitated about most, or many of them. 2. When most of
them are said to be comprized in the Apostles Creed, the
meaning is not, That most of them are comprized there <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi>
or <hi>in terminis,</hi> but by the <hi>likenesse of necessarinesse</hi> to
that of some of those, which are there <hi>formally,</hi> and <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:119266:15"/>
though the Ministers expressions for this, be not so
clear, as I could have wished. Yet charity, and not only
possibility that they may, but probability that they are to
be taken so, makes me so understand, and expound them.
Wherefore I conclude upon the whole, That the 39. Articles
are in a <hi>necessity of reformation,</hi> such at least, as the Assembly
at <hi>Westminster</hi> hath applied unto them.</p>
            <p n="14">14. And now to draw to an end, I shall close the whole
with two Observations more; which shall serve instead of a
Recapitulation. Whereas <hi>page</hi> 5. of your Book, §. 1. after
your putting their first Argument into forme, you remarke,
that the minor proposition, on which (according to your
framing the Syllogisme) the reason mainly depends, <hi>hath
no formall proof annexed to it;</hi> but in stead of proving the
doubtfullnesse of the Doctrine contained in the Articles,
(which can be the only case, say you, of a necessity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Doctrine; though we have seen the contrary)
the doubtfullnesse of the Confirmation of the Articles, is
only insisted upon: And whereas <hi>page</hi> 6. after putting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
forme their second Argument, you deny the <hi>major,</hi> and
insist on that only, according to your framing the Reason,
as that on which all the stresse lay, though it have no proof
annexed to it, as you frame it, and take it: This me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
Sir; might have made you <hi>suspect,</hi> that you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
them not aright; since it was not so easily to be
supposed; that they would be so impertinent, and incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in their purpose, as the way that you understood
them, would have made them to be; and that in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
of that weight to no lesse and meaner Arbiters, than a
Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. And lastly, Page 4. §. 3. you observe, That the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
say not, [<hi>All the publick Doctrine of the Church is
contained in the 39. Articles.</hi>] 2. [<hi>That whatsoever pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Doctrine of the Church is not contained in the 39. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
is not so much as pretended to be in a necessity of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
So that if there be any Doctrine not contained in the
Articles,</hi> (as I conceive, say you, they will confesse there
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119266:16"/>
is,) <hi>that Doctrine is not only clear from all their exceptions,
but will serve also to invalidate something of them,</hi> (to wit,
of the exceptions, as I take it,) <hi>when they are brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the rest:</hi>] to wit, which is in the Articles, it I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this aright. To which I say, 1. That I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
none of that Doctrine, which you bring from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Book, than the Articles, to invalidate any thing of the
exceptions, that are brought against the Articles. 2. That
most of their exceptions brought against the Articles, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their
brought against them, as their Doctrine is abstractly
considered in its selfe, nor as it is only contained in them,
but as it is commonly received to be chiefly contained in
them; and therefore they are brought also against any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Doctrine, contained in the Book of Common Prayer
Ordination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> especially the two Books of Homilies, and
Canons, in reference to the two aforesaid considerations,
as themselves sufficiently expresse in their Epistle to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<hi>ubi suprà,</hi> and in their first sad consequence, by
the two instances in the Books of Homilies; and the other
Books are afterwards spoken to, in the following points of
worship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unlesse we say, that in them is no <hi>publique
Doctrine,</hi> because in some conderation distinct from <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
as proposed in the Articles; which I think none
will say. 3. That the advantage therefore that you would
make by these Observations, will not be great, as it seems
to me. But be that, as it may be, may not the Ministers
pretend to a like advantage from you, in this manner?
1. It is not said by the Reverend Dr. <hi>Pierson; No necessity
of Reformation of the publick Worship, Rites, Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Discipline,</hi> &amp;c. but only <hi>of the publick Doctrine of
the Church of</hi> England. 2. <hi>That of whatsoever we have
shewed a necessity of Reformation, and is not so much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the Reverend Doctor to be defended, is not only
clear from any defence he hath made, but may also serve to
invalidate something of his defence of the publick Doctrine,
and reasons of denying it to be in a necessity of Reformation.</hi>
Therefore to conclude, Sir, I would <hi>earnestly intreat you,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:119266:16"/>
after this Answer, or some like made unto your self, by
your self in your own mind, upon better review of the
Ministers Reasons, or by some others verball bearing it upon you,
<hi>that you would candidly confesse; That the Ministers</hi> also in
sundry Counties took it for granted, that there is
no difference between them and the Articles,
rightly understood, or defenders of
them, in matter of Doctrine,
especially as in its
self considered.</p>
